<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is compiled from messages given by Witness Lee in 1961 in Taipei, Taiwan. In January Brother Lee spoke ten messages in a conference related to the building up of the church. These messages have been published in the book entitled <em>The Vision of the Building of the Church.</em> During this same period of time, he also had extensive fellowship with the co-workers. This fellowship has been published in the book entitled <em>The Blueprint and the Ground for the Building Up of the Church.</em> After his conference and fellowship with the co-workers, the church in Taipei actively devoted itself to matters related to the exercise and the practice of the building up of the church. The twenty-four messages in this book are a record of Brother Lee&rsquo;s further leading in the church in Taipei in this regard. Messages 1 through 14 were originally published in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> from February to August of 1961. Messages 15 through 24 were given in meetings for responsible ones in districts and small groups from March to September. These messages, which are being published for the first time, have been edited from audio recordings of these meetings.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRIESTS AND KINGS<br />
IN RELATION TO GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Zech. 6:12-13; 1 Pet. 2:4-5; Rev. 22:1-2</h1>
<p>In the Old Testament the offices of the priesthood and the kingship were never combined. However, Zechariah 6:12-13 says, &ldquo;Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, saying, Here is a man, whose name is the Shoot; and he will shoot forth from his place and will build the temple of Jehovah. Indeed, it is he who will build the temple of Jehovah; and he will bear majesty and will sit and rule on his throne; and he will be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace will be between the two of them.&rdquo; This is a prophecy related to the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus is the Shoot of David (cf. Jer. 23:5). He will shoot forth from His place and build up God&rsquo;s temple. In the building up of God&rsquo;s temple, the Lord Jesus bears the offices of both the priesthood and the kingship. In Him these two offices are combined.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:4-5 says, &ldquo;Coming to Him, a living stone...with God chosen and precious, you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; These verses speak of our being built up together into a spiritual house, a holy priesthood. Then verse 9 says, &ldquo;You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood.&rdquo; The holy priesthood in verse 5 is referred to as a royal priesthood in verse 9. The word <em>royal</em> refers to kingship; hence, the offices of the kingship and the priesthood are also combined in the believers who are being built up together.</p>
<p>Revelation 22:1-2 says, &ldquo;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. And on this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month; and the leaves of the tree are for the healing of the nations.&rdquo; In the New Jerusalem the river of water of life proceeds out from the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street. The New Jerusalem has only one street. In the original Greek the word <em>street</em> is singular; there is only one street. Since the New Jerusalem has only one street, how can the three gates on each of the four sides lead onto the same street? It must be that the street spirals down from the highest point at the center to all four sides at the bottom.</p>
<p>The throne is at the center, the highest point of the New Jerusalem, which is twelve thousand stadia tall. The walls surrounding the New Jerusalem, however, are only a hundred forty-four cubits tall. This indicates that the city proper is like a mountain with a height of twelve thousand stadia. In order to enter the gates and walk on the street, the street must reach all twelve gates; so the street must spiral upward. The higher it rises, the smaller the circle must become until the street reaches the throne at the peak. From the vantage point of the throne at the peak, however, the street spirals downward, becoming an expanding circle until it reaches the last circle at the base by all twelve gates.</p>
<p>On this street there is a river of water of life. Just as the street spirals downward, the river also flows downward. In addition to a river, there is also the tree of life. The word <em>tree</em> in the original language is also singular; there is only one tree. This tree is like a vine spiraling downward with the river, and its branches grow along the sides of the river, producing twelve kinds of fruit. These signs are very meaningful. They are more than just a beautiful picture; they are a picture of the Triune God as God, the Lamb, and the Spirit, who is symbolized by the water of life. The tree grows on the sides of the river, and the river in the middle of the street proceeds out of the throne continuously. Everyone who enters a gate, regardless of which gate, steps onto this street, drinks of the river in the middle of the street, and eats of the tree.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING FELLOWSHIP AND BLENDING<br />
IN THE SPIRIT FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Recently, the Lord has been doing a strong work in the church. Many saints are willing to be built up according to the blueprint of God, and they also are willing to build up others by the Lord&rsquo;s grace. There is a strong desire and feeling related to the building up of the church within all the saints here in Taipei. In our bread-breaking meetings and in our prayer meetings many saints are expressing their desire for this experience. This is evidence that the Lord is building up His church. When the responsible brothers brought this matter to the Lord and fellowshipped with one another, we all felt that one thing needed to be worked out in order for the building among us to progress. This matter involves our need for fellowship and blending in the spirit.</p>
<p>According to the revelation in the New Testament, those who have been redeemed by God are both the building material and the builders. The building up of those who are both the building material and the builders depends upon fellowship and blending. If we cannot fellowship and blend in the spirit, the building up will not be realized among us, no matter how much we speak of this matter.</p>
<p>We must see that the building up of the church is altogether a matter in the spirit. The building up of the church is not the result of forming a social group. A social group is easily formed when various members of a group contact and connect with one another. With a little organization and arrangement and with an orderly interaction among the members, a group can even increase in number. The building up of the church, however, cannot be accomplished in this way. Although the church is composed of human beings who are seemingly coordinated as a group of people, this is merely its outward appearance. The reality of the building up of the church is related to the saints being blended as one in the spirit. Strictly speaking, the building up of the church depends upon the spirits of the saints being blended as one. If the spirits of the saints cannot be blended together, the most that we will have is a human organization without the reality of the building up of the church. The building up of the church is entirely a matter of fellowship and blending in the spirit. When our spirits are released, there will be a blending in one spirit. This blending in the spirit is the real building up of the church. The building up of the church is a matter in life, as well as a matter in the spirit. This is the difference between the building up of the church and a social organization.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:5 says that the church is a spiritual house. This indicates that the church is a living house. A physical house has an outward structure but no spirit or life. However, the church has both Spirit and life; it is a living house. As a living house, the Spirit of God flows through the church, and the life of God is blended with the church. The Bible also speaks of the church as the Body of Christ and likens it to a body (Eph. 1:23; 1 Cor. 12:12). Since the church is likened to a body that has hands, eyes, and ears, it must be coordinated together, and there must be fellowship, like the circulation of blood. First Peter 2:2-5 shows that our being built up together depends on growing. Building comes out of growing; the church is a building that grows. Our growing up together is a matter of being joined together in the spirit.</p>
<p>Now that the saints have a positive and deep response related to the building up of the church, we should not rely merely upon more coordination, more contact, and more meetings. If this is our response, we will surely fall into an outward form of organization. In the end, we will become a people who merely have the same aspiration and same goal and who are united together to form a good Christian organization. This, however, is not the genuine building up of the church. The genuine building up of the church may have the appearance of a proper human organization, but it is intrinsically a matter of fellowship and blending in the spirit. When our spirits are blended as one with the spirits of the saints and woven into one, this is the building up of the church.</p><h2 class="head1">AUTHORITY AND FELLOWSHIP<br />
BEING TWO LINES IN THE BODY</h2>
<p>When we observe the human body carefully, we see that there are two indispensable lines, or systems, that function in the human body. In spiritual terms these two lines are authority and fellowship. Authority is often described in relation to order and coordination. For example, my upper arm is below my head, my forearm is below my upper arm, my wrist is below my forearm, my palm is below my wrist, and my fingers are below my palm. From this order, we can see the matter of authority at every level. If my wrist or upper arm becomes dislocated, my entire body will be affected. Thus, there is a line related to authority and order in the human body.</p>
<p>Our body also depends on the circulation of blood, which is its &ldquo;fellowship.&rdquo; Although there are many members in my body, there is only one circulation of blood. My hand cannot say that my blood serves only it, nor can my foot make this claim. Every member is connected with the other members in my body through the circulation of blood. Every member renders a supply to the other members and receives a supply from the other members. We depend completely on the authority and fellowship of the members of our body. If there is a problem with either line, our body will be sick.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISRAELITES HAVING AUTHORITY AND FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>When the Old Testament refers to the building up of God&rsquo;s people, from the time of the building of the tabernacle until the end of the book of Malachi, it reveals that God regarded the Israelites as one entity, in which there was a line of authority and a line of fellowship.</p>
<p>As soon as the children of Israel were formed into a nation at the foot of Mount Sinai and began to participate in God&rsquo;s building, there were two lines among them: one line, involving Moses, was the line of authority, and the other line, involving Aaron, was the line of the priests. Every time Moses stood up, he represented authority, and every time Aaron appeared, he represented fellowship. In the line of Moses, there were elders, leaders of the tribes, leaders of families, leaders of thousands, and leaders of hundreds, and among these there was an order of authority (Exo. 18:25-26). In the line of Aaron, there were the high priest, the priests, and the Levites, who represented fellowship with God.</p>
<p>The duty of the priests was to go into the Holy of Holies and fellowship with God. This was especially true related to the high priest. When he went into the Holy of Holies to fellowship with God, he bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on his breastplate; this means that he brought all the people of Israel before God so that the Israelites could fellowship with God (28:29-30). On his breastplate there were precious stones inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. He wore the breastplate in order to understand God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire and to bring God&rsquo;s fellowship to His people. Thus, the high priest received and relayed God&rsquo;s intention to God&rsquo;s people. On one hand, he brought God&rsquo;s people into fellowship with God, and on the other hand, he enabled God&rsquo;s people to understand God&rsquo;s intention. As a result, God&rsquo;s people were in one accord.</p>
<p>Before the priest relayed God&rsquo;s desire to His people, the twelve tribes of Israel could have had twelve different opinions. With regard to a particular matter, the tribe of Judah could have proposed one way, whereas the tribe of Benjamin could have proposed another way. The tribe of Dan could have suggested one thing, whereas the tribe of Naphtali could have suggested another. It could have been that every tribe had its own opinion so that it was not possible for them to be one. However, when the high priest brought the names of the twelve tribes before God on his breastplate and fellowshipped with God, he received God&rsquo;s desire. When he came out from God&rsquo;s presence and brought God&rsquo;s fellowship to the twelve tribes, there was only one opinion, one view, and one feeling among the twelve tribes. They were in one accord, and this one accord was based on God&rsquo;s fellowship.</p>
<p>The two lines among the Israelites&mdash;authority and fellowship&mdash;complemented each other. If authority had been exercised without fellowship, the children of Israel would have merely reflected a human arrangement. If fellowship had been practiced without authority, the children of Israel would not have been able to carry out the fellowship. If Moses and those under him&mdash;elders, leaders of the tribes, leaders of the families, leaders of thousands, and leaders of hundreds&mdash;only exercised authority, the children of Israel would have been in a human arrangement under man&rsquo;s rule. However, Moses&rsquo; authority was always carried out in coordination with fellowship. Hence, the line of authority was not according to human arrangement or man&rsquo;s rule. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s fellowship was coordinated with God&rsquo;s authority so that there was no confusion. When the high priest touched the desire of God&rsquo;s heart in fellowship, this fellowship was carried out by God&rsquo;s authority. Authority needs to be coordinated with fellowship, and fellowship needs authority in order to be carried out. Among the Israelites, these two lines were always coordinated. They were like two cords that were entwined as one. The situation of the Israelites corresponds exactly to that of a physical body, in which there is authority, order, and the circulation of blood. Authority keeps order among God&rsquo;s people, and fellowship produces a flow among God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>When Moses died, Joshua was raised up as God&rsquo;s authority, and Eleazar, the high priest, coordinated with him (Josh. 14:1; 19:51). Then during the time of the judges, the judges continued the line of authority from Joshua, and there were priests who coordinated with the judges. At the time of the judges, the two lines were coordinated, even though the priesthood was more prominent.</p>
<p>In the age of the kings, David, Solomon, and the kings who followed them were in the line of authority. However, even during this time, David never neglected the line of the priests. As soon as David began to reign, he arranged the divisions of the priests for their service in order to recover the priesthood. Solomon also appointed the divisions of the priests for their service (2 Chron. 8:14). From the time of David onward, the priests and kings coordinated together. Before the children of Israel became desolate through captivity, these two lines existed continually. After returning from their captivity, the Israelites recovered both of these lines through Zerubbabel the governor and Joshua the high priest. Zerubbabel was in the line of authority, and Joshua the high priest was in the line of fellowship (Hag. 1:12, 14; 2:4). From this point forward, there was the coordination of authority and fellowship until the end of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>The entire record of the Old Testament shows that the children of Israel were coordinated like a body. In this body there were two systems: one related to authority and order and the other related to fellowship and flow. Whenever the two systems were working together properly, there was the building of God among them. When the tabernacle was being built, Moses, who represented authority, was properly coordinated with Aaron, who represented fellowship. When the temple was built, David and Solomon, who represented authority, were properly coordinated with the recovered priesthood. When the temple was rebuilt, Zerubbabel the governor, who represented authority, was properly coordinated with Joshua the high priest, who represented fellowship.</p>
<p>We must have such a clear view. God&rsquo;s building depends upon His people being blended, and the blending of the people is maintained by the lines of authority and fellowship. Without the two lines of authority and fellowship, the people of Israel would not have been able to be blended. The children of Israel could act as one man and maintain their oneness because of these two lines. There must be fellowship related to the priesthood and authority related to the kingship in order for God&rsquo;s people to be blended as one for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>If we consider the history of the children of Israel further, we will realize that every instance of desolation began with the priests. This indicates that desolation is a result of the loss of fellowship; that is, it is a problem related to fellowship. When the tabernacle was built, there was a positive situation because of the coordination of authority and fellowship. Gradually, however, problems arose among the priests. In the book of Judges, the priesthood was nearly nonexistent. There was even an incident where a Levite was hired as a &ldquo;family priest&rdquo; (17:7-13). Once there is a problem with the priesthood, the kingship will be affected and cease to function properly. Whenever there is a problem with fellowship, there will also be a problem with authority. Hence, in the book of Judges, the authority with the judges was mostly improper, and the priesthood continued to deteriorate. This was particularly obvious in the case of Eli, who represented the fellowship in the priesthood. When there was a problem with Eli, there was also a problem with the tabernacle, which had been built out of the coordination of authority and fellowship. In the time of Eli, the Ark was taken from the tabernacle. The tabernacle became empty, and the Ark was without a covering; the two were separated (1 Sam. 4:3-18). At this time, the Israelites fell completely into a situation of desolation.</p>
<p>When David and Solomon were raised up by God, the people of Israel were revived. As soon as David was raised up, he understood God&rsquo;s desire and restored the priesthood. Although David was a king, he paid close attention to the recovery of the priesthood. He arranged the divisions of the priests and strengthened their service, to the extent that he even put on the priestly garment, the ephod (2 Sam. 6:14). In this regard, David is a type of the Lord Jesus, who joined the priesthood with the kingship.</p>
<p>Through proper fellowship and in coordination with the proper authority, the holy temple was built. The Israelites were completely revived, and the glory of God was manifested among them. Nevertheless, history often repeats itself. Eventually, there was a problem in regard to the priesthood. During the age of the kings, the function of the priests was not always manifested. As a result, the doors of the temple would be closed, and no offerings would be made upon the altar. However, whenever a king was revived, he would open the doors of the temple and call the priests back to resume their service. He also would ask them to read the books of the law. In this way, God&rsquo;s people were brought back into fellowship with God, and God&rsquo;s fellowship was brought to His people. In the books of 1 and 2 Kings and 1 and 2 Chronicles, many kings were not proper before God, because they lost the coordination of fellowship in the priesthood. However, whenever a king was revived, there was a recovery of the priestly fellowship.</p>
<p>This situation continued until the temple in Jerusalem was torn down, and the people of Israel were taken into captivity. This was a second occurrence of desolation. After seventy years elapsed, they were revived again through the coordination of the priestly fellowship and authority. Through this coordination the holy temple was recovered and built up again.</p>
<p>According to the history in the Old Testament, the Israelites had three great revivals. The first revival involved their coming out of Egypt. Then through the coordination of fellowship and authority, they built God&rsquo;s tabernacle at the foot of Mount Sinai. The second revival took place with the rising up of the kings, such as David and Solomon, who built the temple through coordination with the priests. The third revival occurred when the children of Israel returned from the land of captivity. At this time, the temple was rebuilt through the coordination of Joshua the high priest and Zerubbabel the governor. Then, under the leadership of Ezra the priest and Nehemiah the governor, more Israelites returned, and the city of Jerusalem was rebuilt. This record shows that every time the people of Israel were revived, there was building through the coordination of fellowship and authority. Whenever there was a coordination of fellowship and authority, God&rsquo;s people were in a normal condition. However, whenever there was a loss of fellowship, there was desolation. With the loss of fellowship, the exercise of authority lacked balance, and their condition became abnormal.</p>
<p>Consequently, the recovery of a proper condition among the Israelites depended upon the coordination between fellowship, represented by the priesthood, and authority, represented by the kingship. When Joshua the high priest and Zerubbabel the governor returned to Jerusalem and began to rebuild the holy temple, the first thing that they restored was the altar. Later, under the leadership of Ezra the priest, the book of the law was restored. Through the priesthood, God&rsquo;s people were brought into fellowship with God, and God&rsquo;s fellowship was brought to His people. This enabled Nehemiah to continue to restore Jerusalem, the holy city. The city represented the matter of authority, and Nehemiah, who was the governor, represented the line of authority. Joshua and Ezra represented the line of the priesthood, which restored fellowship with God. Zerubbabel and Nehemiah represented the line of authority, which restored matters such as administration, authority, and order. At this time, both the holy temple and the holy city were recovered, and God&rsquo;s people were brought back to a normal condition and formed into one entity.</p><h2 class="head1">THE AUTHORITY AND FELLOWSHIP<br />
IN THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The Old Testament presents a type, whereas the New Testament is the reality. On the day of Pentecost, the number of disciples increased from one hundred twenty to more than three thousand (Acts 2:41). Later, another five thousand were added (4:4). In the book of Acts we can see clearly that there was a line of authority among the disciples. Although the Bible does not use this term, we can surely sense that Peter, John, and James represented God&rsquo;s authority. The elders in the churches also represented this authority. At the same time, the service of the apostles and the saints was full of fellowship. They fellowshipped with God and brought God&rsquo;s fellowship to His people. During the days of the early church, there was order and authority as well as the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Regrettably, this condition did not last long. The church gradually became desolate, just as the Israelites in the Old Testament; that is, the church had problems related to the matter of fellowship. Once the fellowship was lost, the authority became improper. This authority became so improper that eventually the church fell completely into the realm of human organization, being entirely under man&rsquo;s rule. The eventual result of this fall was the establishment of Roman Catholicism, which brought God&rsquo;s people into an improper situation of utter desolation.</p>
<p>For the church to be recovered, the reality of the priesthood had to be restored, just as in the Old Testament. When Luther rose up to recover the matter of justification by faith, the matter of fellowship with God was restored. Although Luther paid attention to the matter of authority and order, it was the Moravian brothers who recovered the matter of authority and order in the eighteenth century. They also experienced the matter of fellowship. In the nineteenth century the Brethren had a very strong recovery of the aspect of fellowship. They fellowshipped with God and with one another; this was truly a great blessing from God to them. Their fellowship was such that they were in one spirit as one man. Gradually, authority and order were also recovered among them.</p>
<p>Our own history also began with the recovery of fellowship. Not only was personal fellowship with God recovered but also mutual fellowship with one another in the Lord. Then the Lord began to show us truth and light concerning the church, the Body, and service in coordination so that we would know the matter of authority and order. Based on His leading among us, there has been the appointment of elders and the arrangement of service. Even now, the matter of authority and order is becoming more and more practical among us.</p>
<p>However, we must remember the lessons of history. It is not easy to maintain a normal condition of fellowship in coordination with authority. If we are not careful, fellowship will be lost, and only authority will remain. If this occurs, the exercise of authority will not be balanced, and our condition will become abnormal. I am speaking concerning this matter with a fully guarded heart. I hope that all the brothers and sisters would have such an inner sense. There is a danger that we would gradually lose the matter of fellowship. If the fellowship among us is weakened, authority will become more prominent than fellowship. This will result in an unbalanced and abnormal situation. Since there is such a danger among us, we should be on guard. This does not mean that we should do away with authority and order; rather, it means that we should strengthen the matter of fellowship. Otherwise, we may speak of building up and endeavor to practice the building up, but the more we endeavor, the stronger authority will become and the weaker fellowship will become. This will result in an unbalanced situation. Hence, before we endeavor to strengthen the building up of the church, we must have a clear view concerning this matter. If we lack the balance from fellowship while pursuing the matter of building up, the aspect of authority will become stronger and stronger among us, while the aspect of fellowship will lose more and more ground. This will cause an extreme imbalance among us, and eventually, we will become altogether abnormal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCH BEING<br />
THE BLENDING OF THE SPIRITS OF THE SAINTS<br />
AS ONE IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Fellowship refers to personal fellowship with God and mutual fellowship among us. These are not two different kinds of fellowship but rather two aspects of one fellowship. Proper fellowship always includes fellowship between us and the Lord and between us and the saints. Inwardly, we must have a clear flow of fellowship with God and with the saints, just as the blood in a physical body flows to the head and to all the members. No member can say that his blood flows only to the head but not to the other members. If his blood does not flow to the other members, there will be a big problem in the circulation of blood. This is a very clear example. Fellowship does not refer only to fellowship with God, but even more, it refers to fellowship with other saints in the fellowship of God.</p>
<p>In the past, when we spoke of fellowship with God, we often considered it only in relation to our fellowship with God. Even when we spoke of fellowshipping with the saints, our understanding was limited to the thought of interacting with the saints. Actually, this is not the meaning of fellowship. Fellowship with God includes fellowship with the saints, and fellowship with the saints comes out of fellowship with God. Fellowship includes more than outward communication and outward associations; it involves the blending of the spirits of the saints in the Spirit of God, all of whom are blended as one.</p>
<p>If we exercise according to this understanding, we will discover that there is no difference between fellowshipping with the saints and fellowshipping with God. When we fellowship with God, our spirit has a clear way to fellowship with the saints, and when we fellowship with the saints, praying, worshipping, giving thanks, and praising, our spirits have a clear way to fellowship with God. These two aspects of fellowship speak of one flow, not two flows. When a light bulb is connected to the power plant through the flow of electricity, it is also connected to other light bulbs. At the same time, when a light bulb is connected to other light bulbs, it is also connected to the power plant. There is only one flow, not two flows.</p>
<p>We must see that the fellowship of the church is the fellowship of God and the fellowship of the Body. The fellowship of the Body is the fellowship of the saints with God; it is also the fellowship among the saints in the fellowship of God. It is regrettable that we consider fellowship with God and fellowship with other saints as being two different things. We must be corrected and begin to see that these two aspects of fellowship are related and are even one. When we fellowship with God, our fellowship includes the brothers and sisters, and when we fellowship with the brothers and sisters, our fellowship includes God. In one spirit the saints fellowship with one another and with God. If this is not our experience, our fellowship is problematic.</p><h2 class="head1">LACKING FELLOWSHIP IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the past we were very short in regard to the matter of fellowship in the spirit. On one hand, many serving ones were lacking in their fellowship with God, and on the other hand, when we came together, we lacked a genuine fellowship in the spirit with one another. For example, in the elders&rsquo; meeting many things are discussed and many opinions are voiced, but it is rare for our spirits to come forth and be blended as one in the Spirit, touching God&rsquo;s feeling in our fellowship. This indicates that we are lacking in the matter of fellowship in the spirit. This situation also exists among the co-workers. In a recent meeting some co-workers acknowledged that there was no fellowship in the spirit among the co-workers, even though they lived, ate, and served in the same place, and even though there was never disagreement or disharmony.</p>
<p>Many of us have been meeting and bearing responsibility in the same place for many years, but how frequently are our spirits open to one another and blended as one in order to have genuine fellowship? Many responsible brothers and sisters in the districts admit that they rarely have fellowship, even though they serve together. Although they do not fight, argue, or strive, they also do not fellowship.</p>
<p>When we were first raised up by the Lord and were serving Him zealously, we were very fresh and genuine, but we were also rather childish. When we served together, we would speak whenever we felt to say something, and we would argue with one another whenever we disagreed. After a period of time, we learned to be political. On the surface, we were at peace with one another, but when we came together, we could not touch one another&rsquo;s spirit. If a brother made a suggestion, the other brothers would agree, and the sisters would indicate their support of the brothers&rsquo; decision. However, our real feeling often was far different, but no one was willing to speak up. Some learned not to say anything or complain, and others would begin to complain as soon as the meeting was over.</p>
<p>This is also the case when we pray. In the service meeting many prayers are perfunctory and not out of the spirit. This can be likened to a business with two sets of accounting books: a public set that meets the requirements of the tax agencies and a hidden set that has the actual numbers of the business. We must ask ourselves whether we have two sets of prayers and two faces when we pray. Do we have a public set when we deal with others?</p>
<p>Currently, in every meeting hall there are several elders and co-workers, and we come together once a week to pray and fellowship. Nevertheless, I am concerned that when we come together and serve, we never open up our spirits to one another. We sit down to discuss and arrange things, but we do not exercise our spirits and allow our spirits to come forth to be blended with one another. When a senior brother takes the lead in a certain matter, our spirits are closed. Sometimes we may participate in the prayer with a few words, asking the Lord to bless whatever is decided. This kind of prayer, however, is rather perfunctory, because our spirit is not stirred up. In contrast, when we give a message, we know that our spirit must come forth; consequently, we pray desperately to release our spirit. On one hand, we do not have adequate fellowship with God, and on the other hand, we lack fellowship with one another. Due to this severe lack, I feel that we cannot speak on the matter of building so quickly. Instead, we must strengthen our fellowship, recover our fellowship, and let fellowship balance the exercise of authority.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECOVERING THE FELLOWSHIP AND<br />
BEING BLENDED INTO ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>I have a very heavy burden. When the saints in various districts come together to coordinate, we should try our best to change the focus of our meeting to one that pursues fellowship. In this kind of meeting, every saint should open his spirit to God and to the brothers and sisters. When we come together, instead of considering so many things, we should simply release our spirit. When I pray, I should release my spirit. When you pray, you should release your spirit. This will allow our spirits to come forth in a genuine way without any outward pretense. If we practice to worship, praise, give thanks, and petition together, there will be a fellowship and blending in the spirit.</p>
<p>If we fellowship and blend in one spirit in this way, we will quickly be harmonized, even if we have different opinions. However, if we do not have adequate prayers that blend us in the spirit, we will only voice our opinions when we discuss matters, and the more we discuss, the more opinions we will have. Furthermore, there will be no edification in the spirit. When we come together, we should not care for our opinions, we should care only that our spirits would come forth. If we release our spirits, we will be blended as one in a thorough fellowship. In this way the Holy Spirit will bring us to a point where we have the same feeling, the same view, and touch the heart of God. Then when we speak of building up and practice the building up, authority and order will be balanced by fellowship. This is the genuine fellowship and blending in the spirit and the genuine building up.</p>
<p>I hope that we can all see this need. We must begin to make adjustments. The elders should change the way that they meet. When they arrive in the meeting, they should first release their spirits, and discuss things only after they exercise their spirits and fellowship. We must release our spirits in order to truly honor one another. We should release our spirits by worshipping, giving thanks, praising, and petitioning the Lord together. When we are blended in the spirit in this way, it will be easy to take care of everything. Similarly, when the co-workers come to the co-workers&rsquo; meeting, they should not care for anything other than being blended in the spirit. All the brothers and sisters who serve should come together and be blended in the spirit.</p>
<p>I hope that we can learn to first be blended together in the spirit, putting practical matters temporarily aside. Rather than starting with the needs of the brothers and sisters or even the affairs of the whole church, we should first blend our spirits together. Similarly, the brothers and sisters who are serving should also come together and blend their spirits. This is a severe lack among us. We are busy discussing and making arrangements, but we lack fellowship in the spirit. This puts the cart before the horse and sacrifices substance for the shadow. Now when we serve, we are like the dry bones in Ezekiel 37; we are piled together, but we are not fresh or living, and we are not joined, or linked, together. Instead, we are separated and scattered.</p>
<p>In addition to the bread-breaking meeting, we should come together often during the week to blend our spirits together. We should come together in the morning and in the evening to blend our spirits together; our spirits must be blended. Before doing anything, we first must blend our spirits together. This can be likened to mixing flour. If the flour is not well mixed, it will not be possible to make steamed buns or dumplings. If we do not blend our spirits well, our leading in a meeting or our visitation with the brothers and sisters will be futile. Without fellowship and blending, our leading will be dry, and our visitation will be dead and empty. It is not too much to say that our spirits are scattered and isolated from each other. Our spirits need to be released from layer upon layer of bondage. When we begin to practice this, we will not be accustomed to releasing our spirit with others. This can be likened to the hinges on a window being rusty and stiff because of a lack of use. A door with rusty hinges may need to be pried open with a little force. Furthermore, the door will need to be opened with regularity in order to not become stuck once again. As we begin to practice the matter of fellowship and blending, we may need to use a little &ldquo;force&rdquo; in order to release our spirits.</p><h2 class="head1">LIVING WATER FLOWING FROM THE THRONE</h2>
<p>In conclusion, let us look at the picture in Revelation 22. In the New Jerusalem there is a river of water of life flowing from the throne. The throne is a matter of authority, and the flowing water of life is a matter of fellowship. The flow of water signifies fellowship, and this flow is related to authority. This is the source of the building up of the New Jerusalem. In the church today the water of life from the throne should be flowing freely among us. Nevertheless, in our present condition it is not flowing freely. Although the water of life may flow to you, it is not easy for it to flow out of you to others. Thus, it ceases to flow. The water of life must flow into us and out of us. When the flow of life comes to us from the throne, it seems to run into barriers that prevent it from flowing out of us. In order for the church to be built up, we need to be transformed. However, this transformation can be produced only from the flowing of the water of life. Genesis 2:10-12 shows that the flowing river produces gold, bdellium (pearl), and onyx (precious stones). The New Jerusalem is built with these three kinds of precious materials. Without the flow of life, without the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, there is no way for gold, pearl, and precious stones to be produced.</p>
<p>In this city of pure gold, the New Jerusalem, there is a throne, and a river of water of life proceeds out from the throne, flowing downward in a spiral fashion to encircle the entire city. The entire city is in this flow and is full of life. Is this the condition that we see in the church today? I am afraid that instead of life we have death, and instead of a flowing condition there is a stagnant condition. Hence, those of us who are serving, whether as elders, co-workers, or responsible ones, must release our spirits whenever we come together so that our spirits may be blended.</p>
<p>In learning to pray in a blended way in the spirit, the main point is to put aside the self; it is not to deal with our sins. According to our experience, if we deal with the self, our sins will be dealt with spontaneously. This can be likened to a person wearing an old, filthy, and stinking garment. He does not need to wash or patch it up, much less sterilize it. All he needs to do is to take it off and throw it away. This solves the problem.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4 says that we should put off the old man and put on the new man (vv. 22, 24). If we compare the reference to the new man in chapter 4 with the new man in 2:15, we can see that the new man is the church. When we put off our self and live in the church, we are putting off the old man and putting on the new man. We do not need to deal with our shortcomings and weaknesses. Our self is like an old, filthy rag that needs to be taken off and discarded; then we will not be in our self. Furthermore, we will live in the church and put on the church as the new man.</p>
<p>I have learned a secret: We do not need to focus on dealing with our sins, which often only brings us into death. We only need to put off the self by coming to the meeting, by releasing our spirit, by living in the Body, and by blending in the spirit. This is to put off our old man and to put on the new man, the church. In this way, we will be sanctified, victorious, and strong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYER</h2>
<p>O Lord, have mercy on us. In the building up of Your church, we want the line of fellowship as well as the line of authority. O Lord, we earnestly hope that everyone among us would be a royal priest who has the flow of life from the throne. We hope that in everyone of us there would be an expression of both the priesthood and the kingship. Lord, we look to You to fill us so that there is a balance among us between the priesthood and the kingship. We pray that You will bring us into continual fellowship with You so that the saints will enter into Your fellowship. Dear Lord, recover this matter! May all the saints long for this matter and pursue this matter in the spirit! Lord, we desire to have this balance. We desire that fellowship will balance authority and that authority will be coordinated with fellowship. O Lord, how we pray that we would have such a normal condition among us, with Your throne being established with its full authority and with the Holy Spirit flowing from the throne in full fellowship. Lord, grace us, that we may have a situation of life with authority so that all of us can fellowship in one spirit and be blended and built up together. Lord, if we are short in this, we will have no way to build up the church on this earth. O Lord, we submit to You, asking You to give us grace, asking You to manifest the priesthood and the kingship among us, and asking You to manifest the reality of living water that flows from the throne. Oh, it is so glorious that fellowship can be coordinated with authority! Lord, may Your building be fulfilled here. May Your plan be accomplished here. We earnestly desire that You would cause every saint to respond to this matter and that we would all rise up to pray, to fellowship, to release the spirit, and to blend with one another in the spirit! O Lord, fulfill this desire! In the name of the Lord Jesus, Amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE THRONE AND THE LIVING WATER</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will look at the balance between fellowship and authority, according to the description of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONTENT OF THE HOLY CITY&mdash;<br />
A THRONE AND LIVING WATER</h2>
<p>Chapters 21 and 22 of Revelation present a clear picture of the content of the New Jerusalem, the holy city. The throne of God and of the Lamb is at the center of the city; it is the peak of the city. A river of water of life proceeds out of the throne and flows throughout the entire city (v. 1). There is one street in the city, and the river is in the middle of the street. On this side and on that side of the river of life is the tree of life (v. 2). Although chapters 21 and 22 speak of many things, the main content is the throne of God and of the Lamb and the river of water of life that proceeds out of the throne. All the other items supplement these two items. For example, the tree of life and the street follow the flow of the river. Even the matters of God being light and the Lamb being the lamp are related to the flow of the river of life (v. 3; John 1:4). Without the flowing of the river of water of life, there would be no shining of light. Also, the matter of God and the Lamb being the temple is related to the throne (Rev. 21:22). God and the Lamb being the temple refers to the presence of God and the Lamb, and the presence of God and the Lamb cannot be separated from the throne of God and of the Lamb. Without the throne of God and of the Lamb, there would be no presence of God and the Lamb. Therefore, the main content of the New Jerusalem is the throne of God and of the Lamb and the river of water of life that proceeds out of the throne.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THRONE AND THE FLOWING WATER SIGNIFYING AUTHORITY AND FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>The throne and the flowing water of life signify authority and fellowship. The throne of God and of the Lamb signifies authority, whereas the flow of the water of life signifies the fellowship of life. God is God, and He is the Lamb (John 1:36). He is also life (11:25). The New Jerusalem speaks of Christ, who came as the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption through His death and to release His divine life. This picture begins with the Lamb and ends with life; it speaks of Christ coming as the Lamb of God for the purpose of flowing out Himself as life (10:10). This picture is quite profound; it presents the clear revelation in the Bible through a sign presented in a simple writing style. The whole Bible shows that God desires to be received by us and to mingle Himself with us in Christ. In order to make this receiving and mingling possible, God released Himself as life through the death of Christ as the Lamb (Rev. 5:6). Through His death, we can receive Him as life. Hence, Christ is the Lamb as well as life.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John and in Revelation, the apostle John consistently presents the matter of Christ being the Lamb and being life. The Gospel of John begins by speaking of Christ as the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world (1:29). The Gospel of John also records the Lord&rsquo;s words concerning His coming so that we may have life (10:10). This promise is confirmed by the Lord&rsquo;s speaking in chapter 7, when He stood and cried out, saying, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&rdquo; (vv. 37-38). John also presents a unique record of the Lord&rsquo;s death, revealing that blood and water came out of His side when He was crucified (19:34). Blood is for redemption, and water signifies the impartation of life. The sign of the New Jerusalem shows that God in Christ as the Lamb flows out as life into man. John repeatedly speaks of the relationship between the water of life and the Lamb (Rev. 7:17; 21:6; 22:1). All these verses speak of Christ as the Lamb being slain in order to release the divine life so that it can flow into man. This is the aspect of fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE COORDINATION OF THE THRONE<br />
AND THE LIVING WATER</h2>
<p>According to the picture in Revelation, the river of water of life flows out of the throne. This, in turn, signifies that the flow of life, the fellowship of life, conveys the authority of the throne. The authority of the throne is present wherever the river flows. Authority and fellowship, the two main components of the New Jerusalem, are coordinated. The authority of the throne flows to every part of the city through the fellowship of life; the entire city is in fellowship and under authority.</p>
<p>On one hand, the authority of the throne is located at the center of the city, and on the other hand, the fellowship of the river of water of life flows throughout the entire city. This picture shows that the flow of the river of water of life brings the authority of the throne throughout the entire city. In the New Jerusalem there is not only authority but also fellowship; fellowship is coordinated with authority, and authority is blended with fellowship.</p>
<p>Everything in the New Jerusalem depends upon the coordination of fellowship and authority. The water that the thirsty can drink is related to the coordination of fellowship and authority; the food in the city, that is, the fruits from the tree of life, is related to the coordination of fellowship and authority. Even the street in the city is related to the coordination of fellowship and authority. Everything related to our living, our way, and our experience of the presence of God depends upon the coordination between fellowship and authority. Without the coordination of fellowship and authority in this city, there would be no food, no drink, and no street.</p>
<p>In the church today, our spiritual food, our spiritual drink, our spiritual path, and our experience of the presence of God depend upon the coordination of fellowship and authority. If there is a full coordination between fellowship and authority in a local church, the church will be filled with living water, food, and God&rsquo;s way. There will not only be water for drinking, food for eating, and a pathway for walking but also the presence of God. Without such a coordination of fellowship and authority, the temple for God&rsquo;s dwelling will be lacking, and His presence will not be apparent. The aspect of God being the light and Christ being the lamp to shine out the glory of God is also related to the coordination between fellowship and authority. Without this coordination, knowing God as light and Christ as the lamp would not be possible. Everything in the New Jerusalem depends upon the throne and the river of water of life. There is no lack wherever the throne and the river of water of life are present.</p><h2 class="head1">THE THRONE AND THE LIVING WATER PRODUCING<br />
GOLD, PEARL, AND PRECIOUS STONES</h2>
<p>The city is pure gold, the gates are pearl, and the foundations of the wall and the wall itself are precious stones (21:18-21). The city is built with these three materials because there is a flow of life with authority in the city. The flow of the river of water of life produces gold, pearl, and precious stones. This is clearly seen in Genesis 2:10-12, which speaks of a river producing gold, bdellium, which is a pearl-like material produced from the resin of a tree, and onyx, which is a precious stone. Hence, without the flow of the living water, there would be no gold, pearl, and precious stones.</p>
<p>Verses 8 and 9 speak of God putting man in the garden with the tree of life. Verses 10 through 14 speak of the river that went forth from Eden in four branches, and then verses 16 and 17 return to speak of the tree of life. Verses 10 through 14 are an inserted word concerning the flowing of water. The implication of this picture is that when man receives life from the tree of life, life will flow within him and result in gold, pearl, and precious stones. Hence, in order for the church to be full of gold, pearl, and precious stones, it must have the flow of the river of water of life, that is, the fellowship of life. If there is no flow of God&rsquo;s Spirit and God&rsquo;s life in a local church, it will be difficult for such a church to produce much gold, pearl, or precious stones. These three precious materials can only come out of the flow of life. If we want to pay attention to God&rsquo;s building, we must pay attention to the flow of life.</p>
<p>Today the Lamb of God is emphasized very much in the preaching in Christianity. Everywhere we can hear people say, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God!&rdquo; However, it is rare to hear people speak of the Lamb releasing God&rsquo;s life so that we may receive His life and be built up as the church. There is little speaking concerning the flow of His life in the church, and there is even less speaking concerning the flow of life bringing the authority of the throne and the fellowship of life to every member so that the church may be full of authority and the fellowship of life. The church must have the fellowship of life that comes with authority so that gold, pearl, and precious stones can be produced for the building. This is the ultimate goal of Christ being the Lamb of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THRONE AND THE LIVING WATER<br />
SPEAKING OF THE LORD<br />
HOLDING THE OFFICES OF<br />
THE KINGSHIP AND THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>Revelation 22 is a picture that portrays how the redeemed Israelites in the Old Testament age and the saints in the New Testament age are built into a city, the New Jerusalem. The Bible concludes with the throne of God and of the Lamb being the center among God&rsquo;s people; this throne is also the center of the whole Bible.</p>
<p>The river of water of life that proceeds out from the throne of God and of the Lamb is Christ as the Lamb of God who was put to death and who was released as the Spirit in resurrection in order to flow as life into those who are redeemed. Christ is the way, the reality, and the life of the redeemed, just as He is the way, the reality, and the life of the New Jerusalem. All these items flow from the throne of God and of the Lamb, which is at the center of the New Jerusalem. As the way, the reality, and the life of God&rsquo;s people, Christ brings God&rsquo;s authority, the authority of the throne, to God&rsquo;s people. The throne and the water of life speak of Christ being both the King and the Priest. He came to be the way, the reality, and the life so that the redeemed could have fellowship with God and blend with one another. The water of life points to the aspect of Christ as the Priest. He also brings the authority of the throne to the redeemed. The throne points to the aspect of Christ as the King. The fellowship of life and the authority of the throne are related to the offices of the priesthood and the kingship, both of which belong to the Lord.</p>
<p>According to the picture of the New Jerusalem, the authority of the throne and the fellowship of life are for the building of the New Jerusalem. This corresponds to Zechariah 6:12-13, which speaks of the offices of the priesthood and the kingship converging in Joshua, who is a type of the Lord Jesus, for the sake of the building of God&rsquo;s temple.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the book of Hebrews deals particularly with the aspect of Christ as the Priest. This book shows that Christ, as the Priest, enables us to enjoy God as our way, our reality, and our life. He brings the believers into the Holy of Holies, that is, into fellowship with God (2:17; 3:1; 4:14; 5:6; 7:1). In the New Testament the Gospel of Matthew deals particularly with the aspect of Christ as the King. This book shows us that Christ is Emmanuel, joining God with man and bringing the authority of God to man (1:1, 23; 2:6). Although Hebrews speaks of Christ as the Priest and the Gospel of Matthew speaks of Christ as the King, both books speak of the matter of building. Hebrews speaks of the building of a city (11:9-10, 16; 12:22), whereas the Gospel of Matthew speaks of the building of the church (16:18). The building of the church and the building of the city are the same thing.</p>
<p>Christ is the Priest for God&rsquo;s building, and Christ is the King for God&rsquo;s building. These are not two separate matters. Although Hebrews speaks in a detailed way concerning the Lord Jesus as a priest, it speaks of the Lord Jesus being a priest according to the order of Melchizedek, who is the king of Salem (6:20&mdash;7:1). Hence, the Lord as a priest is also a king. Similarly, although the Gospel of Matthew shows that Christ is the King, there is also an indication of His being a priest. For example, He came to shepherd His people Israel and to serve (2:6; 20:28). These examples speak of His being a priest. In Christ there is both the fellowship of the priesthood and the authority of the kingship, both of which are for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>The Lamb of God was with the Israelites in the Old Testament in type and with the church of the New Testament in fulfillment. With the redeeming Lamb there is a flow of the water of life into man. As Christ flows out God&rsquo;s life, He also brings the redeemed under God&rsquo;s throne. On one hand, He flows out the fellowship of life to us, and on the other hand, He brings us under the authority of the throne. He is both the Priest and the King. Revelation 21 and 22 present such a descriptive picture.</p>
<p>In principle, the elements in this descriptive picture were present when the tabernacle was erected at Mount Sinai. The tabernacle speaks of Christ as the center of God&rsquo;s people. As the Passover lamb, He was killed so that the Israelites could have fellowship with God in God&rsquo;s building. Furthermore, He brought God&rsquo;s authority to man. As a result of the building of the tabernacle, God&rsquo;s people had the fellowship of God&rsquo;s life and the authority of God&rsquo;s throne. They were able to enjoy all that God is and has and to be built up together as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Hence, when the Israelites built the tabernacle, it was a miniature of the New Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem, which the Israelites built in the land of Canaan, also was a miniature of the New Jerusalem. In Ezekiel 47 the prophet Ezekiel saw a river flowing out of God&rsquo;s temple in Jerusalem, and wherever this river went, everything lived and prospered (vv. 9, 12). God&rsquo;s purpose will be fulfilled when the New Jerusalem is manifested in the new heaven and the new earth. All the elements in the picture of the tabernacle and the picture of the New Jerusalem point to Christ being life to God&rsquo;s people, which brings them under the authority of the throne to be built up together as God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REDEEMED HAVING THE OFFICES<br />
OF THE KINGSHIP AND THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, in addition to Christ, who has the offices of the kingship and the priesthood, the redeemed ones have both offices as well. First Peter 2:9 reveals that the redeemed ones are a &ldquo;royal priesthood.&rdquo; The word <em>royal</em> means that we have the position and authority of a king. The word <em>priesthood</em> indicates that we have the fellowship of life. Revelation 5:10 speaks of God making us priests to reign on the earth. We are joined to Christ, and we have the offices of the kingship and the priesthood. Thus, we are able to meet God&rsquo;s need for the building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING OPEN FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now that we have seen the need for the priesthood to balance the kingship, that is, for fellowship to balance authority, we must open ourselves and release our spirit so that the Spirit of life can flow freely among us. The best way to open ourselves and to release our spirit is to pray. Once we open ourselves to pray, our spirit will be released to supply others. If all the saints open themselves to pray and release their spirits in the meeting, we will experience the living water of life gushing forth and flowing in the meeting, and the whole meeting will be an expression of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Some may be concerned about the topic of our prayer, but we should not be concerned about this. The topic of our prayer can be according to our situation at any given time. For example, since we are currently considering the matter of opening and releasing our spirit to fellowship, we can ask the Lord to open our spirit, release our spirit, and blend our spirits together. Having a particular topic is not the most important aspect of prayer. The most important aspect is to genuinely open up our spirit and exercise our spirit to pray. We need to use our spirit in addition to our mouth. We must release our spirit. If our spirit is released, even a seemingly insignificant topic will become a very good topic. For example, a number of brothers who come together to pray may not have a specific topic, but just their coming together is an adequate topic. They can open their spirits and pray, &ldquo;Lord, we thank You and praise You for gathering us together. We ask You to lead us so that we may touch You in this meeting. Lord, cause us to open to You so that none of us will be closed in our spirit and so that You may operate freely among us.&rdquo; This kind of prayer is quite adequate.</p>
<p>If our spirits are open, there is no limit to the topics of our prayer. Worshipping God can be a topic, giving thanks to God and praising God can be a topic, and building can be a topic, even the biggest topic. When we come together, we can pray for the building. We can say to the Lord, &ldquo;We would like to be built up, and we would like the church to be built up. We are willing to have a part in the building. Shine on us and show us what is not fit in us for the building. We are willing to let You remove it. We are willing to receive the breaking and dealing from Your hand.&rdquo; These are all possible topics. Hence, the topic of our prayer is not important. What is important is whether or not we will open up our spirit. Whenever we gather with the saints, we must always open ourselves.</p>
<p>When we speak of opening ourselves, we may think that this means to be blunt with others or even to point out their mistakes. This is not the meaning of being open. Being open means that our spirit comes forth. Whenever we come and meet together, we must be open to allow God&rsquo;s Spirit to flow into us and to flow through us. If the brothers and sisters are open in a meeting and allow the Holy Spirit to flow into and pass through them freely, our meeting will be full of supply.</p>
<p>In the past, our problem was that our spirits were not open. When we came to a meeting, our spirits were closed. This was true not only in meetings involving a message, but even in our prayer meetings and bread-breaking meetings. Our preference has been to be independent, watching others and receiving some blessing from them. We never had the thought that every meeting was an opportunity to open ourselves to God and to open ourselves to God&rsquo;s children. Hence, in the meetings our spirits were closed, and the flow of life was cut off with no avenue to flow out. As a result, there was a shortage of spiritual food and living water in the meeting, and people were neither fed nor watered. Moreover, there was even a sense of being unable to go on, because God&rsquo;s presence was not with us.</p>
<p>Such an abnormal condition in a church meeting is related to the fact that the water of life has no way to flow out. Our meetings should not be like a person who has all kinds of diseases because there is a problem of poor blood circulation. We need to focus on clearing a way for the circulation of the fellowship of life in the church. If the river of water of life is flowing through the church, there will be the bread of life and the living water of life; there will also be the presence of God and the way of God. Furthermore, this flow will issue in gold, pearl, and precious stones, ultimately consummating in God&rsquo;s building.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAYER AND FELLOWSHIP</h1>
<p>Some Christians pay attention to the priestly ministry of the Lord Jesus, which is related to fellowship, but neglect His kingly ministry, which is related to authority. Other Christians pay attention to the aspect of His kingly authority but neglect the aspect of His priestly ministry. If we stress one aspect more than the other, problems will arise, and the church will not be built up. Therefore, we need to continue to release the light of the truth related to these two matters.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD BUILDING UP THE CHURCH<br />
THROUGH THE KINGSHIP AND THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>The prophecy in Zechariah 6:12-13 speaks of the Lord Jesus as the Builder of the temple. This speaking is very particular, and it shows that the offices of the kingship and the priesthood converged in Joshua, who is a type of the Lord Jesus. The convergence of these two offices is related to building, because the Holy Spirit speaks of Joshua as the one who will &ldquo;build the temple of Jehovah&rsquo;&rsquo; (v. 12). The Holy Spirit&rsquo;s speaking is a strong indication that these two offices are related to the Lord as the Builder of the church, the temple of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AS THE KING, THE LORD<br />
BRINGING GOD&rsquo;S AUTHORITY TO HIS PEOPLE</h2>
<p>From the revelation of the Bible, it is not difficult for us to comprehend that the kingship brings God&rsquo;s authority to His people. At the time of the judges, &ldquo;there was no king in Israel; everyone did what was right in his own eyes&rdquo; (Judg. 21:25). The lack of a king meant that God&rsquo;s authority was not present. Without God&rsquo;s authority, God&rsquo;s people cannot remain on the right track in their respective order. The situation during the time of the judges was full of chaos, because everyone did what was right in his own eyes. In this condition God&rsquo;s people could hardly touch anything related to God&rsquo;s building. During the time of the judges, the Bible does not speak of the building of the temple, and even though the tabernacle existed, it is scarcely mentioned. There is little record of the tabernacle in the book of Judges in comparison to the record in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy. This is related to the lack of kingly authority among God&rsquo;s people; that is, there was no king to represent God&rsquo;s authority among His people.</p>
<p>When David was raised up by God to be king, he brought in God&rsquo;s authority, and the people of God began to come back to the proper path and to leave their chaotic situation. Although king David was good, he was not able to subdue all the enemies of Israel. Hence, even though he brought up the matter of building the temple and was blessed by God, he was not allowed to build the temple (2 Sam. 7:1-17). The building of the temple began when David&rsquo;s son, Solomon, was king. <em>Solomon</em> means &ldquo;peace.&rdquo; Peace in Solomon&rsquo;s time was achieved because of his kingship, which brought God&rsquo;s authority to His people. As soon as Solomon was inaugurated as king, he dealt with the remnants of rebellion in the land, including Shimei (1 Kings 2:36-46). The goal of Solomon&rsquo;s reign was to build the temple; hence, there was a need to deal with the remaining elements of rebellion. When he offered sacrifices to God and fellowshipped with Him, he asked for wisdom and received it (3:5-12). Following this, he established a good order among his officials and servants (4:1-19).</p>
<p>The first two chapters of 1 Kings speak of how Solomon cleared up the remnants of rebellion. Chapter 3 speaks of how he drew near to God and asked for wisdom. Chapter 4 contains a special record of how the Israelites were arranged under an orderly administration. Then chapter 5 speaks of the preparation of the building materials for the temple, and construction officially began in chapter 6. The building could begin because there was a king who brought God&rsquo;s authority to His people so that His people could be brought back to a proper path and arranged in the proper order by God.</p>
<p>In order to build God&rsquo;s temple, the Lord Jesus is revealed as the King who brings God&rsquo;s authority to His people. The church is not only God&rsquo;s house but also God&rsquo;s kingdom. In this kingdom the Lord Jesus is the King, executing God&rsquo;s authority over His people. If the Lord Jesus cannot manifest His kingship among us and exercise God&rsquo;s authority over us to bring us to the right path and place us in the proper order, His church cannot be built up among us.</p>
<p>In Acts, the Epistles, and the seven epistles in Revelation, we see the Lord&rsquo;s authority through kingship in the church. Although the records in Acts and the Epistles do not reflect worldly concepts of organization when they speak of authority, we must admit that the ruling of the Spirit is present in these books. For example, the Lord&rsquo;s authority in the early church is evident in the orderly arrangements that were without confusion. This speaks of the Lord Jesus as the Spirit exercising His kingship among God&rsquo;s people. According to Zechariah 6, the exercise of the kingship is for the building of God&rsquo;s temple.</p><h2 class="head1">AS THE PRIEST, THE LORD BRINGING MAN<br />
INTO GOD&rsquo;S FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>Whenever God is engaged in building, He needs the priesthood to coordinate with the kingship. The fellowship of the priesthood must be coordinated with the authority of the kingship. Hence, in order to build the temple, the Lord Jesus also has the office of the priesthood. The kingship brings God&rsquo;s authority to man, and the priesthood brings man into God&rsquo;s fellowship. If there is only the kingship without the priesthood, God&rsquo;s authority may be exercised over man without bringing man into God&rsquo;s fellowship.</p>
<p>When the high priest went before God&rsquo;s presence in the Old Testament, he bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on the breastplate (Exo. 28:29). This means that he brought God&rsquo;s children to contact God and that he also brought them into God&rsquo;s fellowship to know God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire. According to the New Testament, the Lord Jesus is both King and Priest. In addition to the Lord, Peter, John, and James also expressed the matters of kingly authority and priestly fellowship. God&rsquo;s authority was truly carried out through them to the saints in the church. At the same time, they also brought the saints into God&rsquo;s fellowship. In the early years of the New Testament age, there was a coordination of the priesthood and the kingship for the building of the church through the Lord Jesus and His disciples.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING REGULARLY TO ENTER<br />
INTO FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</h2>
<p>When a person submits to God, he receives kingly authority. However, priestly fellowship requires a person to daily live in God. In order for a person to receive and submit to the authority in the church, he needs to be dealt with and fundamentally subdued by God only once. With such a dealing, he will have a clear sense of any lack of submission in his being from that time forward. However, in order to experience the priestly fellowship in the church, he needs to fellowship with God daily in his spirit. Fellowshipping with God in the spirit does not refer only to individual fellowship with God; it refers even more to our fellowship with God in the church. Even our fellowship with the church, however, is not a matter between just us and the church; rather, when we fellowship with the church, we also fellowship with God in the fellowship of the church.</p>
<p>In order to have this kind of fellowship, we must pray. The book of Acts often speaks of the apostles and the disciples praying. The apostles spoke of continuing steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word (6:4). They prayed because they were priests. If a priest does not go to the Holy Place to burn incense and pray before God, he is not fulfilling his priestly duty. If those who are taking the lead in the church, administrating in the church, and even building the church do not offer adequate prayers to God, they are not fulfilling their responsibility as a priest.</p>
<p>Hence, the elders who are leading the brothers and sisters in the local churches should have the aspect of kingly authority, but even more, they should have the aspect of priestly fellowship. Only when they fellowship with God and spend time in prayer, allowing their spirits to come forth and be mutually blended, will they be able to lead the saints into an atmosphere of prayer. This, in turn, will fill the church with prayer and fellowship, and there will be a convergence of the kingship and the priesthood among the brothers and sisters. This corresponds to 1 Peter 2:5, which speaks of the saints being living stones, who are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood. The living stones that are being built up refer to the priesthood. However, this priesthood is also a royal priesthood (v. 9). Hence, these two offices, the kingship and the priesthood, have not only been combined in the Lord Jesus but also in those who are being built up together. In God&rsquo;s building there is the kingly authority as well as the priestly fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAINTAINING THE BALANCE<br />
BETWEEN FELLOWSHIP AND AUTHORITY<br />
IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Throughout the centuries there have always been situations involving imbalance between fellowship and authority in the church. Those who feel that there is too much organization in the church insist on the need to fellowship, pray, and draw near to God, but they have no regard for authority. Such ones lean toward the aspect of fellowship. It is as if they see only the matter of being a priest but not the matter of being a royal priest. With them there is an emphasis on the priesthood and spirituality but not on the kingship. Still others place too much stress on the aspect of authority and order. Such ones feel that the church represents God and that the church involves God&rsquo;s deputy authority. Hence, they focus on matters related to position, order, and authority in the church, but they neglect the aspect of fellowship. As a result, it is easy for the church to fall into a situation of having outward authority and order among the elders, co-workers, and serving ones but with no expression of priestly fellowship. As a consequence, the saints do not touch the Lord, do not have a praying spirit, and do not have mutual fellowship in spirit. This shows that there is a serious imbalance. If we want to be involved in the building of the church, based on the mercy and the light that we have received from God, we must balance the kingship with the priesthood, and we must balance authority with fellowship. Just as the offices of the kingship and the priesthood have converged in the Lord Jesus as the Builder, there should be a coordination of kingly authority and priestly fellowship within the living stones who are being built up.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD AS THE KING AND THE PRIEST<br />
BEING THE WATER OF LIFE FLOWING<br />
FROM THE THRONE</h2>
<p>In Revelation 21 and 22 there is a throne as well as a river of water of life. The throne points to authority, and the river of water of life points to fellowship. The matters of authority and fellowship run throughout the entire New Jerusalem, which is built with gold, pearl, and precious stones, because authority and fellowship, fellowship and authority, run through the entire city. The throne shows that the Lord is the King, bringing God&rsquo;s people under His authority, and the river of water of life shows that the Lord is the Priest, bringing God&rsquo;s people into the fellowship of His life.</p>
<p>Whenever the Lord is on the throne with authority, life flows. In other words, whenever the Lord exercises His authority, fellowship flows freely. If there is authority and order among us, this authority and order will enable the Lord&rsquo;s life to flow among us, causing us to fully be in fellowship. This is because the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne. On the one hand, wherever there is the throne, there is the flow of life, the fellowship of life. On the other hand, the fellowship of life ushers in the authority of the throne; that is, wherever the river of water of life flows, there is the authority of the throne. The flow of life brings the authority of the throne, which flows, moves, and spirals throughout the entire New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is full of glory with God&rsquo;s presence, God&rsquo;s light, God&rsquo;s supply of life, and God&rsquo;s way of life, which is the unique street. Moreover, the flow of life produces gold, pearl, and precious stones and builds these materials together. The New Jerusalem has both fellowship and authority because the water of life flows out of the throne. This is fellowship with authority and authority with fellowship, running throughout the city in a balanced way.</p>
<p>The throne with living water flowing out of it is the consummate depiction in the Bible of the Lord Jesus as both King and Priest. There is no better picture to illustrate the Lord Jesus being both King and Priest than the river of water of life flowing out of the throne. The throne speaks of the Lord Jesus as the King, who brings God&rsquo;s authority to His people, and the river of water of life speaks of the Lord Jesus as the Priest, who brings God&rsquo;s people into the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. The river of water of life refers to the Spirit (John 7:38-39). The flowing life of God is in the Spirit; thus, the Spirit is the fellowship. The Lord Jesus is the Priest who brings God&rsquo;s people into fellowship, that is, into the Spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, as both King and Priest, brings us under God&rsquo;s authority as well as into God&rsquo;s fellowship so that we may have God&rsquo;s authority and God&rsquo;s fellowship. When these two offices converge, there is also the counsel of peace. In addition, this fellowship and authority are coordinated and balanced because there is a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God. In this situation there is both a submission to God&rsquo;s authority and a living in fellowship with God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RELEASING THE SPIRIT BY MEANS OF ALL PRAYER</h2>
<p>The saints among us have always submitted to the authority of the church and kept a proper order. As a result, there has been no confusion. This is God&rsquo;s mercy. However, I still have a heavy feeling that we have not entered fully into the matter of fellowship; that is, there is not much fellowship in spirit among us and not much flow of life. We need to enjoy this fellowship daily. Hence, our present need is to enter continually into this fellowship. This fellowship is in the Spirit of life. We all need to be in spirit and allow the life in the Spirit to flow. The key to entering into this experience is for our spirits to be released so that we may fellowship in Spirit and blend in spirit with all the saints.</p>
<p>The way to release our spirit is through prayer. If we do not pray, our spirit will not be released. Hence, we must be diligent to learn to pray. In this regard, there is no distinction between personal or corporate prayer. We should exercise our spirit when we pray personally and when we pray corporately. We should exercise when we pray at home, when we pray with two or three, and when we pray in the meetings of the church. From morning until evening, we should pray continually, and then our spirit will be released through prayer.</p>
<p>Within every believer there is a spirit of prayer, a spirit of fellowship. This spirit is like an egg that is waiting to be hatched. Many believers, however, have a spirit that is like an unhatched egg. Within an egg there is the life of a chicken, but without hatching, this life cannot take shape and manifest the chicken. The egg must be hatched so that the life within the egg can begin to grow. In order for a chicken to grow, the shell must be broken so that the baby chick can be released. There are several thousand saints in the church in Taipei who can be likened to unhatched eggs. If the brothers and sisters in the church in Taipei would begin to pray every day, like the one hundred twenty who were in the upper room in Jerusalem (Acts 1:13-14), I believe that everyone&rsquo;s spirit would be released. If we are willing to spend the time to &ldquo;hatch our eggs,&rdquo; there would be a living expression in the church.</p>
<p>We need to ask ourselves whether or not our spirit has been released. If the shell of our spirit has not been broken, we must use prayer to release the life within us. We must pray continually until our spirit comes forth. From this time forward, we must find brothers or sisters with whom we can pray.</p>
<p>When we pray, we should not worry about having a topic. There are plenty of topics. We can pray for the building of the church. We can pray for the release of our spirit. We can pray for the blending in the spirit. We can pray for anything and everything. The topic of prayer is not as important as the release, the coming forth, of our spirit. The more we pray, the more exercised we will be and the more we will pray in spirit. When we begin to pray in this way, we may still use our mind and our intellect. But as we continue to pray, we will turn from our mind to our spirit. Then, as we continue to pray, we will be in the spirit. If we exercise in this way for an extended period of time, we will be in spirit whenever we open our mouth.</p>
<p>A person who does not pray very often will surely be in his mind when he opens his mouth to pray. This is because his spirit is not very exercised, and it is not very responsive to the Spirit. However, if our spirit has been exercised, our spirit will come forth as soon as we open our mouth.</p>
<p>We all need to exercise to release our spirit when we are in the meetings. We should learn to release our spirit to pray as soon as we arrive at the bread-breaking meeting. Remembering the Lord, praising the Lord, and giving thanks to Him are very good topics for prayer. We can use these topics to release our spirit in prayer. We should practice this way in the meetings, and when we come together to fellowship, we should grasp the opportunity to pray and release our spirit. In this way, the saints will come under the authority of God and enter into the fellowship of God. Thus, the offices of the kingship and the priesthood will converge and be balanced in the experience of the saints. We must arrive at this point in order to build the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAYING TO BLEND IN SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 6:18; Jude 20; Zech. 12:10; 1 Tim. 2:8</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning how the serving ones can blend in spirit with one another and how they can lead the brothers and sisters to fellowship and blend in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING THE SPIRIT THROUGH PRAYER</h2>
<p>We must realize that prayer is the means by which we exercise our spirit. This can be likened to walking in order to exercise our legs or to looking at objects in order to exercise our eyes. If a person&rsquo;s eyes are covered and not used for a long time, his eyes will eventually lose their function. Every organ in our body needs some form of basic exercise in order to function. The more exercise that an organ receives, the more skillful it will be in its function. If it is not exercised, it will lose its function. The function of our spirit is not an exception to this principle. Our spirit needs to be exercised through prayer. The human spirit was created so that man could contact God; this contact mainly involves prayer. Hence, if we want to exercise our spirit, we must pray. If we desire to release our spirit so that our spirit can be uplifted and come forth to fellowship and blend with others&rsquo; spirits, we must not neglect the basic exercise of prayer.</p>
<p>If we do not pray for several days or a week, our prayers will become very feeble and formal because our spirit will not be strong, fresh, uplifted, or keen. If we want to pay attention to fellowshipping in spirit, releasing the spirit, and blending in the spirit, we must learn the basic lesson of praying consistently. If we do not have an adequate practice of prayer, we should not expect that our spirit would be released or able to blend and fellowship with the spirits of the saints.</p>
<p>During the ten days prior to Pentecost, the apostles prayed continually every day. As they prayed, their spirits became strong and living, and their spirits were released and manifested. Eventually, their spirits were blended and mingled together. This situation can be likened to pouring water from several bottles into one vessel. When the water is poured out, spontaneously the water is mingled and blended together. The Bible says that we have a treasure in our earthen vessel. This treasure is God as the Spirit (2 Cor. 4:7; John 4:24). Since we have the living water of the Holy Spirit in us (7:38-39), we need to focus on letting this living water flow out from within us. The best and most proper way to let the water flow is to pray.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RELEASING THE SPIRIT THROUGH PRAYER</h2>
<p>When we speak of prayer, our attention should be focused on the release of our spirit as much as on the matters that are the subject of our prayer. The prayers of a Christian typically involve two functions. Prayer often includes petitioning; that is, prayer involves asking God for something. For example, when we encounter a certain problem, we ask God to remember us in the midst of this problem. Similarly, if we have a certain need, we petition God to meet this need, whether the need relates to our work or our finances. Even prayers for the church, the gospel, the Lord&rsquo;s work, the co-workers, the elders, or the serving ones involve the matter of petitioning. There is, however, a more fundamental aspect of prayer&mdash;the exercise of the spirit. Prayers of petition can be likened to walking to a destination by exercising our legs. On the one hand, we will reach our destination by exercising our legs, but on the other hand, our exercise will train our legs to become stronger and more agile. Prayer must involve not only petitioning but also exercising and releasing our spirit.</p>
<p>Regrettably, many believers do not exercise their spirit when they pray, and thus, their spirit lacks the proper exercise that is needed in order for it to be released. Their prayers mainly reflect their thoughts and considerations. As such, their prayers are related mainly to the soul. They pray about matters that other people have entrusted them with, about matters that they remember, or about items listed in a prayer book. We cannot say that these kinds of prayer are not acceptable to God, because our God is too great. Sometimes He even listens to and takes care of the Gentiles. He is a God who cares for people. However, prayer related to our thoughts and memories do not result in our spirit being exercised. In other words, normal prayer involves the exercise of our spirit, whereas the prayer that involves only our mind does not touch our human spirit. This can be likened to a person who moves by pulling himself forward with his arms rather than walking with his legs. Although he may reach his destination in this way, his legs will not be properly exercised, and if he continues to use only his arms, his legs will gradually lose their ability to walk. The prayer of many saints mirrors this example. We cannot say that the Lord does not hear their prayer, because the Lord does, but their spirit is not exercised in their prayer. This kind of prayer only takes care of the function of petitioning, and even though some of their petitions are answered, their spirit has not been exercised.</p>
<p>The main result of prayer should be the exercise of the spirit; praying for and obtaining things should be supplementary. Every time we pray, our spirit should be exercised. Hence, whenever we go before God, we should not rely on the thoughts in our mind or on matters that have been entrusted to us. We should rely on our spirit. We must turn to the depths of our being to touch the feeling in our spirit. Then our utterances will be according to this deep feeling. If we have a sense related to some sins, we should confess our sins; if we have a sense of joy, we should praise; and if we have a sense of sorrow, we should be willing to be sorrowful. We should always touch the feeling in the deepest part of our being and pray according to this feeling.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we cannot pray for our affairs or for the requests that we have received from others. However, these items should not be the initial focus of our prayers. Instead, we should touch God in our spirit. After we utter some words according to the feeling in our spirit, our spirit will be uplifted, and we will enter into the Spirit of God and be able to bring these items to God in a spirit of fellowship. We can say, &ldquo;Lord, I need Your leading in regard to praying for my affairs and for the requests that I have received.&rdquo; After coming to the Lord in such a spirit of fellowship, we will have a further sense within as to the content of our prayer. If there is an inner sense to pray for these things, we should pray for them, but if there is no feeling within, there is no need to pray for them. In short, we must pray according to the feeling in our spirit. If we pray in this way for five minutes, our spirit will be exercised for five minutes. If we pray for ten minutes, our spirit will be exercised for ten minutes. If we pray in this way every day for a week, our spirit will be fresh, uplifted, skilled, living, and released. Hence, in order for our spirit to be released and to blend with the spirits of the other saints, we must practice to pray in the spirit.</p>
<p>Every genuine spiritual transaction with God comes out of prayer involving the exercise of the spirit. When we exercise our spirit to pray, God is able to shine upon us, examine us, deal with us, rebuke us, break us, and come to us with a particular grace. Although it is possible to receive answers to prayers related to our affairs, this does not mean that we have received the shining and dealing that we need in order to grow. If we do not learn to touch God with our spirit in prayer, we will have little experience of touching God in a genuine way. Consequently, God will only be able to supply us with outward things, according to His mercy, but He will not be able to work on our person inwardly so that we can grow.</p>
<p>As a person receives more of God&rsquo;s grace and learns to fellowship with God through prayer in spirit, he will touch God more in spirit and will also let God touch him as he prays. He will be enlightened by God&rsquo;s light, and he will experience the condition of fellowship described in 1 John 1:7. As he fellowships with God according to the life of God within him, God, as light, will enlighten him about his condition. This enlightening will do a work of sanctifying, dealing, and stripping, and God will be able to make demands and lead him in certain ways. This kind of prayer is precious; it is much more valuable than just asking for things. This kind of prayer will cause us to touch God, taste God, and fully receive God&rsquo;s element, and this kind of prayer will cause our spirit to be strong, living, fresh, and released.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT LETTING CIRCUMSTANCES<br />
RELATED TO TIME OR PLACE AFFECT OUR PRAYER</h2>
<p>We should not allow circumstances related to time or place affect our prayer. As we learn to exercise our spirit and to pray in spirit, circumstances related to time or place should not hinder us from releasing our spirit in prayer. In the past, we have allowed circumstances of time and place to influence our concepts and our willingness to pray. Although many brothers and sisters realize the need to fellowship with God by praying in spirit, they do not see that they allow their fellowship and prayer to be affected by considerations related to time or place. Our exercise should not change simply because we are by ourselves or because we are with other brothers and sisters. Our exercise in the prayer meeting should be the same as our exercise in our morning time with the Lord. If we allow circumstances of time and place to affect our prayers, we will encounter many situations in which our spirit is closed.</p>
<p>For example, when we attend a message meeting, we often have a concept that only the brother who is giving the message and the brothers who are leading the Scripture reading and singing need to pray, because we are there only to listen to a message. Thus, from the very beginning, our spirit is closed and our mind does not consider the matter of prayer. Sometimes we even behave in this way in the prayer meeting. Some brothers and sisters come to the prayer meeting determined not to pray. One brother may feel ashamed to pray because he did something in the flesh. Another brother may feel he should not pray because he is a new believer, who has little experience of praying and who is not familiar with the Bible. A sister may feel exhausted from her busy day and be willing to let others pray, while she only says Amen. Another sister may feel that it is not her place to pray. When many brothers and sisters do not open their mouths, the entire meeting is heavy and dead.</p>
<p>We must turn this around. From this time forward, we must learn to pray at every time in spirit (Eph. 6:18), regardless of the situation. As long as there is an opportunity, we should pray; we should seize every opportunity to pray. Whenever we arrive at a meeting, we should begin to pray. We should begin to pray no matter how many people are present and whether or not it is time to begin the meeting. It is not necessary to begin with singing. We can pray until there is a sense to call a hymn. If it is a familiar hymn, we do not even have to call the number; we can simply begin to sing, and others will spontaneously follow. In this way, the meeting will be very living.</p>
<p>Presently, our meetings are very rigid. We wait until it is the meeting time before we begin. We sing a hymn first, but the singing often is without much life or dead. Then a responsible brother prays in a perfunctory manner. When no one uses his spirit, the meeting falls entirely into formality and ritual. Frankly, this dead formality in a meeting is tiresome. We must drastically change the way we meet. We should not focus on changing outward things; rather, we should focus on strengthening the exercise of the spirit in the meeting. We must exercise to the extent that our spirit can come forth at any time and at any place. When we go to a meeting, whether it is a message meeting, a bread-breaking meeting, or a prayer meeting, we should be able to use our spirit to pray.</p>
<p>A brother recently said to me, &ldquo;We have been blending in spirit for several weeks now. Is this enough?&rdquo; I smiled and said, &ldquo;We need to blend in spirit until the Lord comes back.&rdquo; We must blend continually, until the brothers and sisters can release their spirits to pray regardless of time and place. We must be able to use our spirit to contact God and worship Him as soon as we arrive at a meeting. Furthermore, our worship should involve worshipping in one spirit with all the saints. All the saints should be released in spirit. We should blend in spirit with others, and we should enliven the spirit of others. If we practice these matters, the whole church will advance.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ACTIVELY EXERCISING THE SPIRIT TO PRAY</h2>
<p>We have also been influenced by the erroneous concept that we need to wait for inspiration before praying. Hence, some who come to the meeting are waiting for inspiration from the beginning until the end of the meeting. If someone asks a saint why he did not pray, he will say, &ldquo;I was not inspired to pray.&rdquo; This word may sound very spiritual, but it is not practical. If a soccer player does not kick the ball when he is on the field, claiming a lack of inspiration, his explanation will not be taken seriously. What is the purpose of a player being on the field if not to kick the ball? If he is on the field, he should kick the ball. When the ball comes to him, &ldquo;inspiration&rdquo; should not even be a consideration. Similarly, if the ball does not come to him, he should actively seek an opportunity to kick the ball. When we come to a meeting, we should be focused on worshipping God in spirit. Hence, when we come to a meeting, we should use our spirit and actively look for opportunities to pray. We should not come to a meeting and keep our mouth closed because we have a lack of &ldquo;inspiration.&rdquo; Just as a soccer player should kick the ball when he is on the field, we should exercise our spirit in the meeting.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYER NOT BEING<br />
LIMITED TO STEREOTYPICAL PHRASES</h2>
<p>Since the purpose of opening our mouth and praying in the meeting is to release our spirit, we should not be limited to the use of stereotypical phrases. Over the years we have unconsciously generated many stereotypical phrases in our prayers. As soon as we open our mouth, these phrases come forth. These phrases may sound nice, but they restrict the spirit. Hence, it is not easy for people to utter the feeling within them. Also, when new believers hear these prayers, they feel that they cannot match them. Thus, they become too timid to open their mouth. If we want to learn to pray and release our spirit, we must discard these phrases and simply follow the sense in our spirit when we utter our prayers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYER NOT BEING LIMITED BY TOPIC</h2>
<p>We should not limit our prayer to a specific topic. Since the emphasis of prayer is on the exercise of the spirit, the topic is not the most important item. We can pray when there is a specific topic, and we can also pray when there is not a specific topic. Actually, there are many matters that can be the focus of our prayer. For example, the building of the church, the gathering of students during winter break, the release of the spirit, the blending of the spirit, and the fellowship in the spirit are all worthwhile matters for our prayer. Hence, it does not matter whether we have a particular topic but whether our spirit is released. If we are skilled in our exercise, we can always release our spirit and blend in spirit, no matter what the topic is. Often we feel that there is no topic, burden, or leading in regard to our prayer simply because we have not exercised our spirit. As we exercise our spirit, we will become more skillful in sensing a topic of prayer, and there will be opportunities for prayer in every meeting. As long as our spirit is living and we are diligent, we should not be concerned about a topic for prayer.</p>
<p>A lazy person sees little need to do anything, and even if he sees a need, his laziness keeps him from acting on the need. A diligent person, however, is altogether different. Wherever he goes, he will have a sense that many things need to be done. Similarly, if our spirit is living and we are diligent, we will feel that there are many things that need to be covered in our prayer. For example, when we go to a message meeting, we will feel the need to pray for the Lord&rsquo;s servant so that the Lord may release His word to the saints. This is a very good topic for prayer. Being diligent, we will look for a few saints with whom to pray. At the end of such prayer, our spirits will be released and blended as one. This kind of blending is so spontaneous. This can be practiced not only in a meeting but even when we are riding in a bus. If our spirit is living and diligent, those who ride with us on the bus will become a topic for our prayer. When we see those who are not saved, we will pray for their souls, looking to the Lord to save them. Thus, even riding the bus is an opportunity to exercise our spirit. As long as we are willing to practice and exercise our spirit, there will be an unending list of items for prayer. We should not be limited by prescribed topics. If we limit ourselves to a certain topic, our spirit will not be released.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BELIEVING THAT<br />
WE CAN RELEASE OTHERS&rsquo; SPIRITS</h2>
<p>When we pray, we must have the faith that our released spirit will touch and open up the spirits of others. Each time we open our mouth to pray, we should believe not only that our prayer will be heard by God but also that it will touch the spirits of the saints. Every person who exercises his spirit in prayer must have such faith. This again can be compared to playing soccer. As long as we are willing to put the ball in motion, others will follow. As soon as we open our mouth to pray, others will follow. Once our spirit is opened and released, the spirits of the saints will be stirred up.</p>
<p>I would ask the brothers and sisters to exercise diligently related to the points outlined above. We should all exercise to the extent that we know how to pray in spirit so that we can pray at any time and in any place with any person. We should exercise to the extent that we are not bound by stereotypical phrases or limited by prescribed topics. As soon as we open our mouth, our spirit will come forth and touch the spirit of others. We must learn this lesson. This is especially true for the responsible ones who need to take the lead to exercise. This is a basic exercise. We must make an effort to exercise.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF PRACTICE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Working First with a Few and<br />
Then Including Many</h2>
<p>When we practice, we must blend from the &ldquo;center to the circumference.&rdquo; We should not call all the saints together to practice blending in the spirit, because it will not work. We must begin with a few saints who have been blended and who are skilled in the release of the spirit, and then we can include some who have less experience in this matter. Gradually, everyone will be blended. Hence, the responsible brothers and sisters must first be blended together. After they are blended, they can include responsible ones from the small groups. After these are blended, they can return to the small groups and blend with the other brothers and sisters. Blending should begin with those who have a heart to blend and then gradually include others. Eventually, even those who have not been meeting for a long time will be included in this blending. In this way, the whole church will be blended.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having More Prayer and Less Talk</h2>
<p>When we come together to blend in spirit, we should try our best to avoid unnecessary talk. Everyone should come for the purpose of praying. Whoever arrives first should begin to pray, and those who arrive later can join in the prayer. In short, as soon as a person comes, he should pray. There is no need for talk, because talking often kills the Spirit. If there is still time after we have prayed, perhaps there can be some fellowship in the ministry of the word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Open to Let the Spirit Come Forth</h2>
<p>Being open means to let our spirit come forth; it does not mean to speak frankly with others and to point out their wrongdoings. In these days we often speak of being open. However, some saints think that this means to speak forthrightly and to be willing to point out wrongdoings. This kind of &ldquo;openness&rdquo; only opens up a tomb and spreads death. The more that one speaks in this way, the more he is filled with death. We should never practice this. The openness that we speak of involves the release of the spirit. We should not close our spirit; rather, we should try our best to let our spirit come forth. When we are meeting together, our spirit should be open; when everyone&rsquo;s spirit is open, the saints will be blended spontaneously.</p>
<p>This is wonderful. When we pray with an open spirit, there is no need to point out the wrongdoings of others because everyone will see their own wrongdoings in God&rsquo;s light and receive correction from one another in spirit. When we begin to pray, we may have different opinions concerning a matter, but as we pray and our spirits are released, we will become of one mind. Actually, it is not that our opinions will automatically become the same but that we will become one in spirit. When our spirits are in one flow and fully blended, spontaneously we will be one and we will not be governed by different opinions. If we do not pray in this way and instead spend time talking about this and that, we will end up insisting on our respective views. Thus, our spirits will be further and further apart, and problems will definitely rise up.</p>
<p>We must exercise to pray with an open spirit. Saints who serve together should regularly pray and fellowship with an open spirit. Eventually, differences in opinion will be harmonized, problems will be eliminated, weaknesses and shortcomings will be exposed, and there will be a mutual burden and blessing. I hope that from this time forward, we will exercise in this matter in every meeting, releasing our spirits until we are blended. We should pursue this kind of exercise ourselves and lead others into this exercise as well.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LIVING WATER OF LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:10-14; Psa. 36:8; 46:4; Ezek. 47:1-12; John 4:14; 7:37-39; Rev. 22:1-2</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
THE LIVING WATER OF LIFE AND<br />
GOD&rsquo;S DWELLING PLACE</h2>
<p>After God created man and placed him in the garden of Eden, the Scriptures speak of a river (Gen. 2:10). Following this, there are frequent references to a river in both the Old and the New Testaments. When the Bible refers to a river, there often is some connection with the temple of God. For example, Psalm 36:8 says, &ldquo;They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures.&rdquo; Psalm 46:4 says, &ldquo;There is a river whose streams gladden the city of God.&rdquo; Ezekiel 47:1 says, &ldquo;There was water flowing out from under the threshold of the house,&rdquo; and then verse 5 speaks of this flow becoming a river. Joel 3:18 speaks of a fountain that goes forth from the house of Jehovah. In John 4 the Lord spoke of living water that will flow from Himself into man (vv. 10, 14), and in chapter 7 He said that this water would become rivers of living water (v. 38). Of the four Gospels, only the Gospel of John speaks of the Lord being the temple of God (2:18-21). Hence, like the verses in the Old Testament, which speak of water flowing out of the temple, the verses in John 7 also speak about the water of life flowing out of the Lord as the temple of God. Even at the end of the Bible, there is a river of water of life that proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb (Rev. 22:1). This river flows out of the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb, who are the temple of God (21:22). Referring to verse 22, some people may say that there is no temple in the New Jerusalem, but this verse clearly states that the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb are the temple. Since the river of water of life is flowing out from the throne of God and of the Lamb, it is also flowing out from the temple of God.</p>
<p>These verses show that a flowing stream, a river, is closely related to the temple and the city of God. This river is the lifeline of God&rsquo;s temple, God&rsquo;s city. If this river did not exist, God&rsquo;s temple, God&rsquo;s city, would not have life, and there would be no circulation of life or watering of life. The importance of a river to God&rsquo;s dwelling place can be likened to the importance of a city&rsquo;s water supply. The primary concern of the human population of any city is to have a supply of water. Water is more necessary and crucial than food. In human society water, which is more necessary and crucial than food, serves to water outwardly, to quench thirst inwardly, and to cleanse. To live in a city, we need water; otherwise, even the air that we breathe would be dry and unbearable. More importantly, we need water every day to quench our thirst and to live. Finally, we need to cleanse ourselves daily with water to wash away our filth. A city that is short of water will be dry, filled with death, and filthy.</p>
<p>Similarly, in God&rsquo;s city, God&rsquo;s temple, water is also needed. In the Bible the temple and the city both emphasize the aspect of dwelling. In the Old Testament the city refers to the outlying area of the temple, but at the end of the New Testament the city becomes the enlargement of the temple. In Jerusalem the city surrounds the temple. In the New Jerusalem God dwells directly in the city. In other words, the city has become the temple; it has become the enlargement of the temple. The New Jerusalem, either as a city or as an enlarged temple, refers to the saved ones who are gathered together to be the dwelling place of God. Since it is a city filled with people, there is the need for a flow and supply of water. This is the reason that the Bible associates God&rsquo;s temple and God&rsquo;s city with a flowing river.</p>
<p>Genesis 2:10 contains the first reference to a river in the Bible, and it speaks of the river watering the garden. Hence, according to the Bible, the first function of a river is for watering. The first function of water in God&rsquo;s dwelling place is to water people. When the Bible further speaks of water, it is for the purpose of giving people a drink to quench their thirst. Although Genesis 2 does not use the word <em>drink,</em> the intrinsic significance of water is for man to drink. This can be seen from the context of verses 9 and 10. Since the emphasis in verse 9 is on eating the tree of life, the emphasis in verse 10 must be on drinking of the river that went forth from Eden to water the garden. Throughout the Scriptures, rivers are associated with drinking. Psalm 36:8 speaks of drinking of the river of God&rsquo;s pleasures, and in John 7:37-38 the Lord spoke of coming to Him and drinking so that rivers of living water would flow out of those who believe into Him. These verses emphasize drinking. At the end of the Bible, Revelation 22:1 speaks of a river of water of life, and in 21:6 the Lord spoke of giving to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely. Finally, 22:17 says, &ldquo;Let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely.&rdquo; All these verses clearly indicate that the river of water of life is for people to drink and to quench their thirst.</p>
<p>Watering relieves outward dryness, whereas drinking relieves an inward thirst. It is the function of a river to water and to quench thirst. This is the reason that the Bible speaks of a river of pleasures that gladdens the city of God and that makes God&rsquo;s dwelling place joyful (Psa. 36:8; 46:4). We all know that a person who is dry outwardly and thirsty inwardly is not joyful. According to the Bible, thirst is the most severe suffering that a person can experience. In Luke 16:24 the rich man who was suffering in Hades longed to have his tongue cooled by a little water from the tip of Lazarus&rsquo;s finger. It is a happy matter when a man&rsquo;s thirst is quenched. In addition, Revelation 22:1 speaks of this river as being a river of water of life, a river that gives people life. Since life is always versus death, the river of water of life solves the problem of death. Thirst is the herald of death. When the problem of thirst is solved, the problem of death is solved.</p>
<p>If we consider all these points, we can see clearly that in God&rsquo;s city, God&rsquo;s temple, God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the first crucial matter is the flowing of the river. When we speak of the building of the church, we must realize that the living of the dwellers and the work of building cannot be maintained without the flowing of water. If we desire to accomplish the work of building the church as God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the most urgent thing is to let the water of life flow so that there will be a full supply for our spiritual life and living. When the water of life flows in God&rsquo;s dwelling place, it waters the dwellers, quenches their thirst, and washes them of any filth. These functions enable every person in God&rsquo;s dwelling place to be refreshed, living, and clean, without any hint of dryness, death, or filth.</p>
<p>In addition to watering, quenching thirst, and cleansing, the flow of the river produces gold, pearl, and precious stones. This is the picture presented in Genesis 2:10-12. The flowing of the river not only refreshes God&rsquo;s people in their life and living, but it also produces materials for God&rsquo;s building. Hence, when we speak of building the church, we must pay attention to the flow of living water. If living water cannot flow freely, the life and living of God&rsquo;s people cannot be maintained, and there will be no producing of building materials. Instead, the only result will be death and filth. However, when the water of life flows freely, the situation in the church will be full of life, bright, and pure as crystal, and the precious materials needed for the building will be produced. If we want to maintain God&rsquo;s temple and to sustain God&rsquo;s city, the river of water of life is absolutely indispensable. Similarly, if we want the church to be built up as God&rsquo;s dwelling place, there must be a flow of living water.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIVING WATER OF LIFE BEING<br />
THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The Bible clearly associates the Holy Spirit with the flowing of living water. In John 7:37-38 the Lord said, &ldquo;If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; Then the apostle John added a supplementary word in verse 39, saying, &ldquo;But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive.&rdquo; <em>Spirit</em> here refers to the Spirit of life, because John&rsquo;s speaking is always related to the divine life. We receive the Spirit of life inwardly by drinking, whereas we receive the Spirit of power outwardly by being poured upon. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit refers to the baptism in the Holy Spirit, through which we are empowered outwardly. On the one hand, the Spirit is the Spirit of power upon us to work. On the other hand, the Spirit is the Spirit of life within us to drink. Revelation 22:1-2 ultimately speaks of the aspect of the Spirit as the river of water of life.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, the Spirit is God flowing into man and upon man. As the hidden source of life, God is the Father; as the manifestation and expression of life, God is the Son; and as the flowing of life into and upon man, God is the Spirit. The river is the Spirit of life, the flowing of God into and upon man, to be man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>God is life, and God comes to be life. God must flow out in order to be life to us. In order to become our life, God first must flow out from Himself and then flow into us. Revelation 22:1 says that a river proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. Since God and the Lamb are on the throne, the river that flows out of the throne is the flowing out of God Himself. The river of living water is the flowing out of God; it is also God coming to be man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LETTING THE LIVING WATER OF LIFE FLOW FREELY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving God as Life</h2>
<p>God has flowed out as the water of life, but how can man receive Him as the water of life and let this water flow freely in him? According to the record of the Bible, man first needs to receive God as life. Genesis 2 clearly shows that God placed man in the garden of Eden so that he would eat, that is, receive, from the tree of life. This indicates that God desires to enter into man as life in the way of food. After speaking of the tree of life, the Bible speaks of a river in a wonderful way. This implies that whenever man receives God as food to be his life, this life will become a flowing river in him. The Gospel of John confirms this point. In chapter 6 the Lord spoke of Himself as being bread for man to receive as life (vv. 35, 48), and then in chapter 7 He spoke of man receiving Him as life in order to drink of Him as living water (vv. 37-38). This shows that when we receive Him as the bread of life, He becomes rivers of living water in us. Hence, in order to receive the living water, we must first receive God as food into us as life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Letting God Be Enthroned</h2>
<p>In order to let the water of life flow freely, we must also give God the ground to establish His throne in us and let Him have authority over everything in our living. The first reference to a river in the Bible links the river with food, indicating that man must receive God as life so that the water of life may flow. The last reference in the Bible to a river links the river of water of life with the throne of God, indicating that we must let God set up His throne within us, letting Him have His rightful place and letting Him rule over all things, so that the river may flow in us without any obstruction.</p>
<p>Our experience confirms this matter. First, we must believe into the Lord and receive Him as life so that the river may flow into us. Second, we must submit to the Lord, consecrate ourselves to Him, and yield to Him His rightful authority so that He may have the first place in us, be enthroned, and possess all our being. If this is our situation, the river will flow in us without any obstruction.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Open and Allowing the River to Flow</h2>
<p>We must also be open so that the river has an outlet in our being. In John 4:14 the Lord said that the living water would become &ldquo;a fountain of water springing up into eternal life,&rdquo; and in 7:38 He said that rivers of living water would flow out of the innermost being of those who believe into Him. With a fountain, the emphasis is on the source, but with a river the emphasis is on the flow. In order for the living water to flow, there must be an outlet. If we want living water to spring up and flow out of us, we must open our being in addition to receiving the Lord as life and in addition to allowing Him to be enthroned in our living. The type of the New Jerusalem matches this requirement because the river freely flows; there is no obstruction to its flow.</p>
<p>In order for the living water to flow freely, there must be outlets, but God&rsquo;s children have neglected this matter. Even among us, we have heard many messages on receiving God as life, on consecrating ourselves to God, and on giving God the first place and enthroning Him. However, rarely do we speak of being open so that there is an outlet in our being to let God&rsquo;s life flow. Consequently, the river of life is not flowing through many saints. Without such an openness, the river cannot flow into some saints, and the river cannot flow out of other saints. If the river cannot flow out, the river cannot flow in. If we want water to flow in, we must let water flow out&mdash;the more water flows out, the more water will flow in. If we stop the water from flowing out, it will stop flowing in as well. The water reaches all four sides of the New Jerusalem, which means that the water flows freely throughout the entire city.</p>
<p>If we want the living water of life to flow freely, it is not enough to receive it or even to consecrate ourselves; we must open ourselves. It is not enough to receive God as life and to give God the authority to rule over us; we must open ourselves to this life. We must open ourselves to both God and to the saints so that this life can flow freely. We must be open to God as well as to the saints so that this living water in us can become a fountain and flow out of us to become a river. The river that flows out is the fellowship of God&rsquo;s children, which is the fellowship of the church. This corresponds to 1 John 1:2-3, which speaks of the fellowship among God&rsquo;s children in relation to God&rsquo;s life. The fellowship in the New Jerusalem is based on this river; there is no other fellowship. Hence, the fellowship of the church is a flow; the testimony of the church and the building of the church are also in this flow, in this fellowship.</p>
<p>If we compare the scene in Revelation with the depiction of the early church in Acts, we can see a clear correspondence. In Acts the saints received God as life, let God be on the throne, and were open to God and to one another. There was a flow of life among the saints; that is, God was flowing among them as the Holy Spirit. As a result of this flow, there was fellowship among them. This fellowship involved a connection with God and with all those who had His life. This fellowship was the flow of the Holy Spirit. This flow came out of Jerusalem and spread to Antioch, to Macedonia, and even to Rome. This flow has reached us today. According to Ezekiel 47, this flow of life swallows up death wherever it goes. When the flow reaches the sea, even the water of the sea is healed (v. 8); wherever this flow goes, death is swallowed up and life richly grows.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING OPEN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Opening Being a Matter of Our Spirit</h2>
<p>If we consider the picture of the water of life, we will realize that being open is a matter of our spirit. This is because the living water is God, who is Spirit. When God contacts us and flows through us, our spirit is always involved. Hence, when we speak of being open and letting Him flow into and out of our spirit, our emphasis is entirely on our spirit.</p>
<p>Often when we speak to others, our spirit is not open. Our soul may be open to chat, to sympathize, and to agree with the thoughts and opinions of others, but our spirit is closed. Some brothers and sisters can chat with one another for hours without feeling tired, but they cannot pray together. This shows that our souls can be open to one another but that our spirits are closed because of many barriers. Being open does not depend merely upon an outward opening; it depends upon the release of the spirit so that there can be genuine fellowship in the spirit. Being open also does not mean having a &ldquo;frank talk&rdquo; that unleashes a stream of discontentment toward others. Such &ldquo;frank talk&rdquo; merely releases the flesh, not the spirit. Some brothers and sisters are very open and talkative by disposition. When they talk, they tend to have no reservations and no sense of measure. Such people seem to be very open on the surface, but their talk is nothing more than an expression of their soul. If they are not exercised in the spirit, their words will not come from the spirit, and their words will not have the flavor or sense of the spirit.</p>
<p>We must see that being open is a matter entirely in the spirit. When we exercise our spirit, there is an opening for the living water of life to flow. This flow of life is actually God, who is also the Spirit. Such a flow does not begin in our soul, but rather in our spirit. This flow must be released through our spirit and then flow out of us through our soul. If we do not release the flow through our spirit, it will not be able to flow out of us through our soul. Hence, we must learn to be open in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying</h2>
<p>In order to be open in our spirit, we must spend time in prayer. If we desire to be open, we must exercise our spirit more. The exercise and use of our spirit mainly involve prayer. If we are short of prayer, we will have a deflated spirit. It is difficult to have an open spirit when we do not have a spirit that is strong, living, full, and uplifted. If we desire to have a strong, living, full, and uplifted spirit, we must spend time in prayer.</p>
<p>Our spirit is an organ to contact God, and the most crucial way to contact God is to pray. An audible prayer is prayer, and a silent prayer is also prayer. Even looking to God for a brief moment is also prayer. As long as we pray in these ways, our spirit will touch God. If we pray more, our spirit will touch God more, and our spirit will be strong, living, fresh, full, and released. With such a spirit, opening our spirit will be something that is quite spontaneous.</p>
<p>Our mingled spirit is a praying spirit (Rom. 8:16, 26), and the Spirit of God is even called &ldquo;the Spirit of grace and of supplications&rdquo; (Zech. 12:10). Such a Spirit causes us to pray. If we want our spirit to be strong, we must pray; if we want the Spirit of God to increase in us, we must pray. By prayer our spirit is exercised, and by prayer our spirit is opened.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Opening Our Spirit to Others</h2>
<p>We also must learn to open our spirit to others. Some saints can open their spirit to God when they pray privately, but as soon as they pray with others, they cannot release their spirit. It is as if they can be open only before God but not before other people. As a result, God, as the flow of life, is restricted in both His flowing in and His flowing out. With a limited flowing out, the flowing in will dwindle. If we can release our spirit only when we are praying by ourselves, our opening is limited and inadequate. We must learn to exercise our spirit with others as well as before God. We should be open when we pray with others as well as when we pray by ourselves. This will let God, as the living water of life, flow in freely and flow out freely. When we are open before both God and the saints, the living water of life will flow freely without any obstruction in the church, and this flow will bring in abundant fruit.</p>
<p>In the past we received only a little leading in regard to opening ourselves to others. We paid attention to removing the barriers between us and God and to dealing with any problem between us and God, but we rarely considered the matter of removing the barriers between us and others and to dealing with any problem we might have with others, in order to be open to them. Because we lacked the leading in this aspect, it has not been easy to open ourselves to others. Even when we come together for a meeting, it is hard to be open to one another. We might be open when we pray alone but as soon as we are in a meeting, our spirit is closed toward others. As a result, the meeting is heavy and dead because the water of life cannot flow freely. The living water in the New Jerusalem flows throughout the city, but in our meeting this living water is blocked by walls and barriers in our being. With some saints, the water cannot flow in, and with others it cannot flow out. Other brothers and sisters are closed to the saints as well as to God, and still other saints are open to God but closed to others. Hence, we rarely have a meeting that truly expresses the New Jerusalem, in which the water of the life flows unhindered.</p>
<p>For example, in a bread-breaking meeting, the flow of the Holy Spirit may come to me and urge me to pray. However, if I am unwilling to open my mouth due to many considerations and fears, the flow of the Spirit will be obstructed. This restricts the Spirit in the meeting. Later, if the flow of the Holy Spirit comes to you, urging you to call a hymn, but you do not allow Him to flow out, the bread-breaking meeting will be dry and dead, the saints will not be supplied, and their thirst will not be quenched. We must learn to be open in every meeting. When the Holy Spirit moves in us, we should give Him the freedom to freely flow out by releasing our spirit. The extent to which we utter something of the Spirit is the extent to which the Spirit can flow out from within us. This is a crucial point related to our exercise.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Exercised in the Thoughts<br />
and Utterances of Our Prayers</h2>
<p>We need to pray to exercise our spirit, but we also need to be exercised in regard to the thoughts and utterances of our prayers. This is because the flow of the Spirit is very much related to our thoughts and utterances. Prayer also helps us to be exercised in our thoughts and utterances. As we are exercised in prayer, our spirit is strengthened, our thoughts become richer and clearer, and our utterances become more focused and accurate. As we exercise in this way, we will increasingly express the sense in our spirit, based on rich thoughts and appropriate utterances. In the meetings some brothers and sisters are moved by the Spirit and are willing to release their spirit, but they lack the necessary thoughts and the utterances to express their inner feelings. Even if they have a little utterance, the shortage in their thoughts and utterances makes it difficult for them to express the inner sense of the Spirit in a rich and full way.</p>
<p>The release of the spirit is often associated with words, because the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit and life (John 6:63). Our experience confirms this. Often we receive the flow of the Spirit through the words of the ministry or through the words in the Bible. If we do not listen to messages or read the Bible, it will be difficult for us to have a sense of the Spirit. Our sense of the Spirit can be linked with the ministry of the word and the words of the Bible. The way that we have received the Spirit, consequently, is the way for us to express the Spirit, that is, through words. As long as we can find appropriate words to express our inner sense, there is no need for shouting. Once the words are spoken, the Spirit is released through the words. Hence, we must exercise our spirit by praying, and we must be exercised in regard to the thoughts and words of our prayers so that our prayers are based on rich thoughts and fluent utterances. Then, whenever we are inspired, we will have clear thoughts and appropriate words to match and express the Spirit&rsquo;s inspiration. If there is a feeling in our spirit to praise, we will have words of praise; if there is a feeling to give thanks, we will have words of thanksgiving; if there is a feeling to confess our sins, we will have words of confession; if there is a feeling to petition for something, we will have words to petition. If we are keen in our thoughts and rich in our utterance when we pray, our spirit will be released in a rich way. Once the spirit is released, the water of life will flow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GLORIOUS RESULT</h2>
<p>When we release our spirit by means of prayer, we will be blended into one flow, and we will become one in one spirit. This is the blending of the saints into a fellowship in spirit that flows freely and mingles us together in one spirit. If we are blended to such an extent, the Spirit as the water of life will flow unhindered in the church. In whatever meeting and whatever the occasion, there will be a free flow among the brothers and sisters. There will be no sense of dryness, and everyone will be watered. At the same time, our thirst will be quenched by the living water, and this water of life will swallow up every kind of death. This matches the vision in Ezekiel, the vision of a river that is able to heal the water of the sea and cause all creatures to live (47:8-9). The flow of this living water will solve all the problems in the church, removing all traces of filth, and deal with every factor of death. The whole church will become bright as crystal, manifesting the situation of the New Jerusalem. May we all learn to be exercised and to pray to release our spirit so that God&rsquo;s life will flow unhindered among us to manifest such a glorious result!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE FLOWING OF THE RIVER<br />
OF WATER OF LIFE</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning the flow of the water of life and the results of this flow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CONDITIONS FOR THE FLOWING<br />
OF THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The flow of the river of water of life depends on our being open in two directions: toward God and toward man. In order for a river to flow, it must have a source and an outlet. Every river has one of its ends open to a source and the other end open to an outlet. A river that lacks either a source or an outlet is not a river, and it will not flow. This also applies to the river of water of life in the New Jerusalem. It flows from the throne of God, meaning that God is its source; it is open to God. The river of water of life flows throughout the entire city so that no place is without water. In order for the water of life to flow in a person, there must be a thoroughfare between him and God as well as a thoroughfare between him and the other saints. This may seem obvious, but almost every Christian has a problem in this matter.</p>
<p>Some Christians are completely cut off, severed, from the source. There is a barrier between them and God. Perhaps they do not pray in order to contact God. Even if they do pray, they pray routinely and with little interest, because they are not willing to remove the barrier between them and God. Since there is not a thoroughfare between such believers and God, they do not have any fellowship in the spirit. There are other Christians who fellowship with God and are open to Him. It seems as though they are connected to the source, but they are closed toward other believers. As a result, the river of water of life cannot flow out of them. Some believers are closed because they are introverted by disposition; it is not easy for them to open to others. Some believers are closed when they are in an unfamiliar environment; it is not easy for them to open in certain situations. There are still other believers who are closed because they want to &ldquo;learn a spiritual lesson.&rdquo; These believers are not willing to show the riches that are within them. Whatever the reason may be, a believer should not be closed.</p>
<p>We must overcome all three situations. As a Christian, we should live a life that is against our natural man, that is, our natural disposition. If a person is naturally slow, God will ask him to be quick. If a person is quick by nature, God will ask him to be slow. If a person&rsquo;s natural disposition is closed and introverted, God will ask him to be open and extroverted. We often say that we should receive the breaking of our natural man. To go against being introverted is to receive the breaking of the natural man. This does not mean that a Christian should always speak; rather, it means that he should go against his natural disposition and be open to fellowship with other believers. He should preach the gospel, and in the meetings he should testify for the Lord, speak the truth, pray, and praise. In spiritual matters he must go against his disposition and be released. The natural tendency of being closed must be overcome.</p>
<p>We must overcome the situations in which we cannot open. Our spirit should be strong and uplifted; it should not be conquered or dictated by the environment. We should overcome and rule over our environment. With regard to learning spiritual lessons, we should accept the environment that has been sovereignly arranged for us, but with regard to serving the Lord by praising Him, testifying, and praying, we should rule over our environment. We should not allow the environment to rule over us. If we desire to let the river of water of life flow, we must learn to go against our natural disposition and overcome our environment.</p>
<p>Some saints have &ldquo;spiritual reasons&rdquo; for being closed. They desire to learn lessons and not display themselves. Although their motive and intention for being closed seem &ldquo;spiritual,&rdquo; the issue is that their spirit actually is restricted within them. Whether a person displays himself does not depend on his being open or closed; rather, it depends on his intention. If his intention is not to display himself but to release the spirit, others will not feel that he is showing off. Therefore, we do not need to be closed.</p>
<p>The human spirit is the purest and keenest part of man. Our motives are easily recognized by those who know how to discern the spirit. If a believer&rsquo;s motive is to show off, those who know how to discern the spirit will recognize it when he speaks. Whether or not he is showing off is not related to his speaking but to his intention and inner motive. If his intention is to put on a show and display himself, others will discern it. If his intention is to release the spirit so that the Lord may come forth, others will discern that he is not showing off. One does not become humble merely by closing his mouth but by dealing with his inner motive and intention. As a Christian, our mouth should always be open. This is not a matter of self-display. A believer who hides, regardless of the occasion, often wants others to have the impression that he is a spiritual person. He knows that he can receive more praise when his mouth is shut than when his mouth is open. We need to reject this concept. A truly humble brother can open his mouth in every situation and let the spirit come forth. Such a brother can have much utterance without any hint of displaying himself. We must overcome being closed in the name of spirituality. We must not allow our mingled spirit to be restricted; we must not restrict the Lord in us. Our prayer must be open toward God and man and connected with both God and man.</p>
<p>In order to exercise our spirit, we must be able to pray in the Lord&rsquo;s presence and with other believers. Some saints are able to pray in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, but they cannot pray with others. When they are praying by themselves, they are open, but when they pray with others, their spirit is closed. Other saints can pray with a small number of believers but not with a large number of believers. Still others can pray when they are with younger believers but not with older believers. Some sisters cannot pray if brothers are present, some saints cannot pray in the presence of the elders, and still other saints cannot pray in the presence of the co-workers. None of these situations is proper. There should not be any distinctions among us when we pray. We should be able to pray in the presence of anyone. It is not normal to be able to pray only in the presence of the Lord but not with other saints. There is also a small number of saints who can pray only when they are with others but not by themselves. They are open toward man but not toward God. We should overcome all these situations.</p>
<p>A Christian must be open both to God and to man. He cannot be open only to one and not to the other. If he is open to only one, there will be no thoroughfare within him. He must be open to both God and man. A Christian should be open even to unbelievers. He should have the feeling to preach the gospel to an unbeliever. If we are open to God and also to sinners, God will flow through us and make us a channel for the river of water of life as we preach the gospel. As a result, sinners will be saved. We should be open to sinners and especially to the brothers and sisters. We should be persons who have a thoroughfare that is completely unobstructed; we should allow God to continually pass through us in order to reach others. This is the way that the river of water of life will flow within us.</p>
<p>The basic hindrance to the flow of the river of water of life is a lack of prayer. We must spend much time in prayer. On the one hand we should pray in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, and on the other hand we should pray with others. When we preach the gospel to an unbeliever, we should lead him to pray. Sometimes the saints are embarrassed to lead a gospel friend, who is well educated, to pray. Some saints dare not pray with their boss. Such problems are the issue of not having an open, strong, and released spirit. If our spirit is strong, we will lead our gospel friend to pray, no matter what his status is.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESULTS OF THE FLOWING<br />
OF THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Supplying Life</h2>
<p>The flow of living water is also the flow of the Spirit in our spirit. This flow supplies the divine life. Whoever is in this flow will have a richer spiritual life and will receive more inspiration and revelation. In this flow we enjoy the riches of God. The supply for our spiritual life is obtained in this flow. If we lack the flow of living water, our spirit will become dry and weak. When we are open to God and to man, we allow the water of life to flow through us so that we can have a fuller and richer supply of the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Bringing Light</h2>
<p>This flow brings light. According to the Bible, the flow of life brings in light (John 1:4; Rev. 21:23; 22:5). Those who are experienced know that when the flow of life passes through us, light shines within us. The more we allow the water of life to flow through us, the brighter we will be within. On the contrary, when we do not allow the water of life to flow through us, we become dark within.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Quenching People&rsquo;s Thirst</h2>
<p>This flow supplies water to quench our thirst. When our spirit is blocked, we will feel dry and thirsty. Furthermore, those whom we contact will feel as if they have come to the bitter waters of Marah (Exo. 15:22-23). But when the river of water of life flows within us, those whom we contact will feel as if they have come to Elim, where there are twelve springs of water (v. 27). They will be able to drink living water, and their thirst will be quenched. Some brothers and sisters are like a river; when they open their mouths, everyone is able to drink.</p>
<p>Two chapters in the Bible speak of the Lord Jesus being living water. John 4 says that He is the fountain of living water (v. 14), and chapter 7 says that He is rivers of living water (v. 38). His being the fountain is for us, and His being rivers is for others. With the fountain, the emphasis is on His flowing into us; whereas with the rivers, the emphasis is on His flowing out of us. We must not receive the Lord as the fountain but not allow Him to flow out as rivers. We should always allow others to receive the supply of living water from us. In order to flow out rivers of living water, we must be open in two directions. Only those who are open toward God and toward man, allowing the living water of life to flow through them unhindered, can supply others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Swallowing Up Death</h2>
<p>The flow of living water swallows up death. In Ezekiel 47 the flow of the river caused the water of the sea to be healed and caused things to live and grow (vv. 6-12). This shows that life swallows up death and produces abundant fruit. Churches do not bear fruit because death reigns in their midst. Some churches are like the Dead Sea, full of salt water. Hearing idle talk, gossip, criticism, judgments, and opinions can be compared to drinking salt water. This is the reason that hardly anything grows in some churches. For many years not many have been saved, edified, or raised up to serve the Lord, nor have elders been produced. This kind of condition in a church can be compared to the Dead Sea; it is full of salt water. If the living water of life can flow through, the salt water will be healed, and all kinds of living things will begin to grow, because life will swallow up death. Hence, if a church desires to have fruit, it must allow the living water to freely flow through it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Washing Away the Filth</h2>
<p>The flow of living water is able to wash away the filth and make everything clean. The New Jerusalem is not only clean but also pure, because of the washing of the flow of life. When the water of life cannot flow through a believer, silt will accumulate in his being, and those who contact him will become dirty. Some churches are like this. Many of the saints in the churches are filled with so much silt that they are dumb in the meetings. This deadens the atmosphere of the meeting and stops the flow of living water. However, as soon as the meeting is over, everyone is anxious to talk by criticizing or judging. Such talk only stirs up mud and filth. Doctrines and teachings are futile in this kind of situation. These saints need living water. If they can be brought into the flow of living water and will let it flow through them, it will wash away the mud and filth. Only when this happens will the filth that has accumulated be washed away so that the situation becomes clean.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being New, Not Old</h2>
<p>The flow of living water makes everything new. It is one thing to be filthy and dirty, but it is entirely another matter to be old. Some things are not dirty, but they are very old. This can be compared to cleaning an old garment. Even though the garment is clean, it is still old. Some saints are old and stale because they lack the flow of living water. The tree of life in the river of water of life in the New Jerusalem bears fruit every month (Rev. 22:2). This fruit is not old or stale; it is completely new and fresh. If we desire to have new believers as fresh fruit, we must let the living water flow through us continually.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Producing Results in the Work</h2>
<p>The flow of living water will produce genuine results in the work. We give messages because we expect results in the work. However, messages that do not cause the water of life to flow in the saints are not effective. We visit the saints because we hope for results. However, if we do not bring the saints into the flow of life, our visitation will be ineffective. In this respect our past labor offended the Lord. We depended on our speaking of messages, but we did not let the Lord flow into the saints so that He could work in them. We have given many messages, and we have also worked much, but we have done little in terms of opening our spirit and praying, thereby transmitting the Lord into the saints for Him to work directly in them. As a result, the saints have received many doctrines but have not gained much of the Lord. We have offended the Lord, we have not given Him the first place, and we have not glorified Him.</p>
<p>A lack of results is the issue of not bringing the saints into the flow of life. If we could reduce the number of messages that we give and spend more time to lead the saints to pray, the water of life would flow into them.</p>
<p>Whether we give a message or visit the saints, our purpose is for the saints to receive the life supply, to be enlightened, to have their thirst quenched, to have death swallowed up, to be washed so that they may be made new and fresh. If we do not lead the saints to pray, none of these results will be manifested in them. In order to produce such results, we must bring the saints into a spirit of prayer. There is no other way but to pray.</p>
<p>We must admit that we have been short in the past. We have not prayed much; hence, we have not led others to pray. We do not pray when we contact others or visit the saints. We did not know how to lead the saints into a spirit of prayer so that they would be willing to pray regularly. This is a serious lack among us. We must learn how to bring the saints into a spirit of prayer so that they would want to pray, would be able to pray, and would pray regularly. If we can accomplish this, we can be at peace, because the water of life will flow in the saints. As the flow increases and becomes stronger, the positive results listed above will be manifested. Only then will we obtain genuine results in the work that can genuinely build up the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD IN THE LAMB FLOWING OUT AS LIFE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW JERUSALEM BEING<br />
THE CONCLUSION OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The picture of the New Jerusalem is the conclusion of the Bible. The Bible covers many matters, but the last two chapters of Revelation are its conclusion. This conclusion is not merely explained with words; it is expressed by a picture. This representation is richer than any description. There is the saying that &ldquo;a picture is worth a thousand words.&rdquo; If we want to give others thorough knowledge of a certain matter, a simple picture is better than giving many speeches.</p>
<p>God is wiser than we are. In the Bible He covered many things that are complicated and exceedingly mysterious. If He concluded the Bible with only a &ldquo;speech,&rdquo; the conclusion would be very complicated. He used sixty-six books, from Genesis to Revelation, to cover the entire course of mankind and the history of God with man. The length of a summary through words alone would be incalculable. Even a lengthy thesis would not be able to make things clear. At the end of the Bible God in His wisdom uses a picture as the conclusion to all the things He has done throughout the ages.</p>
<p>All the positive things in the Bible are included in the New Jerusalem, but all the negative things have their end in the lake of fire. Hence, the New Jerusalem is the conclusion of all the positive things in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW JERUSALEM HAVING THE THRONE<br />
AND THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE AS ITS CENTER</h2>
<p>The center of the picture of the New Jerusalem is a throne and a river of water of life with the tree of life growing on either side of it. The last two chapters of Revelation, which concern the New Jerusalem, seem to stand out in terms of their content and writing style. It seems as if the Bible is complete by the end of chapter 21, which covers different aspects of the New Jerusalem, but chapter 22 gives more details, specifically related to the throne and the river of water of life. Chapter 22 says that in the New Jerusalem there is the throne of God and of the Lamb, out of which proceeds the river of water of life, which is bright as crystal, in the middle of its street, and that the tree of life grows on both sides of the river. The details concerning the New Jerusalem conclude with a throne, a river of water of life, and the tree of life.</p>
<p>The entire Bible concludes with the New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem concludes with a throne out of which proceeds a river of water of life on both sides of which grows the tree of life. This is the ultimate conclusion as well as the focal point of the entire Bible. The conclusion to the entire Bible is the throne of God and of the Lamb, the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne, and the tree of life growing on both sides of the river. This is the central line of the entire Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Being in the Lamb</h2>
<p>There is a need to add two points of explanation concerning the throne and the river of water of life. First, God is in the Lamb. Revelation 22:1 says that a river of water of life proceeds &ldquo;out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.&rdquo; This verse speaks of God and of the Lamb, but the throne is singular, not plural. There is only one throne, not two. How can God and the Lamb sit on one throne? Some believers may say that God and the Lamb sit side by side because other verses in the Bible say that the Lamb is sitting at the right hand of God (Matt. 26:64; Mark 14:62; Luke 22:69; Acts 5:31). Reading the Bible is not a simple matter. We should not think that since the Lamb is sitting at the right hand of God, God must be sitting at the left hand of the Lamb. We cannot say this. The Bible says that God wants Christ to be seated at His right hand, but to be at the right hand means to have the first place. To be at the right hand means to be first, to be at the top, and to be superior, having the place of honor, but to be at the left hand means to be second, to be lower, and to be inferior. Therefore, for Christ to sit at the right hand of God means that God has given Him the first place. It does not mean that Christ and God are sitting side by side and occupying one seat. Revelation also says that the Lamb is the lamp and that God is the light (21:23). The light is in the lamp. The light and the lamp are not side by side. Therefore, the words <em>of God and of the Lamb</em> indicate that God is in the Lamb, just as the light is in the lamp.</p>
<p>By reading the Gospel of John we can have a better understanding of the meaning of the expression <em>of God and of the Lamb.</em> The first verse of the Gospel of John says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Verse 14 of chapter 1 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; After the Word came forth, became flesh, John the Baptist introduced Him as the Lamb of God (v. 29). In the beginning of chapter 1 the incarnated Word is God, but at the end of chapter 1 this incarnated One is the Lamb of God. God and the Lamb are inseparable, for God is in the Lamb. By reading chapter 1 thoroughly, we can conclude that the words <em>of God and of the Lamb</em> mean that God is in the Lamb.</p>
<p>In chapter 10 the Lamb, the incarnated Word, said, &ldquo;I and the Father are one&rdquo; (v. 30). This verse makes it even clearer that the words <em>of God and of the Lamb</em> refer to the fact that God is in the Lamb. The two are one.</p><h2 class="head2">The Throne Being for Reigning and<br />
for Dispensing Grace</h2>
<p>Let us consider the second point of explanation. Some people understand the throne in Revelation 22 to be a throne for ruling. They do not consider it to be a throne for dispensing grace. God has only one throne; He does not have two thrones. The throne from which He rules is the throne from which He imparts grace. On the one hand, the throne is for ruling; on the other hand, it is for imparting grace (20:4; Heb. 4:16).</p>
<p>The throne being for ruling is related to kingship, but the throne being for dispensing grace is related to the priesthood. The believers are royal priests. We are God&rsquo;s commonwealth, His kingdom, and His kings. In this respect, God&rsquo;s throne is for Him to reign. We are also His priests. In this respect, the throne of God is for dispensing grace. The book of Hebrews is mainly concerning the priesthood. Therefore, it says that the throne of God is a throne of grace: &ldquo;Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace that we may receive mercy and find grace for timely help&rdquo; (v. 16). The throne of God that the priests touch has the aspect of dispensing grace, not the aspect of ruling.</p>
<p>Revelation 1:6 and 5:10 say that, on the one hand, we are priests to God and that, on the other hand, we are His kingdom. At the end of the Bible, these two aspects are consummated in the throne of God. As God&rsquo;s redeemed ones, when we touch God according to our royal status, we touch the throne for ruling, and when we touch Him according to our status as priests, we touch the throne that dispenses grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TREE OF LIFE AND THE WATER OF LIFE<br />
BEING TWO STEPS OF GOD&rsquo;S FLOWING OUT</h2>
<p>The river of water of life and the tree of life are God&rsquo;s flowing out. God is no longer hidden. He no longer dwells only in unapproachable light (1 Tim. 6:16). God has come forth in the way of flowing out.</p>
<p>There are numerous cases in the Bible that portray God flowing out. Some examples include the water flowing out of the smitten rock (Exo. 17:6), the blood and water flowing out of the pierced side of the Lord Jesus on the cross (John 19:34), and the river flowing out of the house of God (Ezek. 47:1-12). These examples speak of God flowing out.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s coming forth, His flowing out, is so that He may be man&rsquo;s life. He becomes man&rsquo;s life by being man&rsquo;s food and drink. If we read the Bible thoroughly, we will see that God&rsquo;s coming forth is for Him to be among men and that He is received into man to be man&rsquo;s life by being food and drink.</p>
<p>The tree of life denotes Christ, the Son of God. The first step of God&rsquo;s flowing out was His incarnation as the Son to be God&rsquo;s expression. God the Son is the expression of God the Father (John 1:18). God the Son came to be among men as the man Jesus Christ. He said that He came that men may have life (10:10). He also said that He is life and that He is the bread of life that came down from heaven for man to eat (11:25; 6:33, 35, 50). How marvelous it is that He is not only the bread of life but also a vine tree and that those who eat Him are His branches (15:5)! By putting these verses together, we can see that the tree of life denotes the first step of God&rsquo;s flowing out to be man&rsquo;s food, making Him edible.</p>
<p>When Christ was on the earth, He was the bread of life that came down from heaven. Those who eat Him do not hunger but live because of Him (6:35, 57). He was also living water for people to drink (4:14). Chapter 7 says that this living water is the Holy Spirit, who flows out as rivers from those who drink Him (vv. 38-39). This corresponds to Revelation 22:1. The river of water of life is the Holy Spirit who flows into man and is received by man.</p>
<p>The tree of life and the river of water of life reveal the two steps of God&rsquo;s flowing out (vv. 1-2). The first step of God&rsquo;s flowing out is in His Son to be the bread of life for man to eat. The second step of God&rsquo;s flowing out is in the Spirit to be the water of life for man to drink. Hence, the river of water of life with the tree of life growing on both sides of the river is a portrait of Christ as the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). God flowed out to be the bread of life as well as the water of life. God is in the Son as the bread of life, and He is the Spirit as the water of life. Moreover, the bread of life and the water of life are together. It is with the Spirit and as the Spirit that Christ can be enjoyed by man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEW JERUSALEM NOT BEING A PLACE</h2>
<p>We should not consider the tree of life and the river of water of life to be related to a geographical location. Many of us still have the natural concept that believers have a place that they will go to in the future. However, the New Testament does not speak of a place where the believers will be forevermore. Gospel preachers like to speak about an eternal home. But the New Testament does not speak of a place that is the eternal home of the believers. The destination of the believers is the mingling of God with man.</p>
<p>We cannot comprehend fully the mingling of God with man, just as we cannot understand how the Lord Jesus, after His resurrection, was able to enter a room that had shut doors (John 20:19-20). We cannot understand the things of God merely with our mind. Likewise, what we see with our eyes is not always accurate. An object that appears to be blue may not actually be blue. We cannot use our limited view or impression to define the glorious situation in the future. It is foolishness to use our limited ability of understanding to define the things of God.</p>
<p>Our concepts have bound our comprehension of our glory in the future to a place. Therefore, we think of going to heaven in the future, that is, of going to a bright and beautiful place. However, we should not have so much consideration about a place. Place is not an issue to a baby who is at his mother&rsquo;s bosom. As long as the baby has milk to drink, whether he is in a palace or in a cottage makes no difference to him. God&rsquo;s salvation does not save us to a place that is outside of God. His salvation saves us into Himself. Therefore, we should not understand the New Jerusalem to be a place in the future, such as a heavenly mansion.</p>
<p>According to the last two chapters of Revelation, John did not see people dwelling in the New Jerusalem. Neither the twelve apostles nor the twelve tribes of Israel were dwelling there. On the contrary, the twelve apostles are the foundations, and the twelve tribes of Israel are the gates. This picture is full of meaning. Suppose there is a picture of a stone with a person&rsquo;s name written on it. This would indicate that the stone refers to that person. Therefore, according to the description in the Bible, the New Jerusalem is not a place where people will dwell. Rather, the constituents of the New Jerusalem are those who will participate in the holy city.</p>
<p>We are not saying that there will not be a New Jerusalem. Indeed, there will be a New Jerusalem. However, the New Jerusalem will not be merely a place, as taught in the traditional beliefs of Christianity. If we understand the New Jerusalem merely as a place, we will have problems in understanding the Bible. Our understanding concerning the New Jerusalem must be delivered from the concept of a place. Then we will see that the New Jerusalem is a mystical mingling of God with man.</p>
<p>Some may say that the mingling of God with man is the spiritual meaning of the New Jerusalem but that the New Jerusalem will also have a physical aspect. This kind of understanding is the result of being bound by one&rsquo;s concept. Such a concept will vanish on the day that the New Jerusalem comes down out of heaven from God. Even though we cannot understand how the Lord was able to enter a room with shut doors, this will no longer be a question after our rapture. Today there is such a question because we are still in the old creation, in which our concepts are still bound by the realm of time and space. After our rapture and the transfiguration of our body, such questions will no longer exist.</p>
<p>After our rapture and the transfiguration of our body, we will have a change in our concept. This may be likened to a caterpillar being transformed from a pupa to a butterfly and to a chick breaking out of an egg; both are completely transformed. We are still in our physical body, which is fallen, so it is impossible for us to break away from the concept of physical things. After our rapture and the transfiguration of our body, however, we will not consider the New Jerusalem to be a place for us to dwell in. We will be a part of the New Jerusalem at its manifestation.</p>
<p>Without this explanation, the saints will not have a proper understanding concerning the New Jerusalem. The Bible clearly indicates that the tree of life is Christ and the river of life is the Spirit. Those who insist on considering the New Jerusalem as a physical location will have a difficult time understanding these matters. We must understand that the emphasis of the New Jerusalem is not on its being a place but on the redeeming God, in His reigning and imparting of grace, flowing out to be man&rsquo;s bread of life and water of life. God&rsquo;s throne involves not only His ruling but also His dispensing of grace. God flows out by His ruling and by His dispensing of grace to be the bread of life and the water of life for man to partake of.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD IN THE LAMB FLOWING OUT TO BE MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>The Bible is a story of God coming to be the Lamb of God so that He can flow out of the throne for reigning and dispensing grace. His reigning and this dispensing of grace are the means by which He flows into man. As the Son, He is man&rsquo;s food, and as the Spirit, He is the water of life. This is the way that He is received and enjoyed by man. Those who enjoy God, who let Him flow through them, are transformed into gold, pearls, and precious stones.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2 &ldquo;God formed man from the dust of the ground&rdquo; (v. 7). First Corinthians 15 confirms this: &ldquo;The first man is out of the earth, earthy...As the earthy is, such are they also that are earthy&rdquo; (vv. 47, 48). As the descendants of Adam, we are earthy. However, God has the appearance of a precious stone. In Exodus 24:10 He has the appearance of sapphire, a precious stone. In Revelation 4:3 God is like a jasper stone and a sardius in appearance, both of which are precious stones. God does not have an earthy element; everything related to God has the appearance of a precious stone. First Corinthians 15:48 says, &ldquo;As the heavenly is, such are they also that are heavenly.&rdquo; Therefore, all those who belong to God will be transformed into precious stones. They will be transformed by God entering into them to be their life, that is, by His being the bread of life and the water of life for their enjoyment.</p>
<p>The lamb is at the beginning of the Bible (Gen. 3:21; 4:4). At the Feast of the Passover the lamb became food (Exo. 12:1-14). Afterward, manna replaced the lamb as food (16:4, 16-35); manna refers to the bread of life (John 6:32, 49-50). There was also the water that flowed out of the smitten rock for the Israelites to drink (Exo. 17:6). In their journey through the wilderness the children of Israel enjoyed manna and water. After they entered into Canaan, the children of Israel enjoyed a land with mountains, rivers, wheat, and barley (Deut. 8:7-8). This means that there was something for them to eat and drink. The Bible describes Canaan as &ldquo;a land flowing with milk and honey&rdquo; (Exo. 3:8, 17). Milk and honey are not only products of the combination of two kinds of lives, the animal life and the vegetable life, but also the blending of food and drink. Milk and honey are food as well as drink. Since milk and honey come out of life, they are a supply for man to live by. These matters are covered in the Bible.</p>
<p>On the positive side, the Bible speaks of only one matter: God as the Lamb coming out of the throne to be man&rsquo;s bread of life and water of life. Whoever lets God flow through him will be transformed into gold, pearl, and precious stone. Whoever does not let God flow through him will manifest only wood, grass, and stubble, materials that are good only for burning with fire (1 Cor. 3:12-15).</p>
<p>After man was created, he was placed in front of the tree of life in the garden of Eden. In the garden there was a river, and the flow of the river issued in gold, bdellium, and onyx stone. Eventually, a counterpart was produced for the man (Gen. 2:7-24). The entire Bible is concerning God flowing out to be the tree of life and the river of life so that man can be transformed into gold, pearl, and precious stones and be built up to become God&rsquo;s counterpart. God flows out of the throne in the Lamb, and the throne is a throne for reigning and for dispensing grace.</p>
<p>On the negative side, there is another stream in the Bible&mdash;a stream of fire. The stream of water begins in Genesis 2, but the stream of fire begins in chapter 3. After man sinned, God placed &ldquo;a flaming sword which turned in every direction to guard the way to the tree of life&rdquo; (v. 24). This is the beginning of the stream of fire. Daniel 7:10 says, &ldquo;A stream of fire issued forth.&rdquo; This stream of fire will sweep everything that is not of God into the lake of fire. The Bible concludes with water and fire&mdash;a city of water and a lake of fire. The New Jerusalem is a city of the river of water of life; it is a city filled with the water of life. In contrast, the lake of fire outside the city is filled with fire. Every person, thing, and matter throughout the generations that rebelled against God will be swept away by the stream of fire into the lake of fire (Rev. 20:15; 21:8). God&rsquo;s throne is for imparting grace as well as for reigning. God reigns by dealing with His enemy with fire. God imparts grace by dealing graciously with His redeemed people with water. The stream of fire eventually becomes the lake of fire, and the stream of water flows through all God&rsquo;s redeemed people and transforms them into the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The flow of God as life in man brings in light and the way. Revelation 21 mentions light and the street (vv. 23-24, 21). This street follows the flow of life, and the light is God in the Lamb. God is light to man, and He is also man&rsquo;s way. The city is also the temple, where God dwells with man (v. 22). The city contains the glory of God, which is God expressed. Everything that God gives man, whether love, light, or grace, is in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
THE GOSPEL OF JOHN AND REVELATION</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John has a very strong beginning, but it does not seem to have a conclusion. John wrote, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (1:1). But at the end, he recorded a few incidents that transpired after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, such as the disciples catching a hundred and fifty-three fish (21:11); the Lord asking Peter, &ldquo;Do you love Me more than these?&rdquo; (v. 15); and the Lord saying, &ldquo;Follow Me&rdquo; (v. 19). These words do not seem appropriate as a conclusion.</p>
<p>The conclusion to the Gospel of John is in Revelation. The book of Revelation does not seem to have a beginning, but it has a very strong conclusion. John&rsquo;s Gospel and Revelation are one complete book. His Gospel is the first half, and Revelation is the second half. The first half has a strong beginning but does not have a conclusion, and the latter half does not seem to have a beginning but has a very good conclusion. The Gospel of John shows that God comes in the Lamb as life to be man&rsquo;s food and living water so that man can have a life relationship with Him. He is the vine, and we are the branches. Revelation shows that the ones who have a relationship with God are His lampstands (1:20). Every person, thing, and matter that is not in the lampstands will be judged by God with fire and will end up in the lake of fire. Then the New Jerusalem will be manifested. The New Jerusalem is a corporate entity composed of God and all those who have received Him as their life, who are joined to Him, and who are built together. God is everything to them. This is the eternal conclusion. Hence, Revelation is the conclusion of the Gospel of John. Every positive thing, such as the tabernacle, the Lamb, the bride, light, the way, life, the living water, and the bread of life, that is mentioned in the Gospel of John is in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The entire Bible speaks of God in His redemption, that is, God in the Lamb flowing out through His reigning and His dispensing of grace, in order for man to receive Him as food and drink. Whoever receives Him will eventually become a part of the New Jerusalem. Those who do not receive Him will end up in the lake of fire. Our responsibility is to receive Him into us and to let Him flow out of us. When we pray, sing hymns, and speak for God, we let Him flow out of us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE KINGSHIP<br />
ISSUING IN THE BUILDING<br />
OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Rev. 1:5-6; 5:8-10; 20:6; 22:1-2; Heb. 10:19-20; 4:14-16; Zech. 6:12-13</h1>
<p>In order for the church to be built up, our spirit must be released and blended into one, because the building of God is carried out through the saints being blended into one in the flow of the Spirit, which is the flow of the water of life. The believers who allow the Spirit of life to flow out from within them are priests. In the Old Testament the building of the tabernacle and of the temple, including its recovery, depended upon the priesthood. Only when there are persons serving God as priests, can the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place be carried out. The Lord Jesus is the Builder of the temple of God. He is building the temple by bearing the priesthood. He is full of the honor and glory of the priesthood.</p>
<p>The building of the church depends on whether or not the saints will bear the priesthood before God. Only the priests draw near to God, touch the throne of God, and allow God to flow through them. The water of life can flow through them and into other persons. The flowing of the water of life is the only way that builds up the church of God.</p>
<p>When God does a work of recovery, the recovery of His Word is crucial. When the children of Israel returned from the land of captivity to Jerusalem, they needed Ezra to open the book of law and read the Word of God so that they might know God according to His Word (Neh. 8:1-6). In the process of building the church, we need the opening of the Word of God so that God&rsquo;s children may see what God is doing in this age and know how God is carrying out the building work. We hope that through these messages the Spirit will bring us into the spirit of the priesthood. The priests are the only people that God needs. The believers are priests, and they need to bear the priesthood by entering into the Holy of Holies, touching the throne of God, and allowing God to flow through them.</p>
<p>Let us consider this matter as presented in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LINE OF THE PRIESTHOOD AND<br />
THE LINE OF THE KINGSHIP</h2>
<p>God created man in His image so that man would be His expression, and He gave dominion to man so that man would be His representation (Gen. 1:26). When the Bible speaks of man, it first speaks of image and dominion, showing that God cares for His image and dominion in man.</p>
<p>The line of image is the line of the priesthood, because only when man draws near to God and allows God to flow through him can God&rsquo;s image be expressed. Moses remained in the presence of God and fellowshipped with God for forty days. As a result, he was saturated with God, and his face was shining (Exo. 34:28-30). In those forty days Moses was with God as a priest. He put aside all other matters and remained with God. He lived in the presence of God, touched God, and allowed God to flow through him and saturate him so that his whole being was filled with the glory of God. This shows that those who bear the image of God live the life of a priest in a practical way.</p>
<p>It is easy to associate the line of dominion with the line of the kingship, because a king receives authority from God in order to reign for God. Hence, in the Bible the lines of image and dominion are the lines of the priesthood and the kingship. These two lines run from the beginning of the Bible to the end of the Bible. When the Bible speaks of God creating man, it speaks of image and dominion. In the last book of the Bible, Revelation, the apostle John says that the Lord has released us from our sins by His blood so that we might be priests (1:5-6), that the Lord made us priests and a kingdom to reign on the earth (5:10), and that when we are resurrected and enter into glory, we will be priests who will reign with the Lord (20:6). Finally, when the New Jerusalem is manifested, the holy city is like jasper (21:11, 18). Jasper denotes the image of God, because God is like jasper in appearance (4:3). In the holy city the water of life&mdash;the Spirit of life&mdash;flows to fill the city with God; hence, the image of God is fully expressed. Furthermore, those who are a part of the New Jerusalem will reign as kings and exercise God&rsquo;s authority for eternity (22:5).</p>
<p>The two lines of the priesthood and the kingship run through the Bible. The priesthood enables man to express God, and the kingship enables man to represent God. The priesthood causes man to have the image of God, and the kingship causes man to have the dominion of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DESOLATION AND RECOVERY<br />
OF THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>God created man with the intention that man would be a priest, that is, a person who draws near to God, allows God to flow through him, is saturated with God, and expresses the glory of God. God also intended that man would exercise His authority. The enemy knew that if the water of life could not flow through man, man would not be like God and could not exercise God&rsquo;s authority. Hence, the enemy came in to damage man so that man would not draw near to God, contact God, or let God flow through him. This is when the adamic race failed God and fell.</p>
<p>God, however, did not give up His original intention. He continued to work by gaining the fathers such as Abel, Enoch, and Noah. Later, He chose Abraham from the fallen human race so that his descendants would become a new race, the children of Israel. After the children of Israel came out of Egypt and arrived at Mount Sinai, God said to them, &ldquo;You have seen what I did to the Egyptians and how I bore you on eagles&rsquo; wings and brought you to Myself...And you shall be to Me a kingdom of priests and a holy nation&rdquo; (Exo. 19:4, 6). God intended that the Israelites would become His priests, not individually but corporately as a kingdom.</p>
<p>The desire of God&rsquo;s heart was for every Israelite to be a priest who drew near to God, allowed God to pass through him, and was saturated with God. Moses is an example. As the representative of the children of Israel, he had the image of God to express God, and he also had the dominion of God to represent God. God&rsquo;s intention was that every Israelite would be like Moses, having God&rsquo;s image and dominion.</p>
<p>As soon as God unveiled His heart&rsquo;s desire, the children of Israel fell and were corrupted. While Moses was fulfilling his priesthood by drawing near to God, the children of Israel were tempted at the foot of Mount Sinai. They did not know how to touch God, draw near to God, or be in His presence; they only knew how to serve a visible god with their physical eyes. As a result, they built a golden calf to worship, thus corrupting themselves. When Moses came down from the mountain and saw the situation, he was furious, and said, &ldquo;Whoever is for Jehovah, come to me&rdquo; (32:26). This was a call for those who were on God&rsquo;s side to stand with Moses. Of the twelve tribes, only the tribe of Levi stood on God&rsquo;s side. Then Moses told the Levites to take out their swords and slay the idol worshippers. The Levites did not care for human relationships; they slew even their own kinsmen. Because the Levites sanctified themselves and remained loyal to God, the priesthood was transferred from the Israelites to the tribe of Levi (vv. 26-29; Num. 1:53). At this time, the Levites became the priests of God. Only the Levites could draw near to God and enter into His presence. They could fellowship with God, allow God to flow through them, and be mingled with Him.</p>
<p>However, history repeated itself, and the priests of the tribe of Levi fell into a desolate state. In the book of Judges a certain Levite was hired by Micah to serve an idol for ten pieces of silver, an array of clothing, and his food, thus undermining the status of a priest and defiling the ministry of the priesthood (17:7-13). Later, at the time of Eli the priesthood was completely corrupted (1 Sam. 2:12-25). The children of Israel became so desolate that the Ark was captured (4:5-11).</p>
<p>It was not until God first raised up David through Samuel and then Solomon that the children of Israel were revived and the priests were revived and strengthened. David divided the priests into twenty-four divisions to minister before God (1 Chron. 24). However, this good situation did not last long. The children of Israel fell into desolation, the priests were not up to standard, the temple was shut, and the altar was abandoned (2 Kings 12:5-8; 2 Chron. 28:24-25; 29:6-8). This was a pitiful situation.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the Lord Jesus is a priest; He is even the High Priest. When He was on the earth, He always brought men to God. He was a person who had entered into God and who allowed God to flow through Him (John 14:9-11). When the Lord was on the earth, the water of life was flowing through Him, and He allowed the Spirit of God to flow through Him. There was no obstacle between Him and God. After He went to the cross and offered Himself to God, He was raised from the dead and ascended to the presence of God to become our glorious High Priest (Heb. 4:14; 7:26).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is our Priest, and those who receive Him are also priests (1 Pet. 2:5, 9). His priestly life has entered into us; hence, we can draw near to God, fellowship with God, and allow God to flow through us. As believers, we can touch the source of the water of life, and we can allow the water of life to flow into us and to flow out of us as rivers of living water. We can be priests who draw near to God.</p>
<p>According to church history, after the time of the apostles the church became desolate, just as the children of Israel in the Old Testament became desolate, and the priesthood was lost. In Christianity only a few believers function as priests. But even these few believers do not know how to pray and touch the throne of God, nor do they know how to allow the water of life to flow through them. The situation in Christianity is very much like the desolate state recorded in the books of Kings and Chronicles: the temple was closed, the altar was abandoned, and the priests were improper.</p>
<p>In order to recover the building of His church, God must first recover the priesthood. The priesthood upholds the building of the church; without the priesthood, it is impossible to build up the church. Hence, God is sounding out a call for us to fulfill the priesthood, just as He called the Levites at the foot of Mount Sinai. Who is willing to stand on God&rsquo;s side in order to fellowship with God and allow God to flow through him by rising up to be a priest of God?</p><h2 class="head1">THE DESOLATION AND RECOVERY OF THE KINGSHIP</h2>
<p>Let us now consider the line of authority in the Bible. As soon as the Israelites became a kingdom, authority was established among them, because there must be authority in a kingdom. Among the children of Israel, Moses was the first person to represent God&rsquo;s authority. After Moses there was Joshua, and after Joshua, God&rsquo;s authority was with the judges. When David was raised up, the authority of the kingship was brought in. The authority of the kingship was the authority of the kingdom. After David and Solomon, the kings became corrupted and defiled the authority that they had received from God. When the priests were improper and the kings were defiled, the prophets were raised up.</p>
<p>God desired to have proper priests and kings. But when the priests and kings were not up to the standard, the prophets came in as a help and a supplement. The Old Testament prophets include Elijah and Elisha. They ministered when the children of Israel were in a desolate state. At the time of King Ahab, who was very evil and corrupt, the priests seemed to have disappeared.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the apostles, such as Peter, John, and Paul, were not only in the priesthood but also had the authority of God. With time, however, the church became desolate, the priesthood waned, and the authority in the church failed. Although there are pastors and preachers in Christianity, the functions of the priesthood and the kingship are missing. Furthermore, the majority of God&rsquo;s children do not know how to function as a priest or a king. They know only about giving a message or listening to a message. Believers rush to hear a famous preacher, and they attend revival meetings, but their condition remains desolate.</p>
<p>Such a condition exists even among us. Many local churches are seeking eloquent ministers of the word, but they do not pay much attention to every saint functioning as a royal priest. This does not mean that it is wrong to speak for God or that ministers of the word are not needed. The Word needs to be increased and strengthened among us, but the priesthood and the kingship need to be stronger than the prophethood. When the people of God are normal, they should be priests and kings. They should fellowship with God, abide in Him, and allow Him to flow through them, thus bringing in the authority of the kingship. As a result, they will be able to exercise authority in fellowship, or have fellowship with authority.</p>
<p>Everyone in the church should be a royal priest. First Corinthians 14:1 says that the believers should desire to prophesy. This shows that the gift of prophesying is obtained through desiring and pursuing. In contrast, a believer becomes a royal priest as soon as he is saved (1 Pet. 2:9). Every believer has this status. We do not like it when only a few saints pray, nor do we like to see the ministry of the word being stronger than the ministry of the priesthood. We hope that more saints will pray and sing in the meetings. There are times when we need to hear a special word, but the normal situation should be that the meetings are full of the service of the royal priests.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MINISTERING AS PRIESTS</h2>
<p>According to Hebrews 4:16, the way to minister as a priest is simply to come forward to the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace for timely help. Revelation 22:1 says that the river of water of life proceeds from the throne of God. If we compare these two verses, we will realize that mercy and grace proceed out of God to be man&rsquo;s life. When we come forward to behold God and contact Him by praying in our spirit and touching His throne, we experience the Spirit flowing in us. The operation of the Spirit in us is not only like the anointing but also like the flowing of the water of life. When we draw near to God in prayer to fellowship with Him, we have an inner sense that the Spirit is flowing through us and supplying us. This supply is the timely help, which is the mercy and grace of God. Although we are unworthy, the mercy of God reaches us and positions us to receive His grace as our timely help.</p>
<p>If we give things to someone who is lovable, it is called grace; if we give things to a beggar, it is called mercy. If a person&rsquo;s condition is normal, he receives grace; if his condition is poor, he receives mercy. In the eyes of God our condition is poor. Nevertheless, God still visits us. This visitation is mercy. After He bestows mercy on us, He gives us grace.</p>
<p>Both mercy and grace refer to God flowing through us and being gained by us. Sometimes a saint testifies, &ldquo;My landlord was hard on me. Then I prayed, and God opened the way for me as my timely help.&rdquo; Some sisters testify, &ldquo;I was in difficulty because my child was sick. Then I prayed, and God answered my prayer by healing my child. This was truly the timely help.&rdquo; Such testimonies are not wrong, but the descriptions might not be accurate. The answers for these types of prayers are not the &ldquo;timely help&rdquo; that we are referring to. Have we not had experiences of prayers that resulted in the opposite of what we prayed for? There have been times when we were in a difficult situation, but the more we prayed, the more trouble there was. Sometimes we have prayed when a family member was sick, but the sickness did not leave. There are many times when our prayers are not &ldquo;answered&rdquo; by God in our way of &ldquo;timely help.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Whether or not our prayer is &ldquo;answered,&rdquo; as long as we contact God, He will flow through us as the living water. This flow is our timely help. The problems might remain or even become worse, but inwardly we will experience unspeakable peace and joy. This is timely help. Timely help is the living God, the flowing God, coming into us and flowing through us to refresh, water, and supply us.</p>
<p>Our God is a flowing God. The first step that He took was to flow out in His Son. The second step was to flow out in the Holy Spirit. According to the Gospel of John, the first step of His flowing out was to be the bread of life, and the second step of His flowing out was to be the water of life (6:35; 7:38-39). The Lord Jesus is the bread of life, and the Spirit is the water of life. Out of the throne of God and of the Lamb proceeds the river of water of life, and the tree of life grows along both sides of the river. We must see that this is God flowing out. The tree of life is Christ, and the water of life is the Holy Spirit, both of whom flow out to be our supply.</p>
<p>The way into the Holy of Holies is now open, and we can enter in (Heb. 10:19-20). We can touch the throne. God and the Lamb are flowing out from the throne to be our supply. Whenever, by the Lord&rsquo;s blood, we come forward and touch the throne of grace, God flows to refresh and water us, and we experience indescribable joy, no matter how harsh the circumstances are.</p>
<p>God has only one throne in the universe. He does not have two thrones. Just as the light is in the lamp, God is in the Lamb. God in Christ is sitting on one throne. To the believers, this throne is the throne of grace, but to God&rsquo;s enemy, it is the throne of authority. The throne of grace is related to the priesthood, and the throne of authority is related to the kingship.</p>
<p>Out from the throne of God flows the river of water of life (Rev. 22:1) and the river of fire (Dan. 7:10). The river of water of life is for grace, and the river of fire is for judgment. Those persons who allow the river of water of life to flow through them will end up in the New Jerusalem, but those who are swept away by the river of fire will end up in the lake of fire. The meaning of the universe is related to these two rivers. The flow of the river of water of life produces a city of water, but the river of the fire of God&rsquo;s judgment flows into the lake of fire.</p>
<p>As believers, we have a twofold status: we are both priests and kings. The priesthood is related to the throne of grace, and the kingship is related to the throne of authority. When we touch the throne of grace and allow the water to flow through us, we receive mercy and grace for timely help. Then we can touch His throne of authority so that He can judge the improper situations within us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FUNCTIONING AS PRIESTS<br />
TO BRING IN THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>Our function as a priest is to touch the throne of grace. Hebrews says that we can pass through the veil that was split to enter the Holy of Holies in order to contact God by touching the throne of grace (10:19-20; 4:16). When we touch the throne, the water of life will flow into us and become our timely help. Moreover, when we draw near to God in such a way, we will be carried by the flow into fellowship with God and into the building of God. The more we allow the water of life to flow in us, the more we will sense that we cannot be independent, and the more the Spirit will blend us with other saints into one. As a result, we will be built up together.</p>
<p>In order for God to gain His building, we must be those who allow Him to flow through us by entering into the Holy of Holies to touch the throne of God. God desires such priests. God desired that the man created by Him would be such a person. After man fell, God desired that the people called by Him would be such persons. After they became desolate, God desired that the people sanctified by Him would be such persons. God still desires that His redeemed people would be such persons. Therefore, He is sounding out the call for His people to see this vision, answer His call, and stand on His side.</p>
<p>God wants us, His saved ones, to enter into the Holy of Holies in order to touch the throne of grace and allow the water of life to flow through us. Then our inner condition will match the New Jerusalem. The throne of God and of the Lamb will be established in us, and the river of water of life will flow in us. This flow will bring us into fellowship with God and will cause us to be built up in His life to be His holy dwelling place. This is what God desires today.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GOD&rsquo;S CALLING AND THE PRIESTHOOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 28:2-25; Lev. 6:16, 18; 7:31-36</h1>
<p>The Bible reveals that God needs to gain a group of people in this age who will be priests according to His intention. We need to consider this matter in the Word so that we can be clear concerning the place of the priesthood in God&rsquo;s heart.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE CONCERNING MAN</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire in the universe is to work Himself into man, to mingle with man as one, and to express Himself through man. Hence, whether in creation or in redemption, God&rsquo;s desire is that man would have His life and nature inwardly and express His image and likeness outwardly. Consequently, God, who is Spirit, created man with a spirit so that He could enter into man&rsquo;s spirit to be mingled with man as one and be man&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>As the divine life in the believers, God is constantly moving and flowing. After He is mingled with us in our human spirit, God continues to mingle Himself with us so that the element of His life can spread into our mind, emotion, and will to the extent that we live out and express the glorious image of God. In the New Testament Paul speaks of Christ being our life (Col. 3:4), of Christ being formed in us (Gal. 4:19), and of Christ being magnified in us (Phil. 1:20). Thus, for us to live is Christ (v. 21), and this living is an expression of God&rsquo;s glorious image, because Christ is the image of God (2 Cor. 4:4).</p>
<p>When the Bible first speaks of man, it speaks of the matter of image and dominion (Gen. 1:26). God created man in His own image, and He gave man dominion over all the creatures. God&rsquo;s fundamental desire is to gain a group of people who will bear His image and exercise His authority. As long as we allow God to saturate us and be our life and let Him live out of us as the expression of His glorious image, we will receive a measure of God&rsquo;s authority. As long as we contact God, are mingled with God, and express God, we will have the authority of God.</p>
<p>However, God has no desire that we would have His image and exercise His authority as individual persons. Instead, He wants those who have His image and authority to be blended together in the divine life as one Body in one Spirit (Eph. 4:4). The believers, though many in number, are one Body, one corporate entity (1 Cor. 12:12). We are one dwelling place, one Body, one new man, and one counterpart (Eph. 2:22, 15-16; 5:23-32). All of these terms imply a corporate entity, not many scattered, independent individuals.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention is to work Himself into a corporate man so that this man would bear His image and exercise His authority; consequently, He wants those who have received Him as life to be blended into one corporate entity to be His dwelling place, His Body, the one new man that He created on the cross, and His beloved counterpart. At the end of the Bible the holy city, the New Jerusalem, manifests these characteristics. This city is full of God&rsquo;s life, God&rsquo;s nature, and God&rsquo;s element. The outward expression of the city is God&rsquo;s glory and God&rsquo;s image. God&rsquo;s authority also is fully expressed through this city. The holy city, New Jerusalem, is a corporate man, bearing God&rsquo;s image and exercising God&rsquo;s authority, expressing God and representing God in the universe. This is the plan that God is carrying out in the universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTION OF PRIESTS<br />
FULFILLING GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE</h2>
<p>We need to be saturated with God&rsquo;s life to the extent that He is our inward element and outward expression and so that we receive God&rsquo;s authority to reign for God. In order for us to attain to this goal, we must contact God, fellowship with God, come forward to God, absorb God, and allow God to fill us. We must allow God to operate in us and flow through us so that our nature of clay will be changed by the flowing of life that produces gold, pearls, and precious stones. When our inner element is just God Himself with His life and His nature, our outward expression will be according to God&rsquo;s glory and image. At such a point, we will receive God&rsquo;s authority and reign for God. The royal priesthood is a group of people who are not independent, scattered individuals but rather a corporate entity blended into one in God&rsquo;s life. In this priesthood, the priests come forward to God, contact God, fellowship with God, and allow God to pass through, operate, saturate, and shine out from them to express His image and receive His authority. The highest grace that we can receive is to be priests. As priests, we can draw near to God, fellowship with God, live before God, and allow God to saturate us and flow out of us. Furthermore, we can receive the authority of God.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD CREATING MAN TO BE A PRIEST</h2>
<p>When God created man, He put man in a position to function as a priest. God created man in His image and according to His likeness and granted him to have dominion (Gen. 1:26). Then God put man in the garden of Eden, which contained the tree of life and a flowing river (2:9-10). These actions revealed His desire. It is as if God were saying, &ldquo;Come and eat! Come and drink! I am before you in the form of food. I do not want you to merely worship and exalt Me. I want you to eat and drink Me. You need to contact Me, receive Me, and absorb Me, just as you eat food and drink water. I want to enter into you to be your life and nature. I want to be absorbed by you, to saturate you, and to flow out from you so that My life and nature are expressed outwardly with My image and glory. If you contact me in this way, you will represent Me and reign for Me.&rdquo; This picture is a portrayal of the function of a priest. As soon as God created man, God revealed the matter of being a priest to him.</p>
<p>We often speak of drawing near to God and fellowshipping with God, but what does this mean intrinsically? Hebrews 10:19-20 speaks of drawing near to God and fellowshipping with God in relation to entering into the Holy of Holies. According to the type in the Old Testament, only priests could enter into the Holy of Holies (Exo. 28:1, 35; Num. 18:1, 7). A person who was not a priest could not enter into the Holy of Holies. This shows that those who draw near to God are those who enter into the Holy of Holies as priests.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN FAILING TO FUNCTION AS A PRIEST</h2>
<p>When a person draws near to God, contacts God, absorbs God, and allows God to fill, saturate, and flow through him, he is a priest. From the day of Adam&rsquo;s creation, God intended for him to be a priest, but Adam failed. When he fell, the whole adamic race fell with him. The failure of Adam was the failure of the adamic race. When the descendants of Adam failed in Adam and with Adam, the whole adamic race lost its position to be priests of God.</p>
<p>Because of this failure and out of this fallen race, God chose Abraham. God wanted him to rise up and be a person living before Him. To Abraham, God said, &ldquo;Walk before Me&rdquo; (Gen. 17:1). Walking before God means to live before God, to contact God, to fellowship with God, and to allow God to flow through. According to Genesis, on several occasions Abraham built an altar and offered sacrifices (12:7-8; 13:4, 18; 22:9). As a sacrifice-offering person, Abraham was a priest who lived before God, fellowshipped with God, and allowed God to flow through him. The history of Abraham shows that God gained a priest out of the adamic race that had rejected God, a man who desired God, fellowshipped with God, and allowed God to flow through him. Abraham was a priest.</p>
<p>Jacob also was a priest. In his youth Jacob was crafty and well able to supplant, but in his latter years he was truly a priest; he was transformed into Israel, the prince of God (32:28; 35:10; 47:7). He bore the image of God, and he represented the authority of God. When Jacob&rsquo;s descendants were coming out of Egypt, God said, &ldquo;You shall be to Me a kingdom of priests&rdquo; (Exo. 19:6). The word <em>priests</em> denotes drawing near to God and allowing God to fill and saturate; <em>kingdom</em> refers to reigning for Him and allowing God to reign. God desired that the children of Israel would be a kingdom of priests, bearing His image to express Him and exercising His authority to represent Him. However, the children of Israel failed in this matter. Consequently, God chose the house of Aaron from the tribe of Levi to be priests (32:22-29). Regrettably, even the priests of the house of Aaron failed to the extent that they bore only the name of priests but not the reality of the priesthood.</p>
<p>This history tells us that generation after generation of people failed to attain to God&rsquo;s goal. The created adamic race failed, the chosen descendants of Abraham failed, and the tribe of Levi and the house of Aaron also failed. Among all these generations, God&rsquo;s will did not have a free way, and His purpose remained unfulfilled.</p>
<p>In the New Testament age, however, the Spirit is leading the chosen descendants of Adam to believe in the Son, who has redeemed us through His blood and regenerated us with His life. Now, as redeemed and regenerated believers, we are in the new creation so that we can draw near to God and contact Him as a corporate priesthood, the church. Regrettably, even the church experienced failure and desolation. The desolation of the church ultimately reflects the fact that our fellowship with God can be cut off and that the flow of God&rsquo;s life can be cut off, causing us to lose His presence.</p>
<p>God is merciful, however, and we have seen some light and have received some measure of grace. Nevertheless, we need to confess that we are still short in our living before God and in our fellowship with God. We need to allow God to saturate and flow through us more so that He can be expressed and His authority can be exercised. We have yet to fully live the life of the priest and fulfill the ministry of the priest. Even though more grace is available to us, at the end of this age our priestly service of drawing near to God, fellowshipping with God, and allowing God to flow through us are not adequate.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING CALLED IN THIS AGE</h2>
<p>In this age God is shining the light to show us His heart&rsquo;s desire. He is sounding out a call for people to respond to His desire. He desires to gain a group of people who will contact Him, fellowship with Him, and allow Him to saturate and flow through them, thereby reflecting His glory, expressing His image, and representing and reigning with His authority. God needs such a group of people in this age. He needs such Christians. He needs such workers. He needs such people to serve Him. Apart from this, God cannot gain the earth.</p>
<p>The church is not built up just by speaking messages. The church is built up in those who contact God, fellowship with God, and allow God to saturate and flow through them for His expression. Such ones live in the Holy of Holies, touch the throne of God, and allow the living water from the throne to flow through them and be expressed in order to bear God&rsquo;s authority. Such a living spontaneously and practically builds up the church as a corporate entity in the life of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GAINING PRIESTS IN EVERY AGE</h2>
<p>From the time God created man, He has been able to gain some who serve as priests in every age; that is, He has gained some who draw near to Him, allow Him to fill and saturate them, and express Him, bearing His image and representing His authority. These royal priests included Abel (Gen. 4:4), Enoch (5:22), and Noah (6:8-9). Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Joseph, and Moses also were such persons. Moses is a prime example of one who served as a priest. He fellowshipped with God on Mount Sinai for forty days (Exo. 24:15-18). He drew near to God, lived before God, and allowed God to saturate him; God&rsquo;s glory shined through him. When he came out from the presence of God, his face reflected God&rsquo;s glory (34:29, 35). At the same time, he was full of God&rsquo;s authority and manifested the reality of the kingship.</p>
<p>Daniel was a prophet, but with him there was also a significant measure of the priesthood. He prayed and lived before God (Dan. 6:10). He thoroughly fellowshipped with God, and God was able to flow through him freely. Consequently, he was full of God&rsquo;s authority. Even though he was thrown into a lions&rsquo; den, his authority shut the lions&rsquo; mouth (vv. 16-22). Daniel was a priest of God as well as a king of God.</p>
<p>As New Testament apostles, Peter, James, and John were also priests. They came forward to God to pray, saying, &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo; (Acts 6:4). They were priests before God. Although they were unlearned fishermen from Galilee, they also exercised kingly authority when they stood up and spoke (1:15; 2:14). They were priests expressing God, and they were kings representing God.</p>
<p>Even when Paul and Silas were put in prison, their prayer and singing made their prison like the Holy of Holies (16:19-25). Even in prison they fulfilled their function as priests. Furthermore, Paul truly had the standing of a king when he stood and made his defense before King Agrippa, who was only an earthly authority; those who were judging Paul were instead judged by him (26:1-29). It is amazing that a man being judged could judge the judges. This shows that he was full of God&rsquo;s authority. He was a priest with kingly authority.</p>
<p>Throughout the ages, God is after people who can be priests to bear His image and kings to exercise His authority. God desires to gain priestly kings and kingly priests.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EMPHASIZING PREACHING TOO MUCH</h2>
<p>In Christianity today too much emphasis is placed on the function of the prophet, a preacher of the word. Stanza 4 of <em>Hymns,</em> #848 says, &ldquo;Through the weakness of their spirits / Preaching doth predominate.&rdquo; This describes today&rsquo;s abnormal situation in which the function of preachers, as ministers of the word, is dominant among Christians. I am heavily burdened because God desires priests and kings for the fulfillment of His purpose. Prophets are supplementary in this regard. In the Old Testament, prophets were not needed when the condition of God&rsquo;s people was normal. They were needed primarily when His people were weak, childish, foolish, and in darkness.</p>
<p>When the children of Israel came out of Egypt, Moses represented the kingship, and Aaron represented the priesthood. Among them there were no prominent prophets. Although Moses was also considered to be a prophet, his service in this capacity was far less significant than the authority that he bore for God. Moses&rsquo; sister, Miriam, also was a prophetess, but her function did not compare to the priesthood of Aaron and the kingship of Moses.</p>
<p>This does not mean that there is no place for prophets or ministers of the word in the church. It means that the prophethood is supplementary and remedial. In the Old Testament the prophets were needed when the children of Israel were in desolate situations. Elijah and Elisha were raised up to speak to the children of Israel when the temple was closed, the priestly service had ceased, and the kings were in disarray. When David lived properly before God, there was no need for prophets, but when David stumbled, there was a need for Nathan and Gad to serve as prophets (2 Sam. 12:7-15; 24:10-14). When David committed a sin, a prophet was needed. When he had a problem, the remedy came through a prophet.</p>
<p>Today all the churches are looking for ministers of the word. This situation is not normal. Some responsible ones in the local churches say, &ldquo;We are good in every respect except for the lack of ministers of the word.&rdquo; The fact that we are looking for ministers of the word proves that we are not as good as we think. When the standard of the kingship in the church is not adequate and the function of the priesthood is lacking, the need for ministers of the word is not a positive development. If there is a manifestation of kingly authority and priestly function among all the saints, there is much less of a need for ministers of the word. From beginning to end, the Bible speaks of God&rsquo;s desire that man would be a priestly king. Everyone in the church should be a priest. If every brother and sister in a local church is a priest who draws near to God, is saturated with God, and allows God to flow through, there would be much less of a need for ministers of the word.</p>
<p>In a certain district meeting, there are many college-age brothers and sisters, and for a period of time, their meetings were quite low. They all felt that they needed more leading in the word. However, in a meeting with these young people, I said, &ldquo;You need to rise up to serve and function in the meetings.&rdquo; The young saints received this word and responded in a very positive way. Their district meetings quickly changed in a positive manner because these young saints began to function in the meetings. In the meetings they pray one after another, and the elderly saints have to exercise to follow them. Since they have risen up to be priests, I do not believe that there has been much thought about the need for ministers of the word because there is no lack in their meetings.</p>
<p>Before speaking of spiritual gifts in 1 Corinthians 12, Paul said that the Gentiles serve dumb idols (v. 2). Idols are dumb, and the more a person worships idols, the less he speaks. Then, in contrast, Paul said that the God whom we serve is a speaking God; He is not dumb (v. 3). When God inspires us, we sing a song. When God inspires us more, we shout Hallelujah. When God inspires us even more, we declare, &ldquo;Jesus is Lord!&rdquo; Our worship of the Lord should not be in silence. We should speak, sing, pray, and even shout. Most of the gifts in 1 Corinthians 12 are related to the utterance of words, such as speaking in tongues and speaking words of wisdom, words of knowledge, and words of prophesying (vv. 8, 10). These are types of speaking.</p>
<p>If we truly fulfill our priesthood by praying, drawing near to God, fellowshipping with God, and allowing God to flow through us every day, it will not be possible for us to be silent and inactive when we come to a meeting. If we open our mouths in the meeting and pray in the meeting, the meeting will not need to rely on a few individuals who speak as prophets.</p>
<p>In Christianity today the ministry of the word is too prominent, and the authority of the kingship and the function of the priesthood are not very distinct. This is the situation among us as well. Sometimes in the meeting, the saints will sit quietly without making any noise. Although it seems harsh to say, it is almost as if everyone were in a tomb. Some open their mouth at home but do not open their mouth in the meetings. In such a meeting the kingship and the priesthood are lacking, and only the ministry of the word has prominence.</p>
<p>Before we recently began to meet for the purpose of blending in spirit, the meetings would begin at seven-thirty, and some would rush to leave when it was only eight-thirty. Now the meetings can go to nine-thirty, and some saints still do not want to leave. This is because more saints are functioning as priests. Today most of God&rsquo;s children have lost God&rsquo;s original commission; they do not function as priests and instead rely on others as prophets to minister the word to them. In 1 Corinthians 13:8, Paul says, &ldquo;Whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless,&rdquo; but Revelation 22:3-5 tells us that the priesthood and kingship are eternal. When the Lord Jesus comes again, the need for prophets will pass away, but the overcoming saints will be priests and co-kings with Christ for eternity. In the New Jerusalem everyone will be a priest serving God and a king reigning with Him. When the people of God are childish, full of problems, and weak, there is a need for prophets to minister the word, but when the people are strong, bright, and mature, there is not much need for prophets.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIVING OF THE PRIESTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being Sanctified</h2>
<p>The primary condition of a priest is one of sanctification (Exo. 29:1). A priest is a sanctified person, a person who has been set apart. If we want to be a priest of God, we must be sanctified.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Enjoying Christ Inwardly</h2>
<p>A priest ate the offerings on the altar, which typify Christ. In other words, the food of a priest is Christ. A priest lives because of Christ and inwardly enjoys Christ. The more a person fulfills his function in the priesthood, the more he can eat of the offerings. Furthermore, the more he eats of the offerings, the more he can fulfill his function. The more we draw near to God as priests, the more we will enjoy Christ. The more we eat the Lord, drink the Lord, and enjoy the Lord, the more we will draw near to God as His priests. A priest who is outside the Holy Place is a hungry priest. A priest who does not participate in the priestly service does not have any food to eat. If we are hungry, it is because we have not drawn near to God as a priest. If we do not contact God, fellowship with God, or live in the presence of God, we will be unable to enjoy Christ as God&rsquo;s offerings. Drawing near to God and enjoying Christ are inseparable.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Putting On Christ</h2>
<p>The priestly garments also typify Christ. The crown of beauty that the priests put on was Christ as their glory; the robe that they wore was Christ as their righteousness. The priestly garments, in terms of their materials, are equivalent to the tabernacle, because the priestly garments were made with fine linen, gold, and blue, purple, and scarlet strands, just like the coverings of the tabernacle (28:8; 25:3-4). The fine linen typifies Christ as our righteousness. Gold signifies Christ as our life and nature. Blue signifies the heavenly condition of Christ manifested in us. Purple signifies the royal condition of Christ manifested in us. Scarlet signifies the efficacy of Christ&rsquo;s redemption manifested in us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Coordinated and Built Up</h2>
<p>The garment of the high priest also included precious stones. The first time that the Bible speaks of precious stones is in Genesis. The onyx stone in the river that flowed out of Eden was a precious stone (2:12), and there were two onyx stones engraved in settings of gold on the shoulder pieces of the high priest (Exo. 28:9). There were also twelve precious stones on the breastplate of judgment made of gold (v. 15). The New Jerusalem has these same features (vv. 16-20; Rev. 21:18-20). The foundations of the wall of the holy city, New Jerusalem, are twelve precious stones, and the base of the city is pure gold. This corresponds to the twelve precious stones set on the breastplate worn by the high priest. The gold and precious stones were connected in rows of stones (Exo. 28:17), depicting a picture of coordination and building. The names of the twelve tribes of Israel were inscribed on the precious stones (v. 2), denoting that the twelve tribes of Israel were built up together to be one corporate entity.</p>
<p>The picture of the living of the priests in the Old Testament shows that priests eat Christ, wear Christ, are filled with Christ inwardly, and express Christ outwardly. They are one with Christ in every aspect. Christ is upon them as the fine linen, gold, and precious stones, and they are coordinated and built up in Christ as one entity. Their living is in Christ as the tabernacle because they are one with the tabernacle. The tabernacle is upon them, they are one with the tabernacle, and the tabernacle is one with them. The tabernacle represents the building of God and the dwelling place of God. The building of God and the dwelling place of God depend upon the priesthood, and the people of God, as precious stones, are not scattered and detached; rather, they are built up as one in and through the priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIVING OF THE PRIESTS ISSUING<br />
IN THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Today there must be some who rise up to be priests, enjoying Christ inwardly and expressing Him outwardly. Only in this way can the children of God be coordinated and built up. Only in this way can there be the building of the church as the tabernacle of God, the dwelling place of God. In the New Testament age, the built-up church is a priesthood. If we are not living before God as priests, there will be no priesthood and no building of the church.</p>
<p>We need to see that God is after a group of people who will be a corporate priesthood. Such a group of priests will live before Him and allow Him to saturate them, fill them, and flow through them. It is not enough for a person to individually draw near to God in prayer, because the priesthood is a corporate matter. In today&rsquo;s Christianity, drawing near to God in prayer is regarded only as a personal and individual matter, but the Bible speaks of priests who are formed into a corporate priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5, 9). The more we live before God, enjoying Christ and expressing Christ, the more we will be blended into one with others and coordinated with others in the life of God, the Spirit of God, and the fellowship of God. As we are being transformed into gold, pearls, and precious stones, we will be built up with others because the gold and precious stones on the priestly garments are coordinated together. This coordination brings in the shining of the Urim and the completing of the Thummim. Only then will men understand God&rsquo;s heart and know what God is doing among His people.</p>
<p>When the church fulfills the priesthood in this way and the saints are built up together in the spirit of the fellowship of the priesthood, the church will be full of God&rsquo;s light and God&rsquo;s presence, and God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire will be revealed step by step. I hope that every brother and every sister can see that God&rsquo;s calling in this last age is for everyone to be a priest. May we answer God&rsquo;s call, not just to pursue spirituality and to draw near to God in prayer as individuals but to be in the priesthood that fulfills God&rsquo;s purpose.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">BURNING THE INCENSE,<br />
LIGHTING THE LAMPS, AND SINGING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 27:20-21; 30:6-8; 1 Chron. 6:31-33; 25:1, 7-8; Luke 1:8-10; Rev. 5:8; 8:3-5; Eph. 6:18; 5:18-19</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD IN CHRIST BEING MAN&rsquo;S ENJOYMENT</h2>
<p>All the riches of God are in the Son to be man&rsquo;s enjoyment. The Bible uses many types of enjoyment to show how man receives Christ. In the Old Testament Christ is portrayed as manna to eat and living water to drink (Exo. 16:4, 15-18, 31; 17:6). This indicates that Christ is our enjoyment (1 Cor. 10:1-4). In the New Testament the Lord is even more explicit, speaking of Himself as the bread of life coming down out of heaven for us to eat and as living water for us to drink (John 6:33, 35, 48-51; 4:14). Eating and drinking are matters of enjoyment. The Lord also spoke in a parable, comparing His complete salvation to a great feast for which He sent slaves to invite people to come and eat, saying, &ldquo;Come, for all things are now ready&rdquo; (Luke 14:17). The feast has been prepared, and we need only to come and enjoy. These verses indicate that God&rsquo;s desire is to give Himself to us in Christ for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>In order for God to become our enjoyment, Christ had to pass through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Through the Spirit, God has a relationship with man. The Spirit is God entering into man and God coming upon man. Our experience of the Spirit involves two aspects. On one hand, He enters into us for us to drink for our inward supply, and on the other hand, He pours Himself upon us to empower us for His work outwardly. The Spirit wants to fill us inwardly with Himself but also to immerse us fully in Himself. These two aspects cause us to be fully mingled with God. God gives Himself to us for our enjoyment by fully mingling Himself with us in order that we would be blended in His life and nature to become a living, corporate entity, the Body of Christ. This corporate entity is the dwelling place of God and His beloved counterpart. This is God&rsquo;s marvelous intention.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRIESTS BEING ENJOYERS OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>According to typology in the Bible, the priests enjoy Christ in a full and rich way. We often say, &ldquo;Christ is our manna,&rdquo; or &ldquo;We enjoy Christ as manna every day.&rdquo; Although manna was surely sweet and pleasant, the priests who ministered in the Holy Place of God ate food that was much richer than manna, because the offerings that were presented to God were also food for the priests. They enjoyed the offerings together with God. We need to consider all the different offerings in the Old Testament because every part of every offering typifies Christ. For example, in the meal offering there was fine flour, oil, and frankincense (Lev. 2:1). The priests could also enjoy the breast of the wave offering and the thigh of the heave offering out of the peace offering (7:34). There were burnt offerings, sin offerings, trespass offerings, freewill offerings, and thanksgiving offerings, as well as offerings of the firstborn and firstfruits to God. All these offerings are types of Christ, and the priests were entitled to a portion of all these offerings. Although manna was certainly good, it represented only one aspect of Christ. The food that the priests enjoyed was multifaceted and much richer than manna. Hence, a priest is one who enjoys Christ in a full and rich way.</p>
<p>The children of Israel ate only manna in the wilderness, but the priests in the Holy Place enjoyed the riches of Christ. In the journey of the children of Israel, they erected the tabernacle whenever they encamped, and the priests presented offerings in the tabernacle. Thus, while the children of Israel were eating manna, the priests were enjoying the riches of the offerings. Even though the priests passed through the wilderness, they enjoyed the riches of the offerings because they were serving in the Holy Place. Similarly, if we want to have the full enjoyment of Christ, we must be a priest.</p>
<p>Today the children of God may know Christ as manna, but they have little realization that manna was food for the children of Israel only when they were wandering in the wilderness; it was not the food found in the Holy Place. If we serve God as priests in the Holy Place and minister before God, we will have an endless supply of food from the offerings on the altar because these offerings also were food for the priests. Eating the breast typifies enjoying the love of Christ, and eating the thighs typifies enjoying Christ as power. If we serve as priests, we will enjoy Christ in all His riches. Conversely, if we are wandering Christians who never enter into the Holy Place to live before God, our enjoyment of Christ will be limited to one aspect. If we want to enjoy Christ in a thorough, multifaceted, and full way, we must function as a priest. We must enter into the Holy of Holies and serve God before the throne of grace. In this place, everything of Christ will become an enjoyment to both God and us.</p><h2 class="head1">PRIESTS PUTTING ON CHRIST OUTWARDLY</h2>
<p>The Bible also shows that those who enjoy Christ have put on Christ. Galatians 3:27 says, &ldquo;As many of you as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; Putting on Christ means being clothed with Christ. According to the Bible, no one among God&rsquo;s people was clothed more beautifully than the priests. From top to bottom, from inside to outside, from front to back, from left to right, everything that the priests wore typifies Christ, including the garment, the ephod, the breastplate, and the turban. This shows that the priests put on Christ in a thorough way. The ephod was made of &ldquo;gold thread, of blue and purple and scarlet strands, and fine twined linen, the work of a skillful workman&rdquo; (Exo. 28:6). A plate of pure gold on their turban was engraved with the words <em>HOLINESS TO JEHOVAH</em> (vv. 36-37). Pomegranates of blue and purple and scarlet strands were sewn around the hem of the garment and bells of gold were sewn to the hem (vv. 33-34). These items are rich in meaning. Pomegranates signify the fullness of life. When a pomegranate ripens and breaks open, its red seeds are an expression of life in its fullness. The golden bells, which sounded out if the priests walked too fast or carelessly, signify that the voice of warning in the church has its source in the divine nature. From the top the expression of the priest is one of glory according to divine holiness, and from the bottom the expression of the priest is related to life and the voice of warning. When the priests were ministering, there was something to see as well as to hear.</p>
<p>The breastplate of the priests was enclosed with twelve precious stones (vv. 15-21). Twelve is the number of the New Jerusalem. In the New Jerusalem there are twelve gates, twelve pearls, twelve foundations, and the names of twelve apostles and twelve tribes (Rev. 21:12, 14, 21). The measure of the wall is one hundred forty-four cubits (v. 17), which is twelve times twelve. In the New Jerusalem twelve is a significant number. It is amazing that there were also twelve precious stones on the priests&rsquo; breastplate.</p>
<p>The breastplate included two additional items: the Urim and the Thummim (Exo. 28:30). When I was young, I read a book written by a Jewish scholar, David Baron, entitled <em>The Ancient Scriptures and the Modern Jew</em> (1901). In this book there is a section on the significance of the Urim and the Thummim. <em>Thummim</em> means &ldquo;completers.&rdquo; There are twenty-two letters in the Hebrew alphabet, but only eighteen letters were used for the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. After the names of the twelve tribes were engraved on the breastplate, the remaining four letters were engraved on the Thummim, which was enclosed in the breastplate. In such a way all twenty-two letters of the Hebrew alphabet were included on the breastplate. This is why <em>Thummim</em> means &ldquo;completers.&rdquo;</p>
<p>According to the aforementioned book, <em>Urim</em> means &ldquo;lights,&rdquo; so the Urim was an illuminator. Although it is hard for historians and Bible scholars to determine what kind of illumination was associated with the Urim, when the high priest wore the breastplate before God to inquire of Him or to seek answers to difficult problems, some of the letters of the alphabet would become dim. The priest could then take note of the order of the dimmed letters to spell out words that conveyed God&rsquo;s intention. This is how Joshua identified Achan as the one who had committed a sin (Josh. 7:16-21).</p>
<p>The garments of the priests are rich in spiritual significance. We can only speak about them in a simple way. All the items of the priestly clothing relate to the expression of Christ. The food that the priests ate signifies the riches of Christ, and the clothing that they wore signifies the beauty of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TABERNACLE BEING SIGNIFIED<br />
BY THE CLOTHING OF THE PRIESTS</h2>
<p>The priestly garments, which speak of the expression of Christ, were made of the same material as used for the tabernacle. The curtains, the veil, and the screen at the entrance of the tabernacle, for example, were made with blue and purple and scarlet strands and fine twined linen, and the priestly garments contained these materials as well (Exo. 26:1, 31, 36; 28:8). The tabernacle had many items made of gold, and the priestly garments were made with gold thread (v. 6). Thus, in principle, the materials of the tabernacle, the dwelling place of God, were worn by the priests.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the priests are the dwelling place of God. First Peter 2:5 speaks of the believers &ldquo;being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood.&rdquo; Those who are being built into a spiritual house are priests. Hence, the priests are the dwelling place of God. Although the Old Testament type cannot convey this thought in a clear way, we should realize that the priests were joined to the tabernacle, and the tabernacle was borne by the priests. According to the Old Testament, the priests not only served in the tabernacle but also were one with the tabernacle. Even when the children of Israel were moving, all the items of the tabernacle were carried by the priests and the Levites. Hence, the tabernacle and the priests were inseparable. In God&rsquo;s eyes, the tabernacle was one with the priests, and the priests were one with the tabernacle; furthermore, the temple was one with the priests, and the priests were one with the temple. In the New Testament God&rsquo;s spiritual house, His dwelling place, is the built-up priests, and the built-up priests are His dwelling place, the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF GOD&rsquo;S HOUSE BEING RELATED<br />
TO THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>God wants man to enjoy and express Christ. This is fulfilled through Christ as our food, our inward supply, and by Christ as our garments, our outward expression. This expression is related to His dwelling place. The building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place depends upon the priesthood. The building materials of gold and precious stones that were worn by the priests signify the building materials of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is built with gold and adorned with precious stones (Rev. 21:18-19). Similarly, on the breastplate of the priests, precious stones were enclosed in settings of gold (Exo. 28:11). The twelve precious stones enclosed in settings of gold were one item that signifies all the people of God. This shows that the priests wore the building of God and that the building of God was upon the priests. Without the priesthood, there is no building of God.</p>
<p>The priesthood is crucial because the enjoyment and expression of God depend upon the priesthood. Furthermore, the building of God as the dwelling place of God is the priesthood. From the beginning to the end of the Bible, we see that God wants to gain a priesthood. All the glorious items in the Bible are related to the priesthood. If we are willing to come forward to God, fellowship with God, live before God, and allow God to flow through us, we will enjoy the riches of Christ and express the glory of Christ as priests in a full way. In this way we will bear the testimony of the church, and the building of the church will be realized among us. We need to see that the Lord&rsquo;s purpose in the universe will be fulfilled only by a group of people who enjoy and express Christ in a genuine and full way. Such a group of people, as God&rsquo;s corporate priesthood, will uphold the church, bear the testimony of the church, and bring in the building of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BURNING THE INCENSE,<br />
LIGHTING THE LAMPS, AND SINGING&mdash;<br />
THE PRIESTLY MINISTRY</h2>
<p>Concerning the ministering of the priests in the Holy Place, Exodus 27:20-21 says, &ldquo;You shall command the children of Israel to bring to you pure oil of beaten olives for the light, to make the lamps shine continually. In the Tent of Meeting, outside the veil which is before the Testimony, Aaron and his sons shall maintain it in order from evening to morning before Jehovah; it shall be a perpetual statute to be observed throughout their generations by the children of Israel.&rdquo; Then 30:6-8 says, &ldquo;You shall put it before the veil that is over the Ark of the Testimony, before the expiation cover that is over the Testimony, where I will meet with you. And Aaron shall burn on it fragrant incense; every morning when he dresses the lamps he shall burn it. And when Aaron sets up the lamps at twilight, he shall burn it, a perpetual incense before Jehovah throughout your generations.&rdquo; These two portions show that the function of the priests also included burning incense and lighting lamps in the tabernacle.</p>
<p>Some people may think that the priests only offered sacrifices. When the children of Israel brought their oxen, goats, or firstfruits to God, for example, the priests would offer these things on their behalf to God. The process of preparing these offerings involved &ldquo;rough&rdquo; things, such as killing oxen and sheep, but the priests also attended to &ldquo;finer&rdquo; matters, such as burning incense and lighting lamps. The process of burning incense in the Holy Place was not as &ldquo;rough&rdquo; as the process of preparing the sacrifices. In the Holy Place the priests also wore a garment with bells sewn onto the hem so that if the priests walked too fast, the bells would sound out. These bells restricted them from walking in a loose way. The priests also had to light the lamps. The Bible says that the priests burned incense before God while they were lighting and dressing the lamps (vv. 7-8). They could not burn incense in darkness; they had to do it in the light, in a bright place.</p>
<p>A few portions in the New Testament speak of the significance of the priests burning incense. Luke 1:8-10 says, &ldquo;While he [Zachariah] served as priest in the order of his course before God, according to the custom of the priestly service, the lot fell to him to enter into the temple of the Lord and burn incense. And all the multitude of the people were praying outside at the hour of the burning of incense.&rdquo; Please note that while Zachariah was serving God by burning the incense, people were praying outside; he was not serving by himself.</p>
<p>Revelation 5:8 says, &ldquo;The four living creatures and the twenty-four elders fell before the Lamb, each having a harp and golden bowls full of incense, which bowls are the prayers of the saints.&rdquo; <em>Which bowls</em> is a translation of a relative pronoun that is in the Greek text. It literally means &ldquo;this,&rdquo; without specifying what &ldquo;this&rdquo; is. Consequently, translators of the Bible have argued over the object of this word. Some think that the pronoun refers to the incense, whereas others maintain that it refers to the bowls. According to the Bible, this pronoun should refer to the bowls of incense. The prayers of the saints are not the incense but the bowls; the incense is Christ Himself. Only the resurrected Christ is the incense. The bowls that contain the incense refer to the fact that the saints&rsquo; prayers are full of the fragrance of the resurrected Christ.</p>
<p>Verses 3 through 5 of chapter 8 say, &ldquo;Another Angel came and stood at the altar, having a golden censer, and much incense was given to Him to offer with the prayers of all the saints upon the golden altar which was before the throne. And the smoke of the incense went up with the prayers of the saints out of the hand of the Angel before God. And the Angel took the censer and filled it with the fire of the altar and cast it to the earth; and there were thunders and voices and lightnings and an earthquake.&rdquo; <em>Another Angel</em> means there was &ldquo;another Messenger,&rdquo; indicating that this messenger is different from any other angel. Many Bible scholars agree that <em>another Angel</em> refers to the Lord Jesus. The censer in this passage refers to the prayers of the saints, and the incense added to their prayers denotes that the fragrance of the resurrected Christ is added to the prayers of the saints, ascending with their prayers and being accepted by God. The result of these prayers being heard is thunders, voices, lightnings, and an earthquake. The significance of the priests burning the incense before God is the addition of the resurrected Christ as fragrance to their prayers that are offered to God.</p>
<p>In addition to burning incense and lighting lamps, the priestly service involved the joyful matter of songs. Although the Pentateuch does not speak of the priests singing, the matter of singing was added to the priestly and Levitical services during the time of David. Although David was a king, he put on the ephod, the garment worn over the priestly tunic with its priestly characteristics, when he received the Ark, and he danced (2 Sam. 6:14). He also sang before God (ch. 22). Later, when he arranged the divisions of the priests, he asked the Levites to sing before God according to the divisions. First Chronicles 6:31-33 says, &ldquo;These are they whom David set over the service of song in the house of Jehovah after the Ark was at rest. And they ministered before the tabernacle of the Tent of Meeting with singing until Solomon built the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem; and they attended to their service according to their order. And these are they who attended and their sons.&rdquo; This refers to the singing service of the tribe of Levi before the tabernacle.</p>
<p>Furthermore, &ldquo;David and the leaders of the army set apart for the service some of the sons of Asaph and Heman and Jeduthun to prophesy with lyres, harps, and cymbals...And the number of them, with their brothers who were instructed in singing to Jehovah, all of whom were skillful, was two hundred eighty-eight. And they cast lots for their duties, all alike, the small as well as the great, the teacher as well as the student&rdquo; (25:1, 7-8). As a group, the sons of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun were set apart to minister in the tribe of Levi. This portion of the Word speaks of three characteristics of this group of singers. First, the group was trained to sing to Jehovah. Whether or not some had a natural ability to sing, everyone had to be trained. This should be a great encouragement to those who think that they cannot sing. Second, the number spoken of in verse 7 is very particular, and it relates to the New Jerusalem. Two hundred eighty-eight is two times one hundred forty-four. The measure of the wall of the New Jerusalem is one hundred forty-four cubits (Rev. 21:17). One hundred forty-four is twelve times twelve. The singers were divided into twenty-four divisions with twelve in each division. This equals two hundred eighty-eight, which is exactly two times twelve times twelve. Third, everyone was divided into divisions that contained &ldquo;the small as well as the great, the teacher as well as the student.&rdquo; In these groups some were instructing, and others were learning to sing. In the church meetings there should be some teaching and some learning how to sing. First Chronicles 25:1 speaks of prophesying, and this shows that they sang the Word of God. Perhaps they turned the Word of God into hymns. The word <em>prophesying</em> in the Bible does not necessarily mean foretelling future events; it also means speaking on behalf of someone. Hence, the hymns that the Levites sang were expressions of the Word of God. Although the priests did other things, such as setting the bread of the Presence before God (Exo. 25:30), burning incense, lighting lamps, and singing were central and fine elements of the service of the priesthood.</p>
<p>Today these three elements of service apply to us as New Testament priests. Burning incense refers to prayer and fellowship with the Lord, lighting lamps refers to being enlightened by God through the reading of the Word, and singing refers to expressing God. We should not think of singing as merely a matter related to music; it is a means of expression. In Christianity singing is a matter only of choirs and music, but in the Bible it is a matter of expressing the grace in our hearts (Col. 3:16); that is, it is a matter of the Spirit flowing from our spirit to express the grace, virtues, and glory of the Lord. Singing is a speaking for God, an expressing from within of the things that we have been touched with by God.</p>
<p>If we function as priests by burning incense and lighting lamps, our situation will be full of glory, and if we remain in the Holy of Holies, touching the throne of grace and allowing living water to flow through us, we will be filled with God. This will fill us with new wine in the meetings, causing us to sing and prophesy with the utterances of God. This glorious situation will be music in God&rsquo;s ears. By praying and reading the Bible, we will be filled with God inwardly and spontaneously speak and sing. Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks (Matt. 12:34); hence, singing is a spontaneous issue of burning incense and lighting lamps.</p>
<p>Regrettably, this is not the case in Christianity today. In revival meetings organized by Christian groups, hardly anyone will pray when the host asks for a volunteer, even though hundreds or thousands of people are present. For every meeting, arrangements have to be made ahead of time for a pastor to read the Bible or an elder to pray. The audience is completely silent, because no one is filled with God inwardly; consequently, they have nothing to say. They are listening with their ears, but their spirit is inactive. When they are asked to pray, they answer, &ldquo;No, no, I am not a pastor.&rdquo; This is a pitiful situation.</p>
<p>A brother once told me that he and two other brothers visited a patient in the hospital. At the end of the visit, they had some prayer together. When a friend of the patient saw them praying, he asked, &ldquo;Are you a pastor? How do you know how to pray so well?&rdquo; This shows that it is a common thought among Christians that only pastors know how to pray.</p>
<p>However, even we often come to a prayer meeting with a deflated spirit. When we are not filled with God, we do not want to speak, and everyone remains in a dry and deadened condition. If several minutes pass in silence, the responsible brothers are left with no choice but to pick a hymn. Then everyone sings the hymn with a weak voice, and after the singing, a responsible brother will offer a prayer, and then another responsible brother will stand up to announce items for prayer. Even if there is some prayer after this announcement, the Spirit is not touched. This causes the brothers to say, &ldquo;Our condition is not good because we are short of speakers. If we had someone to minister the word in our prayer meeting, it would be wonderful.&rdquo; In fact, however, our condition is related to our lack of function as priests.</p>
<p>May we be delivered from such a desolate state, knowing that the Lord&rsquo;s blood has been shed and the veil has been split. Through His blood we can enter through the veil into the Holy of Holies and touch the throne of grace (Heb. 10:19-20; 4:16). His Spirit indwells us, and we should let Him flow through us. We need to exercise to serve as a priest. We need to burn the incense before God, adding the resurrected Christ as the fragrance to our prayers and offering them to God. Moreover, every time we draw near to God, we must light the lamps by reading the Bible.</p>
<p>Every time we fellowship with God, we should be in the light, because God is light. The Bible is the word of God, and the word of God is God Himself. When we touch the word of God, we touch God Himself. Since God is light, the word of God is also light. Whenever we read the Bible in an exercised way, we are filled with light, and we can touch God through prayer. If we read the Bible and pray in this way, we will surely touch Christ, enjoy Christ, absorb Christ, and gain Christ in a full way. Then when we come to a meeting, our mouth will speak out of the abundance of our heart. We will pray, praise, give thanks, and prophesy, fulfilling our priestly service by burning the incense, lighting the lamps, and singing.</p><h2 class="head1">TURNING OUR BEING TO PRAY<br />
ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Every time we come forward to God to fellowship, pray, read the Bible, and even sing, we need to turn our being to our spirit. If you ask what you need to turn from, I would say, &ldquo;You know.&rdquo; Sometimes our thoughts are in one place, and a few seconds later they are in another place. It seems as if our thoughts can travel as fast as a jet plane. It is difficult to pray and draw near to God in this condition. If we want to fulfill our priestly service through prayer, we must turn from the thoughts that fly wildly through our mind.</p>
<p>Some people say that when they pray, they shut the door of their room. While it may be easy to shut a door, it is hard to turn our being back to our spirit. Even though a door may be closed, thoughts are still flying around in our mind. We may even close our eyes, but our thoughts can still fly from the United States to Japan. When we wander in this way, we cannot pray or read the Bible.</p>
<p>We must practice turning our being to our spirit, until we are skilled in this matter. When I was young, it was hard for me to learn how to ride a bicycle. Whenever I tried to ride, I would immediately fall over. When I asked others to help me, they said, &ldquo;The only way to learn is to keep trying. When you ride and fall, you just need to begin to ride again. Eventually, you will not fall.&rdquo; After I heard this word, I practiced until I acquired the skill of riding a bicycle. We can learn to turn our being by practicing to turn our being. If we practice, we will learn. God is not only on the throne, but He is also in our spirit. We need to focus on fellowshipping with the God in our spirit. If we want to pray, we must turn to our spirit. This is the first thing that we need to practice.</p>
<p>When we turn our being to our spirit, we should not rely upon any consideration related to the content of our prayer. When we seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, the things that we need to pray about will be added to us. This can be likened to going to a market to buy some vegetables but then being given some more vegetables as a bonus. We do not need to worry about the content of our prayer. We just need to pray according to our inward inspiration. What we sense inwardly, we should speak outwardly. If we have a sense of joy within, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, I am very happy.&rdquo; If we have a sense of pain within, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, I am hurting.&rdquo; Genuine prayer comes out of the genuineness of a person.</p>
<p>Regrettably, we often have two &ldquo;faces&rdquo; when we pray to God. For example, we may have a sense of a particular sin, but instead, we pray about other matters, such as the illness of our wife, saying, &ldquo;Lord, my wife is ill in the hospital. Please take care of her.&rdquo; A prayer that does not come out of the genuineness of a person may not be answered by God. If we have a sense regarding a sin, we need to confess the sin before we pray about anything else.</p>
<p>When we truly learn how to pray, speaking what we feel inwardly and touching the inner fountain of life, we will touch Christ, and the living water from the throne will flow out freely. The priesthood comes out of eating, drinking, enjoying, and being filled with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FUNCTIONING AS PRIESTS TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>If we function as priests every day, we will enjoy Christ inwardly and express Christ outwardly. Spontaneously, we will also be living in the church and bearing the church. We will be persons in Christ and in the church. Furthermore, the riches of God will flow through us, and the glory of God will be expressed through us. We will bear His image and exercise His dominion as royal priests, as the dwelling place of God, the building of God.</p>
<p>We must learn to burn incense and light lamps before God. We must learn to draw near to God, pray to God, and read the Word of God. Then, as we are filled with Him inwardly, we will open our mouth to speak and sing. Our mouth should always be open. Our mouth should always be full of praises, songs, and rich utterances. If this is our situation, the living water will flow freely among us, and the riches of God will become our reality. This will build up the church as the dwelling place of God and the building of God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRIESTLY SERVICE AND<br />
THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Zech. 6:12-13; 1 Pet. 2:4-5; Rev. 5:9-10; 1 Cor. 14:1; Exo. 27:20-21; 30:6-8</h1>
<p>Zechariah 6:12-13 says, &ldquo;Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, saying, Here is a man, whose name is the Shoot; and he will shoot forth from his place and will build the temple of Jehovah. Indeed, it is he who will build the temple of Jehovah; and he will bear majesty and will sit and rule on his throne; and he will be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace will be between the two of them.&rdquo; This is a prophecy of the Lord Jesus building the temple of God. <em>Shoot</em> denotes the Lord Jesus. According to the flesh, the Lord is out of David; He is the Shoot growing out of David (Jer. 23:5). As the Shoot, He will build the temple of Jehovah and bear the majesty associated with building the temple of God. He will reign as a priest on His throne, and the counsel of peace will be between the priesthood and the kingship. These are extraordinary verses; it is the only place in the Bible that speaks of the combination of the priesthood and the kingship in the Lord Jesus for the building of the temple of God.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:4-5 says, &ldquo;Coming to Him, a living stone,...you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood.&rdquo; Verse 9 says, &ldquo;You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood.&rdquo; The kingship and the priesthood are combined in the term <em>royal priesthood.</em> This shows that both offices are combined in the saints, just as they were combined in the Lord Jesus. The combination of these offices in the saints is for the building of a spiritual house, which is the holy priesthood. Revelation 5:9-10 speaks of Christ&rsquo;s death and of the saints being priests and kings, saying, &ldquo;You were slain and have purchased for God by Your blood men out of every tribe and tongue and people and nation, and have made them a kingdom and priests to our God; and they will reign on the earth.&rdquo; In these verses the kingship and priesthood are combined in the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">UNDERSTANDING THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
PRIESTS, KINGS, AND PROPHETS</h2>
<p>In the Bible the service of God&rsquo;s people is carried out by the offices of the priesthood, the kingship, and the prophethood. Priests fellowship with God, kings reign for God, and prophets speak for God. The priesthood and the kingship are permanently and indispensably linked with each other. However, the prophethood is primarily supplemental. When the priesthood and kingship are functioning properly, there is no need for prophets. Prophets are needed only when kings fail and priests fall short. Hence, the prophethood should not be considered as a permanent office.</p>
<p>The two most prominent prophets in the history of Israel were Elijah and Elisha, who arose at the height of Israel&rsquo;s desolation. At that time, Ahab, who was the king of Israel, &ldquo;did what was evil in the sight of Jehovah, more than all who were before him&rdquo; (1 Kings 16:30). Similarly, Jehoshaphat, the king of Judah, allied himself in marriage with the house of Ahab (2 Chron. 18:1). Elijah and Elisha held prominent positions as prophets because the kings were in a poor condition, and the priests were not ministering properly.</p>
<p>The New Testament extensively speaks of the Lord as King and Priest but not so extensively as Prophet. For example, the Gospel of Matthew speaks of the Lord Jesus as a King, and the Epistle to the Hebrews speaks of the Lord Jesus as a High Priest. However, there is no book devoted to the Lord Jesus as a Prophet. There are some verses that indicate the prophethood of the Lord Jesus, such as Acts 3:22-23, which refers to Deuteronomy 18:15 and 18 through 19, saying that God will raise up a Prophet from the midst of Israel. Even in the prophecy concerning the Lord&rsquo;s building of the temple in Zechariah 6:12-13, only the priesthood and the kingship are mentioned, not the prophethood. When the function of the priests and kings is normal, the function of the prophets is not prominent.</p>
<p>Every believer is a priest to fellowship with God and a king to reign with the Lord (Rev. 5:9-10). We are royal priests (1 Pet. 2:9). In contrast, the Bible does not speak of all the believers as being prophets; rather, it says that we should desire earnestly to prophesy (1 Cor. 14:1). Although God&rsquo;s children may not all function as prophets, they all are kings and priests and must function as priests and kings. It is only when the priesthood and kingship are weak, failing, and desolate that prophets emerge.</p>
<p>We have a serious lack in our service today. Although a few are ministering the word as prophets, it is hard for the saints to function according to the priesthood and kingship. Furthermore, there is almost a complete reliance upon preachers in Christianity. This shows that the priesthood and the kingship have been neglected. If this condition is not corrected, there will be no way to carry out God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>Under normal circumstances, everyone in the church should function as a priest and king. Every saint should fellowship with God, burn the incense, and light the lamps before God so that the fragrance of Christ would be rich, and the light in the Word would be bright. Furthermore, the saints should be full of God&rsquo;s authority to reign for God. Regrettably, God&rsquo;s children have neglected these two offices. Relying on prophets deviates from the normal way and leads to desolation. A church in a locality may have a few particularly strong ministers of the word, but if the condition of the priesthood and kingship among the saints is weak, very little building can occur because the situation is abnormal. When believers focus on preaching and depend upon preaching, the condition of a church is one of degradation. Prophets were raised up in the Old Testament only when God&rsquo;s people were desolate, when the kings neglected their duties, and when the priests were absent in their function. The establishment of seminaries to train a minority of believers to be pastors and ministers speaks of the desolate condition of God&rsquo;s people.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH NEEDING PRIESTLY SERVICE</h2>
<p>In the past I did not see the relationship between the priesthood and the building, even though I bore a heavy burden for the building up of the church. It is only recently that the Lord has showed me from Zechariah 6:12-13 that building is a matter of coordination between the priesthood and the kingship. This light has become increasingly clearer and brighter. Thus, I have the assurance to say that we must recover the priestly service and give heed to the fellowship in spirit in order for the church to be built. Without priests, God&rsquo;s dwelling place cannot be built, because God&rsquo;s dwelling place is intrinsically a priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5).</p>
<p>The tabernacle was linked to the priesthood in the Old Testament; the priests could not be separated from the tabernacle, and the tabernacle could not be separated from the priests. The priests and the tabernacle implicitly reveal two aspects of one reality: The priests and the tabernacle speak of the service of God&rsquo;s people to God, on the one hand, and of the dwelling of God among His people, on the other hand. Furthermore, the New Testament explicitly states that God&rsquo;s dwelling place is a priesthood. Therefore, the building up of the church depends upon the priesthood.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 2:20 Paul says that the church, as the household of God, is &ldquo;being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets.&rdquo; <em>The foundation of the apostles and prophets</em> refers to the revelation that the apostles and prophets received for the building of the church. In 4:11 Paul also speaks of the Lord giving &ldquo;some as apostles and some as prophets.&rdquo; <em>Apostles</em> and <em>prophets</em> refer to the gifts that the Lord has given to the church, that is, to some but not all the believers. Paul speaks of the need to earnestly desire to prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14:1 because the church in Corinth was in a desolate condition; they were fully in the flesh and full of discord and chaos. They were interested only in outward gifts, but the inward matters of fellowshipping with God and being under God&rsquo;s authority were lacking. Due to this condition, the apostle brought up the matter of prophesying because prophesying was the most beneficial gift for the building of the church in Corinth. From Paul&rsquo;s viewpoint, it was necessary to speak of prophesying. However, if the function of the prophethood is stronger than that of the priesthood and the kingship in the church, our situation is not normal. Such a situation also shows that the church is lacking in the building and is not being manifested as a priesthood. In a normal situation the church should have a priestly atmosphere that is full of priestly service with authority. Even if there is an occasional need for strengthening from prophets, the service of the church should be carried out by a royal priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF PRIESTS BEING TO FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>The work of priests, as recorded clearly in the Old Testament, involved not only offering sacrifices in the outer court but also burning incense before God and lighting lamps (Exo. 27:20-21; 30:6-8). Furthermore, the Bible clearly shows that there is a relationship between lighting the lamps and burning the incense. The priests burned incense when they dressed the lamps in the morning and when they set up the lamps at twilight. Lighting the lamps is a matter of light; hence, it denotes the reading of the Bible. Burning the incense is a matter of offering up fragrant incense before God; hence, it denotes prayer. These two aspects are related to the fellowship of the church. If the brothers and sisters have no light or sweet fragrance before God, it is due to a lack of fellowship. If we all are priests and are living in the fellowship, we will be full of light and full of the fragrance of Christ before God. This should be our constant condition before God.</p>
<p>We must admit that our work and our various meetings shine little light to people and offer little fragrance to God because of the lack of our priestly function. Although some can speak the word of God as prophets, there is an urgent need for priests who light the lamps and burn the incense. If our service involves lighting the lamps and burning the incense, the saints will receive a supply that is much greater than what comes through exhortation. If we can help a brother only with teachings and exhortation, we may not be able to shine the light of the Lord upon him or impart the fragrance of the Lord into him. In order to do this, we must be more than prophets; we must be priests. If we are under the authority of God and draw near to God, that is, if we are royal priests, who pray both for and with a brother, we will be able to bring him into fellowship with God so that his whole being is full of light and full of the fragrance of Christ.</p>
<p>We have a great lack related to this point. The apostles said, &ldquo;We will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word&rdquo; (Acts 6:4). They placed prayer above ministering the word. The apostles were royal priests, who reigned and lived in fellowship to minister the word as priests. Moreover, their ministry of the word was mainly to unbelievers. After believing into the Lord, the new believers were brought into a priestly service. God wants us to fulfill a priestly service. We must go before the Lord and exercise our spirit to light the lamps and burn the incense. Our urgent need is not to give more messages but to pray more. We must rise up to be priests and enter into the Holy Place and into the Holy of Holies to fulfill our priestly service.</p>
<p>Although we have some aspects of the Lord&rsquo;s authority and speaking among us, we are lacking in our experience of His priestly function. We may be able to speak many words of exhortation to a brother based on the Bible, but he still may not be affected in a positive way. However, we should lead him to pray so that the water of life begins to flow in him. Then he can be enlightened with just a few words to see his corruption, worthlessness, and filth so that he repents in tears. Such a response can come only from the shining of light within him, not from mere teachings.</p>
<p>In summary, being a priest is a matter of exercising our spirit to pray before God and of fellowshipping with God. We need to personally enter into God&rsquo;s light, be enlightened by God, and touch the fragrance of Christ in order to be acceptable to God. Furthermore, we should pray with others to enter into God&rsquo;s light with them. This is much more profitable than merely teaching with words, and this will build the church.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem illustrates this point. The throne in the city signifies the Lord as King; the river of water of life proceeding out of the throne refers to the Lord as Priest bringing God&rsquo;s people into fellowship with God through the flow of the water of life. We should submit to the authority of God and allow the water of life to flow in our spirit. In this flow there will be light and the sweet fragrance of the supply of life. This is the greatest need of the church today.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>

<p>God needs priests in order to accomplish His eternal plan. Of the three offices&mdash;the priesthood, the kingship, and the prophethood&mdash;mentioned in the Scriptures, the most important in terms of the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s plan is the priesthood. It is not enough just to be a king, because if a king does not live according to the principles of the priesthood, he will not be a proper king. This is also true of prophets. A proper prophet should be a priest in principle.</p>
<p>In addition to these three offices, the Bible uses many terms to refer to God&rsquo;s people, such as the <em>children of God</em> and <em>servants of God. Priests,</em> however, is an all-inclusive term. <em>Priests</em> includes the aspects of being God&rsquo;s servants as well as His people and His children. The Bible shows that the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s plan depends upon priests, because priests are the only people who can accomplish God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S PLAN BEING ACCOMPLISHED<br />
WITH THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</h2>
<p>The first two chapters of Genesis and the last two chapters of Revelation present two descriptive pictures, which are the &ldquo;blueprint&rdquo; of God&rsquo;s plan. Although the Bible speaks of God&rsquo;s plan throughout its pages, the two clearest pictures of God&rsquo;s plan are presented at the beginning and at the end of the Bible. These chapters show the &ldquo;blueprint&rdquo; of God&rsquo;s plan, whereas the remaining portions of the Bible speak of the process through which God accomplishes His plan. Hence, if we want to understand God&rsquo;s plan, we must look at the pictures at the beginning and at the end of the Bible. These two pictures show that God desires to work Himself into man in order that man would express His image and represent His authority. In order to fulfill this plan, God needs to be joined and mingled with man.</p>
<p>The most mysterious and central revelation in the Bible is that God is willing to be joined with man as one. The Word becoming flesh is God&rsquo;s coming to mingle Himself with man (John 1:14). The Word is God, and the flesh is man. The Word becoming flesh means that God became a man, and it also means that God is mingled with man. One of the main points concerning the Lord&rsquo;s birth in Bethlehem is that a Savior was born (Luke 2:11). The most important point, however, is that God and man were mingled together. When the Word became flesh, the One who was begotten was called Emmanuel, God with us, that is, God with man (Matt. 1:23). The Lord, who was born, is God as well as man, man as well as God.</p>
<p>The central thought in the Bible is that God desires to be mingled with man and for man to be mingled with God. Without God, man has no meaning. Similarly, without man, God is not satisfied. If God and man exist apart from one another, the universe will be without full meaning. The full meaning of the universe is revealed in the mingling of God with man.</p>
<p>An unbeliever tends to feel that life has no meaning, because he is a man without God; that is, there is no element of God in him. In contrast, a believer feels that human life is meaningful, bright, joyous, and promising, because God has entered into him and has been mingled with him. We all experienced this mingling when we were saved, but we did not have a full comprehension of what happened. It is similar to receiving the benefit of taking a vitamin tablet without knowing the ingredients of the tablet. We are much clearer now about the mingling of God with man. Therefore, we can say with assurance that the meaning of human life and the satisfaction of God&rsquo;s heart depend upon the mingling of God with man. Mingling is the basic condition that enables God&rsquo;s plan to be accomplished. Man can express God&rsquo;s image only when God and man are mingled, and man can represent God and bear God&rsquo;s authority only when God and man are mingled.</p>
<p>The pictures at the beginning of Genesis and at the end of Revelation also reveal that God&rsquo;s desire is not related to scattered individuals but to a corporate man. According to the type in Genesis 2, Eve is Adam&rsquo;s corporate counterpart. At the end of Revelation, the bride of the Lamb is also a corporate counterpart, the New Jerusalem. A city signifies a corporate entity because a city is a corporate entity of people who congregate together. These pictures show that God desires to gain a corporate entity, not scattered individuals.</p>
<p>The first time that the Bible speaks of the Word becoming flesh is in John 1:14, which says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; This verse refers not only to the mingling of God with man but also to a corporate expression of this mingling, because the Word who became flesh is also spoken of as a tabernacle. A tabernacle cannot be built with only one piece of building material; it has to be built with many pieces. The Lord also referred to Himself as a temple (2:19-21). The Word who became flesh is both a tabernacle and a temple. Hence, when the Bible speaks of the Word becoming flesh, it conveys the thought of mingling and the thought of a corporate entity. This is a mysterious matter.</p>
<p>I hope that we can see this matter. From God&rsquo;s viewpoint, our experience of regeneration did not occur at various times; rather, it was accomplished in a corporate way at the same time (1 Pet. 1:3). With God there is no element of time or space. In God&rsquo;s eyes, Paul was not saved two thousand years ago, while we were saved two thousand years later. In God&rsquo;s eyes, Paul was not saved in the Mediterranean region, while we were saved in the Pacific region. In God&rsquo;s eyes, we were saved together at the same time.</p>
<p>Hence, our experience of regeneration involved more than the union of God and one individual person; it was the union of God with a corporate man. Through incarnation the Word became a tabernacle and a temple, hence, a building. The completion of this building will be expressed through the Body of Christ as the dwelling place of God and as the counterpart that God desires. The corporate entity produced through incarnation and regeneration is the Body as God&rsquo;s dwelling place and counterpart.</p><h2 class="head1">PRIESTS BRINGING FORTH<br />
THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</h2>
<p>The only people who can accomplish God&rsquo;s plan are priests. God&rsquo;s plan requires priests because the key to accomplishing God&rsquo;s plan depends on man having contact with God, fellowshipping with God, enjoying God, and allowing God to flow through him. In other words, the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s plan depends upon the mingling of God and man. Although food may be available to eat, there is still a need for people to eat the food. The purpose of food can be fulfilled only when there are people to eat the food. Similarly, God&rsquo;s eternal plan to be received by man and mingled with man can be fulfilled by priests who go before God to fellowship with Him, contact Him, and let Him flow through them in a mingled way. A priest is one who stands before God and fellowships with God. The New Testament speaks of those who genuinely live before the Lord as being those who enter into the Holy of Holies (Heb. 10:22; 4:16). According to the type in the Old Testament, only a high priest could enter into the Holy of Holies; not even a king could enter. In other words, those who entered into the Holy of Holies were priests.</p>
<p>According to the New Testament, every believer can enter into the Holy of Holies; this means that we can be priests continually. Hebrews 4:16 says that we should come forward to the throne of grace to receive mercy and find grace for timely help. The throne of grace is signified by the lid of the Ark in the Holy of Holies (Exo. 25:17, 21). If we want to touch the throne of grace, we must enter into the Holy of Holies as priests. Strictly speaking, whenever we pray in a genuine way, we touch the throne of grace in the Holy of Holies, and we fulfill our priestly service.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s requirement for the believers is the same as His original desire for created man. If Adam had not fallen, man would have been a priest in the garden of Eden, serving God, drawing near to God, fellowshipping with God, and living before God. When man sinned and fell, however, God blocked the way to the tree of life. The tree of life refers to God, who desires to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life and to be joined with man. Therefore, when sinful man was barred from contacting the tree of life, it meant that he could not contact God, draw near to God, or receive God as life.</p>
<p>The God who is in the Holy of Holies today is the tree of life that was in the garden of Eden. The high priest could enter into the Holy of Holies to see God face to face and have direct contact with God, just as Adam had the right to eat of the tree of life in Genesis 2. Before the fall, there was no separation between God and man in the garden of Eden; man could live in God&rsquo;s presence to enjoy God and even eat God as the tree of life. The Holy of Holies is like the garden of Eden in this regard. At the end of chapter 3, however, man was sent forth from the garden of Eden (vv. 23-24). In type, he was barred from the Holy of Holies and put outside the veil.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, Hebrews 10:19-20 says that we may enter into the Holy of Holies, because the veil that separated the Holy of Holies from the Holy Place has been split. The Lord Jesus died and shed His blood on the cross to satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous requirement related to sin. Consequently, when He died on the cross, the physical veil of the temple was split, and the way into the Holy of Holies was opened (Matt. 27:51).</p>
<p>This shows that God&rsquo;s desire for us to be priests is not an afterthought on His part; it was present within Him even before the creation of man. God&rsquo;s thought is that man would be a priest to draw near to Him, contact Him, and let Him enter into man and be mingled with man. God can enter into and mingle Himself only with priests who bear His image and represent His authority. Only priests can accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal plan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL OFFICES DEPENDING UPON THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>In its presentation of the offices in Old Testament, the priesthood, rather than the kingship and the prophethood, is first spoken of in Exodus. With regard to these three offices, the priesthood is the most prominent and the most critical. This shows the other offices that man has before God depend upon the priesthood. The kingship depends upon the priesthood, as does the prophethood. According to the Bible, the kingship is even brought in by the priesthood. For example, Moses had authority because he fellowshipped with God and lived before God. Since he fellowshipped with God, he could rule for God. Fellowshipping with God is a function of priestly service, and ruling for God is a function of kingly authority. Hence, authority comes out of fellowship. If there is no fellowship, there is no authority. This means that if there is no priesthood, there is no kingship. The kingship depends on the priesthood and is brought in by the priesthood.</p>
<p>Consider the high priest Eleazar, who represented the priesthood, and Joshua, who represented the kingship. All Joshua&rsquo;s activities were under the direction of Eleazar (Num. 27:15-21). This shows that the kingship depends upon the priesthood. Even the age of the kings was brought in by the priesthood. When Samuel anointed David, the age of the kings began, and when the condition of the kings was normal, David conducted himself like a priest, going before the Ark and being clothed with a priestly ephod.</p>
<p>During the age of the prophets, especially the prophets during the time of desolation, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Zechariah were all priests who were serving as prophets. Even the prophetess Anna served in principle as a priest in Luke 2:36-38. She was a widow who spent most of her time in the temple.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the apostles served as priests before God. They continued steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word (Acts 6:4). Their function as proper apostles came out of their prayer. They burned incense before God in prayer as priests. The apostles could serve as apostles because they were priests before God. In order for a believer to be proper, he must be a priest. If a believer does not live within the veil, spending time in the Holy of Holies to contact the Lord, it will be difficult for him to be a proper Christian. As God&rsquo;s children, we must live in the Holy of Holies. If we do not pray or draw near to God, it is almost like not being a child of God. We must be priests and live in the Holy of Holies in order to be a proper Christian.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING AS PRIESTS</h2>
<p>In order to live as priests, we have to draw near to God both individually and with other saints. We need to live in the Holy of Holies by exercising our spirit and turning to our spirit to fellowship with God. We should never think of the Holy of Holies as being merely in the heavens. Subjectively speaking, our spirit is the Holy of Holies. God dwells in our spirit; therefore, our spirit is the Holy of Holies, and when we come together to release our spirit and blend in spirit, this blended spirit is the Holy of Holies as well.</p>
<p>Matthew 18:19 speaks of two being in harmony on earth concerning any matter. We can be in harmony only when we spend sufficient time in prayer with one another so that our spirits can be released and blended as one. This harmonious, blended spirit is the Holy of Holies in which God dwells. Whenever we have such a harmonious situation, God&rsquo;s presence will be there (v. 20).</p>
<p>In order to live as a priest, we must enter into the Holy of Holies and spend time in prayer. When we live in the Holy of Holies, we will bear the image of God and represent the authority of God, and we will be blended as one in spirit and be built up as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This will accomplish God&rsquo;s plan. This is the reason that only priests can accomplish God&rsquo;s plan.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE IMPORTANCE OF THE PRIESTHOOD</h1>
<p>In order to read the Bible properly, we need to understand the meaning of the words, but we also need to touch the feeling conveyed through the words. This can be likened to writing an essay. A good essay expresses the inner feeling of a writer through words. Consequently, when others read the essay, they should touch the feeling behind the words. Similarly, when we read the Bible, we must understand the words and the context, but we also must touch the feeling behind the words. If we do this, we will be able to touch the meaning behind the inspired writing of the Scriptures by touching the Spirit in that particular portion. As we consider the matter of the priesthood in the Bible, the light is becoming much clearer and brighter, and we are touching God&rsquo;s feeling in this matter. Nevertheless, we need to speak further in order to help the saints comprehend this matter more thoroughly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRIESTHOOD AND<br />
THE FULFILLMENT OF GOD&rsquo;S DESIRE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire in this universe is to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life and to be mingled with man as one so that man may have His image to express Him and His authority to represent Him. Moreover, God desires that those who receive Him as life would be built up together as one entity to be His dwelling place, which is the Body of Christ. This is the focus of the entire Bible.</p>
<p>In order to accomplish His desire, God is in the Son, and the first step in accomplishing His purpose involves His coming as the Son to man (John 1:1, 14). In this process the Son is the center. The second step involves His coming as the Spirit of reality to man (14:17; 15:26; 16:13). If God did not come in the Son to be the Spirit, He could not be mingled with man, and man would not have His image to express Him and His authority to represent Him. Furthermore, without this process, man could not be blended together and built up as a corporate entity. Therefore, in order to accomplish His heart&rsquo;s desire, God came to man first in the Son and then as the Spirit. God comes to us in the Son, and the Son is received by us as the Spirit, who comes into us as life and upon us as power. This enables us to express God&rsquo;s image and represent God&rsquo;s authority. Furthermore, in this one Spirit we are one Body.</p>
<p>The Body being one is related to the Spirit in two aspects. On one hand, we need to be filled with the Spirit inwardly as life, and on the other hand, we need to be baptized with the Spirit outwardly as power. Romans 8:2 says that we have received the Spirit of life inwardly; this enables us to be members of the Body of Christ (12:5). This relates to the inward filling of the Spirit. First Corinthians 12:13 then says, &ldquo;In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body.&rdquo; This relates to the pouring out of the Spirit upon us, because the water of baptism does not enter into us; instead, we are immersed into the water.</p>
<p>Both inwardly and outwardly, the Spirit is the ultimate manifestation of God reaching us. God the Father comes to us in the Son, and the Son with the Father enters into us as the Spirit. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit work as one to attain God&rsquo;s goal. This is confirmed by the Lord Jesus&rsquo; charge that we baptize people into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19). Through this process, God enters into man and comes upon man. God can enter into man and come upon man because the Father is in the Son, and the Son is now the life-giving Spirit. The Triune God accomplishes His eternal purpose as the Father, Son, and Spirit. This is on God&rsquo;s side.</p>
<p>On our side it is not enough to merely be human beings; we must also be priests so that God can accomplish His purpose. A priest draws near to God, fellowships with God, lives before God, and allows God to flow through him so that God can saturate him and be lived out of him. We can see this matter clearly with the patriarchs and with the Israelites in the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRIESTHOOD AND THE PATRIARCHS</h2>
<p>In Adam we see God&rsquo;s desire for man to have His image and to exercise His dominion, His authority (Gen. 1:26). With Adam we also see that in order for man to bear God&rsquo;s image and represent His authority, man needs to receive God as life (2:9, 16). A person who receives God as life, lives before God, and lets God live in him will spontaneously bear God&rsquo;s image and represent God&rsquo;s authority. God&rsquo;s original thought concerning the priesthood is illustrated through Adam.</p>
<p>Following Adam, a further aspect of the priestly service can be seen in the lives of Abel, Enoch, and Noah. In addition to walking with God, their lives speak of the need for a redemptive sacrifice (4:4; 5:22; 6:9; 8:20). Redemption is a requirement related to the priesthood. After Adam&rsquo;s fall, there was the need for a lamb to be killed in order to accomplish redemption on man&rsquo;s behalf. Although man needs to live before God and walk with God, man also needs to be joined to God through the death of Christ the Lamb. After Adam&rsquo;s sin, man was separated from God and driven out of the garden of Eden (3:24). As a consequence, he could no longer contact God in the way that Adam could prior to the fall. Man was alienated from God and far off from God (Eph. 2:12-13). Every man is far off from God even before he is born. Hence, there is a need for a redemptive sacrifice, the shedding of blood, so that man can be brought back to God and contact God. This is a matter of the priesthood.</p>
<p>In Abraham&rsquo;s life we can see more concerning the priesthood. Abraham built an altar, pitched a tent, and lived a practical priestly life (Gen. 12:7-8; 13:4, 18). Furthermore, he enjoyed God&rsquo;s appearing, he received revelation from God, and he experienced wonderful fellowship with God. All these experiences are aspects of the priestly service. Hence, his experience of the priesthood was evident in his life even more than in the experiences of Abel, Enoch, and Noah. Abraham even received God&rsquo;s blessing through the high priest Melchizedek, a proper type of Christ as the eternal One, who is our perpetual High Priest (Heb. 7:1-3; Gen. 14:18-20). Abraham even became a person who blessed others (20:17). Wherever Abraham went, he was able to bless others. Hence, his service as a priest before God was more advanced than the service of Abel, Enoch, and Noah.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRIESTHOOD AND<br />
THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</h2>
<p>When the children of Israel left Egypt, God&rsquo;s desire for the priesthood was fully revealed. In the living of Abel, Enoch, Noah, and Abraham, we can see the principles of a priestly living, but the priesthood was not fully revealed or developed. After the children of Israel left Egypt, however, God clearly spoke of His desire for them to be a kingdom of priests (Exo. 19:6). Even when the children of Israel fell, God still chose the house of Aaron out of the tribe of Levi to be priests (32:25-29). The priests of Aaron&rsquo;s house had the presence of God, a living before God that was based on redemption, fellowship with God, and even God as their blessing. The priests of the house of Aaron had everything that Adam, Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob enjoyed, and they enjoyed even more aspects of the priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Enjoying Christ Fully</h2>
<p>First, the Aaronic priests drew near to God and lived before God. They did not draw near to God occasionally; they lived before God continually, and in type they were able to enjoy Christ fully. Those who served as priests enjoyed Christ richly and fully. Whereas the children of Israel ate Christ as the Lamb prior to their exodus from Egypt and ate Christ as their daily manna in the wilderness, the priests enjoyed Christ in a rich and multifaceted way as the sacrifices.</p>
<p>With the exception of the burnt offering, the priests enjoyed all the sacrificial offerings together with God. The priests enjoyed the meal offering of fine flour and oil (Num. 18:9; Lev. 2:1-2, 14); the priests enjoyed the breast and the right thigh of the wave offering (Num. 18:18); and the priests enjoyed a portion of the firstfruits that the Israelites offered to God, such as the new wine and the grain (v. 12). All these offerings are types of Christ. These examples show that a priest fully enjoys Christ.</p>
<p>Today many Christians pay attention to enjoying Christ as manna. However, in typology, Christ was manna to those who were wandering in the wilderness. In contrast, the priests were those who enjoyed Christ fully in the Holy Place. In the wilderness Christ was manna to the people; in the Holy Place Christ was the offerings enjoyed by God. These offerings to God were also food to the priests. In order to enjoy Christ fully, richly, and abundantly, we must be priests. Priests not only draw near to God and live before God; they also enjoy Christ fully.</p>
<p>We often speak of enjoying Christ, but I am afraid that most of the saints are not able to speak of many instances of their practical enjoyment of Christ. When we see how the priests enjoyed the offerings, we should realize that there are many rich items of Christ for us to enjoy. I hope that we will spend some time considering the offerings. We need to study the different offerings and the details of each offering in order to understand their spiritual significance. This will help us greatly.</p>
<p>Only priests can enjoy the offerings. We do not have to be priests in order to enjoy Christ as our redemptive Lamb or as our daily manna. However, in order to enjoy Christ as the offerings to God and as our rich food, we must be priests. Priests draw near to God and live before God, and they enjoy Christ in many aspects. In fact, priests live before God because they enjoy Christ in such a multifaceted way. Drawing near to God and enjoying the rich Christ are matters related to the priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Putting On Christ Completely</h2>
<p>According to the types in the Bible, the priests also put on Christ, just as we put on Christ as our righteousness (Jer. 23:6; 33:16; 1 Cor. 1:30; Gal. 3:27). In typology the priests put on Christ completely. The priestly garments were unique among God&rsquo;s children. All the items of the priestly garments are types of Christ. Christ was the inward content of the priests, that is, their food and inward life supply, and Christ was the glory and beauty of the priests, that is, their outward expression (Exo. 28:2).</p>
<p>Many of the materials used in the tabernacle were also used in the garments of the priests. For example, the fine twined linen, the gold thread, and the blue, purple, and scarlet strands used in the tabernacle were also used in the garments worn by the priests (v. 6). The priests not only put on Christ, but they also put on the tabernacle. From the viewpoint of the New Testament, the priests are the tabernacle. In principle and in nature, the priests are the tabernacle because the priests and the tabernacle are one. God&rsquo;s thought in this regard is very rich, and we should spend time to consider these matters. Christ is the inward supply of the priesthood, and Christ is the outward expression of the priesthood.</p><h2 class="head2">Bearing the Building</h2>
<p>The most important item worn by the priests was the breastplate with twelve precious stones set in gold (vv. 17-21). These precious stones denote God&rsquo;s people. The significance of the breastplate points to the importance of the priesthood in the experience of God&rsquo;s children, which makes them golden and transforms them into precious stones for the building up of God&rsquo;s children into one entity. The twelve precious stones set in gold are a miniature of the New Jerusalem. As the aggregate of God&rsquo;s people, the New Jerusalem is built with gold and precious stones. Thus, the use and arrangement of gold and precious stones on the breastplate is a picture of the aggregate of God&rsquo;s people. Through the priesthood, God&rsquo;s people are in the process of becoming gold, of being transformed into precious stones, and of being formed and built together as one entity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving Revelation from God</h2>
<p>For the fulfillment of the priestly ministry, the operation of the Urim and the Thummim was needed in order to reveal God&rsquo;s intention (v. 30). When God&rsquo;s people contact Him and enjoy the riches of Christ, His people are built together, and their expression is one of gold and precious stones. This expression reveals God&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Heart&rsquo;s Desire<br />
Being Entrusted to Priests</h2>
<p>Every person gained by God through His redemption should be a priest. God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire has been entrusted to the priesthood. God&rsquo;s desire is to be life in His Son through the Spirit so that we may become gold and precious stones to be built up together to express His image and represent His authority. All the details related to God&rsquo;s desire are realized through the priesthood. God&rsquo;s desire in the universe will be accomplished only when He gains the priesthood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OFFICES OF THE PRIESTHOOD, THE KINGSHIP, AND THE PROPHETHOOD</h2>
<p>We will now consider the three offices in the Bible&mdash;the priesthood, the kingship, and prophethood. The Old Testament can be divided into three parts: the first part, the Pentateuch, concerns the priesthood; the second part, the middle section of the Old Testament, concerns the kingship; and the final part, the last section of the Old Testament, consisting of the books of the prophets, concerns the prophethood. In presenting these three offices, the Bible first speaks of the priesthood, not the kingship. This shows God&rsquo;s desire to have the priesthood with the kingship. David was brought in as the king through Samuel the priest. The New Testament similarly reveals a relationship between the priesthood and the kingship among the believers. First Peter 2:9 says, &ldquo;You are...a royal priesthood,&rdquo; and Revelation 5:10 speaks of the believers as being &ldquo;a kingdom and priests,&rdquo; who will reign on the earth. Hence, the kingship accompanies the priesthood; authority is related to image. Only a person who bears God&rsquo;s image can exercise God&rsquo;s authority. The kingship exists because there is the priesthood, and authority can be exercised when there is image. The priesthood brings in kingship, and image brings in authority. This thought runs throughout the Bible.</p>
<p>However, when man becomes desolate due to weaknesses and shortcomings, God brings in the last office, the prophethood. The prophethood is supplementary and remedial; it is not something that is needed in a normal situation. If our condition is normal, there is no need for the prophethood. In fact, the New Testament clearly states that prophecies will be rendered useless, but that the priesthood with the kingship will exist eternally (1 Cor. 13:8; Rev. 22:3-5).</p>
<p>All the books of the prophets reflect situations involving desolation, and every book is filled with words of rebuke. Even though most readers of the Bible agree that Isaiah, the first of the books of the prophets, is a book of the gospel in the Old Testament, the first chapter of Isaiah still contains a strong rebuke. The prophet Isaiah called the people of Israel a &ldquo;sinful nation, / A people heavy with iniquity, / Seed of evildoers, / Children acting corruptly!&rdquo; Then he said, &ldquo;Unless Jehovah of hosts / Had left to us a surviving few, / We would have been like Sodom, / We would have resembled Gomorrah&rdquo; (vv. 4, 9). This is the background of Isaiah&rsquo;s speaking. The priesthood had been abandoned, and the kingship was deformed. Hence, there was a need for the prophethood.</p>
<p>Prophets were needed because the priests and the kings were not functioning normally. If the kings had been reigning in a proper way, there would have been no need for the prophets. Before David sinned, the matter of his kingship was primary, even though he had some function as a prophet (Acts 2:30). When he went astray, however, God had to raise up a strong prophet, Nathan, to correct him (2 Sam. 12:1-15). This shows that the prophethood was needed to remedy the problems of the kingship. However, when the condition of the priesthood was normal, the speaking of God through the Urim and the Thummim was sufficient, and there was no need for God to speak through the prophets.</p>
<p>David was at his best in his function as a king when he wore an ephod of a priest to receive the Ark. In this instance the offices of the priesthood and the kingship were combined in David (6:14). David was a king, but at the same time he was acting as a priest. He was a royal priest. Before these two offices were combined in the Lord Jesus as the counsel of peace, they were combined in David, who was a type of the Lord Jesus. God did not condemn David for wearing an ephod, because this was normal in His eyes. When the condition of David was normal, he was also a priest; knowing God&rsquo;s will did not require a prophet, because the priests had the Urim and the Thummim. The prophethood was raised up only because there was desolation in the priesthood and the kingship.</p>
<p>In regard to the prophethood, however, we must be clear that there is a difference between prophets sent by God and those who proclaim themselves to be prophets, that is, those whose &ldquo;prophethood&rdquo; comes from man. Elijah and Elisha were prophets sent by God, but there were others who were not really prophets, who were prophets only according to man. In the early church there surely were prophets sent by God who bore God&rsquo;s authority. However, the church has become so desolate today because there is a lack of service related to the priesthood and the kingship. For the most part, there are only prophets&mdash;some who have been sent by God but many who have only proclaimed themselves to be prophets. In today&rsquo;s Christianity it is as if there are no priests and kings, no temple and altar; there are only prophets. Among these prophets, only a small number have been sent by God.</p>
<p>When the condition of the priesthood and the kingship was normal, the most prominent item among God&rsquo;s people was the temple. However, when the prophets were ministering, the temple was in complete desolation. The fact that people today do not like to talk about the church is a proof that the temple, the priesthood, and the kingship have become desolate. Where can we find the temple when there is no priesthood? The priesthood and the temple cannot be separated. Today the priesthood has become fallen and desolate, and although the prophethood is functioning, the temple has been abandoned. Some &ldquo;prophets&rdquo; think that it is sufficient to have only the ministry of the word, because they are rendering help to others. They do not see that this speaks of a situation of desolation. Many people can see the preciousness of the prophethood but not the situation of desolation that brought forth a need for the prophethood. Consequently, many want to be prophets, and even schools have been established to mass produce prophets. We have been affected by this because some among us aspire only to be ministers of the word.</p>
<p>On one hand, we treasure that God has raised up ministers of the word in this age of desolation, but on the other hand, we are grieved, because ministers of the word are raised up only when there is a lack of priests. Elijah and Elisha sounded out a cry because there was a lack of the service in the temple. I believe that God&rsquo;s only intention today is to recover the priesthood. God does not want to tear down those who are ministers of the word; however, a minister of the word should also be a priest. Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Zechariah, the prophets who participated in the recovery of the building of the temple and who brought God&rsquo;s people out of desolation, were also priests. Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Zechariah were related either directly or indirectly to the recovery of God&rsquo;s building. Jeremiah prophesied that the Israelites would return from the land of captivity after a period of seventy years. Ezekiel prophesied of a recovered situation when he was in the land of captivity, and Zechariah strengthened the people&rsquo;s hands to recover God&rsquo;s temple and God&rsquo;s building. These prophets were priests. I hope that every minister of the word today would also be a priest.</p>
<p>We cannot be content with the situation in today&rsquo;s Christianity. We cannot be content that only the prophethood is functioning in the church by giving messages. We should not uplift the ministers of the word. We must share God&rsquo;s feeling. Our heart should grieve that there is a need for strong ministers of the word. Although we should be thankful that God has given us ministers of the word in these times of desolation, we should see that this is not a normal situation. If we read the Bible, we will realize that God&rsquo;s people are in a desolate situation when there are many prophets. If God&rsquo;s people were not in a desolate condition, there would not be much need for ministers of the word.</p>
<p>Some may refer to 1 Corinthians 14:4, which says, &ldquo;He who prophesies builds up the church.&rdquo; Paul, however, spoke this word because the church was in a childish condition, and there was a need for prophets. If the church had not been so childish, there would not have been such a strong need. Paul also spoke of prophets building up the church, because the Corinthians were paying too much attention to miraculous gifts. For this reason the apostle said that if they desired to pursue gifts, they should pursue the excelling gift of prophesying, of speaking for God, rather than the gifts of speaking in tongues or healing. The most profitable gift that God gives for the building up of the church is prophesying (v. 1), but in a normal situation, the building up of the church is accomplished through the priesthood.</p>
<p>I hope that this light is clear among us. We need a change in our concept in order to not follow the direction that is being taken in Christianity. We should not place so much emphasis on having a small number of saints who can carry out the ministry of the word. We must see the importance of being priests. We need to be personally recovered to the priesthood, and we should help God&rsquo;s children to be recovered to the priesthood. We should lead God&rsquo;s children to live a life in the Holy of Holies so that we can have the reality of the building up of the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO CARRY OUT<br />
THE PRIESTLY SERVICE</h1>
<p>Only those who serve as priests can be mingled with God, transformed, and built up in the flow of the divine life to be God&rsquo;s eternal dwelling place. The riches of God flow through such believers and are expressed through them. Those who serve as priests have the image of God, and they represent Him in His authority. The priests are the only group of persons who can accomplish the desire of God&rsquo;s heart and fulfill His plan. The persons who are useful in God&rsquo;s plan are those who serve as priests. Now we will consider the way to live as a priest, that is, the way to carry out the priestly service.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING IN THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2>
<p>God is on the throne of grace (Heb. 4:16), and the throne of grace is equivalent to the expiation cover of the Ark in the Holy of Holies (Exo. 25:17). The Holy of Holies is the most sanctified place. It is separated fully unto God. It is the only place that is absolutely and solely for God. This point is clear in Old Testament typology. In the Holy of Holies in the tabernacle, there was only God on the throne of grace. Nearly every place in the universe has something other than God. There is not another place that is absolutely and solely for God and does not have anything other than Him. Hence, the Holy of Holies is the most holy place. God is in the most holy place.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR REGENERATED SPIRIT BEING<br />
THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2>
<p>The Holy of Holies refers to God&rsquo;s habitation in heaven, which is the holiest place in the universe, and also to the regenerated human spirit. Hebrews 10:19-20, which speaks of the Holy of Holies, undoubtedly refers to our human spirit. These verses say that we have boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies. The tone of these verses indicates that it is easy for us to enter the Holy of Holies at any time and in any place. This must refer to our spirit as the Holy of Holies. If the Holy of Holies were only in heaven, we would not be able to enter into it today.</p>
<p>God is Spirit (John 4:24). This is a mystery. Some believers might ask, &ldquo;How can God be in the Holy of Holies in heaven and at the same time be in the Holy of Holies in our spirit?&rdquo; With God there is not a problem with time or space. Our comprehension is limited by time and space because we are humans, but God does not have such a problem.</p>
<p>According to God&rsquo;s ordination and arrangement, our spirit can contain only Him; our spirit cannot contain anything other than God. Our body and our soul can be occupied with many things, but our spirit is useful only to God. Our regenerated spirit is the most sanctified place in the universe. When God enters into us, He makes our spirit His habitation and dwells in our spirit. Hence, our spirit is the Holy of Holies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BLOOD AND THE SPLIT VEIL ENABLING US<br />
TO ENTER INTO THE HOLY OF HOLIES</h2>
<p>How can we enter into the Holy of Holies, that is, our spirit, to approach God? According to Hebrews 10:19-20, God has accomplished two things so that we may enter into the Holy of Holies with boldness. First, the Lord Jesus shed His blood for us. Through His blood we have boldness to enter into the Holy of Holies (v. 19). In the beginning man was without sin and lived before God and fellowshipped with God in the garden of Eden. The tree of life, which signifies God, was also in the garden, indicating that man could contact God freely (Gen. 2:9). When man fell, the way to the tree of life immediately began to be guarded by the cherubim and a flaming sword that turned in every direction (3:24). This prevented sinful man from contacting the tree of life. The cherubim signify God&rsquo;s glory (Ezek. 9:3; Heb. 9:5), the flame signifies God&rsquo;s holiness (Deut. 4:24; Heb. 12:29), and the sword indicates God&rsquo;s righteousness (cf. Lam. 3:42-43; Rom. 2:5). This means that God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness prevent sinful man from contacting God. Sinful man cannot draw near to God or fellowship with God.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus died on the cross and shed His blood in order to satisfy the requirements of God&rsquo;s glory, holiness, and righteousness. Furthermore, His resurrection is proof that God was satisfied. Hence, wherever the Lord&rsquo;s blood is sprinkled, God&rsquo;s requirements are satisfied. Now sinners can approach God and contact Him with boldness through the blood of the Lord Jesus (Heb. 10:22).</p>
<p>Second, the Lord Jesus split the veil to the Holy of Holies, thus opening a new and living way so that we may pass through the veil and enter into the Holy of Holies (Matt. 27:50-51; Heb. 10:20). Not only do our sins prevent us from drawing near to God, but our fallen human nature, which the Bible refers to as the flesh, also prevents us from contacting God (Gen. 6:3). According to typology, the flesh, that is, the natural man, is a veil between God and man (Exo. 26:33; Heb. 10:20), which separates man from God and thus prevents man from contacting God. If this veil were not split, no one could enter into the Holy of Holies and contact God.</p>
<p>We thank God that the Lord Jesus died on the cross. Not only did He bear our sins and remove the barrier of sin, but He also put the flesh to death on the cross. When He died, the veil in the temple was split in two from top to bottom. This signifies that our fallen man was terminated on the cross. When the veil was split, the Lord opened a new and living way. Now there is no veil to separate man from God. Those who are joined to the Lord not only have the Lord&rsquo;s blood sprinkled on them; they also have His death on the cross applied to them. Under the sprinkling of His blood we can draw near to God. In His death we are delivered from the old creation and are no longer separated from God. On the one hand, we have the boldness to draw near to God, and on the other hand, we can come forward to God unhindered.</p><h2 class="head1">TURNING TO OUR SPIRIT TO CONTACT GOD</h2>
<p>There is only one way to contact God, which is to turn to our spirit. People in the world cannot understand this, but we should be very clear about this. God has accomplished redemption, and our spirit is His dwelling place, the Holy of Holies with the throne of grace. The only way to contact God is to turn to our spirit. We must enter the Holy of Holies, that is, turn to our spirit, in order to fellowship with God.</p>
<p>In the world people use their minds to consider God and analyze Him. They attempt to use a part of their soul to contact God. The soul cannot contact God. Some Christians long for a physical feeling when they enter God&rsquo;s presence. This is a mistake. We must realize that God is Spirit and that the Lord is the Spirit (John 4:24; 2 Cor. 3:17). God does not dwell in our body or in our soul but in our spirit.</p>
<p>This mystery of mysteries surpasses our comprehension. God is infinite and great, and man is finite and small. But the infinite and great God desires to dwell in the finite and small man. This is almost incomprehensible and even impossible. But according to our experience, this is an undeniable fact: God dwells in our spirit. For this reason, whenever and wherever we would like to contact Him, we need only to turn to our spirit.</p>
<p>Entering into the Holy of Holies (Heb. 10:19) and coming forward to the throne of grace (4:16) both refer to turning to our spirit. When we turn to our spirit, we enter into the Holy of Holies and touch the throne of grace. Some believers have been saved for many years, but they do not know that the Holy of Holies is in their spirit and that the throne of grace is also in their spirit. If we desire to carry out the priestly service, receive grace, accomplish God&rsquo;s plan, and complete His building, we must enter the Holy of Holies in our spirit and touch the throne of grace. This is the only way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING IN SPIRIT TO RECEIVE GOD</h2>
<p>When we turn to our spirit and touch the throne of grace, we are praying in a genuine way. Turning to our spirit and praying are the same thing; they cannot be separated. If we do not pray, we will not turn to our spirit, and if we do not turn to our spirit, we will not have genuine prayer. When we say that we should turn to our spirit, the emphasis is on prayer. Praying is not a matter of using our mind to remember certain matters. Prayer involves utterances that express the sense in our spirit. Sometimes we sense something within, but we cannot find the utterance to express it. It seems as if human words are inadequate. At such times, we can groan (Rom. 8:26). Whether we use words to express the sense in our spirit or we groan, God can flow through us.</p>
<p>Sometimes God will lead us to petition for certain things. However, the purpose of our prayer is not merely to obtain things but to obtain God. Obtaining God far exceeds obtaining outward things. The fact that God grants us the things that we need can only be regarded as a supplementary result. Hence, the focus of our prayer should not be on things to receive but on God Himself, even though He often gives us what we need when He gives Himself to us. Unbelievers do not see this. They think that believers pray in order to ask God for things. Every believer should be clear that the emphasis of prayer is to let God flow through his spirit and to be anointed with God so that He becomes his enjoyment, supply, and timely help.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING MERCY AND<br />
FINDING GRACE FOR TIMELY HELP</h2>
<p>When we pray in our spirit, God will flow through us. Hebrews 4:16 speaks of receiving mercy and finding grace. Mercy and grace are God. Mercy indicates that we are not worthy to receive God; hence, He reaches us as mercy and places us in a situation that qualifies us to receive Him as grace. To give a beggar one dollar is mercy, but to give a dollar to one&rsquo;s child is grace. Since we are not worthy to receive God, He gives us mercy, and then, when we are in a situation that matches Him, He takes a further step and gives us grace.</p>
<p>Mercy and grace in Hebrews 4 are the river of water of life that flows out of the throne in Revelation 22:1. In referring to the same thing, Hebrews uses plain words, and Revelation uses signs. These two portions show that mercy and grace are God Himself flowing out from the throne as the river of water of life for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:19-20 says that by the blood we have boldness to enter through the veil into the Holy of Holies. The blood and the split veil both speak of the work of redemption accomplished by Christ on the cross. The river of water of life flows out from the throne of God and of the Lamb. The Lamb is for redemption. The work accomplished by the Lamb includes the shedding of blood and the splitting of the veil, which enables God to flow out as the water of life (John 19:34). Without redemption, God cannot flow out as the water of life for our enjoyment; He cannot reach us as mercy and grace. God is in the Lamb; hence, we can contact Him, and He can flow out freely as the water of life. He can reach us as mercy and grace for our enjoyment and timely help.</p>
<p>When we draw near to God with our needs, He will flow through us and give us mercy and grace, which then become our timely help. We have all experienced this. For example, a brother may be under pressure, but when he contacts God, the Spirit moves within him, and immediately he feels released. Another brother may be unable to handle his situation, but when he contacts God, he is strengthened inwardly. A sister may sense that she is in darkness and that there is no way for her to go on, but when she contacts God, she is enlightened and has a way to go on. Some saints suffer afflictions or are misunderstood, but when they fellowship with God and contact Him, their situation no longer bothers them. These are examples of receiving timely help.</p>
<p>The timely help that God gives us will not necessarily change our outward environment or solve our problems. Sometimes our environment may become even worse, or our problems may increase. As long as we contact God, He will supply us so that we may overcome in our environment; this is the timely help that we receive from God. A car that is having difficulty going up a steep hill does not need the hill to be leveled. The car needs more power. God may not let us always take a way that is smooth and straight. He often allows us to take a way that is crooked and difficult. Sometimes we may find ourselves climbing a high mountain, and other times we may be going into a deep valley. Nevertheless, if we keep ourselves in fellowship with God, His mercy and grace will flow through us like living water to be our supply and timely help for us to deal with any situation.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYER BEING NECESSARY FOR RECEIVING GRACE</h2>
<p>In order to receive God as grace, we must draw near to God through prayer. Prayer has a special place in spiritual matters. It cannot be replaced by listening to messages or by reading the Bible or spiritual books. It cannot even be replaced by fellowshipping with other saints. The only way to contact God is to turn to our spirit and pray. This is an ironclad law. If we do not practice this, we will not receive grace. A person who desires to be healthy must eat and drink properly; there is no other way to be healthy. God lives in His believers; hence, if we want to receive mercy and grace, we must contact Him through prayer.</p>
<p>It is possible for some saints to go through a whole day without praying. Some saints do not pray for weeks, months, or even a year. What is the benefit of listening to messages if one does not pray? Some saints pray, but they do not get past their soul; they do not touch their spirit. Such prayers do not have much value.</p>
<p>I would like to ask, how much time do we spend fellowshipping with God? In order for an electric iron to be hot, the switch must be turned on to allow electricity to flow. Are we hot, or are we cold? If we are not hot, we have not let God, our spiritual electricity, flow through us. Contacting God through prayer can be compared to turning on the switch that lets Him flow freely through us. Only in this way can we be burning in spirit.</p>
<p>We must see the importance of prayer: it enables us to contact God and receive Him. Reading the Bible, listening to messages, and fellowshipping are but means that turn us to pray in order to contact God with our spirit. Hence, we should pray whenever we read the Bible, listen to messages, read spiritual books, or fellowship with other saints.</p>
<p>It is regrettable that this is not our practice. Many saints are touched when they hear a message, but they do not pray; hence, the inspiration disappears. Some saints are touched when they read the Bible, but the inspiration is forgotten because they do not pray. Sometimes a saint is inspired through fellowship with others, but the inspiration leaves because he does not pray afterward. These examples show the issue of our lack of prayer.</p>
<p>Christians do not pray enough, and many of those who pray do not know how to turn to their spirit. Their prayers are routine and do not touch the Spirit. After a message meeting, for example, everyone rushes home, because we are not used to exercising our spirit in prayer. Hence, we do not touch God.</p>
<p>The prayer meeting has the lowest attendance. Many saints do not know the importance of prayer. They consider prayer to be tedious and tasteless. Furthermore, even though a larger number of saints attend the bread-breaking meeting, only a few open their mouths to pray and praise; the rest are silent. Some saints attend every bread-breaking meeting, but they never pray. This is our situation. We cannot deny how poor and weak we are in the matter of prayer.</p>
<p>We are short of God&rsquo;s grace, the work does not spread, the church is not being built up, there is not much growth in life, and there is no coordination, because our prayers are inadequate. This situation can be likened to building a house with cement but not having any water. A person may have all the necessary materials, such as cement, sand, and gravel, but without water the materials cannot be mixed together. This is our situation. The saints love the Lord but lack the mingling in spirit and the flow of the water of life; hence, they are not built up. The reason for this situation is that we are short of prayer. From this time onward, we must focus more on prayer.</p>
<p>After a message is given, we will gather in small groups so that we can spend some time in prayer. In the small groups we will not focus on testing our knowledge. Our desire is to enliven the saints by leading them to use their spirit to pray and thus fulfill their priestly function. Most of the saints know doctrine, but we need to enter into the Holy of Holies, that is, to draw near to God in our spirit. This is not a matter of understanding or speaking doctrines. It is entirely a matter of exercising our spirit to pray.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING OF GOD&rsquo;S DWELLING PLACE<br />
AND THE PRACTICE<br />
OF THE PRIESTLY MINISTRY<br />
IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Zech. 6:12-13; 1 Pet. 2:4-5, 9; Gen. 1:26; Rom. 8:29; Exo. 19:6; Rev. 1:6</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF GOD&rsquo;S DWELLING PLACE</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Building of God&rsquo;s Dwelling Place<br />
Needing the Priesthood and the Kingship</h2>
<p>Zechariah 6:12-13 contains a prophecy concerning the Lord Jesus: &ldquo;Thus speaks Jehovah of hosts, saying, Here is a man, whose name is the Shoot; and he will shoot forth from his place and will build the temple of Jehovah. Indeed, it is he who will build the temple of Jehovah; and he will bear majesty and will sit and rule on his throne; and he will be a priest on his throne; and the counsel of peace will be between the two of them.&rdquo; This portion contains two significant points. First, a man whose name is the Shoot will build the temple of Jehovah. This man refers to the Lord Jesus, who is the righteous Shoot of David (Jer. 23:5). Second, the builder of this temple is a priest yet a king, a king yet a priest. In the Old Testament the priests were one group, and the kings were another group. However, the Lord Jesus is the counsel of peace between the offices of the kingship and the priesthood. This means that these two offices have been combined as one in Him.</p>
<p>First Peter 2:4-5 says, &ldquo;Coming to Him, a living stone,...you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ,&rdquo; and verse 9 says, &ldquo;You are a chosen race, a royal priesthood, a holy nation.&rdquo; These verses show that the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place is related to the priesthood and the kingship. We are living stones, and we are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood. The church as God&rsquo;s dwelling place is built up with living stones, and this dwelling place is a priesthood. According to verse 5, the priesthood is holy, and according to verse 9, the priesthood is royal.</p>
<p>There is a common element in 1 Peter 2:4-5 and Zechariah 6:13. Both books speak of the building of God&rsquo;s temple, both speak of the relationship between the priests and the building of God&rsquo;s temple, and both speak of the priesthood as having a royal aspect. The Lord Jesus, as the Priest who is building up the temple of Jehovah, is on &ldquo;his throne&rdquo;; He is both Priest and King. The believers, as living stones who are being built up as God&rsquo;s dwelling place, are a &ldquo;royal priesthood&rdquo;; we are both priests and kings. The priesthood and the kingship are indispensable factors in the building up of God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Priesthood and the Kingship<br />
Representing God&rsquo;s Image and Authority</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s thought and desire can be seen in these verses. When a person writes a poem, there is always a thought and desire that are expressed through words. A good reader will not only read the words of the poem but also touch the inner feeling, thought, and desire of the writer. This is the way that we should read the Bible. The Bible is God&rsquo;s revelation, and His desire, thought, and feeling are hidden within the words of the Bible. As we read the Bible, we must touch God&rsquo;s desire and feeling.</p>
<p>In order to understand the relationship between the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place and the royal priesthood, we need to consider God&rsquo;s intention when He created man. God created man in His image and according to His likeness so that man could express and represent Him (Gen. 1:26). Expression is a matter of life and image, and representation is a matter of authority. God created man because He had a desire to enter into man as life, to constitute Himself into man, and to be mingled as one with man. Consequently, when God created man in His image, He created man with a human spirit so that man could receive God (Zech. 12:1), who is Spirit (John 4:24), and be mingled with God in spirit until man&rsquo;s whole being is thoroughly saturated with God (Rom. 8:16). When God&rsquo;s life enters into us and saturates us, we spontaneously express God&rsquo;s image and glory in all things. This is God&rsquo;s desire and thought in creating man.</p>
<p>Romans 8:29 says, &ldquo;Those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son, that He might be the Firstborn among many brothers.&rdquo; This shows that God intends to conform us to the image of His Son; that is, He will work on us until we are the same as His Son. As the Son of His love, Colossians 1:15 speaks of Christ as being &ldquo;the image of the invisible God.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus is the image of God. Hence, when we are conformed to the image of God&rsquo;s Son, we have God&rsquo;s image and become God&rsquo;s expression. Inwardly we have His life, and outwardly we bear His image for His expression and glory. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s authority is entrusted to those who bear God&rsquo;s image. Of all God&rsquo;s creatures, only man has the capacity to bear God&rsquo;s image and be entrusted to represent God&rsquo;s authority. God&rsquo;s authority and life are connected because His life enables man to receive God and His authority enables man to represent God.</p>
<p>At the end of the Bible the New Jerusalem signifies a corporate man. This corporate man expresses God&rsquo;s image and reigns with God, fulfilling God&rsquo;s desire for man to express His image and represent His authority. If we see God&rsquo;s desire, we will understand His desire for us to be priests and kings, because priests fellowship with God, bring people to God, and bring God into people, whereas kings exercise God&rsquo;s authority to rule for God.</p><h2 class="head2">Priests Being Related to God&rsquo;s Building</h2>
<p>Although the Bible does not explicitly say that Moses was a priest, Moses served as a priest. Moses was with God for forty days (Exo. 24:18), and when he came out from God&rsquo;s presence, the children of Israel could not gaze on his face, because it was full of God&rsquo;s glory (34:29-30; 2 Cor. 3:7). Moses was a priest because he contacted God, received God, and let God flow through his inner being. Moses was God&rsquo;s deputy authority as well because he was faithful in God&rsquo;s house (Heb. 3:2). A priest draws near to God, contacts God, and lets God saturate him in his fellowship with God, and a king comes out from God&rsquo;s presence and represents God&rsquo;s authority. Being a priest and a king involve expressing God&rsquo;s image and receiving God&rsquo;s authority to represent God.</p>
<p>From its beginning to its end, the Bible speaks of God&rsquo;s desire to gain priests and kings. When He created man, God intended to gain a people who would serve as priests and kings. Regrettably, the God-created man, Adam, failed. Later, however, Noah, Abraham, and Jacob drew near to God and offered sacrifices to Him (Gen. 6:8-9; 8:20; 12:1, 7-8; 18:16-33; 28:10-22). In Exodus 19:6 God spoke of His desire for the chosen descendants of Abraham, the children of Israel, to be a &ldquo;kingdom of priests.&rdquo; <em>Kingdom</em> speaks of kingly authority. God&rsquo;s original desire was that all the Israelites would be priests, a group of people who would draw near to Him, would be saturated with Him, and could be entrusted with His authority. When the Israelites failed at Mount Sinai (ch. 32), God chose the tribe of Levi from among them to replace the Israelites as a whole (vv. 28-29). Subsequently, the priests lived before God, drew near to God, and let God flow through them so that His intention could be revealed through the Urim and the Thummim (28:30).</p>
<p>The situation at that time, however, was not fully according to God&rsquo;s intention, because God&rsquo;s authority was represented by a separate office&mdash;the kingship. When Aaron passed away, he was succeeded by his son, Eleazar, and when Moses died, Joshua assumed the leadership. Joshua represented the office related to God&rsquo;s authority, the kingship, whereas Eleazar represented the office related to God&rsquo;s image, the priesthood. Nevertheless, Joshua and Eleazar shared in the work of dividing the good land among the Israelites (Josh. 17:4; 19:51). This shows that the kingship depends on the priesthood; without the priesthood, there is no kingship. Those who do not express God&rsquo;s life cannot represent God&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p>When the priesthood became desolate, God raised up a new priest, Samuel (1 Sam. 2), and Samuel anointed David to be the king of Israel (16:13). Hence, the priesthood brought in the kingship. When David&rsquo;s condition was proper, he treated matters related to the Ark of God according to the priesthood. When he received the Ark into the city of David, he commanded the priests to serve before the Ark, and he even put on the priestly ephod, the priestly robe. David was not a priest, but when he stood before the Ark of God, he was girded with an ephod (2 Sam. 6:12-15). On this occasion, he was a person with both the kingship and the priesthood. He also restored and strengthened the priestly service through his division of the services of the priests and his establishment of the service of song among the priests, arranging them into twenty-four divisions (1 Chron. 6:31-32).</p>
<p>The priesthood and the kingship are involved whenever the Bible speaks of the building of the holy temple, God&rsquo;s habitation. For example, when King Solomon completed the building of the temple, he devoted attention to the service of the priests before God (2 Chron. 8:14-15), just as his father David had done. This shows that the building of the temple is always related to priestly service and kingly authority. God wants to gain those who fellowship with Him, live before Him, and allow Him to flow through and saturate them. Such ones can express Him, be entrusted with His authority, and build up His dwelling place.</p>
<p>At the time of Chronicles, the kings of Israel were in a fallen condition, and the priests were in a desolate condition. During this time evil kings, such as Ahab, did not represent God&rsquo;s authority, and the priestly service ceased to function. As a consequence, prophets, such as Elijah and Elisha, became prominent (1 Kings 16&mdash;22; 2 Kings 1&mdash;8). At the end of the Old Testament, the book of Zechariah shows that the building of God&rsquo;s temple still depends upon priests and kings. Zechariah prophesied that the Lord Jesus would be both Priest and King, One who would fellowship with God, be saturated with God, and have God&rsquo;s authority. The Lord was the Shoot raised up to build God&rsquo;s temple (6:12-13).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus came, He was focused on the temple as the great desire of God&rsquo;s heart. The four Gospels often speak of Him in relation to the temple. When He was twelve years old, He went to Jerusalem and stayed in the temple to be in the things of God (Luke 2:49). At the beginning of the Gospel of John, His zeal for God&rsquo;s house is portrayed by His cleansing of the temple by driving the moneychangers out of the temple (2:15-17). When the Jews asked Him for a sign, He spoke of rebuilding the temple of His body through death and resurrection (vv. 18-22). The Gospel of Matthew also refers to the Lord&rsquo;s cleansing of the temple, which occurred chronologically at the end of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry prior to His death and resurrection (21:12-16). The reference to the Lord&rsquo;s cleansing of the temple at the beginning of the Gospel of John and at the end of the Gospel of Matthew shows that Christ was continually focused on the temple. Even when Peter received the revelation that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord unveiled the building of the church on the rock that was Christ Himself and the revelation concerning Christ (16:18).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, as both Priest and King (Zech. 6:13), is a rock. First Peter 2:4 speaks of Christ as being a living stone as well as the cornerstone who was rejected by the Jews but chosen by God. At the same time, those who have been regenerated with His life are spoken of as being &ldquo;living stones&rdquo; (v. 5). Since He, as a living stone, is a royal Priest, we, who are also living stones, should also be royal priests. When we are built together, we become a priesthood, even a royal priesthood. This royal priesthood is not related to individuals but to one corporate Body, which is the building. Only a corporate group of priests and kings can accomplish God&rsquo;s building work. We must be royal priests, those who live before God, in order to express and represent Him.</p><h2 class="head2">All God&rsquo;s Children Needing to Be Priests</h2>
<p>From the beginning, God&rsquo;s desire has been to gain a group of people who are both priests and kings. He has a need for prophets only as a remedial measure when there is desolation in the priesthood and kingship. There are prophets in both the Old and New Testaments, but in the kingdom age and in the new heaven and the new earth in eternity, prophecies will be rendered useless. First Corinthians 13:8 says, &ldquo;Whether prophecies, they will be rendered useless; or tongues, they will cease.&rdquo; Both prophecies and tongues will pass away, but the priesthood and the kingship will exist forever (Rev. 22:3, 5). In the Old Testament age, the ministry of the prophets was strong when God&rsquo;s people were in a poor condition. If the ministry of the word is being manifested in the church in the New Testament age, it is because most of the brothers and sisters are in a downward condition. This is not a normal situation. If every child of God is functioning as a priest, the service of the priesthood will be strong and normal, and the ministry of the word will not be as prominent in the church.</p>
<p>I hope that we will clearly see God&rsquo;s intention for His chosen and redeemed people to be priests with His image and kings with His authority. Our concepts, however, are often contrary to God&rsquo;s intention, and we have neglected the matter of the universal priesthood. In Christianity today, most people pay attention only to the ministry of the word. For this reason, in most meetings Christian messages are given by designated persons who speak and pray as &ldquo;priests.&rdquo; This is an abnormal situation.</p>
<p>In these days God is leading us to establish the testimony of the church, and He is also leading us to see the need to build up the church. Hence, the priesthood must be recovered among us. Furthermore, this recovery should involve more than just a small number of saints; instead, all the saints must rise up to receive grace and exercise to function as priests. We should contact God not only individually but also corporately. Our meetings should be meetings of priests; we all should be ministering and serving before God as priests. Such a service is according to the Bible, and it reflects the initial condition of the church during the time of the apostles. In the early church, the believers did not come together to listen to one person&rsquo;s speaking. According to 1 Corinthians 14, all the saints exercised their spirits in the meetings of the church. Some exercised to pray, some exercised to speak for God, some exercised to sing to God, and some exercised to interpret tongues or to speak a word of wisdom or a word of knowledge (v. 26; 12:8, 10). Instead of sitting and listening to a message, the saints functioned as priests before God.</p>
<p>It is common for believers not to function because the church has become more degraded and more desolate. Many believers are accustomed to just sitting and listening to a message. It seems as if the ministry of the word is prevailing, while the priesthood is greatly lacking. This does not mean that I oppose the matter of ministering the word; instead, I desire that every saint would be a priest. In every gathering the spirits of the saints should be living and strong. This is the normal way; it is also God&rsquo;s way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE PRIESTLY MINISTRY<br />
IN THE MEETINGS OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Abolishing the Lord&rsquo;s Day Message Meeting<br />
and Taking the Way of Pursuing in Small Groups</h2>
<p>After much prayer and fellowship, many elders feel that the meetings of the church should not depend just upon one man&rsquo;s speaking; rather, our meetings should be a gathering of priests who serve God together. Therefore, beginning with the last Lord&rsquo;s Day in March, we will drop the Lord&rsquo;s Day message meeting. This does not mean that we will no longer have ministry message meetings; we will still have meetings to minister the word of God, especially when there is a need for leading in a certain matter. Such meetings will relate to specific and timely needs. For our regular meetings, however, we will no longer have message meetings, as we have in the past. We must drop the concept of a &ldquo;worship service,&rdquo; which has been passed down from Christianity. Instead, our meetings must become meetings in which everyone is a worshipping priest who burns incense, lights the lamps, sings, and ministers before God.</p>
<p>This decision is based on several factors. It has been more than a decade since we began the work in Taiwan in 1949. During this time, many people have been saved and raised up by the Lord. In the first few years, we did not feel that there was a problem with the way we met. However, by 1954, when a large number of people were saved and had received some edification, we discovered some problems. For example, when all the saints would come together to listen to the same message, the more experienced ones did not receive much help, because they had heard similar messages in the past. However, new believers had difficulty understanding the message because the speaker was trying to speak to &ldquo;elementary students&rdquo; and &ldquo;college students&rdquo; at the same time. As a result, the more experienced saints did not progress, and the new believers did not receive much benefit. When a meeting cannot meet the practical needs of the saints, new ones fall behind and leave, and other saints do not progress.</p>
<p>After considering this situation before the Lord, we feel that we must adopt a way that involves some principles of education. Although messages are needed to edify the saints and supply them in their spirit, the messages still need to have an instructional element. Since instruction always involves education, we are considering dividing the saints into &ldquo;classes.&rdquo; We have been in Taiwan for more than a decade. If we had followed the principles of our educational system, we should have a college-level understanding of the truth. However, many brothers and sisters who have been among us since 1949 can still be considered as being &ldquo;elementary&rdquo; students. Even though they love the Lord fervently, pursue Him, and attend the meetings, they are not able to speak something substantial. Thus, we need to consider how to lead the saints according to their spiritual condition.</p>
<p>Although we do not have absolute assurance that this new arrangement will work, we should try. First, we can simply divide the brothers and sisters into two levels&mdash;those who have more spiritual experience in matters such as being consecrated to the Lord, fellowshipping with Him, and understanding basic items of the truth, and those who are newer in their experience of salvation.</p><h2 class="head2">Emphasizing Truth and Life</h2>
<p>Each of these groups should focus on gaining knowledge of the truth and growing in life. I hope that the church will have these kinds of meetings twice a week, one on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning and the other during the week. The Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting should focus on life, whereas the meeting during the week should focus on truth.</p>
<p>In regard to life, we should lead the saints to know how God&rsquo;s life, which is in the Son, becomes our life practically when the Holy Spirit indwells us. We need to help the saints to know how the Triune God becomes our life, and we should help them learn to live in the fellowship of this life and according to the sense and light of this life. We must begin with these points in order to lead the saints to grow in life.</p>
<p>In regard to truth, we should lead the saints to know four main items: Christ, redemption, life, and the church. Concerning Christ, we must help the saints to see who Christ is according to the Bible. We can begin with Christ being the eternal God; that is, we should speak on God&rsquo;s divine, eternal nature. But we must go on to speak of His incarnation, human living, death on the cross, resurrection from the dead as the life-giving Spirit, ascension into heaven, descension as the Spirit of reality, and status in eternity future. The saints have only a fragmentary understanding of these matters; they have not received a fundamental and systematic teaching related to them.</p>
<p>Modern education involves a system. Mathematics instructors follow a progressive curriculum that begins in elementary school and finishes in graduate school. When a person receives instruction through such a system, he is able to learn the full content of the mathematical discipline in an orderly way. Without systematic instruction, however, a person can study for twenty years yet learn very little. Our situation speaks of this kind of failure. We have given many messages for twelve years, but many of the saints do not know the truth concerning Christ, because our leading has not been systematic. In order to help the saints to go forward, we must systematically lead the saints, step by step, to know the truth concerning Christ, redemption, life, and the church.</p>
<p>Strictly speaking, these four main points are the center of the Bible. The Bible speaks of how Christ came to accomplish redemption so that we can receive God as life and be built up together in life to produce the church. These four points are connected. The Bible is centered on these four points. All the other points are supplementary. If we can provide the saints with a thorough understanding of these four points, it will be easy for them to understand other points.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Preparing Practically and Exercising</h2>
<p>We should use the same subjects in both &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; using less material with the newer saints and more material with those at a more advanced level. This can be compared to teaching first graders to add single digits, but teaching second graders to add double digits. Thus, the saints who are more advanced can be given eight or ten verses on the matter of consecration, but newer ones should be given a general sketch of consecration based on only three or four verses. Hence, although the subject can be the same, the instruction, leading, and material should be different.</p>
<p>Presently, we may not be able to do this. However, we should at least have some feeling related to this need. We must lead the saints to exercise so that they can carry out their priestly service before God, learning not only how to pray to God individually but also how to carry out the priestly service corporately with all the saints. Hence, we will begin to change the Lord&rsquo;s Day meeting. Before we begin, however, we need to have adequate preparation. This is a huge task, and the elders and responsible ones should join together to do it.</p>
<p>In addition, we should lead the saints to pray, not merely individually but with all the saints as priests ministering and serving together in prayer. In the meetings we can lead the saints to exercise to sing, to burn the incense, and to light the lamps. To sing is to exercise to sing hymns. To burn incense is to exercise to pray. When we come together, we should pray; we should open our mouths and exercise to have strong spirits. To light the lamps is to exercise to receive light from the Lord&rsquo;s Word. For example, we can pray-read 1 Peter 2:5 and the related verses in Zechariah 6. We should abandon the practice of one person giving a message. Instead, we should fellowship with one another and bring out what we have gained from the Lord. Some saints may help and perfect others, while other saints may receive the help and the perfecting. Those who receive the help and the perfecting can then render help to others. In this way, all the saints will serve in the meeting, and the function of the saints will be manifested in the meeting.</p>
<p>This is only a general outline; we still need to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading step by step regarding the details. The purpose of this change is not to establish some new rules but to deliver us from meetings that hinder the leading of the Holy Spirit. We should not be like Christianity, which neglects the remembrance of the Lord and the worship of the Father in the bread-breaking meeting and which relies on an outward Sunday worship service. We must exercise to be in spirit in the bread-breaking meeting in order to have real remembrance of the Lord and genuine worship of God.</p>
<p>I also hope that we can have a mutual fellowship in spirit when we come together for prayer, learning to use our spirit to pray freely before the Lord and to have more blending in spirit through prayer. This will allow the Holy Spirit to lead and operate more freely among us. I hope that we will pray before the Lord concerning this matter. We are doing this so that all the saints may exercise to walk, step by step, according to the leading of the Holy Spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LIVING THE PRIESTLY LIFE<br />
BY EXERCISING THE SPIRIT TO SING AND PRAY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:18-19; 6:18</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLES&rsquo; LIVING BEING<br />
FILLED WITH SINGING AND PRAYING</h2>
<p>When the apostle Paul spoke of the Christian life in the book of Ephesians, he specifically mentioned singing hymns and praying (5:18-19; 6:18). Both of these matters are related to our spirit. In order to sing hymns of praise to God, we need to &ldquo;be filled in spirit,&rdquo; and when we pray, we need to pray &ldquo;every time in spirit.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s writing was based on personal experience, and the book of Acts shows how the apostles lived. On one hand, they sang hymns of praise to God (2:47; 16:25), and on the other hand, they prayed (1:24; 6:4; 9:40; 10:9; 13:3; 14:23; 16:25). This is how they lived in ordinary circumstances and in difficult circumstances. When Paul and Silas were in prison, they sang hymns of praise to God; their singing resulted in a great earthquake that opened the prison doors (16:19-26). When they encountered problems, they cried out to the Lord. They sang hymns in spirit and prayed in spirit. As a result, their spirit was strengthened and released.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THE SAINTS TO LIVE THE PRIESTLY LIFE<br />
BY FELLOWSHIPPING WITH THE LORD</h2>
<p>We should lead the saints to live a priestly life by praying and fellowshipping with the Lord in the Holy of Holies in a practical way. The Lord&rsquo;s greatest need today is to gain brothers and sisters who will live a priestly life according to grace. We must come forward to the throne of grace to fellowship with God, and we must come forward with all the saints to serve Him as priests. This will cause God&rsquo;s purpose to be accomplished among us. The leading in the church should be focused on this matter.</p>
<p>Concerning prayer, many saints have a great lack in the exercise of their spirit. In Christianity the situation is even more desolate. Even when hundreds or thousands of people gather together, very few pray in spirit. In Sunday worship services most people are listening, and although some are praying, very few are praying in spirit. We highly regard giving messages and listening to messages, but we pay little attention to praying and singing hymns in spirit; we are lacking in the exercise and release of the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO OUTWARD ACTIVITIES<br />
BUT NEGLECTING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Christians pay attention to outward matters, such as giving messages and listening to messages, and they focus on outward activities. However, they do not exercise their spirit when they pray, sing hymns, worship God, and fellowship with Him. As a consequence, their spirit is rather weak and not easily released. Their fellowship with others also rarely involves a mutual blending in spirit. The human body is a good example that illustrates our need to exercise. Every organ in our body has the human life and a specific function that requires exercise. Our feet have life and the function of walking, but it is difficult to walk without exercise. The need for exercise is even more important when we consider our spirit. Having been born in Adam, we are fallen, and our spirit was dead and without function. Before we were saved, we did not live according to our spirit, because our spirit was deadened. Even after being regenerated, it is not easy to exercise our spirit due to our old, habitual living and the influence of our environment. This is true even when we pray. We know that we should use our spirit to pray, just as we should use our feet to walk, our eyes to see, and our ears to hear; nevertheless, we often fail to exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>Often when we pray, we merely use our mind, or we are stirred up in our emotion, but we rarely pray according to the sense deep within our spirit. Our spirit is like a withering plant because we lack this kind of exercise, and it is not easy for our spirit to be released. Some saints can release their spirit as soon as they open their mouth, but other saints can pray for five or six minutes and still not touch their spirit. Furthermore, if they are fully occupied in their mind, their prayers will reflect only their emotions and thoughts. If we do not exercise our spirit, our spirit will be dormant, and it will be hard to release our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING THOUGHTS AND UTTERANCES<br />
FOR THE RELEASE OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Our spirit is released through words, and words depend on clear thoughts for their expression. The spirit needs words, and words need clear thoughts. Praying more in our daily living increases our exercise and improves our utterances by training our thoughts. Although we pray with our spirit, we need the cooperation of our mind. If we meet with some English-speaking brothers and sisters, and our English is not very good, it will be difficult to release our spirit when we are inspired; even if we release our spirit, our utterance will be limited by language. We must practice to be focused in our thoughts in order to express the sense in our spirit; the more we practice, the more skillful we will become. Then we will be able to express the sense in our spirit with flowing thoughts and appropriate words.</p><h2 class="head1">TAKING THE INITIATIVE TO PRAY<br />
AND THE SPIRIT JOINING IN</h2>
<p>As we advance in our experience of the Lord, the inspiration of the Spirit will become less of a factor when we pray. When we first began to pray, we often waited for the inspiration of the Spirit, but as we advance, we need to take the initiative to pray and not wait for the Spirit&rsquo;s inspiration. The way of the Spirit is to join in after we begin to pray (Rom. 8:26); that is, when we pray, the Spirit moves in our spirit. If we take the initiative to pray, the Spirit will move. If we do not take the initiative, the Spirit will not move. The Spirit can be likened to the engine of a car. In order to drive a car, we need to start the engine by turning the key. The proper sequence for driving a car involves turning the key to start the engine. When we were saved, God&rsquo;s care for us included His moving in us through the inspiration of the Holy Spirit. However, as we go deeper in the Lord, this kind of inspiration becomes less and less frequent because God desires that we take the initiative in prayer. We should not wait for the Holy Spirit to move before we pray; rather, we should take the initiative to pray, and the Holy Spirit will join in.</p>
<p>Taking the initiative requires regular exercise. Some saints are so exercised that as long as they take even a little initiative, the Spirit moves within them. It is as if the Spirit is under their control. This can be compared to turning on a faucet; as soon as a faucet is turned on, water will begin to flow out. However, no water will flow out if we are not willing to turn on the faucet. We need to learn to turn on the Spirit so that He can move within us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THRONE OF GRACE BEING IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Even though we may know spiritual teachings, we can be short in our spiritual exercise. Objectively speaking, the Holy of Holies is in the heavens, but in order to subjectively enter into the Holy of Holies, we need to exercise our spirit. The throne of grace is in our spirit (Heb. 4:16). In John 4:14 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life,&rdquo; and in 7:38 He said, &ldquo;He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; The Lord desires to become a fountain in us so that rivers of living water will flow out from us. This can be seen in the New Jerusalem, which is a sign that relates more to our experience today than it does to prophecies of things in the future. Revelation 22:1 says, &ldquo;He showed me a river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.&rdquo; This verse speaks of the throne of God and of the Lamb. God is in His Son, the Lamb, and His Son dwells in us. Hence, the throne of God is also in us. This throne is related both to ruling and to giving grace because the flow from the throne is not a stream of fire for judgment (cf. Dan. 7:10) but a stream of water for life. The stream of fire is for judging, whereas the stream of water is for bestowing grace, moistening, and supplying. Furthermore, the tree of life that grows on this side and on that side of the river is also for supplying.</p>
<p>The reality of the New Jerusalem is realized in our spirit. God is present in both the New Jerusalem and our spirit. God is on the throne in both the New Jerusalem and our spirit. God as light with Christ as the lamp is shining in both the New Jerusalem and our spirit. Furthermore, the river of water of life is flowing continually in both the New Jerusalem and our spirit. Today the throne of grace is in our spirit because our spirit is the Holy of Holies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RIVERS OF LIVING WATER<br />
FLOWING OUT OF OUR INNERMOST BEING</h2>
<p>God desires to flow out from our spirit as rivers of living water. In John 7:38 Jesus said, &ldquo;He who believes into Me...out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; Then in verse 39, John explained the Lord&rsquo;s words, saying, &ldquo;This He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive.&rdquo; These verses show that the Spirit is realized as rivers of living water flowing out of our innermost being. The river of water of life in Revelation 22:1 also refers to the Spirit, and the tree of life growing on either side refers to Christ. Hence, the Spirit proceeds out from the throne of God&rsquo;s grace and authority, bringing Christ into all God&rsquo;s redeemed. This is a description of the reality in our spirit. Although there is a throne of God objectively in the Holy of Holies in heaven, God has also set up His throne of grace in our spirit as the Holy of Holies so that He may flow out from our inner being as rivers of living water.</p>
<p>Hebrews 10:19-20 says, &ldquo;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies in the blood of Jesus, which entrance He initiated for us as a new and living way.&rdquo; We should enter into the Holy of Holies with boldness through the Lord&rsquo;s blood, because Christ has initiated a new and living way for us. If the Holy of Holies is only in heaven, it would not be possible for us to enter into the Holy of Holies. Therefore, the Holy of Holies spoken of in verse 19 must refer to our spirit. Furthermore, 4:16 also speaks of the throne of grace. If the throne of grace is only in heaven, it would not be possible for us to come forward to the throne of grace. Hebrews 10:19 and 4:16 both refer to our spirit.</p>
<p>If we compare Hebrews 4:16 with the pictures in Revelation 22 and John 7, we can see that grace and mercy flow out of the throne of God. Whenever we turn to our spirit, to the Holy of Holies, and touch the throne of grace, the Holy Spirit flows and waters. When the Holy Spirit flows, He brings mercy and grace as our timely supply. Thus, God in the Lamb flows into us through the Spirit to comfort, water, and supply us with mercy and grace for our timely help.</p><h2 class="head1">SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES DEPENDING<br />
ON THE FLOW OF THE WATER OF LIFE</h2>
<p>In the New Testament age, our spirit is the Holy of Holies, and God has established His throne of grace in us. In the Son and through the Spirit He dwells in our spirit. Hence, we must turn to our spirit to touch the throne of grace so that He can flow into our spirit and out of our spirit. Thus, all the elements of His divine life will flow into us and out of us. For example, this flow will bring us into His light and cause us to see our filth, corruption, and shortage. Furthermore, we will be enlightened in regard to His plan, His work, His leading, and His will. If we do not allow God to flow in us, it will be difficult to know His leading and will. However, when we let God flow freely in us, we spontaneously touch His feeling and understand His leading. In this flow we receive His cleansing, His dealing, His purifying, and His enlightening. All our spiritual experiences depend upon the flow of the water of life.</p>
<p>Genesis 2 speaks of a river flowing out of the garden of Eden, and gold, bdellium (pearl), and precious stones (onyx) are associated with this flow (vv. 10-12). This shows that the flow brings in gold, pearl, and precious stones. Without a flowing river, there would not be any gold, pearl, or precious stones. If we desire to be filled with these elements, we must allow God&rsquo;s life to flow in us continually through our fellowship with Him. As we fellowship with God by turning to our spirit to pray, by turning to the Holy of Holies to touch Him, there will be a flow in our spirit. All spiritual experiences take place in the fellowship and are perfected in the fellowship. Without such a fellowship, there will be no flow.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL SPIRITUAL EXPERIENCES<br />
BEING REALIZED THROUGH PRAYER</h2>
<p>If a person hears the gospel but is not willing to pray, what he hears and what he feels will not become real to him, no matter how much he has been touched. This can be likened to wrapping a package with string but not tying a knot in the string. Without securing the string with a knot, the package will not be secure. A person who hears the gospel but never prays is like an unsecured package. As soon as he encounters some difficulty, all the content in his &ldquo;package&rdquo; will be lost. However, if he prays, &ldquo;O Lord, I am a sinner,&rdquo; his salvation will become firm and secure; he will have a feeling that he has tied a knot. Similarly, when we listen to a message, read the Bible, or read a spiritual book, we must tie a knot by praying about the things that have touched us. If we do not pray, we will be like an unsecured package.</p>
<p>Our spiritual experiences become solid and firm within us when we pray. Consider the experience of consecration. We did not have an experience of consecration merely because we thought about consecration, saying to ourselves, &ldquo;I have been purchased by God, and I belong to the Lord. I should consecrate myself, and I will.&rdquo; Instead, we prayed to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;Lord, You purchased me with Your blood, and now I belong to You. I consecrate myself to You.&rdquo; With a few simple words, we &ldquo;tied the knot&rdquo; in the matter of consecration. In the same way, we need to pray in order to deal with our sins. If we do not pray, we will not experience the matter of dealing with our sins. Whenever the Spirit touches us concerning any matter, we need to pray in order to gain the reality of this experience.</p>
<p>We hear messages, read spiritual books, and study the Bible, but we rarely pray. We have not tied many knots in our spirit; as a result, we have not been solidly constituted with spiritual experiences. Many of the messages that we hear reach our mind but do not enter into our spirit. Our problem is not that we need to listen to more messages but that we need to pray more. We have not received the content of the messages we have heard into our spirit because we have not tied the knot with prayer. Some saints have been listening to messages for many years, and even though they have a clear understanding of the truth, their spirit is weak. Their mind has been trained because they exercise their mind to understand, but their spirit is weak because they have not exercised their spirit through prayer. We urgently need to rise up to exercise our spirit by praying more. We must exercise our spirit until it becomes strong, living, and released. Then our spirit will be released when we go to a meeting or to visit the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We have a practice of listening to messages in a meeting, but we do not have a practice of praying with our spirit. This is like participating in a soccer game but not using our feet to kick the ball. There is no benefit if we only look at the ball with our eyes. Similarly, when we come to a meeting, we must exercise our spirit. If our spirit is strong, we will not wait for the scheduled time to begin. As soon as we arrive, we will begin to pray, and those who arrive later will also pray. Moreover, we will not be rigid in the order of the meeting, such as singing first and then praying. We will function spontaneously, just like ball players on a soccer field. If our spirits are strong when we come together, we will enter the Holy of Holies, release our spirits, touch the throne of grace, and lift up our holy hands to pray (1 Tim. 2:8). When our spirits are exercised to this extent, we will enjoy the normal service of the priesthood.</p>
<p>When we come to a meeting today, however, our spirit is often dormant. When it is time for the meeting to begin, there are more empty seats in the front than in the back. This is not a normal situation. When we come to a meeting, we should be like ball players who are eager for an opportunity to play. Regrettably, our meetings are just the opposite. We have a habitual pattern, and it is not easy for us to change. Unless a person is leading us in the meeting, our spirits seemingly are on vacation. Many of us are only spectators, and it is as if we are watching a show in a theater. If this is our condition, those whom we bring to salvation will be just like us. Many Christians are in such a desolate condition that they cannot pray, and they are unwilling to pray. If this is our situation, how can God flow among us? How can God accomplish anything He desires among us? It is a basic principle in the New Testament that God only works by flowing through man and by working together with man.</p><h2 class="head1">TOUCHING OUR SPIRIT BEING THE REAL REVIVAL</h2>
<p>Some people think that revival comes from heaven, but this is not accurate. Real revival begins when we touch our spirit. Revival begins within us. If we touch our spirit when we come to the meeting, there will be an excellent revival. Revival is not a matter of asking God to send down fire from heaven but a matter of whether we are willing to light the fire within us. If we ask the Lord to revive the church but do not exercise to release our spirit, how can God revive the church?</p>
<p>If God cannot flow in us, we will not have much shining or sense of the Spirit within, and consequently, we will not have much transformation. Some saints have listened to messages for many years, but their disposition has not changed in any respect. Without a flow in their spirit, they have little sense of God, and they often are confused about spiritual matters. Saints in this condition cannot help others to pray and fellowship with the Lord in a fresh and living way. If, however, the water of life is flowing freely in us, we will bear new fruit regularly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIGGING THROUGH TO THE SPRING<br />
OF LIVING WATER IN US</h2>
<p>I have a heavy burden related to letting God flow in us. Today many of God&rsquo;s children are asking for His outpouring, but they are neglecting His flowing within them. The flowing out of God is His normal and eternal operation. Although the Bible speaks of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, it speaks even more of the Lord entering into us to become a fountain to flow out of us as rivers of living water (John 4:14; 7:37-39; Isa. 58:11). In Revelation 21 and 22, there is no mention of rain in the New Jerusalem, there is only a picture of living water that flows continuously. We need both the inner flowing and the outpouring of the Spirit, but the flowing of the inner spring is an eternal feature of the New Jerusalem. We are not opposed to the outpouring of the Spirit, but we do not promote the outpouring, based on negative situations in the past. The outpouring of the Spirit is like a rainstorm that comes upon us suddenly. Although there may be an abundance of rain, the land will eventually become dry again. The residual water from a rainstorm does not last very long.</p>
<p>In Shantung Province in China there is a spring of water that is renowned for its continuous flowing. Even during droughts, there is no shortage of water. Within Christians there also is such a spring of water. If we truly realized this, we would not desire to seek the outpouring of the Spirit so much; instead, we would dig within our being until a spring begins to flow. Some saints need the outpouring of the Spirit, but if they have only this outpouring without digging to touch the spring of living water within them, the outpouring will not be sufficient because it will not last for a long time. God&rsquo;s children need to know this secret.</p>
<p>Today God is in our spirit; He is the fountain of living water. He desires for us to contact Him regularly so that He may flow out of us. Hence, we need to open the way for God; we need to turn to our spirit, exercise our spirit, and allow our spirit to be released. Whether we are at home or in the office, we must exercise our spirit. We have listened to many messages, but now we need to be priests who come to the Holy of Holies to touch the throne of grace. We should not remain in our mind but turn to our spirit. We need to read the Bible, but we need to pray even more. We should exercise our spirit more by exercising our spirit to pray more. This is our greatest need today.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT TO SING AND PRAY</h2>
<p>In our meetings we should lead the brothers and sisters to exercise their spirit more. The prayer meeting should involve less speaking of messages and more praying and singing. We are short of priests who burn incense and who sing; that is, we are short of praying and singing, which strengthens our spirit. Not exercising our spirit in the meeting is like trying to drive a car without turning the key. Every time we come to a meeting, we must first use our &ldquo;key&rdquo; to start the &ldquo;engine.&rdquo; Singing and praying will kindle our spirits. If our spirit is weak when we sing a hymn, we must sing until our spirit rises up. The most important matter in the prayer meeting is to open our spirit and exercise our spirit. As long as the saints learn to turn to the spirit and pray from the spirit, we do not need to restrict the topics for prayer. We also do not need to consider and compose our prayers or be influenced by our environment. We should pray only according to our spirit.</p>
<p>The saints who can sing should help other saints to learn to sing. If our singing is not focused, the spirit of the hymns will not come forth. We should spend much time to learn how to sing hymns so that we can sing at any time and in any place. Singing hymns will cause the brothers and sisters to rise up, and it is not necessary to sing every stanza. For example, we can sing stanza 1 of <em>Hymns,</em> #250 repeatedly: &ldquo;Spring up, well, with water; / Dig Thou, Lord, completely; / Dig away all barriers / That Thy stream flow through me.&rdquo; When a couple goes home after singing this stanza, they will be able to sing it together at home. Then the husband may ask his wife, &ldquo;Are you springing up with water?&rdquo; and the wife may ask the husband, &ldquo;Are you digging within?&rdquo; This kind of singing and speaking to one another will stir up and release their spirits.</p>
<p>The saints are active in their thoughts but not exercised in their spirit. We must increase our exercise of the spirit, digging a well in our being until the living water flows. There is a spring of living water in us. This spring is full of grace, mercy, peace, and power. Because it is easy for this spring to be plugged up, we need to continuously dig so that the Holy Spirit can flow out. As priests, our service is to dig a well to reach this spring of living water so that living water can flow out from the throne of grace. In this spring of living water, there is life, light, mercy, and grace for our timely help; there is everything that we need.</p>
<p>We do not need to ask God to pour out the Holy Spirit upon us. Rather, we need to know the God who is indwelling us. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in the Son bodily (Col. 2:9), and the Son is the life-giving Spirit dwelling in our spirit (1 Cor. 6:17; 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17; Rom. 8:16). All the riches of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are in our spirit; we only need to dig and let Him flow. In the meetings there is no need for a long message; rather, we should lead the saints to exercise their spirit by singing and praying. Furthermore, we should leave some time for the saints to pray at the end of the meeting so that they may realize the preciousness and the secret of prayer. We should pray in the meetings, and we should also pray at home and in other places. We must realize that we are New Testament priests. We should pray not only by ourselves but also corporately with other brothers and sisters.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING THE SAINTS TO PRAY<br />
BY EXERCISING THE SPIRIT AND<br />
ADVANCING IN THE TRUTH</h1>
<h2 class="head1">STRENGTHENING THE EXERCISE OF SINGING HYMNS</h2>
<p>We need to be strengthened in our exercise related to singing hymns. I hope that all the churches would provide opportunities for those who have this function to perfect the saints in the singing of hymns. In every message meeting we should set aside at least twenty minutes to practice singing. We have been short in leading the saints to sing hymns of praise to God. I hope that the responsible brothers in every place can pray about this matter so that some brothers can be perfected in leading the singing of hymns.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MATTERS REQUIRING OUR ATTENTION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Emphasizing the Crucial Points in the Message</h2>
<p>In our &ldquo;classes&rdquo; we should emphasize the crucial points of the message. For example, if the message concerns our need to turn to the spirit to fellowship with God in the Holy of Holies and to pray according to the sense of the Spirit, we should encourage the saints to exercise to pray in their daily life. Furthermore, we should encourage them to fellowship about any difficulties that they have encountered or any insights that they have gained from their exercise. In this way, other saints will receive the benefit. Such a review will also emphasize the crucial points of the previous message.</p>
<p>In our present situation I have not seen this kind of leading and practice. After the message is over, there may be some further speaking and prayer when the saints meet in their &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; but the content does not necessarily correspond to the crucial points in the message. This gives the impression that the message and the subsequent fellowship are not related. The crucial points of the message should be the crucial points of the fellowship in the &ldquo;classes.&rdquo; Moreover, the speaking in this time of fellowship should be concise and not long.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Motivating Those Who Seldom Pray<br />
to Open Their Mouth</h2>
<p>After the crucial points have been reviewed, the saints who seldom open their mouths should be encouraged to pray and fellowship using one or two sentences, because one of the main purposes of these times is to enable the saints who rarely pray to break through in this matter. In the beginning of our pursuit, some saints may need to give a little demonstration of how to exercise. Every &ldquo;class&rdquo; needs some brothers and sisters who are lively and active and who do not deviate from the main subject of the message. There should be at least five or six saints who are lively and able to stir up the other saints; these saints should coordinate to help others. The lively saints should participate, respond, and pray. Their function will serve as a kind of demonstration and usher in an atmosphere for others to do the same. However, we need to be careful not to function so much that there is no ground for those who seldom pray to function. If this is the case, those who seldom pray will not pray. We must not lose sight of the burden that those who seldom pray, those who have not touched the key of prayer, those who have not tasted the sweetness of prayer, and those who have no desire to pray would be brought into this exercise. During our time together, we should focus specifically on motivating these ones. This requires skill.</p>
<p>In our &ldquo;classes&rdquo; we need to emphasize the crucial points so that everyone has a deep impression, and we need to motivate the saints to open their mouth and to exercise in the meeting and even when they return home. We should ask them to be prepared to fellowship at the next meeting about the difficulties they encountered or the experiences they enjoyed so that we can mutually encourage and motivate one another. During our time together, the saints can also pray. The active saints can pray in order to stir up others&rsquo; spirits, and the inactive saints can be encouraged to open their mouth and pray. This is similar to speaking to unbelievers in a gospel meeting. When we encounter some unresponsive ones, we can speak a little to strengthen the gospel message and lead them to gradually open their mouth to pray. It is always hard for a person to open his mouth for the first time, but once he does, it is easy for him to make progress.</p>
<p>This kind of contact is necessary because the weaker saints often need to be encouraged. When we see a saint with a particular need, we should be willing to fellowship with him as time allows. In this way, we can learn about his situation and avoid the need to visit with him at a later time, which may be an inconvenience to him. Since he has heard the message and received some help, he simply needs a little strengthening. Just a few minutes of contact will be a great benefit to him. We should not be focused on those who are more lively and who always open their mouths; we should pay attention to those who do not open their mouths so that they may rise up.</p><h2 class="head1">LEADING THE SAINTS TO PRAY<br />
BY EXERCISING THEIR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The condition in Christianity is that most people go to &ldquo;church&rdquo; on Sunday in order to sit and listen to a sermon, and then they leave when the sermon is over. They do not pray in the meeting, and they rarely pray during the week. Even if they pray, their prayers are merely petitions based on their thoughts and memory. Since they do not know how to turn to their spirit and how to exercise their spirit to fellowship with God, they do not pray when they come to a meeting. This is even the situation of the saints among us. They listen to the message during the meeting, but they do not exercise their spirit. We need to correct this situation. As we lead the brothers and sisters to be built up as the church, we cannot depend on outward arrangements. Rather, we must lead the brothers and sisters to turn to their spirit and to live before God so that their spirit becomes strong and living. When all the saints are blended in spirit, there will be genuine building.</p>
<p>We need to help the brothers and sisters become strong and living by leading them to turn to their spirit to pray and fellowship with God, serving as priests and living a priestly life. As long as they know how to turn to their spirit to pray, they will not be hindered by occasional sins, mistakes, or other problems. Instead, the Spirit will move and flow in them to deal with their inward weaknesses and to relieve their weariness, enabling them to receive the supply from God. With a strong and released spirit, they will blend as one in spirit with other brothers and sisters in the church. We should not emphasize giving more messages but focus on motivating the brothers and sisters to exercise their spirit.</p>
<p>We must bear this responsibility together. It does not matter who gives messages, who visits others, or who contacts people in the meetings, because we have a common goal of bringing the saints into the spirit, into the experience and reality of fellowshipping with God. This is a new beginning for us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENRICHING THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</h2>
<p>Our bread-breaking meetings lack a spiritual supply because the saints are short of spiritual knowledge. Although some do not exercise their spirits, many other brothers and sisters are short of words of prayer, praise, and thanksgiving because they are short in matters related to knowing the Lord. The fact that our prayers and praises are nearly the same for every bread-breaking meeting shows that we are short in our knowledge of the Lord. Without a rich understanding of the things related to the Lord, there will be a shortage in our utterance. If we are short of utterance, it will be difficult to release our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Increasing the Spiritual Supply<br />
according to the Truth</h2>
<p>We need to increase the spiritual supply in the saints by helping them to know the Lord Jesus and the Father according to the truth. The Lord Jesus is the central subject of the Bible, but when we read the Bible, we often do not have much light, and the words that pass before our eyes are quickly forgotten. However, when the truth is released through the ministry of the word, and the Spirit enlightens us inwardly, something solid enters into us and leaves a deep impression. We should supply the saints with messages related to knowing the Lord Jesus and the Father according to the truth. This will enrich the praise and thanksgiving in our bread-breaking meeting, especially when we worship the Father.</p>
<p>In order to strengthen the saints, we will provide a message outline to the responsible brothers and sisters so that they can spend time before the Lord considering, praying, and digesting these points in order to be able to fellowship with the saints in the &ldquo;classes.&rdquo; The saints need to know the truth so that they can be brought into a practice and exercise that is according to the truth. We should print the crucial verses and the main points, and we could even add some prayers. This does not mean that we are asking the saints to repeat the prayers as if they are reading a prayer book; rather, it is to give them some examples so that they can exercise before the Lord at home and in their daily living. This is a consideration to help the ones who are new in their spiritual life and limited in their spiritual knowledge. Providing them with Bible verses and crucial points will surely be a great help to them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Strengthening the Spiritual Supply<br />
through Hymns</h2>
<p>In addition to increasing the spiritual supply in the bread-breaking meeting, we should also strengthen the spiritual supply through hymns, especially hymns related to the worship of the Father. Because we are short in spiritual knowledge and spiritual exercise, our worship of the Father is weak and not much praise is offered to Him. This is a great lack among us. I hope that we would have more hymns to supply the bread-breaking meeting. Although we have quite a number of hymns that are suitable for the bread-breaking meeting, we have lost the taste for some of our hymns because we sing them all the time. This can be likened to eating the same food every day. Even if we eat the best food, the food will lose its &ldquo;freshness&rdquo; and become tasteless if we eat it every day.</p>
<p>The Lord is always moving forward. In every age He leads the church, and His leading brings in a new atmosphere. Presently, the Lord is bringing in a new atmosphere. If we continue to sing the same hymns, they will not always be suitable. Recently in a bread-breaking meeting, a brother led the saints to sing a new hymn, but because we were not familiar with the hymn, we could not sing it. At the same time, we could not go back to the old hymns because the atmosphere was different. This shows that we need a supply of new hymns, and we also need to practice singing these hymns.</p><h2 class="head2">Supplying the Truth concerning the Son</h2>
<p>The bread-breaking meeting needs a spiritual supply that comes from our knowledge of Christ the Son and our knowledge of the Father. In regard to our knowledge of the Son, many essential points need to be presented, spanning from eternity past to eternity future. Many details are involved in this chronology, but we can look only at the main points. For example, the Lord is the Word of God, the light, the Creator, the seed of the woman, and so on. The book of Isaiah speaks of Him as Immanuel who was born of a virgin (7:14), and also as a child born to us, a Son given to us, the Mighty God, and the Eternal Father (9:6). Many saints lack a thorough knowledge of these verses concerning the Lord Jesus; therefore, we need to present these verses point by point so that the Spirit can work in the saints to bring them into a richer knowing of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Lord Being the Eternal God</h2>
<p>We need a series of messages that begin by focusing on the eternal nature of the Lord. The Lord is eternal; He is the eternal Lord. This truth can be presented in five verse portions, including Micah 5:2; John 1:1 and 14; Isaiah 9:6; Hebrews 1:10-12; and 7:3.</p>
<p>Micah 5:2 says, &ldquo;You, O Bethlehem Ephrathah, / So little to be among the thousands of Judah, / From you there will come forth to Me / He who is to be Ruler in Israel; / And His goings forth are from ancient times, / From the days of eternity.&rdquo; According to Matthew 2:1-6, this verse in Micah refers to the coming Christ, that is, the Lord Jesus. There are three main points in Micah 5:2: first, His place of birth; second, His coming to be the Ruler for God; and third, His source being from ancient times, from the days of eternity. We will focus on the third point, the eternal nature of the Lord. The verse says that the Lord&rsquo;s goings forth are from ancient times. This means that His source is in eternity. Although He was born in time at a certain place, in a definite point of time and space, He is from ancient times, and the source of His existence is from eternity.</p>
<p>There are two phrases in this verse that speak of the Lord&rsquo;s eternal nature. The first phrase is <em>ancient times,</em> which denotes eternity. Psalm 90:2 says, &ldquo;From eternity to eternity, You are God.&rdquo; This means that the Lord is outside of time and space. In the Bible the expression <em>eternity</em> has the connotation of infinity, fullness, and completeness. The Lord is not limited by time or space. Although He was born as a man in time and space in the small town of Bethlehem, His source is infinite and eternal, transcending time and space. The second phrase <em>days of eternity</em> refers to the period before time began, a state that has no beginning. The Savior, who was born in the small town of Bethlehem, is the eternal One. He exists in eternity without beginning, before time even began. His source is without beginning; it is eternal.</p>
<p>John 1:1 and 14 also speak of the eternal nature of the Lord. Verse 1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; Although these verses present a contrast in terms of time, both refer to the Son. Verse 1 says that the Son, as the Word, was in the beginning, that He is God Himself. The Son is God in eternity without beginning and before the beginning of time. Verse 14 says that the Word became flesh; He became a man and dwelt among us. Even though He is the Word, the eternal God Himself, He became flesh in time and came among us as a man. On one hand, He is a man, and on the other hand, He is the Word, God Himself. Although He became flesh and was born in time, He is the God who exists in eternity.</p>
<p>Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us; / And the government / Is upon His shoulder; / And His name will be called / Wonderful Counselor, / Mighty God, / Eternal Father.&rdquo; There are parallel contrasts in this verse. The verse begins by speaking of the Lord as a child and a Son, and it ends by speaking of Him as the Mighty God and Eternal Father. <em>Mighty God</em> is in parallel contrast to the word <em>child,</em> and <em>Eternal Father</em> is in parallel contrast to the word <em>Son.</em> This is wonderful. This verse speaks of the Lord Jesus as the Son and as the Father. He is a child and the Mighty God. When speaking of the Father, there is also emphasis on <em>Eternal,</em> which shows that the Lord&rsquo;s source is eternal. The Lord Jesus, who was manifested as the Son, is the Father in eternity; His source is in eternity. Although He is the Son given to us, He is also the Father in eternity.</p>
<p>In John 14:9 the Lord said, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father.&rdquo; He also said, &ldquo;I and the Father are one&rdquo; (10:30). This is the fulfillment of the prophecy in Isaiah 9:6. The Son who was manifested in time is the Eternal Father. The Son who was given to us in time is the Father in eternity, which has no beginning. When He came into time and was given to us, He was revealed as the Son. The Son given to us in time is the Father in eternity. This shows that the Lord is eternal; He is not only the Son but also the Father.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:10-12, which is a quotation of Psalm 102:25-27, says, &ldquo;You in the beginning, Lord, laid the foundation of the earth, and the heavens are the works of Your hands; they will perish, but You remain perpetually; and they all will become old like a garment, and like a mantle You will roll them up; like a garment they will also be changed; but You are the same, and Your years will not fail.&rdquo; In the first part of these verses <em>Lord</em> refers to the Lord Jesus, who laid the foundation of the earth and made the heavens through the works of His hands. This proves that before the heavens and the earth came into being, He existed; He created the heavens and the earth. Moreover, the heavens and the earth will perish, but He will remain perpetually. The first part of these verses speaks of His existence before the heavens and the earth came into being, and the second part speaks of His existence after the heavens and the earth pass away. Thus, both His existence in eternity past and His existence in eternity future are mentioned. He is the One who exists from eternity to eternity, without beginning or end. The heavens and the earth will change, but He is the same; His years will not fail. This proves that He is the eternal Lord.</p>
<p>Hebrews 7:3 says, &ldquo;Having neither beginning of days nor end of life, but likened to the Son of God.&rdquo; <em>Having neither beginning of days nor end of life</em> confirms that the Lord is without beginning or end, existing from eternity to eternity.</p>
<p>Simply presenting these verses without much explanation is sufficient. The brothers and sisters need to realize that even though our Lord was born in a small town, His source was from ancient times, from the days of eternity. He is the Word who was in the beginning before time, but He became a man in time and dwelt among us. Although He is the Son given to us in time, He is also the Eternal Father. Before the heavens and the earth came into being, He existed, and when the heavens and the earth pass away, He will remain perpetually. He has neither beginning of days nor end of life; He is without beginning or ending. We should memorize these verses about the Lord&rsquo;s eternal nature.</p><h2 class="head3">The Lord Being the Word of God</h2>
<p>We should also speak concerning the matter of knowing the Lord as the Word of God. John 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God.&rdquo; Verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; Revelation 19:13 says, &ldquo;His name is called the Word of God.&rdquo; When the Lord is spoken of in this verse, He is also revealed as the One who is called Faithful and True, who is sitting on a white horse, and who judges and makes war in righteousness (v. 11). <em>Word</em> in verse 13 in the original language does not refer to ordinary words but to a longer portion, either spoken or written. He is the Word of God for explaining God.</p>
<p>The words of a person express the person. A person is defined and his thoughts are revealed through his words. If we meet a person who does not open his mouth to speak, it will not be possible to truly know him. We may have some thought concerning him based on his appearance, but this is not sufficient. All real knowledge of a person is based on his words. Once his words come forth, his person comes forth. Being the Word of God means that the Lord Jesus is God&rsquo;s expression and explanation. Conversely, we can say that the Lord Jesus is God expressed, God explained. The Word of God is God expressing Himself and explaining Himself. In other words, the expressed God, the explained God, the God who reveals Himself, is the Word.</p>
<p>John 1:18 says, &ldquo;No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.&rdquo; The Word of God is the expression of God; He is also God expressed. The Lord Jesus is the full expression of God. When God speaks to man, He speaks through the Son; hence, the Son is the Word of God. When God created the universe, He expressed Himself through the things that were created. This is the reason that all things came into being through the Word (v. 3). When God created the universe, He did so through the Son as the Word (Heb. 1:1-3). All these verses show that the Word is the expression of God, the explanation of God. The Lord Jesus is the Word of God; He is God expressed, God explained. One day the expressed God, the explained God, became flesh.</p>
<p>John 1:14 does not say that &ldquo;God became flesh&rdquo;; it says that &ldquo;the Word became flesh.&rdquo; God could become flesh only by being the expressed God, the explained God. If God were unwilling to express Himself, explain Himself, or manifest Himself, He could not have become flesh. God became flesh so that He could express and explain Himself to man. Hence, 1 Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;Confessedly, great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh, / Justified in the Spirit.&rdquo; <em>He who was manifested in the flesh</em> emphasizes manifestation, expression, and explanation. The Word becoming flesh refers to the fact that the God who speaks, the God who desires to express, declare, and explain Himself, has manifested Himself in the flesh.</p>
<p>God created the universe through the Word, revealed Himself through the spoken and written Word, and accomplished redemption through the incarnated Word. He will also carry out His judgment in the future through the Word. In these four stages&mdash;creation, revelation, redemption, and judgment&mdash;God does everything through the Word. Through creation God declared His eternal power and divine characteristics (Rom. 1:20), through revelation God explained Himself (Heb. 1:1-2; 2 Tim. 3:16), through incarnation and redemption He declared Himself even more, and through judgment in the future, He will further declare Himself in righteousness. Hence, whether in creation, revelation, redemption, or judgment, everything is done through the Word, the declared God. The Lord Jesus is God&rsquo;s explanation, God&rsquo;s declaration; He is the explained and declared God.</p>
<p>In spiritual matters, nothing can be done apart from the Lord as the Word or without words. Every time we speak concerning the Lord Jesus, preach the Lord Jesus, or supply others with the Lord Jesus, we must use words. Every time we give praise or thanksgiving, we must use words. Without words, God cannot be expressed. I rejoice that there are words in the universe and that God created man with the ability to speak. If God did not create man with the innate ability to speak and understand words, the universe would be a silent place, and we would not be able to understand God in His expression and explanation of Himself; neither would we be able to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s desire that we would speak shows His desire for us to be His children, and that we, like the Son, would be an expression and declaration of all that He is. If Adam had not fallen and, instead, would have partaken, along with his descendants, of the tree of life, what would be the content of our speaking? Surely the words that we would speak would be filled with Christ Himself. If human beings had not fallen and sin had not entered into man, we would have received the tree of life and would have been filled with God Himself. Then, every word we speak would be Christ. Christ is the real word. The more we love the Lord and the more we know Him, the more our words will be filled with the glorious Christ. He is the Word in eternity past, and His name will be the Word of God throughout eternity future. He is the Word that speaks God and expresses God, and when we speak Him, God is glorified.</p>
<p>The Lord is the Word of God, the declaration of God, and the declared God. Every time we preach the Lord Jesus, we are preaching the God who declared Himself, and every time we speak the Lord Jesus, we are speaking the God who has spoken forth Himself. If God were not the Word, we could not know Him. Although God is hidden and invisible, He is the Word, and He has been spoken of, declared, and expressed. The God who has been expressed is Christ. Romans 10:8-9 says, &ldquo;&lsquo;The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart,&rsquo; that is, the word of the faith which we proclaim, that if you confess with your mouth Jesus as Lord and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from the dead, you will be saved.&rdquo; If a person wants to be saved, he only needs to say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus.&rdquo; He does not need to ascend into heaven or descend into the abyss to look for the Lord. As soon as a person calls upon the Lord&rsquo;s name, He receives the Lord and is saved (vv. 6-7, 13).</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord and All Things</h2>
<p>We also should speak concerning the Lord and all things.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Lord Creating All Things</h2>
<p>The Lord created all things. John 1:1-3 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being.&rdquo; The heavens and the earth, mankind, all matters, and all things were created through the Lord, that is, through the Word. In other words, all things were created by the expressed God. All things were created by the God who explains, expresses, and declares Himself, not by a hidden God. Romans 1:20 says, &ldquo;The invisible things of Him, both His eternal power and divine characteristics, have been clearly seen since the creation of the world, being perceived by the things made, so that they would be without excuse.&rdquo; This verse shows that in creating all things, God expressed Himself. Hence, John 1 says that He is the Word and that He created all things.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 8:6 says, &ldquo;To us there is one God, the Father, out from whom are all things, and we are unto Him; and one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom are all things, and we are through Him.&rdquo; We have only one Lord, Jesus Christ, through whom all things were created, and we are through Him.</p>
<p>Colossians 1:16 says, &ldquo;In Him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him.&rdquo; All things, whether in the heavens or on the earth, visible or invisible, were created through Him. The creation of all things and the existence of all things are for God&rsquo;s expression. Christ is the Word of God, the expression of God; through His creation of all things, God is manifested.</p>
<p>Hebrews 1:2 says that God &ldquo;has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son, whom He appointed Heir of all things, through whom also He made the universe.&rdquo; In the last days, God is speaking through His Son, and this speaking is God&rsquo;s expression. Furthermore, God made the universe through the Son. This means that God expresses Himself not only through the Son&rsquo;s speaking but also through the creation of the universe. The whole creation is God&rsquo;s expression and God&rsquo;s explanation. This explanation in creation is through the Word of God, the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Lord Being the Source of All Things</h2>
<p>No matter how much scientists differ in their opinions or explanations concerning the origin of the universe, they do not deny that the universe comes from one source. All scientific laws and theorems are predicated on the assumption that there is only one source, not dual sources. Even the author of the theory of evolution, Darwin, could not deny that the universe had only one source. Although there are many organisms, there is only one source, and the unique source of this universe is the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p> According to 1 Corinthians 8:6, &ldquo;to us there is one God, the Father, out from whom are all things.&rdquo; Although this verse says that all things are out from the Father, according to Isaiah 9:6, the Son is the Eternal Father. The Lord is the source of all things, and all things come out from Him. Romans 11:36 says, &ldquo;Because out from Him and through Him and to Him are all things. To Him be the glory forever. Amen.&rdquo; This is a sweet and precious verse in the Bible. We should help new believers learn and even memorize these verses.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Lord Being the Sovereign Lord of All</h2>
<p>Acts 10:36 says, &ldquo;Jesus Christ (this One is Lord of all).&rdquo; Being the Lord of all means that Jesus Christ is the sovereign Master. Although there have been many great men, sages, philosophers, and religionists throughout the ages, not one of them has said that he is the Lord. Throughout all of human history only Jesus Christ said that He is the Lord. Furthermore, those who preached Him said repeatedly that He is Lord of all (2:36). First Corinthians 12:3 says, &ldquo;No one can say, Jesus is Lord! except in the Holy Spirit,&rdquo; and 2 Corinthians 4:5 says, &ldquo;We...preach...Christ Jesus as Lord.&rdquo; In the universe only Christ is the Lord. Confucius is not the Lord; neither is Mohammed. Only Jesus is the Lord. He said that He is the Lord, and others believed that He is the Lord, called upon Him as Lord, and preached Him as Lord. Everything in the universe belongs to Him, and everything is under His sovereign ruling. He is the sovereign Lord of all.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">EXERCISING<br />
TO FELLOWSHIP WITH THE LORD<br />
AND TO FUNCTION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">STRENGTHENING THE SAINTS&rsquo; KNOWLEDGE<br />
OF THE LORD AND THE FATHER</h2>
<p>When we meet in the smaller &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; we should spend time to strengthen the saints&rsquo; knowledge of the Lord and the Father. We should use the first three weeks to fellowship about knowing the Lord and the fourth week to focus on knowing the Father. There are many crucial points related to knowing the Lord, but in the first year we should present only a brief outline. More details can be added in subsequent years. For example, there are fine points concerning the Lord being the seed of a woman, being Emmanuel, and being born of a woman. If we focus on these additional points in a gradual way, the brothers and sisters will be greatly helped to know the Lord. There are not as many crucial points related to the Father, so we do not need to devote as much time for fellowship concerning them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIGESTING THE MESSAGES AND<br />
INCREASING THE MUTUAL FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>Meeting in small &ldquo;classes&rdquo; has numerous advantages. For example, in the past the saints did not have the time to digest the message that was given in a meeting. Consequently, the message did not have much impact. Now that we are meeting in small groups, the saints can pray and digest the message, and this will leave a solid impression in their spirit.</p>
<p>Another benefit is that the brothers and sisters have more contact with one another. In the past, the saints came to the meeting to listen to messages or to break the bread, and even though the number in a district was small, there was little opportunity for mutual fellowship. In our pursuing in the small &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; there is more contact between the saints, and this contact is more spontaneous and practical. In short, the saints are receiving much spiritual help in this fellowship. We must continue in this way by the Lord&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HELPING THE SAINTS TO SPEAK FOR GOD</h2>
<p>We should use no more than two-thirds or three-fifths of the meeting time for the release of a message, with the remainder of the time being for fellowship among the saints. This is a way for everyone to serve in the church. Without this practice of pursuing in &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; only the speaking brother who gives a message and a small number of brothers and sisters who help in ushering and other practical matters have an opportunity to serve.</p>
<p>Since we began the practice of pursuing and fellowshipping in &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; all the saints are learning how to serve. In particular, after gaining some understanding of the Lord&rsquo;s Word, they have an opportunity to function by ministering the Lord&rsquo;s word in their speaking to one another. In this way, all the saints receive benefit. This is far better than leading the saints to serve in just ushering and cleaning.</p>
<p>If the brothers and sisters in each district receive this kind of leading, they will be able to do the same thing when they are led by the Lord to move to another place. This is a totally different situation from what we have seen in the past. For example, a new believer no longer comes to a meeting just to sit and listen to a message, which only makes him feel as if he has no function. Our concepts are being changed because the saints now see that everyone can speak for the Lord.</p>
<p>There are two categories of speaking among human beings. Everyone has the capacity for the first kind of speaking, which is ordinary speaking. Unless a person is physically dumb, everyone has the capacity for ordinary speech. The second kind of speaking is related to a more formal speaking, especially public speaking to others. Not everyone can do this. These two kinds of speaking can be seen in the spiritual realm. Every child of God can speak some spiritual words, explain a little about the Bible, share something concerning God&rsquo;s grace, utter words of praise to God, or give a brief testimony for the Lord. It is not right if a brother or a sister cannot speak something for the Lord after being saved for a few years; this is equivalent to being spiritually dumb. Every believer should be able to open his mouth to speak for God and to testify for God, even if he does not have the capacity to give a message.</p>
<p>Among God&rsquo;s children, God has appointed some to speak the word. These, however, are not the only ones who can speak, because every child of God is able to speak something. In order to speak, we do not need to ask for a special portion of grace. As long as we stand in our position as a child of God, we can speak for God. If we have received some training and perfecting before the Lord and have some knowledge of spiritual things and some understanding of the Bible, we can also speak for God in the way of ministry. We must change our concept of sitting and waiting for a &ldquo;pastor&rdquo; to give a sermon; this is a concept in Christianity. If we are perfected to speak as children of God, we can bring other saints into this exercise wherever we are or wherever we move to. This will have a far-reaching impact.</p><h2 class="head1">DROPPING RITUALS AND<br />
SEEKING THE LORD&rsquo;S LEADING</h2>
<p>This kind of practice cannot be done properly within a short period of time. The way that we have received from the Lord is a new way, a way that we have never taken previously. We are learning one step at a time and making improvements as we go. We do not even know the extent of what we should learn because we do not know how the Lord will lead us. We have to set our heart on praying faithfully for these matters every day and every week, seeking to become clear concerning the Lord&rsquo;s leading.</p>
<p>We are not taking this way simply to be different. Instead, we are dropping the ways of Christianity because religious rituals put believers into bondage and hinder the Lord&rsquo;s grace from being released. Many brothers and sisters have been enlivened in their spirits, even though we have been practicing this way for only a short time. We will continue to seek the Lord&rsquo;s leading as we go forward.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING FLEXIBLE AND BEING AWARE<br />
OF INDIVIDUAL DIFFERENCES</h2>
<p>In our &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; we should be flexible and avoid rigidity. We do not have to do things the same way every time; rather, we should consider what to do based on who is present. During the message time, we should consider who is present, especially those who do not come regularly. In our time of fellowship, we can set aside some time to care for them, but we do not have to spend all our time with one person because this may cause him to feel as if he is being pressured.</p>
<p>If a crucial point is mentioned, everyone can pray together. Those who are more exercised should pray first, because their prayer can open up others&rsquo; spirits and bring in an atmosphere of prayer. When we fellowship with a saint who does not meet regularly, we may be able to lead him to pray, but we should not force him. If he does not know how to pray, we can lead him to pray sentence by sentence. We can say, &ldquo;Brother, what if I pray a sentence, and you repeat after me?&rdquo; Perhaps, in this way he will be enlivened. This is the same as leading a person to pray after preaching the gospel to him. Anyone who prays is likely to be enlivened. Initially, a saint who feels that he does not know how to pray or that his prayer is inadequate will hesitate to open his mouth. But if we can help him open his mouth to pray, he will become bolder. Gradually, he will be able to pray by himself and will be blessed a great deal.</p>
<p>After helping him in a wise and gentle manner, we should introduce him to the other saints, telling them, for example, the year that he was baptized. This can be compared to blood circulating in our body. If our blood is blocked in a certain place, various diseases will develop. With this kind of fellowship, there will be a flow among the saints, and many diseases will be eliminated spontaneously. This practice, though seemingly trivial, will have a great impact. If we help a brother just a little, he will come back, and when he comes back, he will bring others with him. This shows that he was helped and that he wants to help others.</p>
<p>We must also pay attention to individual differences. We cannot have a rigid plan to do something for the first five minutes and then something else for the next five minutes. We must be flexible and make adjustments according to the actual situation. If the saints are more advanced, our fellowship should be more advanced. If the saints are new believers, we should adjust our fellowship to their level but still be a little more advanced in our speaking. This can be compared to teaching. When a teacher speaks to his students, his lessons should be according to their level of comprehension, but they should also be slightly more advanced so that the students will be interested in advancing further.</p>
<p>We should not have a fixed way to practice in the small &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; thinking that someone should first give a message and that we should then pray. Once we have such a concept, we will have no way to progress. We should regard our meeting in the small &ldquo;classes&rdquo; as an experiment. We should also be watchful because none of us fully knows what to do. We are learning while doing.</p>
<p>I am concerned that this fellowship will become mere talk; that is, we may be idealistic yet impractical. Therefore, we should practice with the brothers and sisters in a blended way and fellowship together after our &ldquo;class&rdquo; times. Such fellowship will bring out many things that will improve our times together. The saints should have a learning spirit and an opportunity to learn. If they receive any benefit in the fellowship and sharing, we should encourage them to practice it. In this way they will receive much more than they would from merely listening to a message. If we have this attitude and spirit, I believe that we will learn a great deal.</p>
<p>We should also improve the way that we give messages. The main points of a message must be clear, and the messages must be educational. Every time we speak, there should be several clear and understandable points. Whenever we speak, the saints should be touched and educated in spiritual matters. A spiritual sense and some spiritual knowledge should be imparted into the saints. It is not difficult for brothers to speak for a long time, especially those who have been giving messages, but now that we are meeting in smaller groups, the messages need to be shortened. The brothers need more training so that they can cover the main points in a shorter time but still impart something spiritual into the saints.</p><h2 class="head1">EXERCISING TO FELLOWSHIP<br />
WITH THE LORD REGULARLY</h2>
<p>Everyone who bears responsibility in a &ldquo;class&rdquo; must exercise his spirit regularly. This will strengthen, enliven, and enable his spirit to be easily released. It is not enough to merely be open; he must also be able to release his spirit. He cannot perform. If he does not exercise his spirit to fellowship with the Lord regularly, his exercise in the class will only be a performance.</p>
<p>We must practice to fellowship with the Lord in our spirit even in the midst of our busy schedules. Everyone is busy with many things. According to our experience, it is very difficult to set aside half an hour each day to pray. Sisters are busy from morning until evening taking care of their families, and brothers have difficult situations and work-related matters that often overwhelm them. Although we all desire to set aside time to contact the Lord, it is not easy. We can solve this problem by setting aside a little time to contact the Lord every day and by practicing to contact the Lord when we are busy doing practical things. For example, when we are riding the bus to work, or when we are waiting for something, we should do our best to ignore the outward environment and focus on fellowshipping with the Lord. We can practice being joined to the Lord in our office or in other places.</p>
<p>The way to practice this is by speaking to the Lord. When we have a little time, we should fellowship with Him. This is not a small thing. In terms of bodily exercise, it may seem as if we have no opportunity to exercise, but actually we do many physical things every day that we do not notice. For example, a person who has been sick and in bed for a long time will have a difficult time walking long distances when he gets out of bed, because he has not been &ldquo;practicing&rdquo; to walk. However, before he was sick, he had no difficulty walking. This shows that we should not belittle the routine walking that we do every day. Even household chores, such as wiping the chairs and tables, involve physical activity. Of course, it is best if we can devote some time specifically to physical exercise, but if our time or circumstances do not allow this, we can still sweep the floor, clean the windows, or make our beds. These activities are beneficial to the body.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to spiritual things. It is good to set aside some time every day to exercise our spirit in fellowship with the Lord. However, if this is too difficult because of time and circumstances, we must still find other opportunities to exercise. We should learn to exercise our spirit in every circumstance. We must remember that we belong to the Lord and that the Lord is dwelling in our spirit, which is the Holy of Holies. Thus, our fellowship with the Lord need not be limited by circumstances related to time or space.</p>
<p>Some brothers and sisters desire to be free of every earthly entanglement so that they can fully concentrate on praying and contacting the Lord. This reflects a desire to seek spiritual cultivation by leaving the secular world and &ldquo;going to the mountains.&rdquo; This never works. In church history there have been groups of ascetic monks who left the secular world to live the life of a hermit in the wilderness or on a mountain. They devoted themselves solely to prayer and to seeking the Lord. It is quite strange, however, that none of these had any spiritual descendants, and their history did not last very long.</p>
<p>We should not think that we are unable to contact the Lord because we are busy with work. We must believe that the Lord&rsquo;s arrangement is the best environment for us to be built up. Many sisters say that if they were single, they would be like Mary. This is a simplistic thought, because being like Mary does not depend upon a sister&rsquo;s marital status. On the contrary, even in the midst of a busy schedule, involving taking care of her husband and children, it is possible for a sister to contact the Lord and receive some perfecting. Sometimes even a maid, who quits as soon as she is trained to do household chores, can be used by the Lord to perfect a sister. Similarly, when a situation arises that prevents us from fellowshipping with the Lord at a set time, the difficulties and hardships can still be an opportunity for us to have real fellowship with the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WHAT WE DO DEPENDING ON WHAT WE ARE</h2>
<p>In order to perfect and help the brothers and sisters, a living in fellowship with the Lord must become part of our very being. We can only perfect others according to what we are. A person can only perfect someone to be like him; anything other than this involves acting. We can encourage the brothers and sisters only with what we have learned. What we present to others should come out of our actual living before the Lord. If we learn this way and live this way, we will be able to lead the brothers and sisters in the same way. If we only pretend to be spiritual, our work will never be spiritual. A senior brother once said, &ldquo;Our work can never surpass what we are,&rdquo; and I can fully confirm this word. Our work and our leading can never surpass our living and our learning. We can only supply others according to what we have learned and how we live.</p>
<p>Although there are certain skills involved in leading others, the most fundamental point is that we need to exercise to live before the Lord. The Chinese have a good proverb, which says, &ldquo;What is inward is reflected on the outward.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus said something even better: &ldquo;Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks&rdquo; (Matt. 12:34). This means that what we are within will be manifested without. We cannot hide what we are, even if we try. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, His glory was revealed even though it was concealed behind the veil of His flesh and even though He did not seek to reveal it. When a person moves a glass of water that is filled to the brim, some water will spill over. The Lord was filled with God&rsquo;s riches and glory to such an extent that whenever He moved or did anything, His glory was manifested. Everyone He contacted sensed the glory of His divine life.</p><h2 class="head1">BECOMING MORE USEFUL THROUGH MORE EXERCISE</h2>
<p>When we exercise to contact God, we will be able to supply the saints. The basic requirement for supplying others is our fellowship with the Lord. If we are filled with the Lord inwardly, our spirit will be living and fresh, and there will be no barrier between the Lord and us. Thus, whenever we are with the brothers and sisters, we will be able to contact them in spirit. It is not enough for our spirit to be released; our spirit needs to be released in order to supply others. We should take every opportunity to pray and praise; we should also speak and supply others. We need to have such a spirit, a spirit that is fresh, living, strong, open, and easily released.</p>
<p>We need to exercise our spirit in order for its function to be strengthened, just as we need to exercise our physical body in order to strengthen our body. This is a principle in the Bible. Luke 8:18 says, &ldquo;Whoever has, it shall be given to him, and whoever does not have, even what he thinks he has shall be taken away from him.&rdquo; The more we exercise our spirit, the stronger our spirit will become and the richer its function will be. In contrast, the less we exercise, the weaker we will become. I hope that all the responsible brothers will fellowship with the Lord more and exercise more.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EVERYONE FUNCTIONING</h2>
<p>All the brothers and sisters should function and supply others according to their respective portions. We need to consider the condition of those who are in the meeting. If a brother who seldom comes to the meeting is present, we should show concern for him. If a brother is absent several times, we should visit him and invite him to come again. When he comes to the meeting, we should speak a few words of concern and greeting, and after the meeting we can walk with him to the street. Sometimes because of this simple care, the Lord will lead him to come to the meeting the following week. This can be compared to the circulation of blood in the body. Even a small amount of blood circulation can have a great influence and prevent a serious illness. If we function to care for people, we will become living and be able to supply others. Hence, we should not think that we are unable to do anything because we are not a leading one. There are many things that we can do.</p>
<p>In the small &ldquo;classes&rdquo; everyone can be a supplier. Sometimes the prayer of a brother is a little weak, but it is still possible to add to and strengthen his prayer; there is no need to correct him. This will be a helpful demonstration to him, and unconsciously, he will learn something. The fellowship in the &ldquo;class&rdquo; should not fill the time to the point that the saints are unresponsive; everyone should endeavor to add something according to their portion. In this way there will be a rich supply.</p>
<p>Sometimes after the fellowship, there may still be a need to strengthen the crucial points. When someone brings out a crucial point and we have a feeling to follow him, we should strengthen the point. We need to learn to coordinate to the point that we are speaking as one person. A basketball player needs training in both personal skills and in coordination with others. Basketball is not a game for individuals; it is a team sport. Similarly, our priestly service is not a matter of individual service; it is a matter of corporate service. A basketball team passes the ball around, and in our meetings we should mutually coordinate in this way.</p>
<p>The only way to bear this burden is to bear it together. We should labor together. When everyone is serving to carry this burden, the burden will not be too heavy for anyone. Once the weight of a heavy load is distributed among those who are bearing the burden, the weight will not be heavy for just a few. The more we share the burden together, the lighter it will be. We need to coordinate in matters related to the word, to prayer, and to fellowship. These may seem like small, trivial matters, but the success of our practice depends on these details. If we take care of these details, our &ldquo;classes&rdquo; will be profitable.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO THREE CRUCIAL POINTS</h2>
<p>Concerning the small &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; we must pay attention to three crucial points. First, in regard to the message, the speaker must be very exercised and should not speak in a routine manner. Second, the ones bearing responsibility in the &ldquo;classes&rdquo; must be flexible, not rigid. Third, the saints should cooperate in a good way. If we can take care of these three points, the &ldquo;classes&rdquo; will be effective, and as a result, many brothers and sisters will be supported and built up.</p>
<p>We need to treat this matter seriously; it is not something that we have done before. The brothers who have been speaking for the past eight or ten years should not think that they have experience in this new way. Please do not have this concept. Our spirit must be living and fresh; we must absolutely have a sense of newness and have genuine fellowship with the saints. Formerly, the entire time of our message meeting was devoted to the message; now at least one-third of the time must be devoted to fellowship among the saints. We must have a new beginning. The brothers must take the lead not only to practice and to pray but also to do it well and to do it thoroughly. If we cannot do it well, there will be no change.</p>
<p>Although the time devoted to the &ldquo;classes&rdquo; is not that long, we cannot afford to let the time slip away. We should grasp the opportunity to fellowship with the saints who do not meet regularly. However, we should not do anything impulsively; instead, we should prepare by having fellowship with the Lord and by seeking to advance in what we do in the meeting. We should not think that we are too busy to consider such things. We should exercise and prepare during the week. On our way to work we can consider these matters. After work, while walking on the street, we can consider them. Perhaps the Lord will give us a feeling that a certain aspect in the previous meeting was somewhat weak and that we need to fellowship with others about it. There are many lessons that we can learn from taking this way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IMPROVING THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</h2>
<p>Concerning the bread-breaking meeting, I will share some feelings and thoughts based on my observation. First, the saints are strong and living in spirit, and they are even vying for opportunities to pray and fellowship. This is very good. However, the saints do not coordinate with one another in their speaking because of a lack of training. This situation can be compared to a car that is running at full speed but without a definite direction. Even though the meeting is very rich, the riches are displayed as if they are separate items on a grocery stand, which have not been coordinated together to produce a fully satisfying meal. For example, one person may share about being a priest, another about the Holy of Holies, and still another about the throne. Others share about living water and grace and still others share about eternity, the ancient times, and the Alpha and the Omega. We not only pray in this way, but we also sing in this way. I simply want to point out the fact that we need more exercise. With more exercise we will become more coordinated, and our &ldquo;driving&rdquo; will become more focused.</p>
<p>In the bread-breaking meeting, we must pay attention to our worship of the Lord and of the Father. Many saints do not know how to apply their knowledge of the Lord and of the Father in prayer and praise. When we gain some knowledge of the Lord, we should be able to apply it in the bread-breaking meeting. Our prayers should speak of the eternal nature of the Lord because we have knowledge of the Lord in this aspect and some consciousness of it as we are breaking the bread. The Lord is eternal, and when we touch Him, what He gives is eternal and what He works into us is also eternal. The Lord&rsquo;s forgiveness of sins is eternal, His redemption is eternal, the life He gives is eternal, His presence within us is eternal, and His leading in us is eternal. Although we live in time and space, eventually time and space will end, but the Lord is eternal.</p>
<p>Therefore, we need to know the truth related to the Lord. Our knowing cannot be entirely subjective according to our feeling, experience, or standing; we need to know the objective truths concerning the Lord Himself. The material for our &ldquo;classes&rdquo; provides us with this objective knowledge. Any believer, however, who has some genuine, objective knowledge of the Lord, must also have some subjective experience of Him in relation to these truths so that the truths can be applied. When the brothers speak of knowing the Lord, they are presenting objective truths. In the &ldquo;classes,&rdquo; however, the saints need to be given some explanation and demonstration so that they can apply these truths in their daily exercise.</p>
<p>We should follow this principle in every meeting, whether it is a big meeting in the meeting hall or in a small meeting in the districts. We need to lead the saints but avoid giving too much correction. Too much correction affects the spirits of the saints, and it truly does not matter if the saints make some small mistakes. This does not mean that we should not be aware of the situation but only that our adjustments should be slight. If the spirits of the saints are living, we will move past any mistakes and make progress.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEADING PEOPLE TO PRAY<br />
AND SERVE IN SPIRIT</h1>
<p>There are two verses in the New Testament that speak of the relationship between God&rsquo;s dwelling place and our spirit. Ephesians 2:22 says, &ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; We are being built together in the Lord to be a dwelling place of God, and this dwelling place is in our spirit. First Peter 2:4-5 says, &ldquo;Coming to Him...you yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house.&rdquo; We are being built up to be a spiritual house; hence, building is closely related to our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING BUT NOT SEEING<br />
SIGNIFICANT SPIRITUAL RESULTS</h2>
<p>In recent years we have established numerous regular weekly meetings, and we even have special times for special meetings. In nearly every meeting a message is given. We give a message at the end of the bread-breaking meeting, and we do the same in the prayer meeting. There is rarely a meeting that does not involve giving a message and listening to a message. According to our concept, a meeting without a message would not have much meaning. In addition to meetings, we have many service activities. We are thankful that the elders and those in the various districts give of their time and strength in the Lord&rsquo;s service. Many brothers and sisters have jobs or household responsibilities. Additionally, some do not have much free time, some are not physically strong, and some are financially limited. Although the saints are under various kinds of limitation, all willingly participate in the services in the church. In short, we have many meetings, and we also have numerous service activities. However, if we carefully review our situation, we will realize that the spiritual results from these meetings and activities are not satisfactory. We have many meetings with many messages, and we also have many activities, but the spiritual results do not match the amount of our labor.</p>
<p>Consider the bread-breaking meeting. If seventy saints meet on the Lord&rsquo;s Day in a certain district, fewer than half release their spirit to worship God by praying and praising in the meeting. If even half the saints would open their spirit, exercise their spirit, and release their spirit to pray, praise, and worship, the meeting would be more living and enriched. Regrettably, more than half the saints never exercise their spirit to pray in the bread-breaking meetings. The saints who prayed this month are the same ones who prayed in prior months. Simply speaking, those who pray always seem to pray, and those who do not pray never seem to pray.</p>
<p>We should not think that the number of saints in the bread-breaking meeting prevents some from praying. Someone who does not pray in the bread-breaking meeting tends to be weak in the matter of personal prayer as well. Even if such a one were praying with only another brother, he would still be hesitant in his prayers. His prayers are like smoking flax in need of being fanned into flame (2 Tim. 1:6). Many of the saints who do not pray are not occasional visitors; they regularly attend the weekly message meetings and the bread-breaking meetings. Nevertheless, they do not pray, and they do not open their mouth or exercise their spirit. No matter how much we try to help, they always seem reluctant to pray. According to a conservative estimate, this is the condition of more than fifty percent of the saints. If, among seventy saints in a bread-breaking meeting, thirty-five would pray regularly, the meeting would become richer and more living. At most, only thirty to forty percent of the saints function regularly.</p>
<p>We have worked in Taipei for many years, holding many conferences and trainings. Moreover, the elders, co-workers, full-timers, and responsible ones in the districts all labor in service together. In spite of this, very few saints pray regularly in the meetings. If we only had large joint meetings, which do not provide many opportunities for the saints to open their mouth, it would be understandable that many do not pray. However, there are more than thirty districts in the church in Taipei, and for a period of time the saints have been exercising to release their spirit and blend in spirit. Nevertheless, we still have only limited results. We continue to hear good reports that the number of saints who are praying is increasing and that their prayers are stronger, but we cannot be satisfied with this. Although we have many meetings, give many messages, and have many activities, the percentage of saints who open their mouth to exercise their spirit and release their spirit in the meeting is still too low. This indicates that our spiritual condition is poor.</p><h2 class="head1">EXERCISING OUR SPIRIT TO PRAY</h2>
<p>Our spiritual results are poor because we do not exercise our spirit, even though we have many meetings, give many messages, and have many activities. We are trying to build up our work with meetings, messages, and activities but not through the exercise of our spirit. This is the reason for our lack of results. For example, in hall one, after the message meeting, the saints pray in small groups, and I have participated in some of these small groups. If there are seven or eight saints in a small group, three or four are reluctant to pray; their voices even sound as if they were sick. Furthermore, it is difficult to understand the words of their prayer. We have practiced praying in small groups after a message meeting for three to four months, but the situation has not changed. In every group there are always two or three who are released to pray. These are the same ones who pray in the prayer meeting and the bread-breaking meeting. They always pray. In the small groups their prayers are fluent and strong, and their spirit is released. Hence, even in the small groups, some almost always pray, and some almost never pray.</p>
<p>We must come back to God&rsquo;s Word and consider our work; that is, we need to consider what God&rsquo;s goal is for the saints. Is it for them to be in meetings, for them to listen to messages, or for them to be involved in some service? Rather than just this, we must bring them into the dwelling place of God in spirit; this is God&rsquo;s ultimate goal. We must admit that the spiritual result of our work is poor. We began more than ten years ago in Taipei, laboring in many meetings and giving many messages, but only a small number of saints are living and released in spirit. We have not brought the saints into the spirit. After considering and analyzing our work in these days, I have no other burden.</p>
<p>This is the situation not only in our district meetings, but even in our co-workers&rsquo; meetings. Some co-workers attend the co-workers&rsquo; meeting throughout the year but never pray, and some elders attend the elders&rsquo; meeting regularly but never pray. We must realize that the way of our leading determines the kind of fruit that we bear. In the past, our work consisted of meetings, messages, and service activities. We did many things, but we were very short of prayer. Since we did not pray, the saints under our care did not pray either. People can only produce children who have their same racial and ethnic traits. If we rarely pray in spirit, how can we produce people who pray in spirit? We say that the work in Christianity only brings people to a Sunday service, but we should ask ourselves, &ldquo;Where are we bringing the saints? Are we bringing them into the spirit? Have we caused them to be enlivened in the spirit?&rdquo; If we look at the results of our work, it should cause us to be in fear and trembling. We have not brought many saints into the spirit, and there are not many whose spirit has been enlivened as a result of our service and work.</p>
<p>In a recent elders&rsquo; meeting I fellowshipped that we should not bring up any matter to discuss in our times of fellowship but, instead, that we should pray more. We should pray, and we should even fast and pray. Looking at the results of the past decade, we should no longer do things according to the old way. The elders truly need to pray. In the past the brothers surely endeavored to labor, but laboring according to our old way is not enough; we need to exercise our spirit more. We must study how to lead the saints to worship in spirit in the meetings so that they will not merely come to attend a meeting and listen to a message. In the past we emphasized inviting people to the meetings and listening to messages, but we did not lead them to exercise their spirit to serve and worship. This is why so few of them can exercise their spirit to serve and worship. Many of the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones in the districts have not been delivered from the concept of just attending meetings and listening to messages; consequently, few really serve in spirit. We are used to having meetings and listening to messages, but we do not have the concept of exercising our spirit to serve in the meeting. When we come to a meeting, we should exercise our spirit to serve, worship, pray, and praise. We must change our concept.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING PEOPLE TO PRAY AND SERVE IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Many who participate in the service meetings feel that they are merely coming to another meeting; few have the concept that they must exercise their spirit to serve and worship. Formerly, we were not clear concerning our lack, but now that we are clear, we should no longer merely give messages, listen to messages, or labor in activities; we need service that is in spirit. Our goal is not to just bring people to the meetings, because meetings are not our ultimate destination. We must lead people into the spirit, because a dwelling place in spirit is our ultimate destination. We should not bring people just to listen to a message, but we must bring them into the spirit.</p>
<p>If we desire to bring people into the spirit, we must exercise our spirit and pray; this is the key. If we use our mind, we will bring people into their mind, and if we use our emotions, we will bring people into their emotions. We can bring people only to the place where we are. Thus, if we use our spirit, we will bring people into the spirit. Although the saints have been attending many meetings, we rarely bring them into the spirit. As a consequence, their spiritual growth has been very slow, and their spiritual insight has not progressed. The saints can experience spiritual growth, receive spiritual enlightenment, and be delivered from sins only when they touch God in spirit. If we continue to meet, give messages, and serve in activities without bringing the saints into the spirit, we cannot expect them to touch God in their spirit.</p>
<p>A message without the Spirit is mere doctrine, and a message not spoken in spirit is mere letter. Such a message cannot touch the human spirit, and if a person is not in spirit, he cannot be enlightened or touched by God while listening to a message. Only a person who fellowships with God in spirit can be enlightened inwardly to see his sins, corruption, flesh, natural man, and natural disposition. Only a person who contacts the Spirit in his spirit and is touched by God can have real knowledge and real growth.</p>
<p>Our knowledge and experience of the Lord should not be merely doctrinal. For example, both <em>Hymns,</em> #78 and #510 speak of various items of the riches of Christ, but if we commit these items only to our memory, we are increasing only our mental knowledge, not our experience of Christ. Christ can never be experienced in our mind through doctrines. We must touch the Spirit in our spirit and allow the word of God, the living word of God, to enlighten us. This is the way to genuinely touch the riches of Christ. We need to know the riches of Christ in reality. Every real experience of Christ depends on touching the Spirit in our spirit, not on doctrines.</p><h2 class="head1">GENUINE BUILDING BEING IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The greatest hindrance to the genuine building up in coordination is our opinions. Every person has opinions. If a person did not have any opinions, it would be very easy for him to coordinate with others. Whether young or old, we all have opinions. Sisters have opinions, brothers have opinions, and even newly saved ones have opinions. I have never met a person who does not have an opinion. The only place where we can be delivered from our opinions is our spirit. Our spirit transcends opinions. When we bring the saints into the spirit and we are all pursuing in spirit, praying in spirit, exercising the spirit, and releasing the spirit, we will not have any opinions. The more a person exercises his spirit, the fewer opinions he will have, whereas the more a person remains in his opinions, the less he will exercise his spirit. This is a spiritual law: a person who prays little has many opinions. If a person has many opinions, he is surely lacking in prayer. The more we are in spirit, the fewer opinions we have; once we are in spirit, we are delivered from opinions.</p>
<p>The genuine building of the saints is in spirit. God&rsquo;s dwelling place is a spiritual house, a dwelling place in spirit (Eph. 2:22; 1 Pet. 2:5). Oneness is not the result of everyone having the same opinion but of everyone being in spirit. This can be seen in Paul&rsquo;s speaking concerning the oneness of the Spirit in Ephesians 4:3. Our oneness can never be based on trying to have the same opinion but on being in spirit.</p>
<p>If we only study doctrines, the result will be division. This is another law that we cannot escape. Doctrinal discussions only increase the distance between us and generate more opinions. One opinion generates another opinion, which, in turn, generates yet another opinion. The only place where we can be rescued from our opinions is our spirit. Those who pray in spirit and even pray forth their spirit do not care for doctrines or opinions. On one hand, they are very clear concerning doctrines and opinions, but on the other hand, they do not care for any doctrine or opinion, because they know that being in spirit is the key.</p>
<p>God desires that we be in spirit. When we are in spirit, there will be no problems, even if we differ in our opinions or views, because we will be one in spirit. Hence, when the Bible speaks of the oneness of the saints, the oneness in the church, it is referring to the spirit. Ephesians 2:22 says, &ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; Our being built together is in spirit, and what we are building up is the dwelling place of God in spirit. How can we have the building if we do not bring the saints into the spirit? In order for the saints to have genuine growth and to really know themselves, including the corruption of their natural man, we must help them to turn to the spirit. In order to really experience Christ and touch His riches, they must turn to the spirit. In order to have genuine oneness and genuine building up to become God&rsquo;s dwelling place, they must turn to the spirit. Presently, however, the serving ones are very neglectful of this point. We pay attention to matters related to meetings, messages, and activities, but we neglect leading the saints to their spirit. I have a heavy burden concerning this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING STEADFASTLY</h2>
<p>I hope that all the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones in the districts will receive this burden from the Spirit. We must weep and pray concerning our lack, crying out to the Lord. We meet, but we exercise our spirit very little; we preach the gospel, but we exercise our spirit very little; we listen to messages, but we exercise our spirit very little; and we labor in activities, but we exercise our spirit very little. We have everything, but we do not pray. If all the saints would have this sense, the Spirit would surely overturn the condition of the church.</p>
<p>Concerning the prayer time in the small groups after the message meeting, we need to improve our skills in leading the saints. Nevertheless, I have an even heavier feeling that the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones in the districts are short in exercising their spirit and inadequate in their prayer. This is not a matter of just changing our methods. We need to change our concept; we need to have a change in ourselves. We have fellowshipped concerning releasing the spirit, blending in spirit, learning to be priests, and ministering in spirit; however, the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones still have not touched the burden behind these points. They are satisfied with our meetings, messages, and activities, but they are not dissatisfied with our shortage of prayer in the spirit. If they truly felt this lack, they would immediately change their focus from activities and messages to turning to the spirit.</p>
<p>This is a serious matter&mdash;we need to turn to our spirit. We need to pray to be a Christian anew. Our prayer is inadequate; our spirit is not strong, and we do not release our spirit. If we do not take heed to the matter of bringing the saints into the spirit, we will lead them astray. If we are not willing to turn to the spirit to pray, we cannot bring others to their spirit to pray. If we do not open our mouth and exercise our spirit in the meeting, we cannot expect the saints to open their mouth and exercise their spirit when they come to the meeting. If the co-workers, elders, and responsible ones in the districts do not change their concept, we will only address the symptoms of our root problem, even if we change our methods.</p>
<p>In the past, the elders, co-workers, and responsible ones have labored much. However, there are thousands of saints in the church in Taipei who function only a little and whose spirits are not strong, in spite of the fact that they come to meeting after meeting, hear message after message, and labor in activity after activity. This situation grieves me very much. We cannot allow this situation to continue. We must turn to the Lord and begin to learn that the only thing that matters is prayer in spirit. Acts 1:14 speaks of the apostles and the saints continuing &ldquo;steadfastly with one accord in prayer.&rdquo; Later, the three thousand, who were baptized following Peter&rsquo;s message with the eleven, continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers (2:42). The work of the apostles came from their prayer, and the result of their work was to lead people into prayer.</p>
<p>If we look at our work, however, thousands have been saved, but only a few hundred pray in the meetings. This is because our work did not come from prayer, and we have not led people into prayer. It is pitiful that many saints, who obey the word, fellowship with one another, and break bread, are lacking in prayer and in the exercise of the spirit. Is the prayer in our districts dead or fervent, feeble or prevailing? Is the spirit strong or weak, living or half dead? We need to have a clear understanding and realization that merely having meetings, giving messages, and doing activities is inadequate if we are short in prayer and in the exercise of our spirit. We must wake up; we need to begin with prayer and work to bring people into prayer. We must continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word (6:4).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1>
<h1 class="title">BUILDING UP THE CHURCH IN SPIRIT<br />
AND LEARNING TO LEAD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Thes. 5:17-18; 2 Tim. 2:2; 3:14</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH<br />
BEING ENTIRELY IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The building up of the church is absolutely a matter in our spirit. Whether we are an elder, a co-worker, or a responsible brother or sister in a district, if we do not live in our spirit and do not bring the saints into their spirit, there will be no building. Genuine spiritual building does not mean that we have the same goal or even that we are in agreement in our opinions or views. Genuine spiritual building is the result of receiving the Lord&rsquo;s grace and exercising our spirit to the extent that we are persons who live in spirit. Being in the spirit, living in our spirit, is the only thing that matters; everything else is secondary. Being in the spirit satisfies the Lord&rsquo;s heart, and it delivers us from the old creation and dead doctrine. When we truly live in our spirit, we will experience Christ and live by Him.</p>
<p>Being in spirit is the practical reality of being in Christ. Our experience of Christ is absolutely a matter in the spirit. If we do not touch the spirit and are not in the spirit, all our talk about Christ is just doctrine. We can touch Christ practically only when we are in the spirit. God&rsquo;s essence is Spirit; everything of God is in the Spirit. If we are not in our spirit, we will never touch God. We can live in God, experience Christ, and be in the building only when we touch the Spirit in our spirit.</p>
<p>The oneness of the church is the genuine building, and this oneness is the oneness of the Spirit (Eph. 4:3). The oneness of the Spirit is in our spirit. Many times our &ldquo;oneness&rdquo; only reflects our agreement related to certain items of the truth; it does not manifest the genuine oneness in our spirit, much less the oneness of the Spirit. In order to have the oneness of the Spirit, we must be led by God to the extent that we live in our mingled spirit. Being in spirit is the genuine oneness, and it produces the genuine building. If we have not received the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to this extent, we are still short in the matter of building.</p>
<p>If we cannot bring the saints into the spirit, we cannot lead them to be built up. The most important matter is to bring them into the spirit. We may lead the saints to attend meetings and read the Bible, we may fellowship with them, and we may invite them to our home for a meal, but these are only means and procedures to bring them into the spirit. Even when we lead the saints to consecrate themselves to the Lord, to pursue spiritual knowledge, and to deal with sins, these matters are procedures; they are not the ultimate goal. If we lead the saints to consecrate themselves without bringing them into their spirit, we have not reached the goal. If we lead the saints to read and study the Bible without bringing them to their spirit to contact the Lord, we have not reached the goal. Similarly, if we lead the saints to deal with their sins to remove the barriers and hindrances to their fellowship with the Lord, we must lead them further to enter into the spirit to fellowship with the Lord. Our only goal should be to bring the saints into the spirit.</p>
<p>In the past we did not pay adequate attention to this matter. Although we led the saints to deal with their sins, we did not emphasize that the purpose of dealing with sins is to enter into the spirit to have fellowship with the Lord. Similarly, we led the saints to attend meetings, but we did not emphasize that the meetings are for entering into the spirit to serve God as priests. We led the saints to consecrate themselves, but we did not show them that the purpose of consecration is to let God occupy their whole being so that they may have more fellowship with Him in spirit. In short, we led the saints in numerous spiritual matters, but our goal was not clear and definite; that is, we did not emphasize the need to contact the Lord in our spirit.</p>
<p>The work that we have done is not without value and benefit; however, our work has not reached the goal. We lead people to salvation, but we do not bring them into the spirit to contact the Lord. We lead the saints to attend meetings, but we do not lead them to serve in spirit. We lead them to read the Bible, but we do not lead them to contact the Lord through the words of the Bible or to use their spirit to turn the words of the Bible into prayer. We lead them to consecrate themselves, but we do not tell them that consecration separates them from everything of themselves so that they can turn to the spirit to contact the Lord and to let the Lord gain them more. We lead them to love the Lord fervently and to receive the Lord&rsquo;s dealings, but we do not show them that loving the Lord and receiving His dealings enable them to be more intimate with Him in spirit and to live more deeply in the spirit. Since we do not have a strong focus on the saints being in spirit, the saints have not gained something solid or seen this matter clearly.</p>
<p>All the elders, co-workers, and responsible ones in the districts must see that our labor, whether in preaching the gospel, helping the brothers and sisters, edifying the saints, or administrating in the church, has only one goal&mdash;to bring people into God, that is, to bring them into the spirit to live in spirit. When we reach this stage, the church will be manifested. The reality of the church is manifested and the church is built up only to the extent that we are in the spirit. If we have deep and extensive experiences of being in the spirit, the building up of the church will be deep and extensive. However, if we have only shallow and limited experiences, the building up among us will be shallow and limited.</p><h2 class="head2">Turning to the Spirit through Prayer</h2>
<p>Prayer is the only way to help a person to turn to the spirit. No one can turn to the spirit without praying. Even when we are doing a small task, we must do it in the spirit. We must pray in order to turn to our spirit. Without praying, it is impossible for us to turn to our spirit. For example, if we are going to visit a brother and fellowship with him, we must turn to our spirit to pray so that we can fellowship with him. The Bible rarely speaks of doing something unceasingly, but it says that we must pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). The thought of waiting to be led to pray is a wrong concept. There is no ground for waiting if we are to pray without ceasing. Just as we breathe without ceasing, we should pray without ceasing. A saint should not say, &ldquo;I do not have the leading to pray now.&rdquo; We do not have the ground to say that we cannot pray, nor do we have an excuse to say that there is nothing to pray about. Every moment is a moment for prayer; nothing should prevent us from praying.</p>
<p>Some saints say, &ldquo;As we are learning to be priests, we need to pray, but we have run out of topics for prayer, and we often use the same words.&rdquo; Actually, there are many topics of prayer. Paul says, &ldquo;In everything give thanks&rdquo; (v. 18). This means that we should pray and give thanks in everything. If we truly understand the meaning of giving thanks in everything, everything will become a topic for prayer. Everything in our daily living can be a topic for prayer. Wherever we are, whatever we encounter, and whatever we do can be topics of prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practice of Prayer</h2>
<p>Shortly after I was saved, I was taught that in order to pray, I needed to shut the door to my room and set aside a period of time to be quiet before the Lord. This concept influenced me greatly. For quite a while I believed that I had to dedicate time and be quiet in a room by myself in order to pray. However, this concept restricted my experience of prayer too much. If God arranges our circumstances so that we can set aside some time and shut the door to pray, this is very good. However, prayer does not depend on this kind of arrangement. This is especially true in this day and age. Most of the houses in Taiwan are small, and it may not be possible for a person to find a quiet room in which to pray. Some saints have large families living in about one hundred square feet of space. If they depended upon having a quiet room in order to pray, they would not be able to pray at all.</p>
<p>I have learned many lessons, and I realize that prayer should not be limited to specific times and circumstances. On one hand, if time allows and circumstances permit, we should set aside time and pray in a quiet place, just as the Lord Jesus sometimes went up to the mountain and spent the night in prayer (Luke 6:12). On the other hand, we should also pray even in the midst of our busy schedules. Since we do not have much practice of praying at every time, the exercise of our spirit is limited and weak. If we began to pray during our busy schedules, the exercise of our spirit would be strengthened. We would also not be short of topics, because every point in our daily life can bring out a topic for prayer. For example, when a relative calls and expresses the desire to come and see us, we should look to the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, lead me in my speaking to him.&rdquo; Such a prayer will bring us into the exercise of our spirit. I am concerned that even the co-workers are lacking in the exercise of the spirit because they do not have a habit of praying at every time in every place.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Strengthening the Spirit by Exercising to Pray</h2>
<p>My spirit was very strong when I was in the hands of the military police during the Japanese occupation of China; it was even stronger than when I was holding a conference or conducting a training. I was in prison for thirty days, and, other than eating and sleeping, I could only pray. Although I was the primary target, six other brothers were in the prison with me because of their association with me. I was separated from the other Chinese prisoners and put in a cell with a Greek national. At that time my spirit was very strong, because I was praying at every moment, and I experienced the Lord&rsquo;s instant answer to my prayers. Even though the seven of us were not in the same jail cell, we could see one another. When a brother was taken for interrogation, I would pray continually during his interrogation. When we received any news, I would pray. I prayed for every situation that I saw, and my spirit was very strong during this time. I prayed constantly, and my prayers were very spontaneous.</p>
<p>When it was my turn to be interrogated, the interrogation would typically last for three hours, and my experience was fully according to Matthew 10:19, which says, &ldquo;When they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you should speak, for it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak.&rdquo; I could not prepare any answers in advance. I could only look to the Lord and answer according to the Spirit&rsquo;s instant leading. When I was being escorted to the interrogation room, I would pray because I did not know what they would do. One time I was asked about the location of a certain brother, who had moved with the national government to an inland area. I immediately prayed and asked the Lord what I should say. If I claimed ignorance, I would surely be beaten, because they would accuse me of lying, since they already knew that the brother had moved to the inland area. I could only look to the Lord for an answer. The Japanese also knew that we financed his trip; consequently, they also asked where he got the money for the trip. Again I looked to the Lord, but just as I was about to answer, they suddenly changed subjects, dropping the matter of his location and the money. I really worshipped the Lord, seeing His instant answer to my prayer. At that time my spirit was very strong, and I did not have any opinions.</p>
<p>If we use the circumstances in our life as topics for prayer, we will not run out of topics. For example, when we come to a meeting and encounter a brother who is about to give the message, we can pray, &ldquo;O Lord, give the brother the utterance, and strengthen his spirit!&rdquo; When we see the brothers and sisters, we can pray, &ldquo;O Lord, cause every brother and every sister to have an open spirit.&rdquo; If we see a brother who has not been in the meeting for a while, we can utter a prayer, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, speak a word specifically for him tonight so that he can touch You in his spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we pray in this way, an answer to our prayers is a secondary matter; the primary matter is to exercise our spirit. Not long ago, I would feel tired after walking for only twenty minutes. I realized that this was because I traveled everywhere by car and would sit down as soon as I reached my destination. It was difficult to walk a long distance, because my legs lacked exercise. Today I try to walk as much as possible. The primary point concerning prayer is the need for our spirit to be exercised so that it becomes living and strong. Some brothers and sisters have not prayed for a long time, and even when they are in a dire situation, they still cannot pray. This can be likened to a person whose legs are weak because he has not exercised them through walking. Our spirit should be strengthened to the extent that we can pray a simple prayer no matter what we encounter, even if the prayer is only to ask the Lord for mercy. Even when we take the bus or cross the street, we can pray for the Lord&rsquo;s covering. In this way, our spirit will be strong, fresh, and living. This is the primary point.</p><h2 class="head2">Praying with Praises</h2>
<p>Our prayer should not be limited to just confessing our sins. Some people say, &ldquo;I do not need to pray right now because I have confessed my sins already.&rdquo; Our prayers, however, should not be focused on just our sins; we should also consider the Lord&rsquo;s glory, greatness, virtues, kindness, mercy, faithfulness, and power, and offer praises to Him. We may not be able to praise the Lord seven times a day as David did (Psa. 119:164), but we can praise Him at least once a day. When we consider our vast and unlimited Lord, how can we be without topics for prayer? Each of His attributes can be a topic of our prayer, including His holiness, righteousness, light, and life. He is worthy of our praise.</p>
<p>If we do not have words of praise for Him, it is only because of our lack of exercise. When we are first learning how to do anything, we need to practice. For example, it is rather easy to ride a bicycle, but it is not easy if we have never been on a bicycle. If we want to learn how to ride a bicycle, we must practice. If we are short in our exercise of praising, extolling, and giving thanks to the Lord, no words will come forth when we want to praise. Some brothers and sisters can only say, &ldquo;Praise and thank the Lord,&rdquo; or &ldquo;Thank and praise the Lord,&rdquo; because they do not practice regularly. We can practice praising by turning the content of the Psalms into praises. We do not need to recite them methodically; we can simply turn the verses into praises. With practice we will be able to turn to our spirit and praise God like the psalmists.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Turning Bible-reading into Prayer</h2>
<p>When we read the Bible, we should turn the words in the Bible into prayer. According to my experience, we should pray more than we read the Bible. When I was young, I spent too much time reading the Bible and not enough time praying. Sometimes I would spend eight hours a day to read the Bible but not even eight minutes to pray. I cultivated a habit of reading the Bible; I especially enjoyed studying the numbers in the Bible. Although I liked to study the numbers in the Bible, as soon as I began to speak about them, an inner voice would stop me. Studying numbers in the Bible nurtured my mentality, but it did not strengthen my spirit. Even though I went through several copies of the Bible, my spirit was not strong, and when I prayed, my spirit could not come forth.</p>
<p>I hope that the young saints would devote the same amount of time to prayer as they do to reading the Bible. Every sentence and every word should be turned into prayer. Every verse that touches us should be turned into prayer. Even if only a few verses touch us when we read a chapter, we should turn these into prayer. Every verse in the Bible is able to touch me. When we are willing to turn every verse into prayer, every verse will be an inspiration to us. As soon as we turn a verse into prayer, inspiration will come. For example, when we read Matthew 1:1, which says, &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham,&rdquo; we may not have much feeling related to it, but when we turn the verse into prayer, inspiration will come. It is hard to know how the Spirit will use this verse to inspire us, but the Spirit will be able to speak when we pray. The inspiration that the Spirit gives to one brother may be different from what is given to another brother, but the Spirit will be able to inspire everyone.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying in Addition to Listening to Messages</h2>
<p>Similarly, after listening to a message, we must pray. If we do not turn the content of the message into prayer, we are like a person who sees food but does not eat it. No matter how many gospel messages a person hears, he must pray in order to be saved. This is an irrefutable law. The gospel is useless to a person who does not pray, no matter how well the gospel is preached or how much a person is touched by it. Not praying after hearing the gospel is like not eating food that has been presented to us. This also is the case with listening to messages. If we hear a message and are touched, we need to pray in order to receive the edification. If we do not pray, the messages will not be received in a deep way or leave much of an impression in us.</p>
<p>For example, when we attend a meeting and see that the subject is &ldquo;The Importance of the Spirit,&rdquo; we can immediately turn this subject into prayer, saying, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for the importance of the spirit; show me this matter more fully.&rdquo; Even with such a short prayer, there will be a sense of the Spirit&rsquo;s moving in us. This kind of inspiration cannot come from just listening to a message.</p>
<p>We should pray when we listen to a message, when we read the Bible, and when we are in a meeting. There are too many items for which we can pray. When we help the young saints to learn to pray, we should teach them to use the words of the Bible. If they feel that they do not have words for prayer, we can read the Bible with them, musing and chewing on the words of the Bible and turning the words into prayer. Gradually, they will have more utterance in their prayers. The Bible contains all the subjects that we need for prayer. If we practice praying with the words of the Bible, I believe that the brothers and sisters will be strengthened in their spirit. Whenever we come together to meet, we should not wait for others to pray; every saint should be a person of prayer. The reasons that we wait are because our spirits are not connected, and we are not skilled in prayer. We all must use our spirit to pray.</p><h2 class="head2">Praying without Waiting to Be Led</h2>
<p>Many people think that if they are not led, they do not have to pray; but if we are waiting to be led, we will not have any leading. I hope all the brothers and sisters will see that we need to exercise to pray, and we need to use our spirit when we pray. Instead of waiting to be led, we should actively exercise to pray with our spirit. If we do this, we will progress. Our ears and eyes are well coordinated in their function because we have used our ears to hear and our eyes to see from when we were young. Our eyes and ears are quite skilled because of much exercise. Our spirit needs to be exercised in this same way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Praying at Every Time and in Every Place</h2>
<p>With the fall of man, the spirit in man ceased to function according to its intended use. Man&rsquo;s sense of intuition and fellowship with God was lost because of sin. When we were saved, our spirit was enlivened, but even though we can exercise our spirit, we do not have much experience of exercising our spirit. Even after some brothers become elders or co-workers, they do not exercise their spirit regularly. This is also true of brothers bearing responsibility in the districts. Our mind may be sharp, our hands and feet may be quick, and our eyes and ears may be keen, but our spirit can still be sluggish. Without exercise, our spirit is the weakest part of our whole being. Hence, we need to pray more. The more we pray, the more we will enter into our spirit. When we first begin to pray, we may not necessarily be in spirit; but as we pray, we will be in spirit more and more. We should pray for big things as well as small things. We should pray at every time, in every place, and for everything; this is more important than setting aside a time for prayer. As we enter into this practice, our spirit will become living and strong.</p>
<p>If we learn to pray in spirit, we will have a strong sense that our opinions are worthless. We will come to despise our opinions and will no longer have a high regard for them. If anyone asks us for our opinion, we will feel that our opinion is meaningless and worthless, and we will not quickly utter it; rather, we will have a strong desire to pray with the person who is asking for our opinion and touch the spirit together with him. How we respond to requests for our opinions is a strong indication of whether we value our opinions more than prayer. In the spirit there are not many opinions and not many things to discuss and debate; the primary sense in our spirit relates to our need to touch God. In the spirit, matters related to biblical exposition, doctrines, opinions, and methods are not central. The only indispensable matter is to touch God.</p>
<p>This is a law. Someone who prays has far fewer opinions than a person who prays very little. A person who has many opinions prays very little. A saint who prays before the Lord does not feel the need to express the opinions that he may have. If a certain matter is mentioned to him, he is often unwilling to discuss it too much, because his way is to pray. As soon as something is mentioned, he will begin to inwardly pray. There are no opinions to discuss and no matters to study and decide; there is only prayer. Such a saint can touch his spirit in any environment and in any situation. Today the building up of the church depends upon saints who are exercised to pray in spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT ALLOWING SITUATIONS IN THE CHURCH<br />
TO RUN THEIR COURSE BUT LEARNING TO LEAD</h2>
<p>In order to build up the church, we must be in our spirit. As we are learning to turn to our spirit, we also need to learn how to lead others into the exercise of the spirit. All the elders, co-workers, and responsible ones in the districts should learn how to lead, and there are many lessons to learn. For example, when a person hears the gospel, we should lead him to pray and receive the Lord. We cannot merely bring a person to hear the gospel and let him just sit and listen. We must learn how to lead him to pray and receive the Lord. If we do not know how to lead him to pray to touch the Lord, he will not be saved.</p>
<p>Flowers often die when I plant them, but they thrive when someone else plants them. Flowers do not bloom when they are in my hand, but they bloom in another&rsquo;s hand. This is a matter of knowledge. We need to learn how to lead others. After a person is saved, baptized, and begins to meet, we should be able to lead him to fellowship with the Lord, to touch the spirit when he reads the Word, to consecrate himself to the Lord, to live a life of consecration, to receive the Lord&rsquo;s leading, and to live in the fellowship. In this way, he will be built in the church.</p>
<p>We should also learn how to lead in the prayer meeting and bread-breaking meeting. For example, we should keep a good record of how many people are in the meeting and how many are absent. We should also find out why people are absent. If it is related to us or to the meeting, we should correct it so that these ones will come back. If it relates to a personal matter, we should help them to resolve it if possible. We should even endeavor to render some special leading and teaching to those who attend the meetings regularly so that their functions may be manifested.</p>
<p>All the elders, co-workers, and responsible ones in a district should come together to pray and seek the Lord concerning the brothers and sisters whom they should visit, concerning which co-workers should assist in solving the problems of the saints, and concerning who is able to deal with the needs of the sisters. We should take care of these matters in a thorough way. We must know the condition of the saints, because they are a flock of sheep under our care. A shepherd knows thoroughly the condition of his flock (cf. Jer. 31:10; Ezek. 34:12). We should know which ones urgently need to be flocked together, who needs to be restored, comforted, and helped, and even who has special needs financially. We should handle all these situations in a fine and proper way, looking to the Lord even for the financial help.</p>
<p>If we do not know how to lead the saints, we will do great harm to the church. For example, in one district there are more than eighty sisters and about one hundred brothers. Eight sisters and twenty brothers will come one week for the prayer meeting, and five sisters and thirty brothers will come the next week. No one, however, seems to have any feeling about these fluctuating numbers. Although the attendance at the bread-breaking meeting is about the same from week to week, there is still a gradual decline. Nevertheless, there seems to be no sense of concern about this. This shows that we do not know how to lead.</p>
<p>We should not let matters in the church simply run their course. There is a need for leading. We should consider why the saints are not released in their spirit in the meeting. For example, it may sometimes be related to the singing of the hymns. If this is the case, we should find a way to correct the singing. There is always a way. Even people in the world say, &ldquo;Where there is a will, there is a way.&rdquo; We should surely have a higher expectation, because we have the Lord. We serve the Lord, we worship Him, and we labor in His work. How can He not help us? Singing hymns is not a simple matter. Some hymns should be sung a little faster; if we sing them too slowly, our spirit will become sluggish. If the spirits of the saints are not released, the meeting cannot go on. Furthermore, we need to find out why many saints do not come to the prayer meeting. We must study the situation so that we can render a certain amount of leading to them.</p>
<p>God created us as living human beings with a spirit. Since we are human, we have to take care of our human conduct; for this we need to have much learning and teaching. In 2 Timothy 3:14, Paul says, &ldquo;Continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from which ones you have learned them,&rdquo; and in 2:2 he says, &ldquo;The things which you have heard from me through many witnesses, these commit to faithful men, who will be competent to teach others also.&rdquo; After Timothy heard Paul&rsquo;s teachings, he was exhorted by Paul to commit these teachings, that is, to teach Paul&rsquo;s teachings, to those who were competent to teach others. We should learn, and we should teach others. Our teaching is our leading. The brothers and sisters have a heart and love for the Lord, and they are willing to enlarge His kingdom and spread the gospel so that the Lord may deliver more people, gain more glory, and build up the church in a real way.</p>
<p>We must learn every day because there is no time for us to learn later; we must learn while doing. If we pay special attention to exercising our spirit, we can be learning and leading at the same time, and the church will have a way to be built up. If, however, we neglect the spirit and allow the meetings to just run their course, the building up of the church will be nothing more than empty talk. On one hand, all the saints must be in the spirit, and on the other hand, the elders, co-workers, and responsible ones in the districts must endeavor to learn. We can lead others only with what we have learned. All the matters related to service require learning because they cannot be carried out by our natural ability. Without learning spiritual lessons, we will not be able to build up the church, because our natural ability has no place in the building. We cannot serve with our natural ability, thinking that it is enough to follow the Lord according to our own ideas. Since we love the Lord, we have to learn how to lead the brothers and sisters in the meetings and how to care for them.</p>
<p>God in His mercy has placed us in the church in a certain place to care for the brothers and sisters; therefore, we have to bear this responsibility. We should diligently learn and continually learn; the more we learn, the more we will be able to teach others and lead others. The building of the church depends on the exercise of the spirit by all the saints, and it depends on the elders, co-workers, and responsible ones in the districts to endeavor to learn and to endeavor to lead. If this is our situation, the road ahead in regard to the building will be open before us and promising.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAY-READING THE BIBLE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">READING THE BIBLE AND PRAYING<br />
IN ORDER TO GROW IN LIFE</h2>
<p>Every Christian understands that in order to have genuine growth in life, a believer must read the Bible and pray. In recent years many saints among us have been exercised in the matter of reading the Bible and praying. Since 1958, when we began to fellowship concerning how to pray-read the Word, eat and drink the Lord, and enjoy God, many saints, either individually or in small groups, have risen up to pray-read and to enjoy God together. Hence, many saints have substantial experience in pray-reading. We need to pay further attention to the exercise of our spirit to strengthen our spirit so that we can minister in the spirit and serve God as priests, thereby becoming a priesthood to be built up together to be the glorious dwelling place of God. Since this is the Lord&rsquo;s leading, the way to go on has become clearer, and our speaking concerning this has become simpler. The way to go on is by pray-reading the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESS OF LEARNING TO PRAY-READ</h2>
<p>When we reflect on how the Lord led us to practice pray-reading, we must admit that we have encountered many difficulties in learning how to practice pray-reading. Nevertheless, pray-reading is actually very simple. Learning how to pray-read was not easy because it was new and unfamiliar, and even though we saw something, we still felt that the path was rugged and difficult. Whenever a person begins a journey toward a new destination, he turns here and there and looks left and right in order to find the way. When he reaches the destination, however, he often realizes that he could have taken a simpler and more direct way. It is the same with learning to pray-read. Even in 1958, when I released the messages on how to enjoy God by eating and drinking Him, I was not as simple and concise as I could have been in my speaking concerning the way of reading and praying, praying and reading, because our experience was still developing at that time.</p>
<p>The more we touch the matters of exercising the spirit, serving as priests, and ministering in the spirit, the more we have God&rsquo;s leading. Now we are able to speak of a way that is easy, rich, simple, and expedient. We are not overturning our practice from the past; rather, we are providing a better way for the saints. Before we adopt a new practice, we must consider many aspects based on the situation of the saints. For example, if some saints cannot readily accept a new practice, we can begin by making modifications and improvements based on the old practice. We do not have to change everything immediately; we should allow the saints to adjust gradually.</p>
<p>When I first arrived in Taiwan, I got lost as I was hurrying home on a bicycle. When I stopped and inquired about directions, I realized that I was headed in the wrong direction. Even though I had lost much time, I dared not to go too fast when I turned around; instead, as I pedaled, I constantly checked to make sure that I was going in the right direction. It is the same with spiritual pursuit. We may feel that we are endeavoring to go forward, but because we are not clear about the way, we may take a meandering way and even temporarily be further from our destination. However, as we become skilled in taking a straight way to reach our destination, we no longer need to look at the road.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLES OF PRAY-READING</h2>
<p>Pray-reading is a simple way. First, it requires the exercise of the spirit. Second, it enables us to receive a supply of God&rsquo;s word without waiting vainly to be inspired and moved by the Spirit. Third, it is easy to practice. Even a new believer can learn how to pray-read as long as he has a desire. Fourth, it enables us to easily receive God&rsquo;s word. Pray-reading can even help those who have difficulty speaking God&rsquo;s word, because it takes away the excuse that they do not have any words or feelings. With pray-reading, it is easy to receive the word and touch the feeling in the word.</p>
<p>It is best to practice pray-reading in small groups of six or seven people. A saint who pray-reads by himself is too isolated, and pray-reading with just two saints can be difficult if only one is exercised. However, ten saints are too many. It is best for six to eight to pray-read together mutually. This can be likened to starting a fire with wood. One piece of wood is not enough, and it is even difficult to start a fire with two pieces of wood. However, it is easy to start a fire with six to eight pieces. When we pray-read with six to eight saints, there is a mutual kindling; the saints kindle one another, and a fire can be quickly ignited.</p>
<p>There is no need to use many verses when we pray-read, but there is no legality either. Recently, some saints were pray-reading the first three verses of Hebrews in a small group. The leading one felt that three verses were not enough, but in fact, these three verses are too much because of their rich content. Hebrews 1:1-3 can be divided into two sections. The first section is on God&rsquo;s speaking of old in many portions and in many ways to the fathers in the prophets and of His speaking to us at the last of these days in the Son. The second section speaks concerning the person and work of the Son. Both sections are rich, and they should be pray-read and digested separately.</p><h2 class="head1">DEMONSTRATING PRAY-READING</h2>
<p>John 1:1-4 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. He was in the beginning with God. All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being. In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; These four verses can be used as a section for reading and praying. Before praying with these verses, the main points should be mentioned but not explained, because explanations sometimes become a hindrance. It is sufficient to briefly mention the main points: <em>The Word</em> refers to the Lord Jesus, who is God. He was God in the beginning, and He was with God. He created all things, and all things came into being through Him. Life is in the Word, and this life is the light of men.</p>
<p>When we pray-read, any feeling that we have should be expressed in the way of prayer; if we have some feeling, we should not interrupt the prayer to speak, even in the way of fellowship. If we have some feeling, we should spontaneously express it in our prayer, and if we do not have any feeling, we can simply pray according to the verses that we are reading. If our prayer contains the words that we are reading, we will discover that the more we pray, the more feeling we will have. Furthermore, when one person prays, his prayer will stir up another person to pray, and then a third person will have some feeling to pray. When we do this, we will be like six or seven pieces of firewood piled up together and burning spontaneously. When one &ldquo;piece&rdquo; is on fire, the other &ldquo;pieces&rdquo; will catch fire. This kind of practice in pray-reading will then bring in fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BENEFITS OF PRAY-READING</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Spirit Being Exercised</h2>
<p>We should read through the verses and then immediately enter into prayer. In the past we would spend an hour reading the Bible, but we would rarely pray. Some saints, who regularly attend the meetings for Bible-reading and Bible-study, understand the Bible, but it is still not easy for them to pray, because their spirits have not been exercised. This can be compared to a person who spends his entire day in a chair, sitting without much movement. When he wants to walk, his legs will not have much strength. Similarly, if we only listen to messages, read the Bible, and fellowship with one another, but we do not pray, our spirits will be very weak when it is time to pray. The present way of pray-reading is very simple: we pray immediately after reading, and we all pray. If we read the Bible for ten minutes, we need to pray for twenty minutes. This exercise greatly benefits the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Understanding the Thought in the Bible<br />
and Receiving a Supply</h2>
<p>As a result of pray-reading, our spirits will be exercised, and we will have a thorough understanding of the thought in the Bible. When we turn the words of the Bible into prayer again and again through pray-reading, our spirits will be exercised, and the thought in the Bible will be transmitted into us. In this way, we will have clear thoughts, rich utterances, and a strong spirit. By pray-reading in this way, the divine word will spontaneously be assimilated in our spirit to be our supply.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Pray-reading Being Easy<br />
and Having Words for Prayer</h2>
<p>The practice of pray-reading is very easy; it is not difficult at all. When we pray with words from the Bible, there is no basis for saying that we have no words to pray. When we pray with words from the Bible, we do not need to use our own words. For example, when a brother is teaching others how to pray, the learners do not have to pray their own words; they simply need to repeat the words of his prayer. The Bible is the Lord&rsquo;s words to us, and our pray-reading is our repeating of His words back to Him. For example, we can turn the words of John 1:1-4 directly into prayer, saying, &ldquo;Lord, thank You that in the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God. O Lord, thank You. All things came into being through You; in You there is life, and this life is the light of men.&rdquo; This is a very good prayer. Others can follow and use the verses to pray a few more sentences. For example, another brother can pray, &ldquo;O Lord, You are the Word of God that speaks forth God. Without You we cannot know God.&rdquo; This is a further step of turning the words in the verses into prayer. Then another brother can pray, &ldquo;O Lord, You are the embodiment and the explanation of God; You created all things to explain God. If there were no heaven and no earth, we could not know God. But through the things that have been created, the eternal power and divine characteristics of God can be clearly seen.&rdquo; Still another brother can pray, &ldquo;Praise You, Lord. You are the Word, the explanation of God. You not only created the heavens, the earth, and all things, but You also became flesh and tabernacled among us. Your conduct and speaking as a man explained and manifested God.&rdquo; Then another brother can pray, &ldquo;Lord, I thank You and praise You. Your life in me is the light. With Your life, I am inwardly full of light. You are both the Word and the light, and You are also life. When this life comes into me, it shines within me. You are the Word that explains God and that enters into me to be life.&rdquo; When we read the Lord&rsquo;s word with prayer in this way, it is so rich. This kind of prayer is inexhaustible. Even if we vary in how we turn our words into prayer, no one will be without words or feelings. If six or seven people in a small group turn the Lord&rsquo;s words into prayer in this way, everyone will be supplied inwardly, and everyone will be filled with the Lord.</p>
<p>When we pray, we do not necessarily need to close our eyes; we should never make closing our eyes into a regulation. In the Gospel of John, when the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father, He lifted up His eyes to heaven (17:1). There is no command in the Bible that we should close our eyes when we pray. Some people say we should kneel to pray, but there is no command related to this either. I am not against closing our eyes to pray; I often close my eyes when I pray, but this is not a regulation. Some who cannot recite the verses from memory can read the verses as they pray. While they are praying, it may seem as if they only are using their mind to speak, but actually they are exercising their spirit. This can be likened to a little child who is learning to walk; he needs others to guide, support, and protect him as he gradually learns to walk. When a saint is first learning to pray-read, it may seem as if he is using only his mind to pray the words of the Bible. Nevertheless, his spirit can still be activated. This is because prayer is a matter of the spirit, just as walking is a matter of the legs. With much exercise, his spirit will become skilled in prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BLENDING PRAY-READING<br />
INTO OUR PRACTICAL LIVING</h2>
<p>After we pray-read, the Lord&rsquo;s words will be spontaneously realized in our daily living. For example, when speaking of the Lord being the light of life, someone can pray, &ldquo;Lord, You are the light. When we touch You, You shine in us. Your light guides us every moment to minister and to serve, and it also releases us and restricts us.&rdquo; In this way, the Lord&rsquo;s words will become part of our living and will even be realized in our daily living. When a saint is in the middle of a painful situation, for example, the words from his pray-reading can shine within and enable him to turn from his present situation and afflictions to prayer. There are still many details related to how to receive the best benefits from pray-reading, but pray-reading will help the saints greatly. In summary, we need to endeavor to turn our Bible-reading into prayer. This is a simple way to exercise our spirit, to receive the supply from the Word, and to enjoy the Lord practically.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">PRAY-READING IN SMALL GROUPS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PRAY-READING IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship further concerning the exercise and practice of pray-reading in small groups. If we receive this fellowship, we will receive a great benefit. We should use the time after the bread-breaking meeting and after the prayer meeting to practice exercising together. This will eliminate the need to set up another time; it will be convenient and save time. Most of our bread-breaking meetings are more than one and a half hours long, but an hour is sufficient. The remaining thirty minutes should be used for pray-reading the Bible, not just studying the Bible. We should read some verses in a simple way and then turn them into prayer. If six or seven people pray-read together in a small group, we will be greatly benefited.</p>
<p>We can also practice pray-reading after the prayer meetings. If attendance is small, there is no need to pray for an hour. Thirty to forty minutes will be sufficient to pray over the prayer items related to the church. The remaining time can be used to practice pray-reading in small groups. This will give us at least two opportunities every week to practice pray-reading, one after the bread-breaking meeting and the other after the prayer meeting, and there will be no need to gather the saints at another time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAY-READING IN THE VISITATION OF SAINTS</h2>
<p>When we visit the saints with members of our small group, we can pray-read with them. We should make a list of dormant saints to be recovered and visit them. For example, we can invite a brother to come to our home on an evening during the week, or we can make an appointment to visit him on the weekend with a few other saints. If these are not convenient times for him, we can ask him if another time would be better. We should let him know that we will bring some saints for a time of singing hymns, reading the Bible, and praying. A visitation by a group is much more powerful than a visit by just one person, and there will be a better result. When a group visits a saint who does not meet regularly, they can fellowship and sing with him, and they can exercise by pray-reading. These visitations will restore some dormant saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PAYING ATTENTION TO<br />
READING THE BIBLE AND PRAYING</h2>
<p>In the past we were not very balanced in the matters related to reading the Bible and praying. Either we would read the Bible more than we prayed, or we would pray but not read the Bible. Many saints feel uncomfortable when we begin to speak of prayer. Some say that they do not know how to pray, others say that they do not have words to pray, and still others say that they do not have any feeling when they pray. As a consequence, they do not pray. When we exercise to pray-read, however, we are reading the Bible as well as praying. This kind of reading does not emphasize studying or even sharing about a particular point that has touched us. Instead of studying and sharing, we should begin to pray immediately after reading through a portion of the Scriptures, turning the Scriptures that we have read into prayer. In this way, it is very easy to pray. Those who do not know how to pray can pray by simply speaking the Lord&rsquo;s words back to Him. At the same time, those who have no words of their own can pray with the words of the Bible.</p>
<p>When we have words, inspiration will follow. Many saints testify that when they begin to pray-read, they do not have much feeling, but when another brother prays, it stirs up their feeling and willingness to pray. This situation can be likened to placing six or seven pieces of firewood so that each piece of wood is burning the other pieces of wood. Eventually, everyone is on fire when we pray-read. This kind of exercise is very good. Although we may read only one or two verses, the words that we utter in our prayers will be full of supply. Moreover, the supply that we receive will carry over into our practical living. Pray-reading is very simple, and it produces rich results. Many saints can confirm this point.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICAL MATTERS REQUIRING<br />
OUR CONSIDERATION</h2>
<p>In our exercise of pray-reading in small groups, we should decide in advance on the Bible verses to use. In principle, the portion should not be too long or too short. If the portion is too long, the saints will not be able to digest it. This can be compared to eating a very large breakfast. If a breakfast includes porridge, pickled vegetables, and steamed buns in addition to milk and bread, it will be difficult for a person to digest all the food because his morning appetite is often smaller than his appetite at other meals.</p>
<p>The specific verses should be selected based on two factors. First, a portion can be selected based on its content alone. For example, some portions in the Bible are rich, and other portions touch deeper matters. New believers, however, may not be able to easily enter into the thought in these deeper verses. Second, a portion can be selected according to the condition of the members in the small group. When a mother is preparing a meal, she should be aware of who will be eating. If only babies are being fed, milk, rather than solid food, should be prepared, but if young adults are coming to dinner, some solid food must be prepared. Hence, in selecting a portion of the Scriptures, the condition of the group should be considered in addition to the biblical content.</p>
<p>The main points of the verses should be mentioned as well, but there is no need for a lengthy explanation. The main points should be mentioned only briefly.</p>
<p>When pray-reading in a small group, the saints should be helped to pray short prayers. It is sufficient to mention only one point, but at the most, we can mention two points. Some saints have the capacity to pray about every point, and they often pray in this way out of concern that all the points may not be covered. Instead of being helpful, however, this is a hindrance. When the saints pray together, there must be an atmosphere of mutuality. There is no need for one person to pray about every point. When we pray together, one brother can pray about one point, and another can pray about the next, and so forth. This is prayer in coordination.</p>
<p>Luke 1:1-4 says, &ldquo;Inasmuch as many have undertaken to draw up a narrative concerning the matters which have been fully accomplished among us, even as those who from the beginning became eyewitnesses and ministers of the word have delivered them to us, it seemed good to me also, having carefully investigated all things from the first, to write them out for you in an orderly fashion, most excellent Theophilus, so that you may fully know the certainty of the things concerning which you were instructed.&rdquo; If we read this portion of the Scriptures, a brother can begin by praying, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for coming to the earth. If You had not come, we would not have known God.&rdquo; When he finishes, another can continue, saying, &ldquo;Thank You, Lord, that Your living on the earth has been preached by those who witnessed Your accomplishments. Thank You that we know of You through their preaching.&rdquo; A third brother can continue, saying, &ldquo;Praise the Lord! Your accomplishments were not only witnessed and preached by men, but some even wrote them down so that we can witness them in our reading. Thank You that we are now Your witnesses.&rdquo; When we pray in a mutual way, all the points will be covered, and there will be no need for one person to cover all the points.</p>
<p>If the six or seven members in a small group spend thirty minutes exercising to pray-read in this way, there will be opportunities for everyone to pray, not just once or twice, but even six or seven times. In such a prayer, there will be a mutual &ldquo;burning&rdquo; that carries over into our daily living.</p>
<p>After pray-reading in this way, we will be able to use the Scriptures to fellowship, explain, and utter the spiritual sense that we have gained. When we join the Word with prayer, our spirit will be exercised, and the Lord&rsquo;s word will enter into us. This is much deeper than just using our mind to read and study the Bible; it affects us more deeply and feeds us in our spirit.</p>
<p>In order to practice pray-reading in small groups, we should select appropriate verses from the Bible and determine the right portion to pray-read. Second, we should bring out the main points in a pertinent way. Third, we must not pray long prayers or try to cover all the points in one prayer. Each person should pray over one point or at the most two points. After one person prays, another should continue and also pray a short prayer so that everyone can have an opportunity to pray. However, we do not need to be rigid in taking turns; that is, we do not always need to pray in the same order. For example, a brother may have a feeling to pray again after only one other brother has prayed. This is not a problem if we do not pray long prayers. In summary, the principle is that we would take turns and pray according to the sense that we have within our spirit. When all the saints pray by adding something to the prayers of the other brothers and sisters, the pray-reading will be very rich, and the feelings in each other&rsquo;s spirit will be drawn out in the prayer.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">ENJOYING VARIOUS CATEGORIES<br />
OF WORDS IN THE BIBLE</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PROGRESSING IN OUR PRACTICE OF PRAY-READING</h2>
<p>Many saints acknowledge that pray-reading is simple and practical, and they testify that pray-reading fills them with satisfaction when they touch the Lord. Presently, our practice is in a beginning stage, but as we go deeper and progress further, we will realize that pray-reading is not a rigid matter; there are many details that we need to consider.</p>
<p>The more we practice pray-reading and the more we touch the Lord&rsquo;s word, the more we grow. This fellowship is not based on human imagination, nor is it just a theory; rather, it is based on experiences gained through practice. To pray-read means to turn the word of the Lord into prayer while reading the Bible. Although it is simple to practice, it involves many items. In this chapter we will fellowship about some of these items.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE WORD ACCORDING<br />
TO CATEGORIES OF WORDS IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The Bible is the word of the Lord, and it provides life as spiritual food to man. It contains many elements. A good meal includes various dishes, such as fish, meat, and vegetables, but cooking a meal is not always easy. For example, simmering meat in a soup or frying it in a pan will produce different results. Different foods also require different cooking methods. Even eating food involves the use of different utensils. Western cuisine is eaten with a knife and a fork, whereas Chinese food is eaten with a pair of chopsticks. Different utensils require different ways of eating. Likewise, there are also many details related to &ldquo;cooking&rdquo; and enjoying the word of the Lord.</p>
<p>The words in the Bible can be categorized in many ways, and we need to consider and digest the riches contained in these words. There is not a single, uniform method that we can use to digest the words in these various categories; rather, we should digest them according to their differences. Just as different types of food require different ways of eating and different utensils, different categories of words in the Bible also require different ways of digestion. This is a general principle. The words in the Bible can be divided into many different categories, but we will cover only a few prominent categories.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning the Lord&rsquo;s Person and Work</h2>
<p>The first category of words in the Bible concerns the Lord&rsquo;s person and work. The Bible reveals the person of the Lord, and it also shows the Lord&rsquo;s acts and deeds, His work. Whenever we touch words in this category, we need to worship, praise, and give thanks. For example, John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God,&rdquo; and verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh.&rdquo; These verses speak of the person of the Lord. We need to digest and assimilate these words in prayer through worship, praise, and thanksgiving. We can say, &ldquo;Lord, You are the Word that was in the beginning; You are worthy of our worship. Lord, You were with God, and You are God. We praise and worship You.&rdquo; We need to use words of worship, praise, and thanksgiving to digest the words concerning the person and work of the Lord.</p>
<p>When the Lord ate the bread and drank the cup with the disciples, He broke the bread and gave it to the disciples, saying, &ldquo;This is My body.&rdquo; And He took a cup and gave thanks, and He gave it to them, saying, &ldquo;Drink of it, all of you, for this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (Matt. 26:26-28). When we read these verses concerning His work, we need to pray with praise, saying, &ldquo;Lord, we praise You. Thank You for giving up Your body for us and for shedding Your precious blood to establish a new covenant so that our sins could be forgiven.&rdquo; We need to turn the Lord&rsquo;s word into prayer with a spirit of worship, praise, and thanksgiving to digest the Lord Himself and to receive Him with His work.</p>
<p>After receiving, we can enjoy what He is and what He has done. The Lord&rsquo;s word is the bread of life, the living water, light, and life for our enjoyment. For example, when we see that the Lord stretched out His hand to touch the leper and said to him, &ldquo;I am willing; be cleansed!&rdquo; (Luke 5:13), we need to say, &ldquo;You are the Lord who is able to cleanse people. I worship and praise You. I receive You as such a Lord into my being. Remove all my uncleanness. Thank You for being willing to stretch out Your hand to touch and cleanse me. Lord, please touch me and cleanse me.&rdquo; This is to enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s person and work. With regard to words concerning His person and work, we need to worship, praise, receive, and enjoy.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning Our Living and Conduct</h2>
<p>The second category of words in the Bible concerns our living and conduct. When we read such words, we need to receive their teaching and correction. For example, there are many places in the Bible that speak of our need to be humble, meek, or watchful. Some portions tell us that we need to honor our parents, nurture our children, and deal with others properly in the Lord. There are numerous portions in the Bible concerning our living and conduct. When we read of such words, we need to receive their teaching and correction. These words also have the ability to enlighten us. When we receive their enlightenment, we are receiving the Lord&rsquo;s correction and teaching. After we receive the Lord&rsquo;s teaching, we should confess our impotence, saying, &ldquo;Lord, this is Your command, but I am unable to do it. I need to receive You into my being.&rdquo; We must confess our impotence to fulfill His words and teachings, and then we must receive the Lord as our power to fulfill them. We need to say, &ldquo;Lord, I cannot do this. I cannot make it, but I want to receive You into my being. Lord, be my inward strength to keep Your word.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Romans 12:11 says, &ldquo;Do not be slothful in zeal.&rdquo; As soon as we read this word, there is correction. We should not think that we have no need of correction because we love the Lord, know the Lord, and enjoy the riches of the Lord. According to experience, we need these teachings. Although we have been saved and are enjoying the Lord and tasting His riches, we still need to see that we are very slothful. We need the correction that comes through the Lord&rsquo;s word. We are short in meeting many of the Lord&rsquo;s commands. Even in reading the Bible and in praying, we are lacking in zeal. When we touch these words, we can pray, &ldquo;Lord, in my practical living I am still slothful and lacking in zeal. I cannot meet this demand. Only You are not lacking in zeal. Be the One keeping this word in me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we read words concerning our living and conduct, we need to receive their correction, we need to confess our inability to meet these requirements, and we need to receive the Lord as our power. We must digest these words in this way. Even those who have been recently saved can digest words in this category with simple prayers. They can say, &ldquo;Lord, I thank and praise You. Your Word says that we should not be slothful in zeal. Supply me so that I am not slothful in zeal.&rdquo; Even this simple prayer will have impact. We must come before the Lord, confess our shortage, receive His correction, and acknowledge that we are unable to keep His word. Our willing and our running do not work (9:16), but we can still say, &ldquo;Lord, only You can keep these words. If You do not come into me, I cannot do it. I want to receive You into my being as the power to keep these words.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning God&rsquo;s Plan, Work, and Purpose</h2>
<p>There are many portions in the Bible that speak of God&rsquo;s plan, work, and purpose. Whenever we read such words, we need to praise Him. This also shows a proper attitude of fear before the Lord. We should praise God for His plan, His work, and His determined will to gain the church as His glorious purpose. After praising, we need to intercede. For example, when we read of &ldquo;the church...His Body&rdquo; (Eph. 1:22-23), we need to praise the Lord and say, &ldquo;You have purposed that the church would be Your Body. You are the Head, and the church is Your Body. We are joined together in life, just as the head and the body are joined together.&rdquo; Then we should intercede, saying, &ldquo;Lord, cause the church to be manifested as the Body, with the function and measure of the Body.&rdquo; This is to intercede for the church. After we praise and intercede, we need to inquire of the Lord, saying &ldquo;As a member of Your Body, how should I function? What responsibility should I bear? How should I be joined with others in Your Body?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matthew 24:14, which speaks of God&rsquo;s purpose and plan related to the gospel, says, &ldquo;This gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth.&rdquo; After reading this, we can pray, &ldquo;Lord, praise You that You have purposed and revealed that the gospel of the kingdom will be preached in the whole inhabited earth.&rdquo; Then we can intercede, saying, &ldquo;Lord, there are still many places where the gospel has not been preached. The gospel has not even been preached thoroughly in the areas surrounding my locality. Lord, cause the preaching of Your gospel to spread further to reach more places.&rdquo; Lastly, we can inquire, asking, &ldquo;Lord, what responsibility should I bear toward Your gospel? How should I participate in its spread?&rdquo; When we read portions concerning God&rsquo;s plan, work, and gospel, we need to praise, intercede, and eventually inquire of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">Concerning Words of Enlightenment</h2>
<p>Another category of words in the Bible concerns words of direct enlightenment. These are words that specifically shine upon us. When we read words in the Bible that shine upon us, we need to have a receiving spirit. In our prayer we should express our willingness to receive the light. For example, the Lord said to the disciples, &ldquo;If anyone wants to come after Me, let him deny himself&rdquo; (16:24). This seems to be a word of teaching and instruction, but it can also shine upon us to expose our unwillingness to deny ourselves. There are also words of exhortation in the Bible. For example, James 1:21 speaks of &ldquo;putting away all filthiness.&rdquo; Under the shining of this word, we may realize the need to keep ourselves pure before the Lord. We can be enlightened concerning our condition when we read words of exhortation, and when we are enlightened, we need to pray, confessing our mistakes to receive the benefit of the enlightenment. It is not enough to pray, &ldquo;Lord, thank You for showing me that I should deny myself and put away all filthiness&rdquo;; we also need to accept the Lord&rsquo;s enlightenment, saying, &ldquo;Lord, in the light of Your word, I see that I still love myself. I do not even abhor what is filthy in me. I still am full of filthy things that have not been put away completely.&rdquo; When we encounter the Lord&rsquo;s direct enlightenment in our reading of His words, we need to respond.</p>
<p>After we receive enlightenment, we need to confess our sins. This is necessary. Words of enlightenment will cause us to see our shortages and to sense our need of confession. After we confess, we should seek forgiveness and apply the efficacy of the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood by faith so that we can go on, knowing that God has forgiven us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Our Responsibility before God</h2>
<p>Another category of words in the Bible concerns our responsibility before God, or God&rsquo;s requirement of us. When we read such words, we should express our willingness to meet the Lord&rsquo;s requirement. For example, the Bible explicitly says that we need to leave all and follow the Lord (cf. Matt. 19:27-28), and that we need to present our &ldquo;bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God,&rdquo; which is our reasonable service (Rom. 12:1). Words like these speak of God&rsquo;s requirements and of our responsibility to fulfill them. Therefore, when we pray-read such words, we need to express our willingness to meet these requirements and to pay the price. We cannot read these words with an unwilling attitude. We should even acknowledge our agreement to the Lord, saying, &ldquo;You have asked us to present our bodies, and I am presenting my body. You have asked us to leave all, and I am willing to say yes.&rdquo; After we express our willingness, we also need to entrust ourselves to Him, saying, &ldquo;Even though I am willing, I cannot do this by myself. I entrust myself to Your hand and to Your ability to fulfill it in me. Be my supply.&rdquo; We need to utter words of agreement and dependence in order to digest these requirements and responsibilities.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Our Fellowship with the Lord</h2>
<p>There are also words concerning our fellowship with the Lord, such as waiting for God (Psa. 130:5-6), panting for God, thirsting for God, and appearing before God (42:1-2). These words help us to fellowship with God, cause us to rejoice, and allow us to see God&rsquo;s light in fellowship. As we are digesting words related to fellowship, we should have the same attitude of those who uttered these words, praying to the Lord with the same words: &ldquo;My soul pants for You, O God. Here I wait for You. I come and appear before You.&rdquo; We should utter and digest words of fellowship with the same attitude, the same spirit, and the same words as those who spoke these words in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Patterns in the Bible</h2>
<p>There are many patterns mentioned in the Bible, such as Abraham and Enoch in the Old Testament and the apostles in the New Testament. When we read words concerning patterns, we need to thank God for the patterns. For example, the Bible speaks of how Paul was faithful, lived before God, did not account his own life as precious for the gospel of God, and cared for and loved the church. When we read these words, we need to pray, &ldquo;Thank You for giving us such a pattern. You chose Paul, and You equipped him, supplied him, established him, and presented him as a pattern for us.&rdquo; Then we need to ask for grace to follow these patterns, saying, &ldquo;Lord, I am willing to receive the same grace. If it pleases You, grant me the same grace so that I may follow Paul&rsquo;s pattern.&rdquo; We should praise, and then we should beseech the Lord concerning our willingness to receive the same grace.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning the Promises of God</h2>
<p>There are also words in the Bible concerning God&rsquo;s promises. When we read words of promise, we need to give thanks in order to digest these words. We need to thank the Lord and say, &ldquo;Thank You for giving us these precious, sweet, and rich promises. Thank You for these words.&rdquo; Then, with an attitude of receiving, we need to say, &ldquo;Lord, I want to receive these promises.&rdquo; However, we also need to acknowledge our limited faith, even our inability to believe. Since we do not have the ability in ourselves to believe, we need to say, &ldquo;Lord, all of my believing ability comes from You. I am unable to believe Your promises in myself. I need You to be my believing ability. I entrust myself to You and receive You into me as my believing ability.&rdquo; We should praise and thank the Lord for His words of promise, and then we should receive His words with a believing attitude by acknowledging Him as the believing One in us.</p>
<p>I hope that the saints will receive more help to enjoy the supply of the divine word in the Bible through pray-reading in this way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">COORDINATION IN THE MEETINGS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE COORDINATION OF PERSONS</h2>
<p>The first aspect of coordination in the meetings is the coordination of persons. For example, after a few brothers pray, it is better for a few sisters to follow. The brothers and the sisters should coordinate together to pray. If only the brothers pray in a meeting and the sisters do not respond, our meetings will be like a paralyzed body, which is neither beautiful nor living. We are not saying that the brothers and sisters should take turns in a set order; we are simply emphasizing that a coordination of persons is needed. In the meetings the brothers and the sisters need to coordinate with one another in a living way. After a few brothers pray, a few sisters should join in, and after a few sisters pray, a few more brothers should join in with more prayers. If the brothers&rsquo; prayers are too quick, the sisters may not be able to keep up. This requires the brothers to be willing to pause and wait so that more sisters can join in to pray. Furthermore, when there is a pause in the middle of a strong atmosphere of prayer, the sisters should realize that the brothers want them to join in. At such a time, the more experienced sisters need to pray immediately. If the experienced sisters do not pray, the young, meek, and timid sisters will be less likely to follow. Then when a sister joins in to fill the time created by the pause, the brothers need to realize that other sisters may follow. Thus, there is no need for the brothers to rush to pray again; they should leave time for more sisters to pray. The brothers also need to learn not to ignore others when they receive an inspiration.</p>
<p>In Genesis 32, when Jacob returned to the land of Canaan, he brought his wives, children, flocks, and herds with him. Later, Jacob met Esau, his brother. In 33:13-14, Jacob said to Esau, &ldquo;My lord knows that the children are frail and that the nursing flocks and herds are a concern to me; and if they overdrive them for one day, all the flock will die. Let my lord please pass on before his servant, and I will lead on slowly according to the pace of the cattle which are before me and according to the pace of the children.&rdquo; His young children and his nursing flocks and herds could not walk too fast, so Jacob accommodated them. Likewise, in the meetings we need to accommodate the sisters. Sometimes, as soon as the sisters begin to pray, the brothers take control of the direction of the prayer. If the sisters have more opportunities to pray, they will be more released.</p>
<p>I hope that the brothers and sisters will begin to pray in coordination in a strong way. Typically, more sisters than brothers attend the meetings, so they should be allowed to function more. This will fill the meeting with enjoyment. The brothers have a responsibility to give the sisters more opportunities to pray, and the sisters have a responsibility to offer prayers at the right time. This coordination will allow the functions of the brothers and the sisters to be carried out in a proper way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COORDINATION IN THE CONTENT<br />
AND THE LINE OF PRAYER</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Having Content and a Line in Prayer</h2>
<p>In addition to the coordination of persons in the meetings, there is also a need for coordination in the content and the line of the prayer in the meetings. This kind of coordination is even more difficult, so it requires more exercise and practice. For example, there should always be content and a line in the prayer at the bread-breaking meeting. The line of the prayer should climb higher and higher and eventually reach a peak in which there is a blessing of and a thanksgiving for the bread and the cup. When the atmosphere of remembering the Lord reaches the highest peak, the bread and the cup should be passed.</p>
<p>When the meeting reaches such a peak, we need to learn to remain at the peak, just as Moses remained at the top of Mount Pisgah, beholding the land of Canaan (Deut. 34:1). At such a point, we may not need to call a hymn or even utter more praise; we can simply and quietly contemplate the beauty of the Lord. This is not idle time but time at the peak. There is a sense of sweetness in the spirit when everyone reaches the point that there is no need to say anything. In such an atmosphere, we should be silent. If we have learned the lesson, we will not call a hymn or say anything that would disturb others and spoil the atmosphere of silence.</p>
<p>After the bread and the cup have been passed, a brother can pray, thanking the Lord for being our enjoyment. In such a way, the section of remembering the Lord will come to an end, and we can worship the Father. In the bread-breaking meeting, a great portion of time is for remembering the Lord, but there should be some time for the worship of the Father. A brother can start the worship of the Father by praying, and then the saints can follow. Perhaps another brother may be inspired to choose a fitting hymn to worship the Father; in this way, the saints&rsquo; singing will be very enjoyable.</p><h2 class="head2">Knowing the Lord as the Content</h2>
<p>It seems easy to describe the progression of a meeting, but in practice, much skill is needed. First, we need to know the Lord in order to have content for the meeting. Second, the brothers and sisters should coordinate with one another. To know the Lord is one matter, but to apply what we know in a meeting is another matter. We need to know the Lord and learn to coordinate with others to function in prayer in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Considering the Lord&rsquo;s Suffering</h2>
<p>Let us consider the Lord&rsquo;s suffering as an example of the content for a meeting. According to the Bible, the Lord&rsquo;s life of suffering can be divided into three major sections. The first section began with the Lord&rsquo;s birth and ended when He began to minister. His sufferings began from the time of His birth. The second section covers the period of His ministry; this suffering lasted for three and a half years on the earth. The third section includes the suffering in His crucifixion. When the Lord Jesus was praying in the Garden of Gethsemane before He went to the cross, His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground (Luke 22:44). This was the beginning of the suffering in His crucifixion. The Lord Jesus&rsquo; suffering in His crucifixion is the last section of His suffering. The first two sections of the Lord&rsquo;s suffering can be further divided into nine crucial points.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Suffering in His Birth</h2>
<p>When the Lord was born, His mother wrapped Him in swaddling clothes and laid Him in a manger because there was no place for them in the inn (2:7). This depicts the suffering in the Lord Jesus&rsquo; birth. Being wrapped in swaddling clothes indicates that there was no blanket, not even clothing. This implies a state of humiliation. Being laid in a manger indicates that even though He was born as a man, He did not have the status of a man. When we were born, we were not placed with cattle but with men. However, the Lord Jesus was laid in a manger, the place for cattle. There being no place in the inn denotes that there was no place for Him. These three brief points summarize the Lord Jesus&rsquo; suffering in His birth. The Lord Jesus was the Lord of the universe, the great God, but He became an infant. He went from being lofty to being lowly, from being great to being small, and from being rich to being poor. If we compare the Lord&rsquo;s status prior to His birth, we will realize how much the Lord suffered in His birth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Suffering in His Growth</h2>
<p>The Lord also suffered in His growth. A person&rsquo;s birth and growth are two different matters. Jesus was born in Bethlehem of Judea, but He grew up in Nazareth, a despised place. Bethlehem is a small city, but in the eyes of the Jews, it is the city of the royal family. Bethlehem is even called the city of David (vv. 4, 11) The highest king of the Jews&mdash;the Lord Jesus&mdash;was born in Bethlehem, the city of the royal family, but He did not grow up there. He stayed in Bethlehem for only a short period of time, and then He was forced to flee to Egypt (Matt. 2:13-15). When He returned to Israel, He did not go back to Bethlehem but to the region of Galilee. He lived in a small city called Nazareth; thus, He was called a Nazarene (vv. 21-23), which was a derogatory title. In John 1:45 Phillip found Nathanael and said, &ldquo;We have found...Jesus...from Nazareth.&rdquo; Nathanael reacted by asking, &ldquo;Can anything good be from Nazareth?&rdquo; (v. 46). In John 7:52 someone even said, &ldquo;Search and see that no prophet arises out of Galilee.&rdquo; Although the Lord was born in the respected city of the royal family, He grew up in a despised, small city.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Suffering in Poverty</h2>
<p>Isaiah 53:2 says, &ldquo;He grew up...like a root out of dry ground. / He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him, / Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him.&rdquo; This indicates that the Lord came out of a poor family. A poor family is like dry ground that is without a rich supply of nutrients. After the Lord Jesus was born, His parents took Him to Jerusalem to offer sacrifices according to the law. They did not have a lamb to offer but only a pair of turtledoves or two young doves to offer (Luke 2:22-24). This was the sacrifice offered by the poorest Israelites. Leviticus 12 clearly speaks of a lamb as the preferable sacrifice to be offered on behalf of a newborn. Verse 8 says, &ldquo;If she cannot afford a lamb, then she shall take two turtledoves or two young pigeons.&rdquo; Joseph and Mary&rsquo;s offering indicated their poverty. The Lord was born into a poor family.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being a Poor Man</h2>
<p>The Lord grew up in Nazareth, lived in a poor family, and was Himself a poor man. He seldom carried any money in His pocket. When some people came to take the temple tax, He did not have any money in His pocket. Rather, He told Peter to go fishing to obtain a stater from the mouth of a fish to pay for the tax (Matt. 17:24-27). When the Pharisees and Herodians joined forces to tempt Him, asking Him if they should give tribute to Caesar, He did not take out any money from His pocket; instead, He asked them to show Him a coin (22:15-19). All these accounts show that the Lord Jesus was poor.</p><h2 class="head3">Being a Carpenter on the Earth</h2>
<p>This poor man out of a poor family was a carpenter on the earth. Mark 6:3 says, &ldquo;Is not this the carpenter?&rdquo; In regard to the Lord Jesus&rsquo; suffering in being a carpenter, we can pray, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, we could have never imagined that You would become a carpenter. Just as a common laborer suffers and toils, You suffered and toiled.&rdquo; The Lord is certainly in glory and on the throne, but there is even more to praise Him for in regard to His being a carpenter on the earth. When the Lord created the heavens and the earth, He spoke, and it was; He commanded, and it stood (Psa. 33:9). However, He became a lowly carpenter on the earth. Carpentry requires much time and energy. Regarding this point, there can be rich development and deep prayer in the bread-breaking meeting. Furthermore, the utterance for such prayers will be full of taste and will touch our feelings. We can pray, &ldquo;Lord, You are the Creator, but You willingly became a poor carpenter.&rdquo; We can continue to pray, &ldquo;Lord, You even patiently did the work of carpentry for others; thank You that Your patience is available to us today.&rdquo; As long as we grasp the content, the Spirit will surely grant us much development.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Being a Man of Sorrows</h2>
<p>The Lord was a man of sorrows. He was born in a manger, grew up in Nazareth, came out of a poor family, and was a poor man and a laborer. He was truly a man of sorrows. Isaiah 53:3 says, &ldquo;He was despised and forsaken of men, / A man of sorrows and acquainted with grief.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head3">Having No Permanent Home,<br />
Traveling and Laboring Much, and<br />
Not Eating Regularly</h2>
<p>The Lord did not have a permanent home or a place where He could lay His head. Luke 9:58 says, &ldquo;The foxes have holes, and the birds of heaven have roosts, but the Son of Man does not have a place where He may lay His head.&rdquo; His situation was worse than that of the foxes and birds. He traveled everywhere and often made long journeys. One time, He was wearied from the journey under the burning sun, so He sat by a well and asked someone for water. When He asked for water, the one whom He talked with was not a noble person but a Samaritan despised by the Jews, even a Samaritan woman with a bad reputation (John 4:6-7). He asked for water from a lowly person, indicating how lowly He was and how much He suffered on the earth. In order to do the work of God, the Lord was so busy that He did not have time to eat. Mark 3:20 and 6:31 both record that because He was serving diligently and faithfully, He did not have time to eat. From the time of His birth, suffering was the mark of the Lord&rsquo;s human life. He was born in a manger, grew up in Nazareth, came out of a poor family, was a poor man, worked as a carpenter, and was a man of sorrows and acquainted with grief. Moreover, He did not have a permanent home, He traveled and labored much, and He did not eat regularly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Following One Another in Prayer<br />
according to the Line of Thought</h2>
<p>From these points, we can see the line of the Lord&rsquo;s suffering in a simple way. When the saints are praying in a bread-breaking meeting, they can follow one another in prayer according to a line like this. Some can pray about the Lord being born in a manger, some about there being no place for Him in the inn, and some about His being the great God who came as a small infant. As we praise Him for coming down from the throne in the heavens to a lowly place on the earth, the brothers and sisters can follow one another in prayer and praising. Such prayers will be full of enjoyment.</p>
<p>Then the brothers and sisters can pray concerning the Lord&rsquo;s growing up in Nazareth, following one another, section by section. No one needs to pray for a long time. It is a beautiful scene when twenty or thirty saints pray in such a way. After every section is covered, a brother can offer a comprehensive, concluding prayer. When the meeting reaches a peak, the saints can spontaneously stand up to praise and give thanks and bless the bread and the cup. This kind of meeting will be full of enjoyment.</p>
<p>This is not something idealistic, and we are not asking new believers to immediately reach such a level. Most of us, however, have been meeting for more than a decade, and this kind of prayer is possible in our meetings; this is not an unreasonable expectation. Ten years is sufficient time for a person to finish junior high school, high school, and college. We have been meeting for ten years, but we are short of practice, so we are not up to the standard. We should not look for excuses, saying that we have already fulfilled our obligations. In these matters we are not giving the saints the proper leading. We should take these matters seriously, and we must carefully consider them, because these practices are very fine and detailed.</p>
<p>Our coordination in prayer must follow the sequence of the line of the content. For example, before the section of the Lord being born in a manger is finished, we should not jump to the section of the Lord being a carpenter. This kind of prayer is not wrong, but it is random. If a sister prays about the Lord being a carpenter, and then a brother continues by praying about the Lord being born in a manger, it is out of order. Situations such as this show that we have not been trained adequately.</p>
<p>We also need to exercise to avoid being distracted from the subject. While all the saints are praying, praising, and giving thanks according to the line of the Lord&rsquo;s suffering, someone might be touched and feel that the Lord&rsquo;s love is marvelous. He might ignore the line of suffering and veer off from the subject to pray about the Lord&rsquo;s love. We need to learn to stay on the subject, remain on the same line, and follow one another. Our prayer should not only follow the foregoing prayers but also pave the way for subsequent prayers. This can be likened to playing a ball game, in which we need to coordinate with others; we need to not only catch the ball but also make the ball easier for others to catch.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CULTIVATING AN ATMOSPHERE AND<br />
PERFECTING THE NEW ONES</h2>
<p>If ten saints are coordinating together in each district, they will be able to gradually cultivate such an atmosphere. The responsibility falls upon the leading ones. If a team is playing well, those who later join the team will quickly catch up. In our meetings the saints who are coordinating together can establish a model in every meeting, while leaving time for others to function. Some saints are just learning how to praise, but they should still be encouraged, and other saints should endeavor to bring the meeting higher. With everyone functioning, the meetings will be up to the standard and enjoyable, and the new believers will be raised up. If we all receive this kind of training, the meetings will keep and supply the saints when a district meeting is divided into two. May the Lord have mercy on us so that our meetings may be strong to keep the newly saved ones.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING PRAYER</h2>
<p>We need to realize that prayer related to spiritual warfare involves three parties in the universe: God, man, and Satan. In fact, the universe is just the story of these three parties. The Bible speaks of God and man, but it also speaks of Satan, who is between God and man. Our prayer should always be related to God, man, and Satan. For the most part, however, our daily prayers are focused on ourselves. We often pray, &ldquo;Lord, be gracious to me. Take care of me. I have this need and that problem. Remember me.&rdquo; Our prayers are all about &ldquo;me,&rdquo; that is, our family, our children, our spiritual condition, our sins, our weaknesses, and our problems. These prayers are not high. We need to learn to pray about God, that is, God&rsquo;s plan, God&rsquo;s purpose, God&rsquo;s work, God&rsquo;s gospel, and God&rsquo;s church. We need to pray for God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire and to pray from the perspective of God. Such prayer is high prayer.</p></body></html>
