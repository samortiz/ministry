   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Any Christian worker who has not resolved the issue of money within himself and who is still bound by the power of money is certain to relate his field of work to money.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When he has to decide where he will work, his decision will surely be influenced by financial support.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He will go where there is financial support, and he will not go where there is no financial support.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His support becomes his guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If he only goes where there is support, surely he will not go to a poor place, or, if he goes at all, he will leave that place after a short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If another place is rich in support, he will spontaneously be drawn to their support, and he will think that God is leading him there.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some prayers and guidance follow monetary support.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This support becomes the focus of attention.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Profit and money drove Balaam to bother God again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He kept bothering God about whether or not he should go.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Over ten years ago, an elderly brother commented on the lamentable state of Christian affairs, saying, "See how many servants of God are after money!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>So many poor places are short of care, yet so many workers are frequenting big places which are already crowded with people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Is there something wrong with the guidance they have received?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This was a strong word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If a brother has not dealt with the problem of money, it will not be a surprise at all that his footsteps inevitably will be like those of Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His pathway will be determined by the amount of his support.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The amount of his support will become the direction for his pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a place is poor, he will not visit it or will seldom visit it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if he visits the place, he will leave quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a place is rich in support, he will visit more or will stay there permanently.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Money will become the source of his guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To such ones God can only say, "Go as you wish."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A worker who is not free from the influence of money is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If a worker cannot boast as Paul boasted with regard to money, he is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a worker cannot be freed from money and its influence, he cannot be a minister of God; his way will surely be Balaam's way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some people are easily touched by money; their pathway is easily affected by money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a result, their way is the way of Balaam.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The way of Balaam is simply a way that is dictated by money.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>May the Lord be gracious to us so that we will all be delivered from money.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not wish to see any of us becoming a beggar.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>May the location of our work not become the spot where we beg.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once it does, we become a slave to money.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is a pity and shame for God's servant to be led and controlled by money!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is a shame to seek for guidance not by prostrating at God's feet but by following the direction of money!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a man is not fully delivered from money, he may be deep in money's bondage when he says that he is under God's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is too shameful!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Of course, the matter of money is a very superficial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the God we believe in is living, we should be able to go anywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But if He is not living, we might as well retreat quickly and do nothing at all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is a shameful thing to preach a living God and yet have our pathway governed by money.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a great shame!</S>
