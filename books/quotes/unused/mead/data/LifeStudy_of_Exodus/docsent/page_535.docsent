   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SWEETNESS OF GENUINE PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The incense was not for God to see; it was for Him to smell.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This indicates that God smells our prayer rather than sees it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What does your prayer smell like?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This question may help us to realize that the incense is a deeper type, a type that cannot be understood merely according to doctrine or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can understand this type only by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both the ointment and the incense are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s coming to us is Christ, and our prayer ascending to Him is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The anointing is from God and is also of God, for the anointing actually is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have used paint as an illustration of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Just as we paint a wall with paint, so God anoints us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He paints us with Himself as the divine paint.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When God anoints us with Himself as the ointment, He is applied to us and comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, when God anoints us with Himself, He is added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His divine element is added to our being in somewhat the same way as paint is added to a wall.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This anointing is God s coming.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now we must go on to realize that our prayer is our going to God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, because the incense is Christ, our prayer is actually a matter of going to God as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is genuine prayer?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Genuine prayer is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This kind of prayer, prayer which is actually Christ, is our going to God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not merely our going to God; it is our going to God through Christ and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The anointing brings God to us for our participation in the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The incense is our going to God with Christ and as Christ in prayer for God s enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At the altar in the outer court God has food.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But the fragrance that makes God happy and satisfies Him ascends from the golden altar of incense.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What God desires is not only food to satisfy His appetite, but also a pleasant fragrance to please Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Day by day we may eat healthy, nourishing food.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But sometimes this food has little taste.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Often people go to a restaurant not to enjoy nourishing food but to enjoy pleasant-tasting food.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Children, in particular, like to eat things that taste good.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God also has a sense of taste and smell.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not think that God is so majestic that He does not enjoy a fragrant aroma.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God not only eats He also enjoys a pleasant fragrance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the bronze altar we offer Christ to God as food.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering all typify Christ as food for God to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whenever we offer Christ to God as the peace offering, there is food for God to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, we need to remember that God also enjoys tasting and smelling.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Very few Christians are interested in hearing about things like this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only those Christians who truly seek the Lord have the desire to know these things.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you are not seeking the Lord Himself, you will have no interest in messages on the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Such messages will not tickle your ears.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the genuine seeking ones surely will want to hear a word concerning the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They will be interested in hearing about what is sweet smelling to God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I can testify that genuine prayer is sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>With the two altars, the bronze altar and the golden altar, there is both nourishment and enjoyment for God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The altar in the outer court is larger than the altar in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The altar in the outer court is made of bronze, and the altar in the Holy Place is made of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Furthermore, the golden incense altar is finer than the bronze altar of burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On the bronze altar there was a great deal of wood and, consequently, a big pile of ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But on the golden altar of incense only a small fire burned, and the ashes were very limited in quantity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This altar is not for nourishment, for feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is for fragrance and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The purpose of the incense altar is to cause a fragrant aroma to ascend to God for His enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the way our prayer should be.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have a short hymn in our hymnal that speaks of the two-way traffic between God and us and between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The last stanza of this hymn, a hymn on both the ointment and the incense, goes like this:</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Ointment is Christ for us,</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Exceeding glorious!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Incense is Christ for God,</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Wholly for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Ointment flows down to us,</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ is our portion thus;</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Incense ascends to God,</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Fragrant to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Tis by th anointing</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Christ we experience</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>And then the incense burn.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christ in our prayer and praise</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>O what a Christ we raise</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>From our experience,</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Precious to God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hymns, #1116</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This hymn well expresses the burden of this message.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>My burden is to show you the divine traffic; it is to help you see that God comes to us through Christ, and we go to God in Christ and through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In fact, God s coming is Christ, and our going to God should also be Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need to be impressed with the fact that our going to God is our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Perhaps you have never imagined that our going to God is our prayer and that this prayer should be Christ Himself.</S>
