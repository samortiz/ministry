   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN THE NAME OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND HOW IT IS RELATED TO AUTHORITY Date: Monday, June 28, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Scripture Reading: Luke 10:1, 17-19 AUTHORITY OVER POWER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today we will speak about the relationship between the name of Jesus and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>How much does the name of Jesus include!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How little do we know about it!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Luke 24:47 says that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that forgiveness comes from the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is also through this name that the disciples received life, cast out demons, caused men to walk, and baptized men.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is also through this name that believers are justified, that they pray to God, and that God pours out the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The emphasis here is that the Bible equates the name of Jesus with authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Luke 10 speaks of the seventy disciples going out to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In verse 17 they returned and reported to the Lord, saying, "Lord, even the demons are subject to us in Your name."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verse 19 the Lord answered them, saying, "Behold, I have given you the authority to tread upon serpents and scorpions and over all the power of the enemy, and nothing shall by any means hurt you."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The name in verse 17 equals the authority in verse 19.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord's name is His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The serpents are related to Satan, and the scorpions are related to his power.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is a big difference between authority and power.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Twenty years ago we saw the difference between authority and power.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In Shanghai I once said that the power spoken of in the New Testament is like dynamite; it is not an ordinary kind of power but a tremendous power.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Yet authority transcends such a power.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Authority can subdue the greatest and strongest power.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Authority prevails over power; it subdues even the power of dynamite.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord said that He has given us authority to overcome the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everywhere in this world, we find authority prevailing over power.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>An elderly man of seventy years old may not be able to walk.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He may cough all the time, his back may be hunched, and he may carry a stick with him everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His thirty-year-old son may be very strong physically, but the son has to obey the words of the father.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As far as power is concerned, the son is stronger than the father, yet he has to obey the father.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The son obeys the father not because of his power but because of his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Consider the example of a school.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A teacher may have a few dozen or even a hundred students in a class.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the students obey the teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As far as their power is concerned, the students' combined power is surely much greater than that of the teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet they obey the teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the teacher assigns the students work, they obey.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the teacher prepares an examination, the students take the exam.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The students obey the teacher not on account of his power but on account of his authority.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As far as power is concerned, ten strong teachers would still be unable to subdue a class of over a hundred students.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The issue, however, is not power but authority.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The teacher has the authority to rule over the students.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is an example of authority over power.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's priority in the whole universe is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Satan controls man with his power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He instills fear in man with his power.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet he does not have any authority.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let me give another illustration which I used twenty years ago when I was speaking in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is a busy intersection in the city of Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many cars go through it every minute.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>During its busiest hours over a hundred cars can pass through it at any one moment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, only one policeman directs traffic.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One person controls over a hundred cars at any one moment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As far as power is concerned, a hundred-horsepower car is strong enough to pulverize the policeman, but all the cars at the intersection only move according to the waving of the policeman's arm.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>His club is neither short nor long; it is no good as a weapon for beating either men or dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is useless even for kneading flour dough, but that little club is very useful for directing hundreds of cars.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is another example of authority over power.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As soon as the Lord's disciples exercised authority, Satan fell like lightning out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is true that he possesses power in this world, but he does not have any authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He merely exercises his power through messengers who follow him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God, however, has appointed us to be His authority to subdue Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No matter how powerful Satan is, authority is in our hand.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As long as we have authority, everything is under us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This universe is ruled by authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God has established authority as the fundamental principle of administration.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>As soon as a man touches authority, his own power disintegrates.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A robber may be armed with a gun, but as soon as he meets a policeman, his boldness leaves him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The policeman does not have to run away; the robber is the one who has to run.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Authority is behind the whole issue.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When a sergeant gives a command, the soldiers march, and when he halts, the soldiers stop.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What gives the sergeant the ground to direct his soldiers?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The soldiers have weapons.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Why do they have to listen to one man?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Here we find authority prevailing over power.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If a man knows authority, he will spontaneously obey.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>No one can go up against authority with his power.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Authority will eventually prevail over power.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In the spiritual realm we are the ones with representative authority.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although Satan has power, the victory will always be ours, because authority always prevails over power.</S>
