   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING PREDESTINATED UNTO SONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Ephesians 1:5 says, Predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is a deep matter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To be predestinated is to be pre-marked, marked out before we were born or even created.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is as if God saw us in eternity and said, I like this one.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before the foundation of the world, God looked at us, selected us, and put a mark on us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot recognize the mark, but God and all His angels can.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Wherever we go, all the angels can see that we are those who have been marked out by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The so-called scientific people may say that this is a mere superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, it is no superstition; it is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Day and night there is a mark on us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Again, according to the natural concept, many Christians may say that God has predestinated us unto salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I too held this concept for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I read Ephesians many times, but I did not see the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, one day the Lord opened my eyes to see the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Salvation is easy to understand, but sonship is not.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God predestinated us not merely for salvation but even more for sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sonship means that God makes us His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Once we were only God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At that time we were not born of Him, but now we are born of God John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I was young, Christian pastors and evangelists would tell us that we need God s salvation because we are fallen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In their thought, if we were not fallen, we would not need salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, even if we had never sinned and fallen, we still would not be sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At best, we would be a humanly perfect item of God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s intention is not simply to create us but to make us His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In God s predestination He marked us out in order to make us sons, those who are born of Him to have His life, nature, and all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the proper meaning of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Divine Sonship</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Being a Corporate Entity</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The divine sonship is not merely an individual matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not simply that you become one son of God, I become another son of God, and others become many other sons of God individually.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, the divine sonship is corporate.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Bible tells us that God has many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Originally, Christ was the unique, only begotten Son of God v. 14, 18; 3:16; 1 John 4:9 , but now He is the firstborn Son of God Rom 8:29; Heb 1:6 . Hebrews 2:10 says that God is leading many sons into glory, and verse 11 says that Christ, the firstborn Son, is not ashamed to call them brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today God has not only one Son but many sons corporately.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>A family is a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All the brothers in a family should be one because they are all of one father.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>One person by himself cannot be a family.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A bachelor, for example, has only himself, not an actual family.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A couple with one child is a family, and a family like that of Jacob, who had twelve sons and one daughter, is a much greater family.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The divine sonship is a corporate entity that eventually becomes the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Divine Sonship Being</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>the Mingling of God with Man</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The church is the totality of the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Originally, Jesus Christ as the unique Son of God was the individual expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>John 1:18 says, No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This expression of God by the individual Son, Jesus Christ, was a perfect expression, but it did not fulfill God s goal.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God s goal is to have the totality of the divine sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As the redeemed, forgiven, saved, and regenerated sons of God, we have the divine nature of God 2 Pet 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some may wonder how we as mere human beings can have the divine nature, and some have spoken evilly of this as an evolution into God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such a speaking is in darkness, without any revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If by the Lord s mercy we receive revelation, we will see that God has put His divine nature into the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may compare this to the addition of tea to a glass of plain water.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we place a tea bag into water, the tea becomes mingled with the water to become tea-water.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Once tea is mingled with water, we no longer call it water; we call it tea.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, we do not mean that it is only tea.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Rather, it is tea mingled with water.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>According to the facts of the Bible, God has mingled His divine nature with us to make us divine.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When plain water is saturated with tea to have the element, color, appearance, and taste of tea, we may say that the water is teaified.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The water remains water, but now it is saturated with the tea.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the same way, when God puts Himself into us, He sanctifies us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Because we have been born of God, we now have God s divine life and divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This does not mean we are no longer human.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are still human, but we are humanity mingled with divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We do not preach evolution into God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God is God, and we are human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Nevertheless, God has put His divine nature into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, we are sons of God with the divine life and the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The divine life and the divine nature are the very elements of the divine sonship, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The church is not merely human; it also has the divine element.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we were all only human, we would not be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We would be a human society.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The church is absolutely different from a human society or a religious organization.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The church is something human, yet it is saturated and permeated with the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Because the church has the divine element, everything in it is holy and without blemish.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Therefore, we should not look at ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In ourselves we are unholy and full of blemishes.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must have a heavenly view.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have been chosen to be holy and without blemish, and we have been predestinated, pre-marked, to be the sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This does not mean that from now on we are no longer human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We are still human beings, but another element has been added into our plain water to teaify us, that is, to sanctify us.</S>
