   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Now there is such a unique One in the universe who is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He is God plus man.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then He went voluntarily to the cross and died there for us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hebrews 9:14 indicates that when He went to the cross to offer Himself to God, He was not alone because the Holy Spirit was with Him to strengthen Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His offering of Himself to God as a sacrifice was strengthened by the third of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When He was hanging on the cross, the Father, the first of the Divine Trinity, was also with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His death was not merely the death of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His death was the death of God plus man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord was crucified from the third hour, 9:00 a.m. Mark 15:25 , to the ninth hour, 3:00 p.m. He suffered on the cross for six hours.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At 12:00 noon, the sixth hour, darkness fell over all the land until the ninth hour Matt 27:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For the first three hours, from 9:00 a.m. to 12:00 noon, He was persecuted by men for doing God's will; in the last three hours, He was judged by God to accomplish our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was during this time that God counted Him as our Substitute who suffered for our sin Isa 53:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Darkness fell over all the land because our sin and sins and all negative things were being dealt with there; and because of our sin, God forsook Him Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God put all the sin of the world upon Him Isa 53:6 , making Him sin on our behalf 2 Cor 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He died on the cross under God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He cried out, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God forsook Him for our sake and for the sake of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God forsook Christ on the cross because He took the place of sinners 1 Pet 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He bore our sins 2:24; Isa 53:6 and was made sin for us 2 Cor 5:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the three hours from 12:00 noon to 3:00 p.m., He was condemned by God, judged by God, and cut off by God from the land of the living for our sake.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then He was buried, and after three days He rose up out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When He rose from among the dead, He did not drop His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To say that Christ is no longer human after His resurrection is absolutely wrong and heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the day of His resurrection in the evening, He came back to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although the doors were shut where the disciples were, He appeared in their midst and said to them "Peace to you" Luke 24:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His disciples became frightened and thought they beheld a ghost v. 37 and note 371 Recovery Version . Then He said, "See My hands and My feet, that it is I Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Touch Me and see, for a spirit does not have flesh and bones as you behold Me having" v. 39 . Although He was resurrected, He was a man with a physical body that could be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When He appeared in the midst of His disciples, He did not speak much to them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead, He breathed into them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Holy Spirit is the holy pneuma, the holy breath.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord breathed Himself into them as the holy breath.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A person's breath is actually himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit breathed into the disciples is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>First Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam, Christ, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This Spirit, who is the Spirit of Jesus, is a Spirit with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No one can fully comprehend this divine mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is a brother among us who is a professor of physics at the University of California at Berkeley.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I recently asked him whether the very Christ who was standing in the midst of the disciples on the day of resurrection was physical or spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He said that he did not know.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a mystery which no one can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today the very Christ in resurrection still has the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even in His resurrection and in His ascension, He is both divine and human.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Is this not wonderful?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The life-giving Spirit of Christ is not merely the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now He is the compounded Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is compounded with divinity, plus humanity, plus the wonderful all-inclusive death of Christ and the powerful resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the consummated Spirit who is the very consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today when someone believes in the Lord Jesus, he receives the consummated Spirit of life as the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The eternal life is a mingled life a life of divinity mingled with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord Jesus said that He is the eternal life John 14:6a , and by believing into Him, we received Him as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In Him we have the complete God and the perfect man.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Him we can also participate in His all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His death is a dear death.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We all have to love this death, to "kiss" this death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>His death is different from the death of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The death of Adam is terrible, but the death of Christ is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In Him we also have the powerful resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, in Him we have God complete, man perfect, death all-inclusive, and resurrection powerful, compounded together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is the life we received when we believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is clearly revealed in the New Testament, but not many realize that the eternal life which they have received is such a mingled life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Body of Christ is of such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We may talk much about the Body of Christ, but I am concerned that we may not realize that this Body is of such a wonderful life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We all have to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now we may ask how such a life could get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is why we have to read Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Ephesians 1 is a particular, skillfully written chapter telling us how this wonderful life has gotten into us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We may have read Ephesians 1 many times without seeing this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is why, in chapter one of Ephesians, Paul prayed that God would give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation v. 17 . Paul prayed that God would open up our eyes, giving us the ability to know the wonderful, mysterious things recorded in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We may read Ephesians 1 without a spirit of wisdom and revelation, without the opening of our inner eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Thus, we do not have the ability to apprehend the divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I have been praying much for all of us since the day we decided to have this conference.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I desired that the Lord would grant us a spirit of wisdom and revelation to see Ephesians 1.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This chapter is a deep mine.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I want to open up this mine and show us the treasures in this mine.</S>
