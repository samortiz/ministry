   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD HAVING GRANTED TO US ALL THINGS RELATED TO LIFE AND GODLINESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the ones sitting here are working saints.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When I was young, I was also working.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because my background was poor, I had to work when I was a teenager.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Afterwards, I got saved, and because of the Lord's calling and attracting, I was very happy being a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whether I was reading the Bible, praying, or preaching the gospel, I enjoyed it very much.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But sometimes I read some words in the Bible which caused me to feel sad.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For example, the Bible says, "You shall be holy, because I am holy" 1 Pet 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It also says, "You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect" Matt 5:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In another place it says, "Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me, cannot be My disciple" Luke 14:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I thought in my heart, "How can I be holy?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How can I be perfect as my heavenly Father?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To ask me to carry the cross to follow the Lord is an impossible task.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, I cannot just drop it and forget about it; it was not up to me to decide whether I should be a Christian."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, I was really sad and full of worry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My Christian life was like this year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>More and more I found myself to be no good.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we still have some hope for ourselves, then it proves that we still consider ourselves to be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I finally reached a point where you may say that I knew myself thoroughly and realized that there was not even one bit of hope with me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I could not be holy, I could not follow the Lord, I could not overcome, I could not be spiritual, and I could not be perfect as God is perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I could not do it at all.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It was at this time that the light of the Bible enlightened me to see that God never said that we are all right.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We are rotten to the core.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is impossible for us to be holy and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When I was subdued, the life supply came.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I saw that it was due to my being no good that I needed Jesus to be my life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Afterwards when I went to read the Bible, the situation was different.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What had formerly been words of requirement in the Bible was all changed in my reading to become words of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I remember that one time about thirty years ago when I was working in Manila, as I was reading 2 Peter 1, I was greatly opened up to see that the divine power of God has already granted to us all things related to life and godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Life and godliness include sanctification, perfection, spirituality, overcoming, and all the requirements in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we do not have to worry, because all these have already been granted to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>DRAWING ON GOD'S SUPPLY BY FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I know that many working brothers and sisters, after finding a job, experience pressure from their boss, competition from their co-workers, plus the jealousy of the aggressive ones.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is indeed not a simple situation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only so, but after marriage they will have a wife, and not long afterwards they will have children.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is indeed troublesome.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Although there is enjoyment in these things, yet it is not without troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is just like the hymn we sang tonight, which says,</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thou art all my life, Lord,</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In me Thou dost live;</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>With Thee all God's fulness</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thou to me dost give.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By Thy holy nature I am sanctified,</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>By Thy resurrection, Vict'ry is supplied.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The last stanza says,</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I would cease completely</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>From my efforts vain,</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let Thy life transform me,</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Full release to gain.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hymns, #841</S>
