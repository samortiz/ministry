   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>N. MEEKNESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In His humanity Christ has the virtue of meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To be meek means not to resist the world's opposition but to suffer it willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To have the virtue of meekness means that we do not invade others or fight with them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead, we are willing to give in. The meek give in to others, but those who are strong in a natural way fight and refuse to give in. At the least, they want to stand their ground.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The meek, however, give in, do not fight, and do not invade others' territory.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord Jesus said of Himself, "I am meek in heart" Matt 11:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In facing opposition the Lord Jesus was always meek.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul in 2 Corinthians 10:1 speaks of the meekness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Meekness is a virtue of the humanity of Christ by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ's meekness is not a simple matter, for it is in His humanity and by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He lived a human life by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through this mingling of divinity and humanity the virtue of meekness was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ's meekness is seen in the way He entered Jerusalem as described in Matthew 21:1-11.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He was "meek and mounted on a donkey and on a colt, the foal of a beast of burden" v. 5 . This signifies the meek and lowly state in which the Lord was willing to present Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The donkey and the colt together give an impression of meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the Lord had been mounted only on a donkey, the impression of meekness would not have been so striking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The significance of the Lord's being mounted on a donkey and on a colt is not smallness but meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ, the heavenly King, did not come with haughty splendor but with gentle, humble meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He did not ride into Jerusalem proudly on a horse; He came mounted on a little donkey, even a small colt.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No earthly king would do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord Jesus, however, came to be a meek King.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Yes, He was the heavenly King, but He had no intention to come as a great king fighting or competing with others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead, He came as a meek King who did not fight against anyone or compete with anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the meekness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>O. FORBEARANCE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 2 Corinthians 10:1 Paul also speaks of the forbearance of Christ, a virtue, like meekness, that is produced by the mingling of divinity and humanity in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, forbearance is another virtue of Christ lived in His humanity by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To have meekness is to not invade others but to give in to them; to have forbearance means that we are willing to be invaded by others and to suffer affliction and injury.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Meekness and forbearance are two of the virtues Christ lived in His humanity by the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Greek word rendered forbearance in 2 Corinthians 10:1 is composed of two words: epi, a preposition that means unto, and eikos, which means seemly, fitting, or suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the preposition epi is added to other Greek words as a prefix, it often bears the meaning of full or extensive.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The use of this preposition as a component of the Greek word for forbearance in 2 Corinthians 10:1 indicates that the meaning of this word is to be fully reasonable, or fitting or suitable to the fullest extent.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ has a full and extensive reasonableness and considerateness.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Furthermore, He always acts in a way that is fitting and suitable to the fullest extent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Greek word for forbearance is rendered different ways by different translations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some versions render the word as yieldingness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The word used in the Chinese version means to give in humbly.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These understandings are correct, but they are rather shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Other translators point out that the Greek word means reasonable, considerate, suitable, and fitting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A forbearing person is one who always fits in, one whose behavior is always suitable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The virtue of forbearance is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It includes love, kindness, mercy, peacefulness, mildness, gentleness, reasonableness, the ability to fit in, and many other virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are reasonable, considerate, and able to fit in, we shall also be gentle, kind, mild, and peaceful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, we shall be meek and moderate, full of compassion for others.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The opposite of forbearance is being just in an exacting way.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A person who lacks forbearance will be exacting and demanding of others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But to be forbearing means that we are easily satisfied, even with less than our due.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Alford says that the Greek word for forbearance means not to be strict with respect to legal rights.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The best word to sum up the totality of Christ's human virtues is forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Besides the Lord Jesus, no human being has ever practiced a life of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you study the biographies of famous people, you will see that not one was truly a person of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, if you read the four Gospels, you will see that the human living of the Lord Jesus was full of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In particular, the Lord exercised forbearance with His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Consider, for example, how He spoke to the two disciples on the way to Emmaus as recorded in Luke 24.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He drew near, went with them, and said to them, "What are these words which you are exchanging with one another while you are walking?" v. 17 . With a rebuking tone, one of the disciples replied, "Are you a stranger dwelling alone in Jerusalem and do not know the things which took place in it in these days?" v. 18 . Appearing not to know anything, the Lord asked, "What things?" v. 19 . Then they proceeded to tell Him about Jesus of Nazareth, "a Prophet, powerful in work and word before God and all the people" v. 19 and who was crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How forbearing the Lord Jesus was to listen to the disciples speak things that He knew much better than they did!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After walking quite a distance, "they drew near to the village where they were going, and He acted as though He would go farther.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>And they urged Him, saying, Stay with us, because it is toward evening and the day is already nearly over.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>And He went in to stay with them" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>28-29 , even sitting down to dine with them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When He took bread, blessed it, broke it, and gave it to them, "their eyes were opened, and they recognized Him" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>30-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this we surely see Christ's forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He has the growth in life, the satisfaction in life, and the contentment of life required to have the virtue of forbearance.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, wherever He was He was full of forbearance and He could exercise His forbearance toward all.</S>
