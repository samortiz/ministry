   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF REVELATION MESSAGE SIXTY-ONE THE NEW JERUSALEM 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider some further characteristics of New Jerusalem, namely its measurements and its wall.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ITS MEASUREMENTS A. The Measuring Instrument</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let us firstly consider the measurements of New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Revelation 21:15 says, And he who spoke with me had a golden reed as a measure, that he might measure the city and its gates and its wall.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reed is for measuring, and measuring signifies taking possession Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>40:5; Zech 2:1-2; Rev 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Notice that the measuring instrument is a reed, not a rod.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A rod signifies or implies judgment, discipline, and punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to 11:1, a reed like a rod was used to measure the temple of God and the altar and those who worship in it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because a rod implies punishment Prov 10:13; Isa 10:5; 11:4 , a reed like a rod indicates measuring with punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 21:15, however, we have the reed, but no mention of the rod.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here there is no implication of judgment, discipline, or chastisement, for in every respect New Jerusalem is complete and perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This city has already passed every test.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The universal bright woman, whose consummation is New Jerusalem, has passed through many kinds of dealings and has been measured by many rods in each of the four dispensations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even today the church is being measured by a rod, not by a reed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the four dispensations are over and the new heaven and new earth have come, there will be no further need for measuring with a rod.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fact that New Jerusalem is measured with a reed means that it is measured for possession.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose you intend to purchase some property.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Firstly you measure it, and then you take possession of it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Women do the same thing when they purchase material in a fabric store.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The amount of material they measure out is the amount of material they purchase and possess.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Likewise, the New Jerusalem, which will be measured by a golden reed, will be fully possessed by the Lord in a very positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Notice that the reed is a golden reed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Since gold signifies the divine nature of God, golden here signifies that the measuring of the city, its gates, and its wall is according to God s divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Anything that does not match the nature of God does not belong to the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God cannot possess anything that does not match His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The whole city, with its gates and wall, can pass the measuring and testing of the nature of God; hence, it is qualified to be possessed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even today God measures the churches by the golden standard of His divine measurement.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When God measures a church, He is not concerned with our intelligence, activities, or ability to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But He is very concerned about how much of His nature has been wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Is the divine gold the solid substance of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Is the church constituted with God s divine essence?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church must be substantially divine; that is, the divine substance must be wrought into the very being of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, the standard of measurement is not our human nature, but God s nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we are about to express our love for one another, we must determine what kind of love is being expressed, whether it is human or divine.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The same is true with respect to humility and goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although we must be humble and good, we must check whether our humility and goodness are human or divine.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This principle applies to every aspect of our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to be divinely human; that is, we must have the divine nature wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Please keep in mind that God s measurement of the church is according to the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The golden nature of God is the unique standard.</S>
