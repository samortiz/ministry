   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST LIVING IN RESURRECTION AND IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ lives in resurrection, and He lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is clearly indicated in John 14:19 and Galatians 2:20.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, "It is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Oh, Christ lives in us!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He sits on the throne as the Lord, but He lives in our hearts as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In John 14:19, the Lord Jesus said that because He lives, that is, in resurrection, we shall live also in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As the vine lives in the branches, the branches also live.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We all need to be deeply impressed that Christ lives in us and we live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How wonderful this is!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CHRIST BEING OUR LIFE,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>AND WE LIVING BY HIM THROUGH ENJOYING HIM</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christ is our life, and we live by Him through enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Colossians 3:4 we are told that Christ is our life, and in John 6:57, that if we eat Him, we shall live because of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ is not only our life, but also our life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the bread of life John 6:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Bread is something for us to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We live by what we eat.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we did not eat, how could we live?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We live by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At times I become tired, but always after eating a good meal, I am nourished.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I live by what I eat.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In a spiritual sense, we live by eating Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Just as a car runs by the gasoline it "eats," we "run" by eating Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jesus is our food and Jesus is our "gasoline."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We live by Him through enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>For this reason, every day we need some time to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should not say that we are too busy to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we refrain from eating, after a certain period of time we will die.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can never graduate from eating.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more we eat Jesus, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We eat Jesus, and we live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>HAVING DIED TO THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THAT WE MIGHT LIVE TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Galatians 2:19 Paul says that we have died to the law that we might live to God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although this verse is in the Bible, we may be unaware of it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When we read the law, the Ten Commandments in the Bible, and realize that it is good, we may determine to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, Paul says that we Christians have died to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The law is good, but it is not for us to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have died to the law that we might live to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that we are not responsible to the law, but we are responsible to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are responsible to our God, who is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let me illustrate in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose you read in the Bible, "Honor thy father and thy mother" Exo 20:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You may say to yourself, "I am a child of my parents, but I do not honor them all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Through reading the Bible I have learned that I should honor my parents."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Immediately you may make a strong decision to honor your parents.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may tell the Lord, "Lord, You know that I am weak.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have the desire to honor my parents, but I cannot do it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Lord, help me to honor my parents."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I prayed this kind of prayer many times.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I can testify to you that this kind of prayer was never answered.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more you pray that the Lord will help you to honor your parents, the more you may lose your temper with your parents.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When you read such a verse, you need to say, "Satan, let me tell you that I have died to the law, and I am not responsible to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I am living to God; I am living to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I do not care for the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I only care for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He is within me.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He lives within me and I live with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I am responsible only to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Morning and evening, day and night, every minute and every second, I am responsible to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I live to Christ, I live by Christ, I live in Christ, I live with Christ, and I live Christ Phil 1:21a .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am one with Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Spontaneously, Christ in you will live to honor your parents.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Now your honoring of your parents is not you, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not you who honor your parents; it is Christ in you who honors them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We all need to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many of God's people use the Bible in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For example, many Christian husbands and wives misuse Ephesians 5:22 and 25.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These verses say that wives should submit to their husbands, and that husbands should love their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>However, each may read these verses for the other, not for himself.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The husbands may read verse 22, "Wives, be subject to your own husbands, as to the Lord," while neglecting verse 25; and the wives may read verse 25, "Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church," while overlooking verse 22.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the early years of my ministry a number of cases between husbands and wives were brought to me.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Both the husband and the wife came to me to present their case.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The husband complained that his wife was not submissive, and the wife, that her husband was not loving.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In this way the Bible became the law for a lawsuit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>But we need to see that we have died to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We no longer live to the law and are not responsible to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We live to Christ and are responsible to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should no longer care about the law; we should only care for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Our need is simply to pray, "Lord Jesus, I love You.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Thank You, Lord, that You are one with me.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>You live in me and I live in You.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Lord Jesus, it is not I, but You.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I desire to live You every minute and every second."</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A wife who prays in this way will gradually find that she can easily submit herself to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>She will do it unconsciously, willingly, and unintentionally.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is the same with the husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>There will be no need for the husbands to determine to love their wives; they will love their wives spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We have died to the law that we may live to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is to live Christ.</S>
