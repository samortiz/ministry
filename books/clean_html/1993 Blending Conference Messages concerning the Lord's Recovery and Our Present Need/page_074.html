<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ANOINTING SPIRIT</H2><P>First, the Spirit is the compound Spirit, the compound ointment; then He is the anointing Spirit (2 Cor. 1:21; 1 John 2:20, 27). The anointing Spirit is simply the application of the compound Spirit. The compound Spirit needs to be applied to us and added to us through the anointing Spirit. The anointing is the moving and working of the indwelling compound Spirit. Second Corinthians 1:21 says, "But the One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God." God anoints us by attaching us to Christ, the anointed One. Christ, the anointed One, is full of ointment. He is not only the compound Spirit, but He is also the means by which we are anointed. He is the ointment and the anointing One. Because we have been attached to Him, the ointment that is on Him flows to us. Through the moving of the anointing Spirit, all the elements of the compound Spirit are added into our inner being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF JESUS FOR THE HUMAN LIFE OF JESUS</H2><P>The Spirit is also the Spirit of Jesus for the human life of Jesus, especially in His sufferings (Acts 16:7). In Acts 16 the apostles, having come to Mysia, were endeavoring to go into Bithynia, but the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them. The Spirit of Jesus is a particular expression referring to the Spirit of the incarnated Savior, the One who passed through human living and even death on the cross. The Spirit of Jesus includes not only the divine element of God but also the human element of Jesus with all His experiences of human living and His death on the cross. Such an all-inclusive Spirit was needed by the apostles in their ministry&#151;a suffering ministry among human beings and for human beings in the human life of Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST FOR CHRIST IN RESURRECTION</H2><P>The Spirit is also the Spirit of Christ for Christ in resurrection in His divinity and His uplifted humanity (Rom. 8:9). In Acts 16 there is the Spirit of Jesus, but in Romans 8 we see the Spirit of Christ. Romans 8:9 says, "But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you. Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him." The title the Spirit of Christ implies that this Spirit is the embodiment and reality of Christ. This Christ accomplished everything necessary for God's plan. He includes not only divinity, which He possessed from eternity, but also humanity, which He obtained through incarnation. Human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension are also included in the Spirit of Christ. This is the Spirit of the One who passed through death and entered into resurrection. His death was an all-inclusive termination, terminating everything of the old creation. His resurrection was the all-inclusive germination that brought forth the new creation. The Spirit of Christ is therefore the totality, the aggregate, of the all-inclusive Christ with His all-inclusive death and resurrection. Because we have this Spirit of Christ in us, we have everything related to this all-inclusive termination and germination.</P>
