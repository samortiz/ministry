   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because of the political situation, many people from other provinces moved to Yunnan, making it difficult to rent a proper building.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Before we found a meeting hall, we met in a brother's house.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we began the table last year, there were a little over ten brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Thank and praise God for His operation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The number of saved ones has increased gradually.</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Before Brother K. H. Weigh came to Yunnan, we had Brother Lin Kwang-tsao lead the gospel meetings on the Lord's Day.</S>

   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>3 Marvelous miracles: When the brothers were preaching the gospel in rotation, a Miss Lee began to attend the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When she was at home, a piece of earth fell from the ceiling and hit her on the head, injuring her brain.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She frequently had headaches after this accident.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>She went to both Western and Chinese doctors, but to no avail.</S>

   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>She received the Lord Jesus as her Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One day she was reading in Psalm 103:3, which says, "He pardons all your iniquities;/He heals all your diseases."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When she read it, she realized that God was not only her Savior but also her doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>She prayed desperately that God would heal her sickness and pain.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thank and praise God for listening to her prayer and healing her.</S>

   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>These are the miracles that the Lord's grace has bestowed upon sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>4 Offerings: In the past the offerings from the brothers and sisters did not do much more than cover all the expenses; at the end of the year not much was left.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But the church is the house of God, and there should never be a lack.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When man has no way, God has a way.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The deposit on the meeting hall is very large, and there was not enough in our bank account.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The brothers and sisters prayed that God would touch His children to do their best to make an offering.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Thank and praise Jehovah-Jireh, on the last Lord's Day before the Chinese New Year, there was enough money in the offering box, including two pieces of gold jewelry and the addition of our bank savings, to more than pay for the deposit and the rent.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There was even quite a bit left over.</S>

   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>5 Baptisms: Since we began meeting in K'un-ming, those who have believed and been saved have not been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we continue to delay, it will not be very good.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We have already prepared a metal baptistry framed in wood.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>A baptism meeting will soon be held.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>More than ten people want to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We hope that God will give grace on the one hand, and that the Lord will touch those who have not obeyed yet to be willing to render this testimony on the other hand Mark 16:16 .</S>
