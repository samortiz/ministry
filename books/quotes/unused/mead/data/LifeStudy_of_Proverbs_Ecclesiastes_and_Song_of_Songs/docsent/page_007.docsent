   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PROVERBS MESSAGE TWO THE PRINCIPLES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR MAN TO LIVE A PROPER HUMAN LIFE Scripture Reading: Prov 1 9; 31</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What the book of Proverbs is to us and what the entire Bible is to us depend on what kind of person we are.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the apostle Paul every book of the Old Testament was Spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But for many of today's Christians the Bible, including the New Testament, is mainly a book of proverbs.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such Christians do not understand a verse like Ephesians 3:8, which speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ for the producing of the church to fulfill God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They may have no interest in these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, they may be very interested in what Ephesians 5 says about husbands loving their wives and about wives submitting to their husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This illustrates the strong tendency among Christians to try to understand the New Testament according to their ethical mind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They are not interested in anything that cannot be understood in an ethical way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In particular, they do not understand the New Jerusalem and do not seek to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>From this we see that the kind of person we are determines what the Bible will be to us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this message we will consider from Proverbs the principles for man to live a proper human life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Each of these principles revering God, needing wisdom, honoring one's parents, and holding marriage in honor is a nugget.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I. REVERING GOD</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To revere God is to consider and regard Him in everything, never forgetting that He is the wonderful God who has created us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we are about to lose our temper, we should revere God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Revering God stops us from doing evil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Revering God also causes us to be touched by the sufferings of others and to show mercy and compassion to them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though I was born into Christianity, before I believed in the Lord Jesus I never revered God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But from the day I got saved, I began to revere God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In everything I respected and regarded God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That caused a great change in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A. Fearing God</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To revere God is to fear God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The fear of Jehovah is the beginning of knowledge and wisdom, and the knowledge of the Holy One is understanding 1:7; 9:10; 15:33a .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Knowledge, wisdom, and understanding come from God.</S>
