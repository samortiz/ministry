   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECOVERY OF BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although the Baptist Church existed and sent brothers to China who baptized people, the battle for the truth concerning baptism did not really begin until God raised us up in China.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Nee s family first belonged to the Methodist denomination, in which they were sprinkled.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After they were clearly saved and saw in God s Word the truth of baptism by immersion, they went to fellowship about it with Miss M. E. Barber.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Miss Barber had already seen this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>She brought this recovery concerning baptism to Foochow, and Brother Nee was baptized by immersion there in March 1921.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From that time onward, baptism has been an important item of recovery among us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When the Holy Spirit works, He does the same thing everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Over the past fifty years many people who were raised up by God were initially baptized by sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After they began to pursue the Lord, they realized that sprinkling is not according to the Bible, because there should be a burial in baptism; thus, they were baptized by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many believers had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Mr. Chia Yu-ming, a Presbyterian pastor, was very influential in a particular seminary.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He strongly opposed the practice of immersing those who had been baptized by sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One day as he was praying on a mountain, he was filled with the Holy Spirit to the extent that he went running and jumping for joy down the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He jumped into a pond and baptized himself by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The work of the Holy Spirit caused people to be baptized by immersion; it is not an outward ritual but the result of the inward sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thus, we should not despise baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the New Testament was only concerned with the spiritual aspect and not the practical aspect of baptism, the Lord would not have repeatedly exhorted us to be baptized by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Matthew 28:19 says, Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Mark 16:16 says, He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These verses are both related to baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are several examples of salvation in the book of Acts, and in each case the ones who were saved asked to be baptized by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Acts 8 Philip preached the gospel to a eunuch; Philip was not caught away by the Holy Spirit after the eunuch received the gospel but after the eunuch was baptized vv.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>26-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this example, Philip must have spoken to the eunuch about baptism immediately after preaching the gospel to him; if he had not done so, how could the eunuch have said, Look, water.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What prevents me from being baptized? v. 36 . He did not even understand the book of Isaiah, so how could he have known about baptism? Philip must have spoken to him about it; thus, he was baptized beside the road.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The spiritual aspect of baptism is certainly important.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We passed through a time of fierce spiritual battle concerning baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For quite a long period of time, people criticized and slandered us, saying that as a matter of regulation we received only those who had been baptized by immersion and that those who had been baptized by sprinkling had to be re-baptized before we would accept them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was a false accusation against us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, baptism by immersion was the second recovery among us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE RECOVERY OF THE BREAKING OF BREAD</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Catholicism, the breaking of bread was transmuted into the holy communion of the mass.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Protestantism to some extent corrected the superstition involved in the breaking of bread but in principle retained the old form of Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Communion in the Roman Catholic mass is filled with superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Roman Catholics believe that communion can cure illness and keep people in prosperity and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Despite the superstition in the Roman Catholic practice, Protestants continue to use the term holy communion, which is an error.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Holy communion is a Catholic term.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Bible uses the phrase eat the Lord s supper 1 Cor 11:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When Catholicism uses the word holy in the context of the Lord s supper, it means that the bread and wine which have passed through the ritual blessing of the clergy have physically become the Lord s body and are holy.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All believers are equal at the Lord s table.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the New Testament, God does not have a group of intermediaries between Him and His people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Only the Lord and His disciples were present at the Lord s supper; there were only two groups of people, not three.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, the Roman Catholic Church interposes a third group the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The priests, who are professional clergy, distribute the bread to the congregation in a ceremony they call holy communion; only the priests drink the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>During the Reformation, not only did Roman Catholic terminology remain in use, but the same general way of doing things was also kept.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In Protestantism, only the clergy can distribute the bread and the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a certain congregation wants to have the Lord s supper when their minister is out of town, they cannot distribute the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is a great departure from what should be the situation in the bread-breaking meeting; the flavor of the saints direct contact with the Lord and their mutual fellowship in the one loaf of the Body of Christ has been completely invalidated.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 1922 the brothers in Foochow broke away from these erroneous teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There were no priests or ministers among them, nor did they have a chapel, yet they all sat before the Lord around the bread and cup in a brother s home and fellowshipped directly with God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That meeting was the beginning of the recovery of the truth of the breaking of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This was the third recovery.</S>
