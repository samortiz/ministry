   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Brother Witness Lee's Answering Letter</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Brother in the Lord, Hsien Hui:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I have read your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank the Lord; He really has worked in your heart!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yes, every brother or sister who is clear about the Lord's light and who wants to go the way of the Lord should leave the denominations in reality and in name.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason, everyone who wants to obey the Lord thoroughly should take his name off the denominational registers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although this is but one of the thousands of things we must obey in the Bible, it is still something we must obey.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should be "faithful in the least" Luke 16:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Truly, we should "obey in God's light"!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Truly, "obeying is the expression of loving the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here are the answers to your questions:</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1 We should not "wait for awhile to obey" because there is no meeting in the Lord's name in the place we are.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our obeying the Lord should not be influenced by our environment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Truly, "once we are clear, we should obey."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Waiting for awhile to obey" is really "the entanglement of the enemy."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2 Actually, going to the denominations to hear the Word does not benefit us much.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Your own experience is sufficient to prove this.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since it does not help us, why waste the time?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It would be better to follow the Lord's leading and go out at this time to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Once sinners believe in the Lord, you can lead them to walk in the way and meet together with you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You do not have to wait for many.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You only need two or three people Matt 18:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since we are clear that the Lord is going to tear down the denominations, it is best not to involve ourselves in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must firmly maintain our position.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we are not separated, we do not have a testimony!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The power of a testimony is separation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not be afraid of stumbling others in obeying the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we truly act according to the Lord's will and some are stumbled, we do not have to bear this responsibility before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When our Lord was on the earth, He never disobeyed God because He was worried about stumbling others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, He was "for the falling and rising up of many" Luke 2:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He is the faithful Rock.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Yet He is also the "stone of stumbling" to those "who stumble at the word, being disobedient, to which also they were appointed" 1 Pet 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For this reason, when our Lord was on the earth, He received so much persecution that He became "a sign spoken against" Luke 2:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we walk the Lord's way today, we shall also receive what the Lord received.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we give in a little, if we change it a little, if we move just a little, we will avoid much suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But, "let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach" Heb 13:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Please sing Hymns #60, 33, and 131 in the Little Flock Hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we obey the Lord in this way, we should pay attention to one matter of greatest importance: We should have a heart of love when we contact any brother or sister in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our attitude should be meek, and our words should be polite.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have the wrong attitude or if we say the wrong things and stumble them, we will be responsible for it before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are all very well here.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the Lord allows, I will go to Shanghai next week.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Parts omitted.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I pray for you.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Peace be to you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Your brother,</S>
