   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In quantity God sanctifies us wholly; in quality God preserves us complete, that is, He keeps our spirit, soul, and body perfect.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In God's full salvation our entire being is saved and made perfect and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this, God is preserving our spirit from any deadening element Heb 9:14 , our soul from remaining natural and old Matt 16:24-26 , and our body from the ruin of sin 1 Thes 4:4; Rom 6:6 .</S>
