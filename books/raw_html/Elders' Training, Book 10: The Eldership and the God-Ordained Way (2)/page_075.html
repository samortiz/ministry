<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCHES,<br>THE NATURE, GROUND, AND<br>CONDITION OF A LOCAL CHURCH,<br>THE FACTORS OF A DENOMINATION,<br>AND THE DISCERNING OF THE ONE BODY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCHES<br>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:3-6; Acts 2:42a; 1 John 1:3; John 17:11b, 20-23; Rev. 1:11; Rom. 14:1-6; 15:1-7; 16:17; 2 John 7-11; 1 Cor. 5:9-13; 2 Cor. 2:5-11; Titus 3:10</H1><P>In this chapter, I am burdened to share with you, first, concerning the fellowship of the churches in the Lord's recovery. Today we need to have a complete, thorough knowledge concerning the fellowship of the Body of Christ, and also concerning the fellowship of the local churches.</P><P>As we have seen in this book, the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine revelation concerning eight basic and major items: God, Christ, the Spirit, the eternal life, the believers, the church, the proper ground of the church, and the practice of the local churches. Among these items, the recovery of the proper ground of the church touches a major practical problem that we are facing today. The recovery today is very practically the recovery of the proper ground of the church. All the divisions and confusions among Christians today have come from this one source: the fact that most Christians are destitute of the knowledge of the proper ground of the church. Today all of Christianity is full of divisions. Division eventually leads to confusion; these two are actually two sides of one thing. In the past three years we have been facing a real problem among us, a problem that may be termed a rebellion, a turmoil, or a division. This problem has been due not to the lack of knowledge concerning the proper ground of the church, but to the fact that those responsible for the problem would not practice the truth concerning the proper ground of the church. They would not keep the proper ground of the church. In addition to the knowledge concerning the ground of the church, for the proper practice of the local churches, the adequate knowledge of the fellowship of the Body of Christ is needed.</P>
