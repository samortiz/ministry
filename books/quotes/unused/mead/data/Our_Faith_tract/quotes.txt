[1]  We believe in the Bible, in God, in Christ, in the Spirit, and in God s redemption and salvation.
[2]  The Bible is the true and objective gift from God that offers to us His revelation concerning Himself, His full salvation, and His plan, or economy, for man.
[3]  Because He bears to us the humanity, human living, and death of Jesus, He is called the Spirit of Jesus Acts 16:7 ; and because the divinity and resurrection of Christ are made real to us by Him, He is called the Spirit of Christ Rom 8:9 .
[4]  Based on Christ s redemption, God regenerates the redeemed with His Spirit John 3:5-6 to consummate His salvation, that they may become His children John 1:12-13 .
