<h2 class="head1">THE PICTURE OF<br />
THE BUILDING OF THE TEMPLE OF GOD<br />
IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The blueprint for God&rsquo;s building is revealed in the Scriptures. The Old Testament presents a picture of the building of the temple of God. First Chronicles 28:11-14 says, &ldquo;David gave Solomon his son the pattern of the portico of the temple and its buildings and its storehouses and its upper rooms and its inner rooms and the building for the expiation cover; and the pattern of all that he had by the Spirit, for the courts of the house of Jehovah, and for all the chambers around, and for the treasuries of the house of God, and for the treasuries of the dedicated gifts; and for the divisions of the priests and the Levites, and for all the work of the service of the house of Jehovah, and for all the vessels of the service of the house of Jehovah; and for the gold, by weight of the gold for all the vessels of each kind of service; for all the vessels of silver, by weight for all the vessels for each kind of service.&rdquo; Verses 20 through 21 say, &ldquo;David said to Solomon his son, Be strong and be bold and do it; do not be afraid or dismayed, for Jehovah God, my God, is with you. He will not fail you nor forsake you until the completion of all the work for the service of the house of Jehovah. And here are the divisions of priests and Levites for all the service of the house of God, and with you in all the work will be every willing man with wisdom for any service; also the leaders and all the people will be wholly at your command.&rdquo;</p>
<p>These verses show how the temple of God was built. The first point is the pattern (vv. 11-12, 19). The word <em>pattern</em> indicates a certain standard. It is not according to your will or according to my will. The revealed pattern became the standard of the work of the service. How and what the service carried out were based on the pattern.</p>
<p>Next, according to the pattern, there were various needs, and based on the needs, work was assigned. The divisions of the priests and Levites were according to the assignments (vv. 13, 21). Third, all the vessels of the service had certain weights; there could not be too much or too little material (vv. 14-18). Therefore, everything in the building of the temple of God was done according to the pattern, including the divisions of the priests and Levites and the quantities of the vessels. Nothing was added to the pattern. Moreover, willing men with wisdom for any service came to help (v. 21). Because the Lord was with the children of Israel, they had wisdom and were willing to serve. Finally, the leaders and all the people were wholly at Solomon&rsquo;s command (v. 21). <em>Command</em> here indicates that authority is involved. All the people being wholly at Solomon&rsquo;s command is a matter of being in one accord&mdash;the hearts of the many were as one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRITUAL HOUSE AND THE PRIESTHOOD<br />
BEING ONE IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>In the New Testament 1 Peter 2:5 says, &ldquo;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.&rdquo; In this verse the spiritual house is the holy priesthood, and the holy priesthood is the spiritual house. Some may think that the spiritual house refers to a thing and that the priesthood refers to a group of people. In the Old Testament the house and the priesthood were separate, but in the New Testament the house is the priesthood, and the priesthood is the house. All of God&rsquo;s children, that is, all those who are being built up, are, on the one hand, the house of God, and on the other, priests of God. We are priests, and we are also a house. Therefore, 1 Peter 2:5 says that we, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood. We are the habitation of God and also the ones who serve God. Furthermore, we are not individual priests; we are a corporate priest, a holy priesthood.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the priesthood was associated with the temple. Whether in relation to the tabernacle or the temple, the priests were not separate; they were in coordination. They served as a corporate entity, a &ldquo;-hood,&rdquo; according to divisions and orders. Thus, the priesthood was not separated from the temple. The priesthood with the temple shows that the temple is a body of priests and that the building of the temple involves the coordination of the priests. The priests&rsquo; being coordinated into one corporate entity is the building of the temple into one entity.</p>
<p>Although 1 Chronicles 28 speaks about the pattern and method for the building of the temple, a depiction of the priestly divisions, work, and services is integrated into the chapter as well. Thus, the Holy Spirit indicates that these two are one. This is the same principle in Exodus. The priesthood&mdash;the priestly service, work, and garments&mdash;is integrated into the section concerning the building of the tabernacle and its furnishings (25:9&mdash;40:17).</p>
<p>If we start from the inside of the tabernacle, the furnishings are the Ark, the incense altar, the golden lampstand, the table of the bread of the Presence, the laver, and the altar. When we start from the outer court, the furnishings are the altar, the laver, the table of the bread of the Presence, the golden lampstand, the incense altar, and the Ark. However, the sequence given in Exodus 25, the pattern for the building, is the Ark (vv. 10-22), the table of the bread of the Presence (vv. 23-30), the lampstand (vv. 31-40), the coverings and the standing boards of the tabernacle (26:1-37), the altar of burnt offering (27:1-8), and the hangings for the court (27:9-19). The pattern for the incense altar and the laver are omitted in this section. The pattern for the incense altar (30:1-10) is given after the priestly garments (28:1-43) and the sanctification of Aaron and his sons, the priests (29:1-46). The pattern for the laver (30:17-21) is given with the instructions concerning the priests&rsquo; going into the Tent of Meeting to serve God (v. 20). Hence, two items, the incense altar and the laver, are linked with the priests and are not spoken of with the furniture of the inner and outer courts of the tabernacle. We need to consider these matters. In this portion of the Scriptures the Holy Spirit indicates that the building of God and the coordination of the priests are one, and in the New Testament the two are one and inseparable.</p>
