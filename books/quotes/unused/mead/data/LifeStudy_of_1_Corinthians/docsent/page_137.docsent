   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FORTY-SEVEN THE TYPE OF ISRAEL Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 10:1-13</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First Corinthians 10:1-13 is a special section of the Word, a portion written with the history of the children of Israel as the background.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul wrote this Epistle not only according to the situation at Corinth, but also with the history of the children of Israel as the background.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Israel is a complete type of the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible contains two histories the history of Israel and the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The history of the children of Israel is a type, and the history of the church is the fulfillment of the type.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the entire Bible gives us one revelation, the revelation of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the Old Testament we have a type, a picture, of God s economy, whereas in the New Testament God s economy is fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In both 1 Corinthians and Hebrews Paul presents a clear view of the history of Israel as a type and portrait of the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have seen that in 5:7 and 8 Paul refers to the Passover and to keeping the feast.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The children of Israel experienced the Passover and kept the feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As Christians in the New Testament age, we also have our Passover and our feast of unleavened bread.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 10:1-13, part of the section which deals with the eating of sacrifices to idols, Paul again refers to the history of Israel, taking it as a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I. AN ILLUSTRATION OF RUNNING</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE RACECOURSE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we would understand why in 10:1-13 Paul again refers to Israel as a type, we need to remember that chapter nine is an insertion related to Paul s own person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The fact that 10:1-13 is a continuation of this insertion is proved by the word for in 10:1.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This word indicates that what follows is a continuation and an explanation of what has gone before.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Chapter ten is not only a continuation of chapter nine, but also a further definition of the race in 9:24-27, with the children of Israel in the wilderness used as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the end of chapter nine Paul charges us to run the Christian course, and in chapter ten he uses the children of Israel as an illustration of running this course.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The running of the Christian course ordained by God is typified by the history of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Israelites ran the course from Egypt, through the wilderness, and into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It took forty years for them to complete this course.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have seen that in chapter nine Paul presents himself as a pattern of one who is pure and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we take Christ as our life and practice being one spirit with Him, we, like Paul, shall be pure and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In chapter nine Paul seems to be saying, Brothers, you should imitate me and take me as a pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I encourage you to take Christ as life and be one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This will enable you to be pure and faithful and cause you to care for your bodies, which are members of Christ and a temple of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If you have a proper regard for your bodies, you will eat in a proper way and have the proper married life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Otherwise, you will damage your body, which is the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You may also destroy other members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The way Paul deals with the practical problem of eating is full of life and spiritual understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He could deal with the problem in such a way because he was full of Christ, one with the Lord, and saturated with the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After presenting himself as a positive pattern, Paul uses the children of Israel as a negative pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In doing this, he sounds a word of warning to the Corinthians and indicates that they should imitate him, the positive pattern, but not the children of Israel, who are a negative pattern.</S>
