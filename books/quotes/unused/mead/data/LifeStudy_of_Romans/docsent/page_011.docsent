   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Through the Obedience of Faith</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The called ones receive the gospel of God through the obedience of faith 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Under the law of Moses, God gave people ten commandments to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That kind of obedience was the obedience of the law, the obedience of the commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this age of grace, God has given us one, unique commandment to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God does not require us to keep any commandment other than this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Regardless of who we are, we must obey God s commandment to believe in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whoever believes in Christ shall be saved, and whoever will not believe in Christ has been condemned already because of his unbelief John 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we obey God s unique commandment, we have the obedience of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is why the Lord Jesus said in John 16:8-9 that the Holy Spirit will convict the world of sin for not believing on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today there is one, unique commandment believing in Jesus and there is one, unique sin not believing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you believe, you have the obedience of faith and you receive the gospel of God through such obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the eyes of God the most obedient person is the one who believes in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The most disobedient person is the one who will not believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Nothing is more offensive to God than not believing in Jesus, and, on the contrary, nothing is more pleasing to God than believing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If any sinner, any prodigal son, will say, O God, thank You for sending Jesus Christ I believe in Him, the Father will be pleased.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God is happy with you when you have the obedience of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>B. Unto Grace and Peace</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The receiving of the gospel through the obedience of faith results in grace and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Grace is God in Christ as everything to us for our enjoyment, and peace is the issue of the enjoyment of God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This peace is the inward rest, comfort and satisfaction, not something outward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>V. THE POWER OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This gospel is the power of God unto salvation 1:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the book of Romans salvation means a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Salvation not only means to save us from God s condemnation and from hell; it means to save us from our naturalness, our self-likeness, our individualism, and our divisiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This salvation saves us to the uttermost, enabling us to be sanctified, conformed, glorified, transformed, built up with others as the one Body, and not divisive in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The gospel of God is the power of God unto such a full, complete, and ultimate salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is the power of God for all who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We believe.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>REVEALED IN THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Why is the gospel so powerful?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is powerful because the righteousness of God is revealed in it 1:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to John 3:16, salvation is out of God s love.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to Ephesians 2:8, salvation is by God s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But here Paul does not say that salvation is out of the love of God or by the grace of God; he says that it comes by the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Neither love nor grace is related to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>No law forces people to love and no law compels people to give grace.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whether I love you or not, I am still lawful, and whether I extend grace to you or not, I am still legal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In a sense, God is not bound to love us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If He likes, He may love us; if He does not like, He may forget about us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, God is not legally held to show us grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whenever He feels happy, He may say, Here is grace ; when He feels unhappy, He may stay away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God is not bound to love; neither is He legally held to extend grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Righteousness, on the contrary, is very much related to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since Christ has fulfilled all the righteous requirements of the law, God is bound to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you say, Lord Jesus, You are my Savior, you can turn to God and say, God, You have to forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whether You like it or not, You must forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You are righteous if You forgive me, but You are unrighteous if You don t forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Be strong to speak to God in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Because Christ has fulfilled all the righteous requirements of the law, God is bound by His righteousness to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Righteousness is a mighty bond.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God is under such a bond to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God cannot escape He has to save us because He is righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>First John 1:9 says that if we confess our sins, God is righteous to forgive us our sins because Christ has died for us and has shed His blood for us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, God must cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There was power in the gospel preached by Paul because the righteousness of God was revealed in it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we come to chapter 3, we will see God s righteousness.</S>
