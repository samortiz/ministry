   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ILLNESS AND GOD S DISCIPLINE A. God s Disciplining Hand</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>behind Some Sicknesses</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is interesting to note that unbelievers often are easily healed, while Christians are not healed so easily.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The New Testament shows that when unbelievers went to the Lord, they were healed immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible also speaks of the gift of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both believers and unbelievers can be healed through the gift of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the Bible also shows that some Christians were never healed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Trophimus was one, Timothy was another, and Paul was a third.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These three were the best brothers in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul kept Trophimus in Miletus because he was sick and nothing could be done 2 Tim 4:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Paul advised the sick Timothy to take some wine because his stomach was not clean; Timothy was not healed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even Paul himself suffered and was weak because of an eye disease or some other malady.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is why he said that there was a thorn in his flesh 2 Cor 12:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A thorn always irritates people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even though a thorn is very small, it is very uncomfortable when lodged in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even when it is lodged in the little finger, it can be very painful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul s thorn was not a small one but a big one.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This thorn caused discomfort to his whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In verse 9 he used the term weakness, which tells us how much he suffered!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These three persons were the best brothers, yet they were never healed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Instead, they bore their illnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Illnesses are different from sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sins cannot yield the fruit of sanctification, whereas illnesses can yield the fruit of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is wrong to lump illnesses together with sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are some similarities between the two, but there are also many dissimilarities.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The more a man sins, the filthier he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But a man does not become filthier by becoming sick.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In fact, he can become holy through his sickness, because God s disciplining hand is with his sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sickness can result in discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When God s children are sick, they have to learn to submit to God s mighty hand 1 Pet 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. Accepting the Lesson</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That Comes with the Illness</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you have an illness, you should learn to deal with your problems one by one before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After you have dealt with them, you may conclude that God s hand is upon you and that He is doing this to stop you from becoming proud and wild like other sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You should remember that you must accept not only the illness but also the lesson that comes with this illness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Having an illness alone is useless; you must learn the lesson that comes with the illness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Illness alone cannot sanctify a person; it is the acceptance of the lesson that comes with the illness that sanctifies a person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You must reap the benefit and result that come with the illness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps God put His hand on you in order to humble you as He did Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He prevented Paul from becoming proud through the revelations that he had received.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God may allow a sickness in our flesh to soften us because we are too strong in our disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These things can explain why He does not heal us immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sickness alone does not profit anyone; only the softening brings the profit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no point in being ill all our lives unless the illness will soften us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many people have been sick all their life, yet they have never been dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Such sickness is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes a person recovers from an illness after a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But even though the sickness is over, the Lord may not let the person go.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Other things will come along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As soon as one becomes sick, he has to go to the Lord and seek His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Often we can identify the Lord s discipline in our sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God disciplines many people through their illness and touches them in certain areas.</S>
