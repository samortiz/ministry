   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Nullifying the Poison</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Wild Gourds with Flour</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the disciples of Elisha were short of food, they cooked a stew with poisonous gourds.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Elisha nullified the poison of the wild gourds with flour 2 Kings 4:38-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In principle, the Lord Jesus did the same thing for His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He warned them, saying, "Watch and beware of the leaven of the Pharisees and Sadducees" Matt 16:6-12 , and He healed the disciples with Himself as the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many of the teachings in today's Christianity are "poisonous gourds."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some Christian books are good, but many are not pure.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have recommended certain writings by Andrew Murray, Madame Guyon, Brother Lawrence, and others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have especially recommended Andrew Murray's masterpiece The Spirit of Christ, as well as God's Plan of Redemption by Mary E. McDonough and Life on the Highest Plane by Ruth Paxton.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Among us we also have the ministry of Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Nee's ministry was rejected by the Western missionaries in his youth, but today his ministry is known by seeking Christians throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By the Lord's mercy and grace, in the last seventy years nearly all the crucial, important revelations of the Bible have been covered in Watchman Nee's ministry and my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I would urge you to pay attention to these pure and healthy things and not waste your time collecting "poisonous gourds."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>E. Healing Leprosy</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In 2 Kings 5 Elisha healed a case of leprosy Luke 4:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord Jesus did the same thing in His ministry Matt 11:5; 8:1-4; Luke 17:11-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>F. Floating with a Wooden Stick</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>the Ax Head That Had Fallen into the Waters</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In 2 Kings 6:1-7 Elisha floated with a wooden stick an ax head that had fallen into the waters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This signifies Christ recovering with His cross, in resurrection, the power of sinners that had fallen into the death water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As sinners, we lost our "ax head," our power, but Christ has recovered this lost power in resurrection with the "wooden stick" of His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>G. Cursing the Mocking Boys</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 2 Kings 2:23-24 Elisha cursed the mocking boys to be torn up by two female bears out of the woods.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who think that the Lord Jesus did not do the same thing in principle need to read the Gospel of Matthew again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Matthew 3:12 says that the wheat will be gathered into the Lord's barn but that He will burn the chaff with unquenchable fire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be sure, this burning of the chaff is a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, in Matthew 12:31-32, 34 the Lord Jesus warned the Pharisees concerning an unforgivable sin, the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Matthew 23 He spoke eight woes to the scribes and Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This was His curse to them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>By all of the foregoing we can see that Elisha was a very accurate type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Elisha changed the age in type, and the Lord Jesus did the same thing in fulfillment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today we are in the changed age, the age of the fulfillment of God's New Testament economy.</S>
