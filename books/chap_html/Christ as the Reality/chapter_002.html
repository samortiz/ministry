<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>GOD’S REQUIREMENTS AND GOD’S FOOD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Lev. 1:1-10, 14-17; 6:8-13; 7:8; Psa. 20:3; Num. 28:2</h1><p>Note: In order to be more accurate according to the original language, changes should be made in the above verses. Change all the instances of “bring” to the verb “present” except in Leviticus 1:15; “the priest shall bring it unto the altar.” Also change “offer” to “present.” The word “offerings” should be changed to the noun “present,” except when it reads “burnt offering.” Also in the phrase “an offering by fire,” it should remain as “offering.” “Burnt sacrifice” should also be changed to “burnt offering.”<p>We have seen two things whereby God meets us and we meet God. It is by the tabernacle that God comes to meet us, and it is by the offerings that we can meet God. This is Christ coming and going. God is in the heavens, and we are on the earth. How can God come to us? Praise the Lord, it is through Christ being the tabernacle! And how can we go to God? It is by Christ being all the offerings.<h2 class=head1>THE REQUIREMENTS OF GOD</h2><p>Exodus shows us a tabernacle on the earth, and this tabernacle is of three parts. There is the outer court, which has a white linen fence enclosing the tabernacle. Then within the outer court, there is the tabernacle which is divided into two parts: the holy place, which is the outer part and the Holy of Holies, which is the inner part. Within the Holy of Holies, there is the ark. These three parts comprise the tent of meeting, which is Christ enlarged.<p>Christ Himself is the ark individually, and when He is enlarged, He becomes the tabernacle. This signifies the church; so it is called the tent of meeting.<p>Once the tabernacle is erected, God is no more just the God in the heavens, but the very God on the earth among His people. Christ as the tabernacle has brought God down to the earth. God is now in the tent of meeting, in the midst of us, through Christ the tabernacle. God is here, but how may we contact Him? God is on the earth among the people, but look at ourselves. We are so sinful. How can we contact God? This is the reason for the fence in the outer court. The white linen fence signifies the righteousness of God. God is righteous, and His righteousness is an enclosing fence. If we would contact this very God who is now on the earth among His people, we need to pass through this fence. In other words, we must meet the requirements of this fence. The righteousness of God is a kind of requirement.<p>Can we meet the righteous requirement of God? In ourselves, we are nothing but sin and unrighteousness. We are not qualified to meet the requirement of God’s righteousness. But praise the Lord, we have Christ! Christ is God’s righteousness; so He is qualified to meet the requirement on our behalf.<p>Within the tabernacle, on nearly every side, there is gold. All the boards on each of the four sides are overlaid with gold. It is a golden place. Gold signifies God’s nature, which is holy. Not only is the righteousness of God a requirement, but also His holiness. If we would meet with God, we must meet the requirement of His holiness as well as His righteousness.<p>In addition, on the ceiling at the top of the tabernacle there are the cherubim. The cherubim in typology signify God’s glory. Thus, there is another requirement, the requirement of God’s glory. If we would meet with God, we must meet these three divine requirements. There is the requirement of divine righteousness, divine holiness, and divine glory. God is now on the earth in the tabernacle, but do not think that He is on the earth in a careless way. He is enclosed by His righteousness and holiness, and He is also covered by His glory.<p>There is the separating line of white linen. This is the first enclosure of the righteousness of God. God’s righteousness is a separating line. It separates unrighteousness from righteousness. The second enclosure is made of gold. Linen is the first boundary, and gold is the second. Righteousness is the first requirement, and holiness is the second. God is enclosed within these two requirements, and He is covered by His glory. If we would enter the Holy of Holies to meet this righteous, holy, and glorious God, we need to meet all His requirements. Do you think that you can make it? Do you have the righteousness, the holiness, and the glory? We need Christ not only as the tabernacle, but also as the offerings.
