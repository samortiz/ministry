We hope that by January of next year, we will have one hundred brothers and sisters to be the pioneers. Thereafter, every two months we will have thirty more to follow them. In March, May, July, September, and November, we will add thirty more people each time. Then in the following year, we will do the same thing by sending thirty brothers and sisters out every two months. In all there will be twelve waves with a total of three hundred sixty people. After the start of this move, the training center will produce fifteen people every month. If we cannot send out thirty people every two months, all of us will have to fast and pray because this is an important matter.<h2 class=head1>THE WORK OF THE LORD NOT BEING A MOVEMENT BUT AN ACTIVITY IN LIFE</h2><p>The work of the Lord on earth was never a movement. The Gospels show us that when the Lord Jesus was working for God on earth, He did not advertise or gather huge gatherings; He did not solicit any contacts for the sake of the work. All social activities in human society are basically movements. As such, they need advertisements and huge gatherings. There is also the need for soliciting contacts as a kind of work. But the Lord was not promoting a movement on earth. Hence, the disciples whom the Lord called were mostly humble people of little education. The first pair of brothers that the Lord called, Peter and Andrew, were both fishermen (Matt. 4:18). The second pair of brothers, James and John, were also fishermen (Matt. 4:21). A fisherman did not have a high education or refined culture; he would not have been that eloquent, much less would he have known how to advertise, how to organize huge congregations, or how to do other things of that nature. If the Lord Jesus were to gain the refined ones, He would have had to go to Judea to find them. All the talented ones were gathered in Jerusalem, close to the city of David. But the Lord began His work in Galilee, the fishing land. Of the twelve apostles that Jesus called, eleven were Galileans. Only one was a Judean. It is so strange that in the end he was the very one who betrayed the Lord. This proves that the Lord was not spreading a movement on earth.<p>This was true not only with the Lord Jesus; with the apostles it was the same. Acts 4 tells us that when the Jewish Sanhedrin interrogated Peter and John, they realized that these ones were uneducated and unlearned men. This proves that the apostles were not promoting a movement either.<p>Next we come to Paul. According to his background, Paul was much more refined than the Galilean fishermen. But neither was his labor for God a work. He was born in the then highly cultured city of Tarsus (Acts 22:3). Academically speaking, doubtless he was educated in the highest school of learning there. Religiously speaking, he was taught by Gamaliel, the most knowledgeable rabbi of Judaism at the time. But after he was saved, he did not promote a movement either. We only see him preaching Christ Jesus everywhere. The Jews were jealous of him; they tried their best to catch him. He was forced to go to Antioch, a place not much noticed by the Jews (Acts 13:1).<p>In Antioch he did not promote any movement. Acts 13 tells us that while they were there fasting and praying, the Holy Spirit separated Paul and Barnabas and sent them out (vv. 2-3). This sending was not a movement; there was no formality. Only a few prophets and teachers laid their hands on them. When they went out to preach the gospel, there was no organization or arrangement. They preached this way until they reached the west and north coasts of the Mediterranean Sea. Everywhere they went they set up churches. Hence, from the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles, we cannot detect any flavor of a movement in the works of the Lord Jesus or of the apostles. This is because what they did was not a movement but an activity in life. They were a group of people constituted by life. They knew nothing except to act according to life.<p>After Paul met the Lord on the way to Damascus, he was completely changed. The former Saul of Tarsus had been a persecutor of those who believed in the Lord. Now he became a saved Paul speaking to everyone about Jesus, even entering into the synagogues of the Jews to preach there. Everywhere he went he lived this way. For Paul, preaching Jesus was not a work; rather, it was his living. You have to know that, outwardly speaking, going to the countryside for the spread of the gospel is a work. Actually, it has to be your living. Some have misunderstood; they thought, &#8220;Brother Lee has gone to Taiwan to promote a great movement.&#8221; But I must tell you soberly that we are not after a movement. To go to the countryside for the spread of the gospel is not a movement but a living. When you go to the countryside, you are bringing the Lord Jesus and His gospel to people and sharing with them the truth in the Bible. This move of dispensing is not a movement but a living.<h2 class=head1>THE LORD HAVING CHOSEN US TO GO FORTH AND BEAR FRUIT</h2><p>Today I want to give you two verses. The first one is in John 15:16: &#8220;You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit.&#8221; If you have an inexplicable sensation within that you have been touched by the Lord, it is a proof that the Lord has chosen you. I have the faith and confidence that from the time I first began to serve the Lord, He has been in me as my motivating power. This has been true even until today.<p>While I was walking on the road on the evening that I was saved, I was touched by the Lord within. At that time I did not know what it meant to be touched; nor did I know what it was to be chosen. But I lifted up my eyes to heaven and said to God, &#8220;O God, from this day on, even if the whole earth is offered to me, I will not take it. I will take the Bible and go to the villages house by house to tell people to believe in Jesus.&#8221; At the time I did not feel that that was a prayer. I only uttered those few words to God. I did not realize that by those few words I had sealed myself for God. Later, after I graduated from school, the Lord said to me, &#8220;Did you not say that you wanted to go to the villages with your Bible?&#8221; I tried to find reasons for retracting. But after some time, the Lord reminded me again, &#8220;Did you not say that you wanted to go to the villages with your Bible?&#8221; For eight years, from 1925 until 1933, I was unhappy. There was something within that could not be shaken away. Later I found out that it was the Lord&#8217;s choosing.<p>Do you have this something within the depth of your being today? If you do, it means that the Lord has found you. Although the universe is vast, the Lord did not go to other planets. Rather, He came to the earth, even to the shores of the sea of Galilee. He did not enter into other boats but went onto the boat of Peter to seek him out. In the same way, though the world is so big, the Lord did not go elsewhere. He came rather to your boat to seek you out. Outwardly speaking, it was the church preaching the gospel and your classmates inviting you to attend which resulted in your receiving the Lord. Actually there was another story within; you knew that the Lord Jesus had sought you out. Although you realized that you were over twenty years old and that you had to make plans for yourself, your parents, and your family, something within made you unconcerned about all the earthly things. Some drop everything readily to preach Jesus; but most are like myself, not being so quick and ready. However, the Lord Jesus continues to bother you day and night. You can no longer be as free as the others are. Others can easily look for jobs, go abroad, or get married. But for you, wherever you go, the Lord Jesus is there bothering and tormenting you. He does not let you go.<p>In John 15 when the Lord said that the disciples had not chosen the Lord but that the Lord had chosen them, Peter had already been following the Lord for three and a half years. The Lord reminded Peter that it was not he who had dropped the net and forsaken the boat to seek the Lord in Nazareth; rather, it was while Peter was busy casting the net and fishing in the sea that the Lord had sought him out. It was the Lord who had chosen Peter and had appointed him to go forth to bear fruit. When the Lord called Peter, He said, &#8220;I will make you fishers of men&#8221; (Matt. 4:19). After three and a half years, the Lord sent Peter forth to bear fruit (John 15:16). To be a fisher of men may still be an outward activity; but to bear fruit is an outflow of the inward life. It is a transmission, an expression, and a dispensing of life. For this, the Lord charged Peter to abide in Him (John 15:4). Peter was not the tree. The unique, true vine is the Lord. Peter was only a branch on the tree. If the branch does not abide in the tree, it cannot bear fruit of itself.<p>In God&#8217;s garden we see only one tree. In the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth, there is also only one tree, the tree of life (Rev. 22:2). This tree is Christ. Today God is cultivating only this tree, which is the Lord Jesus. We are all branches which are grafted into this tree. For this reason we cannot be separated from Him. We must live together with Him. He is our life within, and we are His expression without, living Him out in our life. It is in this condition that we bear fruit one by one. Hence fruit-bearing is not a movement in work but a result in life through man living before the Lord and being joined to Him.<p>Outwardly speaking, our spread to the countryside does have some organization and arrangement. But these are not what we are after. What we are after are the things of life behind all these arrangements, activities, and moves. For this reason, you receive the full-time training as your preparation. After you are trained and have passed through much experience in life, you will be able to live Christ when you go out for the spread of the gospel. This is to bear fruit. It is to dispense the Christ who lives in you to others through door-knocking, visiting people, and contacting people.<p>This can be seen from the case of Paul. Others reviled him as being &#8220;a pest&#8221; (Acts 24:5). Paul was full of the &#8220;Christ-germ.&#8221; Whoever touched him or spoke with him received Christ. I hope that every one of you would be like Paul. When you go to the villages next year, you should all carry the &#8220;Christ-germ.&#8221; Regardless to which city, town, village, or hamlet you go, as soon as you knock on others&#8217; doors and enter into their homes, preaching to them for fifteen minutes and contacting them in this way, they will be infected. I have been infected with the &#8220;Christ-germ&#8221; for over sixty years. Sometimes this &#8220;sickness&#8221; gets a little less severe. At other times the &#8220;sickness&#8221; is so severe that others catch it also.<h2 class=head1>FRUIT-BEARING REQUIRING THE MATURITY AND FRESHNESS IN LIFE</h2><p>The &#8220;abiding&#8221; in John 15 is not an ordinary living. It carries the meaning of lodging and residing. In 14:2 the Lord said, &#8220;In My Father&#8217;s house are many abodes.&#8221; The noun abode has the same root as the verb abide in 15:4. What the Lord means here is that we should lodge and abide in Him. There should be nothing between Him and us. We should never be separated but should instead be one forever. At the same time, in order for a tree to bear fruit, there must be the growth and maturity. A young tree cannot bear fruit. But for a mature tree to bear fruit there must be the new branches. Hence, maturity and freshness are the conditions for fruit-bearing. Those brothers and sisters who have been saved for a long time may be mature; but it is possible that they do not have fresh branches. If you are mature but old, you cannot bear fruit. In order for a tree to bear fruit, the farmer has to cut off the old branches and retain the original trunk so that the old trunk will bear new branches. The new branches will then bear fruit. I hope that those brothers and sisters who have passed through four terms of training would not become old. If you go to the villages in an old way, you will not have the flavor of the new life, and people will not be saved. A gospel preacher must be one who is full of the flavor of new life. When this life enters into man, it results in fruit-bearing. When you go down to the villages, you are not promoting a movement but are conducting a living that is full of the flavor of the new life and that bears new fruit through living Jesus.<h2 class=head1>THE NEED FOR CONTINUOUS CONSECRATION, PRAYER, AND DEALING</h2><p>The exercise that you are now having makes your life mature and fresh. The first thing one has to exercise himself in is a continuous consecration. This is not merely a daily consecration but one that is renewed hourly. Second, there is the need for continuous prayer. Third, there is the need to receive continuous dealing. The environment in the Training Center and every aspect of its living, including eating, sleeping, dressing, moving about, and whatever there is that is not suitable to you, is a kind of dealing. The dealing that you are receiving now is your preparation for the spread of the gospel in the future. If you refuse the dealing, your life will not grow. The Gospels show us that the Lord never sent people out to preach the gospel alone. The principle of sending out people for work in the Bible is in twos (Mark 6:7). Moreover, when the Lord sent out His disciples, He did not put Peter and Andrew, brothers in the flesh, together. Rather, He put Peter and John together. Neither does the Lord put two clever ones or two foolish ones together. Instead He matches a slow one with a fast one, a gentle one with a rash one, and a foolish one with a clever one.<p>I have observed that this is the same in marriages. I have never seen a couple that is exactly alike. Mostly the quick ones are matched to the slow ones, the ones who like hot food are matched to the ones who like cold food, and the talkative ones are matched to the quiet ones. It is so wonderful that after all the time of choosing, one&#8217;s spouse ends up being a person of opposite personality. While living in the Training Center, surely you will encounter such things. Among your roommates and among the group with which you are coordinating, surely there are some who give others a hard and difficult time. Since the time I dropped my job to enter into the Lord&#8217;s work over sixty years ago, I have tasted thoroughly this kind of sourness, hotness, and bitterness. As soon as I dropped my job, I went to serve in Shanghai. For a northerner like me to eat the dark and sweet Shaoshin cuisine of the south was a really difficult thing to do. Our circumstances at that time were far inferior to what you have now. What you now have is too good.<p>Today these dealings in the environment are the best preparation. You will not be going to the villages alone. By next year when you leave, you will leave in teams of twenty each. After working in a place for fifteen days, eighteen will go on, leaving two behind in the locality. Whether or not these two can coordinate together depends on how much dealing they receive today. I am afraid that before you reach the villages, while you leave the gate of the Training Center to board the car, you will already be arguing about the seats. I hope that you start practicing now being insensitive to everything so that by that time when you are asked to sit in the front, you will be able to say, &#8220;Hallelujah.&#8221; Or if you are asked to sit in the back, you will also be able to say, &#8220;Hallelujah.&#8221; Even if you are asked to take the next car, you will still be able to say, &#8220;Hallelujah.&#8221; Otherwise, if you are affected and feel depressed, you will not be able to preach the gospel anymore. Hence, you must learn to have genuine growth in life by continually consecrating, praying, and receiving the dealings.<p>When we receive the dealings, we are receiving the breaking by the cross. At the same time the cross breaks us, it brings in the Spirit who is life (2 Cor. 4:11). Hence, the fruit-bearing in life comes from the breaking by the cross. Not only do you have to study the Bible, study the Life-study Messages, and pursue life; you must also continually consecrate yourself, pray, and receive dealings so that you will receive the Spirit through the breaking of the cross. If you do not do this, your study of the Bible will not have much light. Only when you allow the Spirit to have the ground in you will your reading of the Lord&#8217;s Word, through the mingling together of your spirit with it, give true benefits to you. The reason for this is that the prerequisite for having the Lord&#8217;s word is to have the Lord&#8217;s Spirit. The way to have the Spirit is through the breaking of the cross. In smooth circumstances, there is usually no breaking of the cross. But in trying circumstances, provided that you take these environmental dealings willingly, you are, in the Lord&#8217;s word, bearing the cross (Matt. 10:38). As such, you will receive the Spirit.<p>Actually, the dealing of the cross is not that man would suffer. Rather, it is to kill man. The dealing of the cross is to put man to death. This is absolutely different from the Chinese ethical teaching of patience and forbearance. The Lord wants us to accept death. In adverse circumstances, we must learn to die. If we are willing to die, we will receive the rich Spirit (2 Cor. 4:10). The Spirit within us is a preparation for the reception of the word. The Spirit and word are actually one.<p>In this way, all of you will have the experiences of life. You will have the Lord, and you will have the consecration, the prayers, and the environmental dealings. By then, it will be no problem for you to spread the gospel in the villages. Paul exhorted the Philippians in chapter two of his Epistle, &#8220;Do all things without murmurings and reasonings&#8221; (v. 14). To be without murmurings and reasonings is something that cannot be acted out. If you have the experience of the cross, the Spirit, and the word, you will have the capital. These things will become your life, power, and authority. In this way, you will be able to minister life and to dispense Christ into others as their life element. This is fruit-bearing. In the places where you will spread the work, as soon as you contact people and open your mouth, Christ will come out. The Spirit and the word will also come out, and your experience of the Lord will come out together with them.<p>Paul said in 1 Corinthians 4:15, &#8220;For though you have ten thousand guides in Christ, yet not many fathers.&#8221; A guide is one who gives teachings and instructions to the children under his care, while a father is one who dispenses his life to his children. Paul was a spiritual father. Through the gospel he begat the Corinthians in Christ, dispensing into them the life of God that they might become the children of God and the members of Christ. Physically speaking, an old man can no longer beget children because his power of reproduction has ceased. I hope that you are not an old man spiritually. An old Christian can only give a few messages, exhort people to join Christianity, and be a religious man. I hope that in your contact with people, after one or two encounters, you will be able to dispense Christ into them and to produce in them the seed, which is Christ in man as life. This is to beget someone and to dispense life into the begotten children. This is not a movement in work but a result of activity in life. It is the injection of the &#8220;Christ-germ&#8221; into man.<p>Most people think that to prepare for the gospel outreach there is the need for more prayer, more reading of the Bible, and more willingness to suffer. But these kinds of teachings are too shallow. According to my experience and observation, the matter has to be presented in a more detailed way. You have to continually consecrate yourselves, continually pray, and continually receive the dealings in the environment. The dealing of the cross brings in the Spirit. When the Spirit touches the word, the two will be mingled as one. The word is like sugar, and the Spirit is like water. When the two meet, the sugar will be dissolved into a sugar solution. When we read the Bible or spiritual books, it should be like sugar touching water. If there is the lack of the Spirit, there will be the lack of the dissolving element for the Lord&#8217;s word. If you have the Spirit and can dissolve the Lord&#8217;s word, your going out to dispense life to others will result in fruit-bearing.<p>The second verse that I will give to you is Galatians 4:19: &#8220;My children, of whom I am again in travail until Christ is formed in you.&#8221; Paul compared himself to a travailing mother. After he preached the gospel to the Galatians the first time, they deviated from Paul&#8217;s gospel. As a result, he had to travail again until Christ was formed in them. When you go out to bear fruit, you are producing spiritual descendants and raising up children in the gospel. The most important thing to remember is to have the Lord, the experience of the cross, the Spirit, and the word.<p>(The above message was given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on October 20, 1988.)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>NOT LABORING ALONE BUT LABORING TOGETHER WITH GOD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 3:6, 9; 2 Cor. 5:20; John 15:4-5</h1><h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S RELATIONSHIP WITH MAN BEING A MATTER OF MINGLING</h2><p>John 15:4 says, &#8220;Abide in Me and I in you.&#8221; We abide in the Lord, and He abides in us. It may be that we will never be clear whether it is He abiding in us or we abiding in Him. The word &#8220;abide&#8221; in Greek has the meaning of staying, remaining, and living. For example, to say that we abide in a house includes, of course, the sense that we live in the house. When we say that we abide in the Lord, it means that we stay, remain, and live in the Lord. In the same way, the Lord stays, remains, and lives in us. His abiding in us is the mingling of God and man.<p>According to God&#8217;s New Testament economy, the relationship between God and man is a matter of the mingling of God and man. On the one hand, we are in Him; on the other hand, He is in us. When the two are added together, we have the mingling. For example, we may have flour dough here. It is the result of mingling oil with flour. The flour is full of oil, and the flour is mingled into the oil. The northern Chinese make tasty nut cakes out of this kind of dough. Another example is tea added into hot water. After a few minutes, the water turns into the color of tea. The tea element in the tea has entered into the water, and the water has entered into the tea. The first mingling is a mingling of oil with flour. The second mingling is a penetration of tea into water, &#8220;tea-ifying&#8221; the water.<p>As early as the second century, there were people who saw the truth concerning the mingling of God and man. But at that time, they did not see that the mingling of the divine nature with the human nature does not take away the original element of each nor produce a third element. This mingling is not a taking away of the nature of God or the nature of man. Neither are these two natures turned into a third nature. The two natures still exist; there is no change. We will never become God through this mingling. This mingling only makes us partakers of His life (1 John 5:12) and nature (2 Pet. 1:4), thus making us the children of God (1 John 3:1). This is the same as a son and a father having the same life and nature. It does not mean that the son&#8217;s having his father&#8217;s life and nature makes him the father. In person, the son is still the son, and the father is still the father. But in nature, the two are the same.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S WORKING TOGETHER WITH MAN BEING A MATTER OF MUTUAL MINGLING</h2><p>John 15 says that the Lord is the true vine and that the believers are the branches. As such, the believers have to abide in the vine. Because of the way this is said, it may appear that this is an illustration. But 1 John 4 is definitely a fact. There it says, &#8220;In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given us of His Spirit&#8221; (v. 13). The Spirit given by God who abides in us is the witness in our spirit, testifying that we abide in God and that God abides in us. Here man is mingled with God. This is the principle of incarnation. In the whole universe, at least there is One among all of God&#8217;s creation, Jesus of Nazareth, who is a product of the two natures of God and man. He is God, yet He is also man. He is the God-man. God is not only with Him but is mingled with Him. They share the same life, the same living, the same move, and the same work. Thus, in heaven or on earth, the Lord Jesus walks and works together with God. This togetherness is not only one of being alongside one another, but one of being mingled with one another.<p>All of Christianity talks about working for God and serving God but fails to realize that to co-work with God is a matter of mingling. Brother Andrew Murray once said that the best prayer is one in which the Christ within prays to the Christ in heaven. The best prayer is one where the heavenly Christ prays to Himself from us the earthly people. In other words, the highest prayer is one where Christ prays with us by putting us on and &#8220;wearing&#8221; us. Romans 8:26 says, &#8220;For we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.&#8221; When this verse says that the Spirit intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered, does it refer to a groaning without or a groaning within the believer? Doubtless this groaning of the Spirit refers to something within. We may have never realized that while we are groaning, our groaning is the prayer of the Holy Spirit. In our experience, sometimes we have a feeling and a burden toward a certain matter, but there is no word for utterance; we can only groan. Actually this groaning affords an opportunity for the Holy Spirit to express the feelings within us. We cannot utter this groaning. It is something that even we ourselves do not understand, but God understands. God who hears our prayer understands this groaning.<p>If we read these verses carefully, we will see that God&#8217;s New Testament economy is to work Himself into man and to work man into God that God and man would be mingled as one. All of man&#8217;s worship and service to God and all of his work for God are a matter of living, walking, and laboring together under this principle of incarnation. Everyone in the church, whether they be old or young, must learn from the start of their service to God that a worker for God is just a man in God. When you step into a car, He steps into the car with you. When you are happy, He is happy with you. When you are sad, He is sad with you. When you lose your temper or when you do something that makes Him suffer or gives Him a hard time, you are working alone. When your spiritual condition is normal, you should not do anything alone. Rather, you should work together with God. Let me repeat-the togetherness here is not one of being alongside one another. It is not an outward togetherness. The togetherness here is one of being mingled with one another. It is a togetherness in mingling.<h2 class=head1>A VISION OF THE MINGLING BEING THE CAPITAL AND THE BOLDNESS IN OUR WORK</h2><p>Perhaps you are well-blended with the brothers and sisters. But no matter how well you get along with them, your togetherness is not a mingling. In us, however, and in all the brothers and sisters, there is One who is mingled not only with us but with all the saints. We are all mingled with Him. In the end we are all mingled with one another. When you are mingled with God in a normal way, you are also mingled with all the brothers and sisters. You can say that you are in the brothers and sisters and that they are in you. This is like saying that electricity is in the power station and is also in this hall as well as in every light bulb. We can also say that the power station is in the hall and the hall is in the power station. Through the electricity, the light bulbs are all in one another. By themselves every light bulb is separate and independent; but in the electricity they are all mingled together and are inseparable. God is Spirit. He is like the electricity. He is in us, and we are in Him. In this way, we are also in one another.<p>When Peter stood up with the eleven apostles on the day of Pentecost (Acts 2:14), something unfolded in the universe-the God in heaven joined Himself to man on earth. Through this, heaven and earth were joined as one. When the twelve stood there, they stood as one. They were one entity. That was a tremendous mingling. This is the situation that the church should be in today. In the future when you go to the villages, what you need is this vision. Those who participate in the outreach should have the understanding and perception that they are not going out alone but are going with Him. They go out in a mingling in which He puts them on and now abides in them. Not only are they mingled with Him, but they spread by going down to the villages and by mingling with all the co-workers and all the brothers and sisters. If you understand this mingling, your faith will increase. This will be your capital as well as your boldness in the work.<p>Peter was such an example. On the day of Pentecost, the Galilean fisherman was afraid of nothing but was bold to speak the word of God in the great city of Jerusalem in front of all the noble and dignified people. His boldness came from this mingling. Peter had followed the Lord Jesus for three and a half years. He saw with his own eyes the Lord being crucified and buried. After the Lord resurrected, he visited the empty tomb. Later the resurrected Lord appeared to him and breathed into him, telling him to receive the Holy Spirit (John 20:22). By then the resurrected Christ had become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). From that day on, the resurrected Lord entered into Peter and changed him entirely. Peter in the four Gospels was a foolish man full of the natural constitution and the flesh. He even argued with the eleven disciples concerning who was the greatest.<p>But by Acts 1, there were a hundred twenty people there. Not only were there brothers, but there were sisters as well. In that complicated situation, Peter did not argue. Not only did Peter and John have no argument; even the hundred twenty there had no disagreement (v. 14). They were all in one accord, persevering in prayer for ten days. All of a sudden, Peter stood up and spoke. That Galilean fisherman began expounding Psalms. Peter was the first expositor after the Lord Jesus. Although he had not attended any Greek college nor had he been taught at the feet of Gamaliel, the Spirit was in him. His exposition was too wonderful on that day. While he was praying to the Lord, he was already mingled with the Lord. Under this ideal condition, Pentecost came. A noise came from heaven, and the Holy Spirit was poured out upon him. The Spirit had been in him prior to that. Now in addition the Spirit came upon him outwardly to strengthen him. He was released and had the boldness to work with God.<p>When Peter stood up to speak, doubtless he was working with God. While he was standing there, he was joined to heaven and earth. At that moment heaven and earth were all joined in him. It was as the Lord Jesus had said, that all authority in heaven and on earth was given to Him (Matt. 28:18). I hope this scene that I am describing today would become your vision. Next year, you should go out to spread the gospel under this vision. Peter&#8217;s gospel preaching was not a teaching of doctrines but a matter of being joined to God and being one with the Spirit. Under that kind of circumstance, the one hundred twenty left no ground for opinion, disposition, and temper. They were all in the same Spirit and the same breath. Everyone was responding to the words of Peter with loud &#8220;Amens.&#8221; This is what you should do when you go to the villages. When you go out two by two to knock on others&#8217; doors and to speak with people inside their homes, do not forget that heaven and earth are joined to you. There is no need for you to call upon heaven and earth; heaven and earth will follow you because you are there working with the Lord.<p>In 1 Corinthians 3:6 Paul said, &#8220;I planted, Apollos watered, but God made to grow.&#8221; According to our concept, Paul planted first, then Apollos came later to water, and finally God gave the growth in life. Actually, Paul was mingled with God, and Apollos was mingled with God. That was not all. These two distant co-workers were also mingled with one another in the One with whom they were mingled. Had the two co-workers not been mingled in God, there would have been no possibility for these two who had not crossed each other&#8217;s path to plant and to water separately. The fact that they were doing this was surely due to their being in the same Spirit. In 1 Corinthians 4:15 Paul said, &#8220;In Christ Jesus I have begotten you through the gospel.&#8221; The begetting here is the planting. Paul preached the gospel in Corinth. When the Corinthians received the word that Paul preached, the seed of the gospel of Christ was planted into the Corinthians through him. What was sown into them was the seed, and what grew out was the tree. As far as the seed is concerned, it is a planting, and as far as the tree is concerned, it is a watering. Throughout the process, neither Paul nor Apollos were working alone but were working with God. While Paul sowed, God was there dispensing life, and while Apollos watered, God was there adding more life. This is what Paul meant by saying that he planted, Apollos watered, and God made to grow. This is to work with God.<h2 class=head1>CLAIMING OUR ENJOYMENT ON THE GROUND OF OUR CO-WORKING WITH GOD</h2><p>Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5:20 that we are ambassadors sent by God to beseech and to entreat others on behalf of God to repent to Him, to be reconciled to Him, and to be one with Him. Although this work was not conducted by God Himself directly but was entrusted to Paul who carried it out as His ambassador, Paul wanted the Corinthians to know that his work was actually God&#8217;s work. God was working within His ambassador. The two were one. When Paul went to Corinth, God also went there. The beseeching and entreating of Paul were the beseeching and entreating of God. Paul brought God along with him. He was a co-worker with God. This is a very fundamental point. No matter how young you are, you have the right to claim the riches in this matter. You have the right to say to God, &#8220;God, when I go out today, I am not working alone or by myself. Rather, I am co-working with You. I am going out with You.&#8221; This understanding and realization will become in you your vision, your experience, and your ground. Daily you can stand on it and live in it.<p>The reason so many preachers in Christianity are weak and poor is because they have not seen this vision. They have not taken this ground and are not exercising their rights on this ground or claiming the enjoyment which is properly theirs. I hope that you will all have this fundamental understanding. When you have this vision, all your concepts, actions, and attitudes will be changed. For example, before you are married, you live a bachelor&#8217;s life. However, after you are married, you live together with your spouse as a couple. If you do not change your life-style, you will be in trouble. When you consider how your life-style has changed, your actions are affected by it.<p>In the same way, for you to work together with God and for Him to be with you, you cannot do just as you please. In everything you have to ask Him. As far as He is concerned, everything is ready; but as far as I am concerned, many times I am unaffected when He has already gone on. On God&#8217;s side, He was ready long ago. It is we who are lacking in cooperation. Here we have to learn a lesson, which is to fellowship with Him in everything. Whatever we do, we should look to Him, seek Him, and discuss with Him. This practice will calibrate you. You do not realize how much trouble you have caused by being hasty. After you fellowship with God, He will act faster than you do and will &#8220;stop your car&#8221; and rescue you. Sometimes, however, you need to be adjusted the other way because you are too slow. I can tell you that God is the One who can best balance you.<h2 class=head1>BEING ONE WITH GOD TO HAVE SWEET COORDINATION WITH THE BROTHERS AND SISTERS</h2><p>I have told people that it is not difficult to work together with man but that it is very difficult to coordinate with God. Sometimes, for the purpose of training us, God becomes very difficult with us. When we want to be fast, He insists on being slow. This is why some have experienced being angry with God. It is like Martha when Jesus came to her. She complained, &#8220;Lord, If You had been here, my brother would not have died&#8221; (John 11:21). According to Martha, the Lord delayed until her brother was dead, buried, and stinking. What was the use to come then? Martha&#8217;s complaint was her anger. Paul said in Philippians 2:14, &#8220;Do all things without murmurings and reasonings.&#8221; To murmur is to be angry, and to reason is to argue. To be without murmurings and reasonings is to be without anger and arguments. We say that the best church in the New Testament was the church in Philippi, and the best believers were the Philippian believers. But Paul gave this charge to them. I would say the same thing to you today. When you go to the villages for the spread of the gospel, do not murmur and do not reason. It is not a sweet thing to murmur or to reason.<p>God can accomplish things in a speedy way; but for the purpose of training us, He would not do things that way. Even when He does, He will only do so for others but not for you. I say this so that you will have a deep impression. Today you are involved in the Lord&#8217;s business. It is different from all the business in the world. In all other lines of business, we do things by ourselves. But when you go to preach the gospel in the villages or in the communities, you are not doing this alone. Rather you are doing this together with the Lord. As long as you can coordinate with the Lord, you will have no problem in co-working together with the other brothers and sisters. If you have a problem with the brothers and sisters in your room or your team, it proves that you have a problem with the Lord. Not only do you have to learn this lesson from man, but you also have to learn this lesson from God.<p>Can you coordinate with God? Is there a problem between you and God? Or does God have a problem with you? If you do have a problem with Him, your prayer will be hindered. When there is a gap between you and God, it is like a couple whose relationship is strained; it will be difficult to strike up any conversation. The relationship between the husband and the wife is entirely not a matter of reason but of love. When there is love, everything is all right. When there is no love, no reason will suffice. The right and wrong between a husband and wife depend not on facts but on feelings. The problem is the same with us in our service before God. When there is a harmonious feeling between us and God, there will be no problem.<p>Hence, you have to remember that this One is not only beside you, but He is even in you and is active within you all the time. He is with you every day-in your eating, sleeping, and everything that you do. It is a sweet word to say, &#8220;The Lord be with us.&#8221; But this continual presence is at times tiresome, bothersome, and hard to bear. Here is a lesson which we have to learn. If your relationship with the Lord is good, if He and you get along with each other well, and if there is no problem between you and Him, you will have no problem in coordinating with the other brothers and sisters. In the past there were many problems in our coordination. We thought that the young ones were the problem or that the old ones were the problem. Actually, neither the young ones nor the old ones are the problem. The root of the problem lies with your compatibility, your relatedness, and your oneness with the Lord. If this relationship is properly fostered, the work will prosper. If not, the work will be difficult.<p>Let me repeat again. Our co-working together with the Lord is not one in which we work side by side, nor is it one in which one works outside and the other works inside. Rather, it is one which is a mingling of the two. We are so one that there is no possibility of coming closer. The two are mingled as one. In this way we become the most free as well as the most bound persons. God has become our freedom as well as our bondage. You must learn this lesson before you can become effective and long-lasting in your work. If you are not properly mingled with the Lord, by the time you go to the villages for the gospel spread, you will have no interest or taste for whatever you do. And when you see no fruit in your work, you will be easily frustrated and will turn back. The mingling between us and the Lord is a necessary lesson for everyone who serves the Lord.<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on October 22, 1988.)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>LEARNING TO USE THE SPIRIT</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 1:9a; John 6:63; 2 Tim. 1:7; Luke 9:55</h1><h2 class=head1>CHRIST BEING THE SPHERE AND ELEMENT OF OUR SERVICE</h2><p>Contacting sinners and bringing them to the Lord is not a matter apart from man; however, neither is it a matter in man&#8217;s body nor a matter in man&#8217;s soul. Preaching the gospel and bringing people to the Lord is a matter in the spirit. In Romans 1:9 Paul said, &#8220;God...whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son.&#8221; The spirit here does not refer to God&#8217;s Spirit, but to Paul&#8217;s regenerated spirit. Christ and the Spirit are present with the believers in their regenerated human spirit. Paul served God in his regenerated spirit by the indwelling Christ who is the life-giving Spirit. This was his first key point in preaching the gospel. Paul&#8217;s word &#8220;in my spirit&#8221; is altogether a Greek expression. A Chinese person might say &#8220;with my spirit.&#8221; However, to say &#8220;with my spirit&#8221; would annul the original meaning and the connoted significance. The words &#8220;in my spirit&#8221; indicate that what is involved is not only an instrument, but also a sphere and an element. &#8220;God...whom I serve in my spirit&#8221; means the God whom I serve in this sphere and in this element. Thus, its connotation is richer than that of &#8220;with my spirit.&#8221; Many verses in the book of Ephesians speak of being &#8220;in Christ&#8221; and &#8220;in Him.&#8221; These are also Greek expressions. In Chinese one can say &#8220;by relying on Jesus,&#8221; &#8220;by virtue of Jesus,&#8221; or &#8220;by means of Jesus.&#8221; To say &#8220;saved by relying on Jesus,&#8221; &#8220;saved by virtue of Jesus,&#8221; or &#8220;saved by means of Jesus&#8221; is not wrong, yet the significance and implication are not rich enough. To say that one is &#8220;in Christ&#8221; means that Christ is not only a sphere and a person, but also an element. We are saved in His sphere, person, and element. This is by far richer in implication than to say that we are saved by relying on, by virtue of, or by means of Jesus. By saying &#8220;in Christ,&#8221; the connoted significance is not lost. Paul said he served God in the sphere of the spirit and with the element of the spirit. Hence, the sphere and the element become a means. We may apply this sphere and element to serve God in our spirit.<h2 class=head1>OUR SPIRIT BEING REGENERATED AND MADE ALIVE</h2><p>Our service to God and our work for the Lord-in particular, our preaching of the gospel-must be a move in our spirit. This is like the full-time exercise and preparation that Olympic athletes do for the sake of their body. They study how they should eat, drink, and breathe; they study all of this to develop their physical functions. Today, when we serve God, work for Him, and preach the gospel, not only does our body have to move, but our soul has to match this move by thinking with the mind, choosing with the will, and loving with the emotion. These are the different parts of our soul. In short, to serve God, to work for Him, and to preach the gospel are all matters in the spirit. We must learn to use our spirit and to apply our spirit. When we talk with others, we need to speak from our spirit; when we sing hymns, we need to sing from our spirit; when we read the Bible, we need to read from our spirit; when we wish to convey something to others, we also need to convey it from our spirit.<p>Before a man is saved, he uses either his body or his soul. All secular education, whether it is education in the home or in the school, whether it is kindergarten or the university, is training in what the Chinese call the four disciplines, that is, moral, mental, physical, and social skills. These all aim to prompt, cultivate, and nurture the faculties of man&#8217;s body and soul. The ordinary person speaks with his body and his soul; he rarely uses his spirit. But the New Testament tells us that our relationship with God is altogether in the spirit. John 4:24 says, &#8220;God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality.&#8221; This spirit refers to our human spirit. The Lord taught the Samaritan woman that she needed to use her spirit to contact God who is the Spirit. God is the living water. When man comes to drink Him, contact Him, and enjoy Him, he is worshipping Him! Our worship of God must be in our spirit. An unsaved person does not know his spirit; but we the saved ones must conscientiously learn to know our spirit. The human spirit of the unsaved is dead; it has lost its function. Peter said they are as animals without reason (2 Pet. 2:12); they live by their natural abilities. It is God&#8217;s mercy that the conscience of some is still functioning so that they can listen to the gospel and repent to receive the Lord Jesus.<p>However, we the saved ones not only have a spirit, but we have a spirit which is regenerated and has been made alive. Ephesians 2 says that we were dead in offenses and sins (v. 1), but God, being rich in mercy, even while we were dead because of offenses, raised us up together with Christ (vv. 5-6). When God raised the crucified Jesus from the dead, He also raised us up together with Him. It was by the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2) that God raised us up, thereby dispensing His eternal life, which is Christ Himself, into our deadened spirit to enliven us. When God made us alive, it was the embodiment of Himself becoming the life-giving Spirit who enlivened our deadened spirit. His Spirit came in contact with our deadened spirit like electricity passing through our body. Now this &#8220;electric current&#8221; abides in us continuously. In this way, He dwells in our enlivened spirit. Man&#8217;s spirit is his highest part. Today within our highest part lives the One who enlivened us, who even became one spirit with our spirit.<h2 class=head1>OUR INWARD REALITY BEING THE SPIRIT OF GOD</h2><p>The Chinese Union Version of the Bible confuses the heart with the spirit in John 4:24. Most Christians not only confuse the heart with the spirit, but also make no distinction between the spirit and the soul. Actually, the salvation of the spirit is one thing; the salvation of the soul is another. These are two aspects of salvation. When I started working in the United States in 1961, I led the saints to exercise their spirit from the very beginning. During those years, traveling from coast to coast, I visited many places. After hearing my messages, many older Christians who were well-acquainted with the Bible and had even gone through theological training came to me and said that they had never known that man had a spirit. Christians in general are very vague about this matter. The Chinese metaphysicists were also quite ignorant of man&#8217;s spirit. They divided man into two parts, one part being invisible, which is man&#8217;s soul which they referred to as man&#8217;s higher form, and the other part being visible, which is man&#8217;s body which they referred to as man&#8217;s lower form. As late as the turn of this century, there was still a major turbulence aroused when Mrs. Penn-Lewis spoke on the tripartite man, especially on the distinction between the spirit and the soul.<p>The Bible, however, clearly shows us that man is tripartite. First Thessalonians 5:23 says, &#8220;And may your spirit and soul and body be preserved.&#8221; This word strongly points out that man has three parts-spirit, soul, and body. If only two things were referred to here, the verse would not require the conjunction &#8220;and&#8221; in two places. Since Paul used the conjunction twice, surely there are three things here. Furthermore, it is clearly spoken in Hebrews 4:12 that the word of God is living, piercing even to the dividing of the soul and the spirit. The distinction between the spirit and the soul is too great. These two can be spoken of as two different worlds or two different spheres. According to John 3:6, &#8220;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8221; It is in our spirit that the Spirit of God regenerated us. Therefore, our spirit today is not only the highest part of man, but it is also that part which the Spirit of God has enlivened. The Spirit of God is the heavenly electric current, conducted through us and remaining in us, even becoming one spirit with our spirit. Today we must learn to serve God, work for Him, and preach the gospel in this spirit. This is because God Himself is the Spirit, and this Spirit is in our spirit. If we do not know our spirit, and if we do not know how to use our spirit or how to apply it, we cannot touch God. God is Spirit. At the same time, this Spirit dwells in our spirit. It is impossible to serve God in a genuine way without using our spirit.<p>The life which we live in the twentieth century is a life of electricity. Once the electricity is cut off, the room becomes pitch black, the elevator will not move, the washer will not turn, the freezer will not operate, and the electric cooker will cease to cook. Although a power failure may last only a few hours, everyone groans with pain. Man&#8217;s life in the twentieth century fully depends on electricity. In the same way, the Christian life is fully a matter in the spirit. Today the Christian life is fully a life of the spirit. We must learn to use the spirit. However, today there are still many Christians who are not willing to use their spirit. To them, it is too troublesome a matter. It is convenient for them to use their mind, for they have been using it since they were young. It is also convenient for them to use their emotion, since they are accustomed to living entirely in their soulish parts.<p>When you go out for the gospel outreach, this is the point you need to pay the most attention to. If you do not use your spirit regularly, you will not be able to use your spirit when you speak to people concerning the gospel. Therefore, you must know not only that God is the Spirit, but also that this Spirit dwells in your spirit and is one spirit with you in your spirit. This is what transpires inwardly in a Christian. Within this inward happening, there is a reality which is the Spirit of God. Not only do we need to use our spirit in our prayer and our speaking with God, but we need to use our spirit even when we speak with man. Since God is in our spirit, only by using our spirit can we help people to touch Him.<h2 class=head1>GOSPEL PREACHING BEING A MATTER NOT OF TECHNIQUES BUT OF THE SPIRIT</h2><p> Superficially speaking, you have come to the training to learn some very useful techniques for home visitation. However, gospel preaching is not a matter of techniques but a matter of the spirit. The proper technique is required to do anything; but this does not mean that with the technique one can succeed. To have the technique is one thing, to have the proper element as the means is another. For example, a forty-year-old sprint coach may be very successful in teaching others to run the one hundred-meter dash, but if he himself were to run, he would probably not make it physically. However, when he teaches the young athletes who have the strength to run in the field the proper technique, they will surely win the championship. Before you go for the outreach, you need to learn the techniques. Never despise the techniques. There are many techniques in preaching the gospel through home visitation. There are also many techniques in inviting people to the small group meetings. There are also many techniques in speaking with gospel friends. However, regardless of the technique employed, the power and the strength is the spirit.<p>There is no problem with the Holy Spirit; He is always waiting for us. The problem is on our side. Some Christians do not know that they have a spirit. Others know that they have a spirit but do not know how to use it. Often, when the time comes for us to preach the gospel, we are like a blind cat bumping into a dead mouse; everything is by chance. When you go to the villages, be a live cat catching live mice. We need to be agile and exercised, bringing in fresh and living people. Techniques are needed to preach the gospel; but above all, there must be the spirit. Most seminaries train people in techniques. The Pentecostal movement, on the other hand, mostly stresses the spirit and ignores the techniques. I hope that you will have both the techniques and the spirit. From now on, you should start exercising your spirit. While you speak in your daily life, you should use your spirit. In your daily life, you should learn to use the highest part within you. We all know that the body is merely a passive instrument among man&#8217;s three parts; it cannot purpose by itself. It is either our soul or our spirit that directs our body. Most people speak from their soul and rarely from their spirit. We, however, are people who love the Lord. We should learn to speak from within our spirit.<p>Whether or not our meeting is rich in content depends on the speaking of the brothers and sisters. Is the speaking from the soul or from the spirit? The fundamental difference lies in the source. If the source of the speaking is the soul, the word spoken will spontaneously be from the soul. Whether it is spoken from the spirit or from the soul all depends on the attitude of the speaker. The word of the speaker when spoken lightly is in the soul, but when spoken weightily it is in the spirit. When an unbeliever becomes angry, he uses his spirit the most. Since he has nowhere to release his anger, he has to put his whole being into his speaking, exercising all his physical strength. When we prophesy for the Lord, our tone will be weighty if we put our whole being into it. Once our tone is weighty, our word will definitely come out of the depth of our being. What comes out of the depth of our being is surely the spirit. If our attitude is casual, our tone will spontaneously be light. All the casual speaking comes from the soul. The Chinese describe a remark which does not come from the heart as &#8220;words from the lips.&#8221; Even the speaker himself will easily forget his own &#8220;words from the lips&#8221; after they are spoken. Weightless words spoken in the meeting are not a supply, but rather a distraction.<p>A Christian&#8217;s life should not be inconsequential, but should be one that is significant every day. Even now while you have not yet gone out for the outreach, you should not be a loose person. The way you speak in your daily life should carry a weighty tone. You must learn to use your spirit the moment you open your mouth. If you always exercise to speak with your spirit, when you go for the outreach in the villages, whether people come to visit you or you go to visit them, the gospel will flow out the moment you open your mouth. On the contrary, if you are a person who is careless about everything and not exercised in your ordinary speaking, you will not be able to impart the gospel, the truth, and the life to people quickly when you meet them.<h2 class=head1>THROUGH PRAYER MAN&#8217;S SPIRIT BEING CONSTANTLY EXERCISED</h2><p>Everyone who exercises his spirit prays. Only prayer makes a person exercised in his spirit, in the same way that only moving the feet enables a person to walk. If we want to walk, we must move our feet. Similarly, if we would exercise our spirit, we must pray. Prayer is not merely asking God for strength to accomplish what we are doing. Rather, prayer causes us to exercise our spirit to contact God. If you are a man of prayer, your word will come out of your spirit when you go out to contact people. Your attitude will be grave, and your tone will be weighty. Therefore, before going out to preach the gospel, you must first have an extended time of prayer to build up your spirit.<p>In 2 Timothy 1, Paul said to Timothy, &#8220;Fan into flame the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands&#8221; (v. 6). Fanning into flame the gift of God has much to do with our regenerated spirit. This gift refers to the Spirit which we received from God. The gift we received from the Lord is like a little fire dimly burning. We need to fan it into flame and add fuel to it. Paul said that &#8220;God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind&#8221; (v. 7). Power refers to our will, love refers to our emotion, and a sober mind refers to our mind. Our spirit is not frail; but we must exercise it more regularly. When we live in our spirit, our morality will be uplifted. The spirit makes a man sober and orderly. The orderliness and sobriety from the spirit come neither from rational restrictions nor from pretense; they are lived out through our spirit. For this reason, they are spontaneous. Everything done and spoken from the spirit will surely convey God.<h2 class=head1>PRAYER AND SINGING BUILDING UP MAN&#8217;S SPIRIT</h2><p>When you live in the spirit, you live in God, for God dwells in your spirit. God is powerful and gracious; He is also holy and righteous. As you live out God, love, holiness, righteousness, and power come out. In this way you become a powerful person. This power is a matter in your spirit. I hope that before you go to the villages for the outreach, you will desperately exercise your spirit and will not be a light person. It is not enough for you to be a rational person. You must exercise yourself to get into your spirit in order to build it up and strengthen it, just as an athlete exercises his body daily. He does it in order to strengthen all the muscles of his body so that eventually his will can direct his body for an outstanding performance.<p>An athlete exercises to strengthen the physical element of his body. Similarly, our exercise of the spirit builds up and strengthens our inner, spiritual element which is the Spirit bearing God&#8217;s presence within our spirit. Therefore, we should exercise our spirit all day. We should never behave loosely in our living nor should we ever speak loosely, but in everything we should follow the spirit. Paul said in Romans 8:4, &#8220;Walk...according to spirit.&#8221; Paul referred to our general conduct in living which should be according to the spirit. If you are a person following the spirit, the Scriptures you use for your gospel preaching and the songs you select will all be full of the Spirit.<p>The best way to exercise the spirit is first to pray and second to sing. Hymn singing is very effective in freeing people from the soul. It causes them to forget the soul. Before you go to preach the gospel, it is best to sing one or two gospel hymns. When you sing or pray, your spirit will be strengthened.<p>This training provides you with some preparation. In the upcoming move, you will have to live in the spirit to be a person with a high standard. By living in the spirit, you will be restricted, regulated, and sober. If you are not loose, spontaneously you will not easily have friction and conflict with others. In this way there will be no difficulties produced in your relationships with the brothers and sisters. If you cannot regulate or restrict yourselves, you will create friction with others in small matters. The best way to avoid creating difficulties is to live in the spirit and to yield to the restriction of the spirit. In this way the spirit will build up your person. In fact, a proper character that can be used by the Lord, as we have mentioned in the past, is brought forth in this way. Your going out to work for the Lord is like an army going into battle. Every one of you has to be trained to send out the gospel. For this reason, you desperately need to exercise your spirit all the time and build up your personality and character in the spirit.<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on October 27, 1988.)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST AND THE REALITY OF RESURRECTION</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 1:3-4; 8:9-11; Phil. 3:9-11</h1><p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You. You have gathered us again to open up Your word to us. We are open to You and are ready to receive You and Your word. We want to know Your resurrection in the spirit. Be with us. Be one spirit with us at this time so that we can be one spirit with You. Lord, be gracious to us, and pour Yourself out upon us and into us that we would have good fellowship in You and receive the best supply from You. Lord, grant us the word, the expression, and the utterance that You may freely speak what You want to speak and that we may touch Your will in a real way, that we could be those who are in Your heart in this age and who take this way of resurrection in spirit.<p>Lord, lead us, not only during these days of the training but all the days of our lives, that we would be in Your Spirit. Thank You that You are strengthening our inner man step by step that we could be persons in this age fulfilling Your purpose by building up the Body of Christ. Lord, oppose and destroy the enemy for us, and cover us with Your victorious blood. We hide in You under the covering of Your blood. Fight for us. We want to behold Your victory. Although we are still under sufferings and attacks, we enjoy You and experience You in a real way every day. Lord, make everything we hear real to us, and make everything that You show us true to us. We declare once again that You are the Lord. You are the sovereign One, and You are even the victorious One. We are here following You. Our hearts are set. Our wills are strengthened. Our spirits are high. We open our mouths to praise You, to sing lauds to You, to exalt Your name, to testify and speak of You everywhere, and to dispense You to others. Lord, speak to us directly now. Amen!<h2 class=head1>SUBSTANTIATING SPIRITUAL THINGS BY THE SPIRIT</h2><p>This message is a continuation of the last message. In the last message we covered the matter of our service being in the spirit and with the spirit as the sphere and the element. Moreover, we serve by this spirit. This spirit is the noblest part of our whole being. We the saved ones were not only created but are regenerated as well. Jesus has passed through all the processes and has accomplished everything, adding humanity to Himself, and uplifting humanity and bringing it into His divinity, that humanity may receive the life of God in His divinity. Today He is the firstborn Son of God with both divinity and humanity in Him. This is not all. He has been processed and is consummated as the life-giving Spirit. Not only is the Holy Spirit of God in Him, the complete Triune God is now in this life-giving Spirit. Now this Spirit abides in us. How noble and transcendent is this One in us today! The Lord of the universe, the Triune God, who has passed through all the processes to become the life-giving Spirit, is now in our spirit. We receive this truth not by our feelings, nor by our mentality, but as a spiritual fact.<p>A spiritual fact is a mysterious matter. We need the mercy of God to have this substantiated into a reality through Him being in us as our faith (Heb. 11:1). For example, in our body, there are many facts which we can neither see nor feel. We acknowledge these organic mysteries in the body not by feeling, but by the facts. In the same way, God purposely created a spirit for man at the time of creation to receive Him as life and as the food of life. Hence, whenever we mention God, we have to be in the spirit. Outside the spirit we cannot serve God and we cannot worship God. He is Spirit, and we must worship Him with the spirit in us which is the same as His nature. When we exercise our spirit, it is like touching electricity with a piece of metal; immediately electricity is passed through to our hand. The lesson of serving in the spirit is one which everyone who desires to serve the Lord has to learn from youth. We have to continually practice touching God with our spirit.<h2 class=head1>LEARNING TO EXERCISE THE SPIRIT AND TO WALK ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Man is always confused in his perception of spiritual things. There is always the lack of power of discernment. Truth is not received. On the contrary, rumors are taken to be true. The reason for this is that there is a shortage in the knowledge of the spirit. Since 1980 the Lord has shown us God&#8217;s New Testament economy, which is the Triune God dispensing Himself into the three parts of the believers. We have repeated this point again and again and have even published many messages. However, not only are these messages not spoken of in Christianity, but even among us not many are speaking them. Many times, what spread fastest are the rumors. Some are even saying that every local church is a Body. We know that as far as congregations are concerned, there can be thousands upon thousands of them. But as far as the Body is concerned, Christ has only one Body. In the body there is nothing autonomous or federated. In the body there is only the circulation of the blood. One can never divide the body.<p>As a matter of fact, the apostles never abandoned the churches after they established the elders. Paul not only wrote letters to the churches and visited them, but he also stayed in Ephesus for three years. According to the record in Acts 20, during Paul&#8217;s last journey to visit Jerusalem, in the midst of his busy schedule, he sent men to Ephesus to invite the elders; he spoke to them, telling them that from the first day that he set foot in Asia he taught them publicly and from house to house (vv. 18-20). Within Paul&#8217;s charge there were also exhortations and warnings. He did this not only to the church in Ephesus but to the church in Corinth as well. Actually, every letter of Paul&#8217;s was written to churches where elders were already established.<p>After Paul appointed elders in every place, even though he might not have been able to visit those places personally, he wrote letters to fellowship with them. He said to the church in Corinth, &#8220;And the remaining matters I will set in order when I come&#8221; (1 Cor. 11:34). If the apostles took their hands off the churches after the elders were appointed, to whom then were all the Epistles in the New Testament written? Paul said that &#8220;the anxiety for all the churches&#8221; was pressed upon him daily (2 Cor. 11:28). Some among us have misapplied the words of Brother Watchman Nee in his book The Normal Christian Church Life, claiming that the apostles should not touch anything in a local church after they have appointed the elders. Those saying these kinds of things have not read Brother Nee&#8217;s book Church Affairs written ten years later. In that book, Brother Nee said that after the apostles have appointed the elders, they still have to stay there to teach and to lead the elders, showing them how things should be done. If we do not check with the Bible and do not verify the facts, we will easily take in all kinds of hearsay.<p>Paul told the Ephesian believers to be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men. This teaching is based on man&#8217;s craftiness with a view to a system of error. This is a crafty work (Eph. 4:14). This morning I want you to know that the reason Christianity is divided into so many denominations is because no one is calm before the Lord in their spirit. The spirit is most noble and transcends everything. It is not affected by human emotions. On the contrary, it influences our emotion, our love, and our natural inclinations. If you are not willing to use your spirit and would not live in the spirit but would only walk according to the preference of the soul, you will surely be deceived. On the other hand, if you are not in the emotion or in the natural preference but are walking according to your spirit, you will be saved from deception. You young ones have just come into the Lord&#8217;s recovery. There is a long way ahead of you. I hope that you would learn to use your spirit right from the beginning.<p>You are going down to the villages for the gospel spread in January of next year. Each team will have twenty people working for two weeks in a place. After that, two will stay behind to care for the newly baptized ones. Suppose the leading brothers make an arrangement that is not that proper. For the first two weeks you may serve grudgingly. But after two months, the discontent may grow stronger and stronger within you. The wall of anger may become higher than the Great Wall of China. What should you do then? It is not easy to turn to the spirit then. If someone were to say to you that you should not be suppressed by others, that you should be autonomous, and that you should not come under the restriction of coordination, the words will become very appealing to you and will suit your appetite very well. You may think, &#8220;Let us all be autonomous!&#8221;<p>In the Bible there is a case of co-workers being divided in their ways. Acts 9 shows us that after Paul was saved, no one dared to receive him (v. 26). It was Barnabas that sought him out and brought him to Antioch (Acts 11:25-26). They met together in the church there for a full year. In chapter fourteen we see Barnabas and Paul appointing elders in Lystra, Iconium, and Antioch and strengthening the disciples there. By chapter fifteen the two of them went to Jerusalem to solve the problem of circumcision. Later they intended to visit the brothers and to see how they were doing. Barnabas was determined to bring along Mark his cousin; but Paul considered it unsuitable to take Mark along because Mark deserted them in Pamphylia and did not co-work with them any longer. A great dissension arose between Barnabas and Paul, so much so that the two parted their ways. From that time on, Acts no longer recorded the name of Barnabas. Never be too confident that you have been trained for four terms and that there are no more problems. Actually, Barnabas was a good brother. When others were reluctant to receive Paul, he sought Paul out. He had also sold his field and brought the sum of money and placed it at the feet of the apostles (Acts 4:37). Acts 14 calls Paul and Barnabas the apostles (v. 14). Even such a good brother could deviate from the Lord&#8217;s way if he did not live in the spirit.<h2 class=head1>NOT BEING IN THE NATURAL REALM BUT IN THE REALM OF RESURRECTION</h2><p>I would like to mention to you in passing that some Brethren teachers say that only those who have seen the Lord Jesus can be considered as the apostles. This kind of saying is not correct. Not only was Barnabas who had not seen the Lord called an apostle, but even Timothy, Titus, and Silas were also called apostles. None of these persons had seen the Lord. In addition, none of the three, Timothy, Titus, and Silas, received direct revelation from the Lord. They were all apostles produced by Paul. They were apostles produced by other apostles. I mentioned during the elders&#8217; meeting three weeks ago that there are different kinds of apostles. Some are produced directly by the Lord. Others are produced by other apostles. This question has been studied for over two hundred years, since the time of Zinzendorf. When the Lord raised us up in China, we considered the matter afresh. As a result we arrived at the light and revelation which we have now. Every one of you needs to have a fearful and sober attitude. The scope of truth is too broad. Our understanding is too limited. We should not make judgments based on our little understanding.<p>Do not receive rumors, hearsay, and lies. I have met a lot of these kinds of situations during my time of co-working with Watchman Nee for twenty years. Today you should receive grace to be one who serves the Lord. You must keep yourself preserved and live in the spirit. Although it is not easy to turn to the spirit when you are angry, you still have to do it. Paul prayed in Ephesians 3: &#8220;I bow my knees unto the Father...that He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man&#8221; (vv. 14-16). Paul prayed that the Lord would strengthen the believers with His power through His Spirit into their inner man. When we are angry we are in the soul and in ourselves. To turn back to the spirit in an instant requires the apostle&#8217;s prayer for us. There is the need for God to strengthen us according to the riches of His glory with power and through the Spirit into our spirit. This is a lesson that we must learn.<p>In a situation like today&#8216;s, all the rumors outside should not be taken. Actually, since the time of Paul, the church has been in confusion. We can see this from the Epistles which the apostles wrote to all the places. When Paul wrote to the church in Corinth, there were many problems in the church there. When John wrote to the believers he said, &#8220;Do not believe every spirit&#8221; (1 John 4:1). Do not think that today is a clear day. There are indeed clear days in the church life; but there are also dark days. Sometimes there are even stormy days. For this reason you have to learn to walk constantly in the spirit. Only by being in the spirit can you touch God. Only by being in the spirit can you be preserved. In the same way, only when you are in the spirit can you touch others&#8217; spirits during your contact with them. Only when you speak in the spirit will you be able to touch others&#8217; spirits and enliven them. Whatever you do apart from the spirit, whether it be good or bad, produces the same result. Whatever you do outside the spirit is done in the natural man. When you hate others you are being natural, but even your love for others is natural. Your pride is natural. Your humility is also.<p>The opposite of being natural is being in resurrection. God is never natural. God only wants resurrection. The natural being is represented in the Bible by the first one. The firstborn is the first one. Hence, God does not want the firstborn. At the Passover, the angel of destruction smote the firstborn (Exo. 12:29). Were all the firstborn of Egypt bad? It was not a question of being good or bad. As long as it was a firstborn, it was natural and had to be smitten. By the end of Revelation, John said, &#8220;And I saw a new heaven and a new earth; for the first heaven and the first earth passed away&#8221; (21:1). The first heaven and first earth are of the old creation. The New Jerusalem, the new heaven, the new earth, and everything that is new are second. The book of Hebrews calls the old covenant the first covenant and the second covenant the new covenant (9:18). Everything that is old is natural. If you are not in the spirit, even your good deeds are natural. I am afraid that even in preaching the gospel you may not be in spirit. If that is the case, then even such a good thing may have the possibility of being in the natural realm. There is only one realm we should be in, the realm of resurrection.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST BEING THE REALITY OF RESURRECTION</h2><p>My words today are mainly warnings. I want you to know that today there is confusion. Winds are blowing from all directions. When you go out to work, there is only one place which is your best sheltering harbor. This place is your spirit. You have to turn to your spirit. Whatever you hear, you have to turn to your spirit. You have to listen in spirit, and you have to consider in your spirit. If you would practice this, it will become a habit to you, and you will not want to speak, move, or say anything apart from the spirit. When you turn to the spirit, you will be delivered from your natural being and will enter into resurrection. The light of the New Testament shows us that the reality of resurrection is the Spirit of Christ. Romans 1 says that according to the flesh, the Lord Jesus came out of the seed of David, but that according to the Spirit of holiness, He was designated the Son of God in power out of the resurrection of the dead (vv. 3-4). Paul said that according to the nature of the Spirit within the Lord, He was designated in resurrection. This resurrection is the result of the operation of the Spirit. Resurrection is the expression of the Spirit&#8217;s operation within you. Any expression which does not result from the operation of the Spirit is not resurrection but rather is natural.<p>For us who fear the Lord and are genuinely learning to follow Him, nothing is a misfortune. Even misfortunes are turned into blessings. Brother Nee always said that all we have to fear is the loss of the blessing of the Lord. When the blessing of the Lord is not there, even the things that are most right are wrong. But when the blessing of the Lord is there, even the wrong things become right. Fortune and misfortune lie in God&#8217;s sovereign hands. When you go out to the villages next January, without God&#8217;s sovereign permission, no wrong will befall you. To accept a seemingly wrong arrangement is something that the natural man cannot do. Then you have to pray. The more you pray, the more you will be delivered from the natural being into the spirit. In the end, the spirit will operate, and you will be moved immediately from the natural being into resurrection. Resurrection will become your power. The power of death is known to be unconquerable. When death comes, no one can resist its visit. But resurrection is able to overcome death. All that Satan can use is death. But today we are in resurrection. Resurrection can destroy death. Resurrection has the power to counter the poison of death. When you go out to preach the gospel, you must not be in the natural realm. If you are in the natural realm, you are in the death realm of Satan. If you are not in the natural realm, you will be in spirit. Once you are in spirit, you will be in resurrection. Resurrection vanquishes all death.<p>A good gospel booklet or a suitable gospel tract is not what saves people. When you go out to preach the gospel, you have to depend on your spirit. You must preach the gospel with your spirit. If you preach the gospel in spirit, your preaching will be in reality and in resurrection. Resurrection is the spirit, and the spirit is the reality of resurrection. The Pentecostal Christians claim that they have received power. Actually, they have not yet truly come into the reality of the indwelling Spirit. True spiritual power lies in the life-giving Spirit who is the consummation of the Triune God. Today this life-giving Spirit is fully in resurrection. The light of the New Testament shows us that even God Himself is processed. Before God was processed, God had no humanity. He had not passed through death and had not yet come through death into resurrection. Strictly speaking, God cannot die; He is immortal (1 Tim. 6:16). God had no humanity; He was not qualified to die. But in order to accomplish redemption, He put on humanity, entered death, and came out of death to be consummated as the life-giving Spirit. Without the Spirit, there is no resurrection. Resurrection is in your spirit. Today, the Spirit of Christ is in resurrection. We should have a proper understanding of this.<h2 class=head1>ENTERING INTO RESURRECTION THROUGH PRAYER</h2><p>The processes that the processed Triune God went through are the putting on of humanity, the entering into death, and the coming out in resurrection. Once He came into resurrection, the Triune God who bore humanity with Him, became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection. This Spirit is the reality of resurrection. We have to learn to live in this Spirit. In this way we will be in resurrection. The power of resurrection is unconquerable. Only resurrection can overcome death. Jesus told Martha, &#8220;I am the resurrection and the life&#8221; (John 11:25). The resurrection operating in us today is this Spirit. Romans 8 says clearly that this is &#8220;the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead&#8221; (v. 11). This Spirit is linked with resurrection. In other words, it is the Spirit who is the resurrection and who has become our resurrection. This Spirit is with you. When you live and move in this Spirit, you are in resurrection. Resurrection is an invincible power; it cannot be overcome by death. For this reason, when you go out to preach the gospel, you must be in spirit. When you open up your mouth in the spirit, the Spirit will go out with you, and your word will become invincible.<p>The way to be in the spirit is to pray. Many Christians have a wrong concept about prayer. They think that to pray is to beg God and to beseech God to do something for them. The main emphasis of prayer is not in the realm of things. The main point in prayer is to pray yourself out from the natural being. There are so many rumors because there are too few people who pray. If you are a praying person, you will never believe lightly in the rumors. All those who hear rumors and spread them are superficial people. Only those who pray much and remain in the spirit are weighty. You have to be exercised in this matter.<p>I hope that you will not forget the story of Pentecost. After the disciples saw the Lord Jesus ascending to heaven, they returned to Jerusalem. There the one hundred twenty did nothing but pray in one accord for ten days. Before you go out to the villages, you should pick up the burden to pray. Do not pray for so many things. The Lord Jesus said that the Father knows all the material needs (Matt. 6:8). You have to learn to pray in the spirit. Ephesians 6 says, &#8220;Praying at every time in spirit&#8221; (v. 18). The more you follow the Lord to pray in spirit, the more you will be delivered from the natural being into the spirit. In this way you will be in resurrection, and you will have the position and the qualification to work for the Lord. By then, all your move, work, and words will be in resurrection. You will be a most solid person and will have the highest discernment.<p>When you go to the villages, the first thing to learn is to pray. Pray yourself from the natural being into the spirit. In this way, you will be a weighty person. You will have God in your spirit, and you will be able to discern all things. This will keep you in harmony and in oneness and will become your strength and even your stand. When you contact others, there will be the impact. The point to watch in our work is that the worker himself must be delivered from the natural being to enter into resurrection so that he will become a weighty person. In this way, it will not be difficult for you to get along with others. If you stand on the proper ground in your work, and if you have the proper means and live in the proper sphere in your service, you will be one who serves the Lord in resurrection.<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on October 29, 1988.)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>FEEDING THE LORD&#8217;S LAMBS AND SHEPHERDING THE LORD&#8217;S SHEEP</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: John 21:15-17</h1><p>This message begins with a continuation of the last two messages. We will continue to consider the matter of the exercise and use of our spirit.<h2 class=head1>CONTACTING PEOPLE WITH THE SPIRIT TO QUICKEN THEIR SPIRIT</h2><p>Our spirit is the organ for us to contact God. For this reason we need to use our spirit to touch, worship, and enjoy God. Seemingly the spirit has nothing to do with our outward walk. But whether we are proper or not in our walk has much to do with our spirit. Even the Chinese Confucianists say that &#8220;the way of the Great Learning lies in the development of the bright virtue.&#8221; This bright virtue is part of the spirit. If a man is not strong in his spirit, it will be easy for him to be loose and unrestricted. But if his spirit is strong, the whole person will be restricted, and it will be easy for him to be strict. For example, when a person is angry, others would advise him to be more sensible and less emotional. The reason that there is the need for such advice is that the person is no longer restricted and has lost his sense. In Chinese, sensibleness is a term that is difficult to explain. It means both reasonableness as well as wisdom. Reason is of the mind, and wisdom is of the spirit. Hence, to be sensible has something to do with man&#8217;s mind as well as his spirit.<p>When we go out for the gospel spread and while we are talking or conversing with others, it will be very easy for us to get into trouble unless we are in the spirit. We easily lose our bearings and are either too much or not enough. But if we live in the spirit, we will be sober and weighty, and we will be proper in our speaking. Do not think that our ordinary walk in our daily life, seemingly being a matter totally unrelated to the worship of God, has nothing to do with the spirit. We have to know that the spirit is the central part of our whole being. If this central part is not functioning properly, the outward person will consequently be affected. Take for example the matter of eating. Both in the East as well as in the West, there are proper table manners to be observed. If we are persons living in the spirit, there will not be the need for outward restrictions. Spontaneously, we will act properly and politely. Although we may not be very expressive, we will nevertheless behave weightily.<p>We are not here for a mental education or a physical education. We are here for a spiritual education. This is absolutely a matter in the spirit. When we contact people and talk with them, there will be no way for us to touch others&#8217; spirits unless we use our spirit. It is a very interesting phenomenon that when I come to you smiling, it spontaneously stirs up your smiling capacity; you will smile along with me. If I come to you crying, it will easily stir up your crying capacity, and you will feel sorrowful along with me. In the same way, only when we exercise our spirit will others&#8217; spirits be quickened.<p>When we go out to preach the gospel by knocking on doors, there are two ways to preach with The Mystery of Human Life. The first is to speak from the spirit. Perhaps the first two sentences will not touch others&#8217; spirits. But if you continue in the spirit, you will touch others&#8217; spirits, and their spirits will be quickened. The other way is to speak from the mind. When you exercise the mind, others will exercise their minds also. In the end there will be a debate. Man has been exercising his mind long enough. What you have to do is to bring him out of his mind so that he will use his spirit and will fear God&#8217;s word. You should not try to subdue him by many arguments. This requires that you continue to practice speaking with the spirit so that others would feel that your speaking is not common in spite of your age. Your speaking will not be something out of your mind but will be something out of your depth. When you exercise your spirit this way, you will touch others&#8217; spirits.<p>Recently I fellowshipped about four points in the messages concerning living and serving in the new way. The first is that we need a revival every morning to live an overcoming life every day. The second is to contact people and to have home meetings with them. The third is to have small group meetings. The fourth is to prophesy in the district meetings. Today you are being trained in these things. You have to be revived and ascended in your daily living. You have to contact people and meet with them in the homes. You have to have small group meetings in the spirit. You also have to prophesy in the church meetings.<h2 class=head1>FEEDING AND SHEPHERDING THE LORD&#8217;S SHEEP</h2><p>In John 21 the Lord asked Simon Peter three times if he loved Him. When Peter answered that he did, the Lord charged him, &#8220;Feed My lambs....Shepherd My sheep....Feed My sheep&#8221; (John 21:15-17). Many people confuse these three charges of the Lord. The first time the Lord said to feed. The lambs here refer to the young, newborn sheep. They do not need the shepherding yet. They need only the feeding, which is to put the grass by their mouth. When the lambs are grown up, they can be in the flock, and there is the need of shepherding. Hence, in 1 Peter 5:2 Peter said, &#8220;Shepherd the flock of God.&#8221; The third time the Lord mentioned feeding again. This shows us that the sheep in the flock have not graduated from feeding; they still need the feeding and the supply of the grass. Our home meetings and small group meetings are related to the feeding and the shepherding of the Lord&#8217;s sheep.<p>It is not too difficult for you to be revived every morning and to be overcoming every day. As long as you have the heart and are willing to sacrifice a little of your time, you can make it. But the other three things-the home meetings, the group meetings, and the preparation for prophesying-are not that easy. They require much practice.<h2 class=head1>FEEDING PEOPLE IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2><p>It is quite inappropriate in the home meetings for us to try to help the newly baptized ones to live a revived and overcoming life immediately after salvation. This is like teaching kindergarten children with university material. The new ones are newborn babes and know nothing about revival and overcoming. Therefore, we have to exercise our spirit to speak something suitable to them. There is much to learn here. If we are not proper in our speaking, we will cause problems. Hence, we have to pay close attention to this matter.<p>Both the home meetings and the group meetings have their difficulties. But one principle is the same: it is impossible to set down rigid rules. However, you cannot come without any preparation. It is like a cable car. There may be no track, but the cable car cannot go where it pleases; above it there is still the cable to which it is joined. You cannot speak whatever you want to a newly baptized one. This will only stir up his curiosity, and it will not help him much in his Christian life.<p>Basically, what a newborn baby needs the most is feeding. From experience we know that after a person is baptized, he may, experientially speaking, be only half saved. We need to help him to be fully saved. For example, after we preach to a person with the booklet The Mystery of Human Life and the person has prayed and received the Lord, we may perceive that he is ready for baptism. Subsequently we baptize him. But it is possible that the person has not touched the Lord within yet. This is like having the lamps, the electric wires, and the bulbs all installed; but the electricity is not yet connected. For this reason, the key point in our bringing people to salvation is to help them to make the &#8220;connection&#8221; with the Lord. They have to be quickened by the Lord within. Some of us have had this kind of experience. A person has heard the gospel. He is baptized and can pray. He comes to the meetings and even reads the Bible, yet you still feel that such a one might not have been quickened yet. He does not yet seem to have touched the Spirit of God. Hence, outwardly speaking, his salvation is clear; but inwardly speaking, his salvation is vague. The reason for this is that he is not yet clearly enlivened within. I speak all these things from my experience. When I was in Shanghai, I knew a brother. During the years that I was acquainted with him, I never touched his spirit. One time I asked Brother Nee why this was so. He answered jokingly, &#8220;This person might have been saved without being regenerated!&#8221; As far as the truth is concerned, he who believes and is baptized is saved (Mark 16:16); but for all the time that I was with him, I never touched his spirit. This is why Brother Nee joked that he &#8220;might have been saved without being regenerated.&#8221;<p>Since 1943 when I saw the light concerning the tree of life, my messages and writings have never departed from the matters of life and spirit. Hymns #11, a hymn written by me, mentions the word &#8220;spirit&#8221; nineteen times. Many preachers in Christianity give many messages, but none of them mentions the spirit. However, we have to know that the spirit of a man must come in contact with God the Spirit before he can be genuinely saved. If he has never touched Him, there is a problem. We must have a touch with God the Spirit. This is the basic element in our going to the home meetings.<p>Every time we meet with the newly baptized brothers and sisters, we have to touch their spirits. We should render them help according to this point. The Life Lessons can be used as a means, but they cannot be applied in a rigid way. We have to consider carefully if a point or a passage will touch others&#8217; spirits or not. If others&#8217; spirits are touched, we have to give them some further enlightening and revelation. After a person is saved, we have to have long conversations with him. During the conversation you have to tell him, &#8220;We have a spirit within us. The Lord has died on the cross for us to be our Savior. He has resurrected from the dead to become a life-giving Spirit to live in our spirit. These two spirits are now mingled to become one spirit.&#8221; You must explain to him this crucial point. At the beginning he may be listening with his mind. But after you talk for a while, he will be led to touch his spirit. This kind of fellowship must also be based on your experience. If you have no experience of touching the Spirit, you will not be able to do this. But if you have this experience, he will understand immediately after you explain to him. Based on this principle, when we go to the home meetings, we have to touch others&#8217; spirits. We must open them up and enliven their spirits.<p>Following this, we must open them up further by telling them that we need to call on the Lord and to pray. To pray is not just to beg the Lord to do something for us. Prayer is a kind of calling on the Lord Jesus. This kind of calling is not just from our mouth but from the depth of our being, our spirit. Our spirit is the source of our calling on the Lord. We have to call from our spirit, &#8220;O Lord Jesus!&#8221; In this way, we will have a certain sensation; we will feel different within. In this calling we t<p>ouch our spirit, and we exercise our spirit.<p>After a few days, you should go see them again to ask if they have called on the Lord and if they have had any feeling after calling on Him. Then you should go on to touch their living. Take for example the playing of mah-jong. You can ask if they liked mah-jong playing before they were saved. What is their experience now after they are saved? If they say that the interest seems to have waned, you should ask them why this is so. If they say that they do not know, you should tell them that when they call on the Lord all the time, the Lord gives them the proper feeling that takes away their love for the game of mah-jong. This is not all. The more they call on the Lord, the more the Lord will touch them about the game. They will feel sinful and filthy when they touch the game again. We have to help others according to this principle. This is what we mean by feeding. When we go to the home meetings, the only way to render a proper feeding to the new ones is to do it on the basis of the experience of life which we have after salvation, corresponding to the word of the truth in the Bible.<p>Next January we will begin the work of gospelizing Taiwan. We believe that preaching the gospel by visiting people in their homes will surely succeed. But when we baptize people, we have to be careful that we do it neither too fast nor too slow. Nevertheless, we have to be fast in setting up home meetings with them after baptism, the sooner and the more frequent the better. It would be the best if we could do it once today, once tomorrow, and once the third day. If we feed them continually this way, they will surely grow in life.<h2 class=head1>SHEPHERDING PEOPLE IN THE SMALL GROUP MEETINGS</h2><p>The small group meetings are for the shepherding of the Lord&#8217;s sheep. Hence, in the small group meetings, not only must there be the feeding, there must also be the shepherding. First you have to gather three or four families together. You will not be speaking to one person but to a group of brothers and sisters. This is no longer just feeding, but shepherding, leading, and teaching as well. All these are based upon our experience of life.<p>In the small group meetings, not only can you help others to call on the name of the Lord; you can also help them to pray. You can lead them to confess their sins according to the inner sense. This is not just a kind of feeding but a kind of shepherding as well. Perhaps while a brother prays, the Lord will enlighten him, showing him that his attitude toward his wife is poor. At that time you have to help him to confess his sin to the Lord immediately. Following that, you have to help him further to find a chance to apologize to his wife. He may feel awkward doing that. There is then the need of shepherding. You have to help him with some words. You can say, &#8220;By ourselves, it is surely rather awkward to apologize. But we are all saved now and are all brothers and sisters in the Lord. We are also the Lord&#8217;s sheep. We are different from those in the world. For them, they would put anything aside that would make them feel awkward. But for us the saved ones, even if we feel awkward, we still have to apologize. We should not care too much for our face.&#8221; In this way, you will be shepherding him and will be helping him to grow in life.<p>Hence, the shepherding in the small group meetings does not necessarily follow the sequence of the Life Lessons or the Truth Lessons. Rather, it is according to our experience after salvation in how we meet the Lord and how in everything we are led by the Lord. These are the materials we use for our small group meetings. When we have the experience of life, and when we match with this the expression in truth, we have our own kind of &#8220;Truth Lesson&#8221; for the shepherding in the small group meetings.<p>However, neither the feeding nor the shepherding is an easy matter. It is like learning to play the violin; there is the need for a long time of practice before one becomes skillful. Therefore, every day we have to learn the proper way to take care of the home meetings and the group meetings, and we have to study with all the brothers and sisters how to touch others&#8217; spirits when contacting people and how to help others use their spirits to touch God. All these will be useful not only when we go out for the gospel spread, but they will be a tremendous help to us throughout our lifetime of service. I hope that we can all learn together.<h2 class=head1>PROPHESYING IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS</h2><p>In addition to these matters, we have to practice prophesying in the district meetings. Some saints in some districts have the practice of laboring on the Lord&#8217;s word during the week to prepare a three-minute script for their prophesying on the Lord&#8217;s Day. This is not a bad practice. We have to know that we are not God. God works by creation; He calls things into being from nothing. With Him there is no need for improvement. But man learns. There is therefore the need for improvement and progress. For example, in order for us to graduate from the university, we have to pass through at least sixteen years of learning from elementary school through junior high school, high school, and then the university. For the same reason, in speaking the Lord&#8217;s word, there is the need for learning and practice.<p>As early as 1937, Brother Nee saw that the Lord&#8217;s Day morning meeting where one speaks and the rest listen is a practice according to the customs of the nations. He hoped very much to do away with this Lord&#8217;s Day morning message meeting. But at that time, he could not think of anything to replace it. He suggested that the brothers and sisters use the Lord&#8217;s Day morning for preaching the gospel. In the evening everybody could gather together for the Lord&#8217;s table. However, everyone was already accustomed to listening to messages. If they were asked to preach the gospel, they had neither the burden nor the interest to do it. For that reason, this practice was not carried out then. Ten years later in 1948, while Brother Nee was conducting a training on Kuling Mountain, he mentioned this matter again, as printed in the book Church Affairs. However, there was still no way to carry it out.<p>Now we are setting aside all difficulties to carry out the new way. I feel that sooner or later we have to do this. If we do not pay the price in this generation, we will have to pay the price in the next. But I am very cautious like one walking on thin ice. I have not hastily asked the church in Taipei to close the doors of its halls. Rather, I waited thirty-seven months from October 1984 to October 1987 before we closed down the Lord&#8217;s Day morning big meetings. We did this after the festival last November. We did it after we had some assurance that there was a practice that could replace the big meetings. After this I now have a heavier burden. What will happen if the replacement does not turn out well? Over the last ten or so months, while we went through a process of temporary replacements, I discovered that we have to strengthen the prophesying. Without prophesying, the meetings will be empty. Emptiness will mean failure, and the new way will not be successful anymore.<p>First Corinthians 14:26 was first pointed out by Brother Nee. At that time he was very strong in pointing out that the meetings with one speaking and the rest listening should be annulled. There ought to be the meetings of mutuality where everyone speaks to one another and listens to one another. However, this matter is easy to say. Many have attempted to do this throughout the ages, but none have succeeded. I do not know how many times I have read 1 Corinthians 14. Gradually the light came. Verse 1 says, &#8220;Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but rather that you may prophesy.&#8221; To desire is not just an aspiration of the heart but a pursuit in action. This is like desiring to have a doctoral degree. If you have only the aspiration without the action, you will not attain to your goal even if you aspire for a few decades. If you desire to have a doctoral degree, you have to study hard. Studying is a kind of exercise that enables us to pass the examination. Hence, to desire is a motive. It makes us willing to pay the price to study. It is the same with prophesying. Formerly we thought that prophesying, like tongue-speaking, was a kind of gift that falls from heaven. But from our experience we see that prophesying can be learned through practice. Through practice we can supply Christ to others when we open our mouth to speak for the Lord and to speak Him forth.<p>When we prophesy, we have to exercise our spirit. Only then can we enliven others&#8217; spirits. We must also pay attention to the pitch in our speaking. Those who are too high in pitch should lower it a little. Those who are too fast should slow down a little. And those who are too soft should raise their voice a little. Others have to hear you clearly. Do not love your throat and your face too much. Otherwise, others will not be able to hear you clearly. It would not be a bad idea for a few of you to come together and to take turns speaking while the others criticize. Practice having a proper pitch, tone, and speed in your speaking. At the same time, practice speaking from your spirit every time you open your mouth.<p>Concerning the content for prophesying, all the meeting halls in Taipei are having the proper response. For example, for every week Hall One has compiled six portions of the text from the Gospel of John, together with the footnotes and the Life-study Messages for its spiritual pursuit. For six days, the brothers and sisters study these portions. On Saturday, they condense these materials into a three-minute script for prophesying. Then in the Lord&#8217;s Day meeting, everyone exercises to prophesy a portion. This kind of exercise may not be an instant success at the beginning. But after two months, by the time all of you go out to the villages, your prophesying will be greatly improved.<h2 class=head1>FOUR IMPORTANT THINGS</h2><p>When you go out for the gospel spread, you must be able to do these four things. The first is to preach the gospel by knocking on doors. This will surely save people and bring them in. After a person is saved, the second thing is to have home meetings with him. The third thing is to have small group meetings. When the number grows to over thirty, there is the possibility of having church meetings. In such meetings, we have to exercise to prophesy together. If there is the gospel preaching by door knocking, the home meetings, the group meetings, and the practice of prophesying, the gospel spread will surely be successful, and the church life will be raised up in different localities. After this, the older and more mature co-workers can go to these places every month and can gather together the four or five churches around the area for a conference. They can do this once a month. In twelve months, there will be twelve conferences. I believe that a church produced through this kind of nourishing will surely be fresh, living, and quick in growth. The key lies in how well you practice these four things when you go out for the spread of the gospel. For this reason, in these days you have to be more aggressive and strict in your exercise.<p>(The above message was given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on November 3, 1988.)</body></html>
