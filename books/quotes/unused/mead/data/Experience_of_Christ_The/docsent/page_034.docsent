   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LAW AND CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to know what the excellency of the knowledge of Christ is, we need to see that the main comparison in chapter three is between the law and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 5 says, "According to the law, a Pharisee" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>. Verse 6 says, "According to zeal, persecuting the church; according to the righteousness which is in the law, blameless" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>. In these two verses "according to" is used three times: according to the law, according to zeal, and according to righteousness in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verses 7 and 8 Paul uses the words "on account of" three times: on account of Christ, on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ, and on account of whom, referring to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 5 Paul says "according to the law," but in verse 7 he says "on account of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here we see the contrast between the law and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A second comparison is that between zeal for the law and the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The third comparison is that between the righteousness of the law and the righteousness which is of God by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The focal point of these comparisons, however, is the comparison between the law and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The knowledge in verse 8 is not the knowledge of the law, but the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This knowledge has its excellency because Christ is excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do you still believe that the law is excellent?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you say no, I would ask you to compare the law of the Old Testament with the law of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By this comparison the law of the Old Testament is excellent, for it excels Roman law.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But if you compare the Old Testament law with Christ, it does not have any excellence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE EXCELLENCY OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the fullness of the Godhead is embodied in Christ and dwells in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What could be more excellent than the fullness of the Godhead and Christ as the mystery of God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>According to the New Testament, no one can know Christ adequately because He is so excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Matthew 11:27 the Lord Jesus said, "No one knows the Son except the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, it is impossible for us to know Christ fully; He surpasses all things and far transcends our comprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One day, however, the Lord brought His disciples to Caesarea Philippi and asked them to tell Him who people were saying that He was.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They said, "Some, John the Baptist; and others, Elijah; and still others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets" Matt 16:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All these were nonsensical answers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then the Lord asked His disciples, "But you, who do you say that I am?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Matt 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suddenly Peter responded, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" Matt 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is no comparison between the Son of the living God and Elijah or any of the other prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After Peter made his declaration regarding Christ, the Lord Jesus said to him, "You are blessed, Simon Bar-jona, because flesh and blood did not reveal this to you, but My Father Who is in the heavens" Matt 16:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus seemed to be saying, "Simon, you are a son of Jonah, the son of a man of flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, you have received a heavenly revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This did not come from flesh and blood, but from My Father in the heavens who has revealed it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I am not simply a Nazarene, the son of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I am the Son of the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>With Jesus the Nazarene there was no excellency, but with the Son of the living God there is excellency.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>None can compare with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although Peter received the revelation in Matthew 16, in Matthew 17 he acted foolishly on the Mount of Transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When Moses and Elijah appeared, Peter said, "Lord, it is good for us to be here; if You are willing, I will make three tabernacles here, one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah" Matt 17:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Peter's word offended the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, a voice from heaven said, "This is My beloved Son, in Whom I delight; hear Him!"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Matt 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This voice seemed to be saying, "Peter, don't suggest building three tabernacles, one for Moses, one for Elijah, and one for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Listen only to the Son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This voice was a shock to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>With the two other disciples, Peter fell on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But when they lifted up their eyes, "they saw no one except Jesus Himself alone" Matt 17:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jesus Christ, the embodiment of the fullness of God, is excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His excellence far surpasses that of Moses and Elijah.</S>
