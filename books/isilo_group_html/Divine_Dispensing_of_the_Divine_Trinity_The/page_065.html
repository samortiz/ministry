<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE DIVINE TRINITY ISSUING IN<br />
THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE BODY OF CHRIST<br />
INTO A FULL-GROWN MAN</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:1-32</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GRACE GIVEN ACCORDING TO THE MEASURE<br />
OF THE GIFT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Ephesians 4 is a long chapter containing many &ldquo;diamonds.&rdquo; The first of these diamonds is the grace revealed in this chapter. Verse 7 says, &ldquo;But to each one of us was given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ.&rdquo; Here grace is given according to the gift, but in Romans 12:6 the gifts differ according to grace. Grace is the divine life that both produces and supplies the gifts. In Romans 12 grace produces the gifts, and therefore the gifts are according to grace. But in Ephesians 4 grace supplies the gifts, and therefore grace is according to the measure of the gift. First the divine life produces the gift, and then it supplies the gift. Such a producing and supplying life is grace, which is given according to the measure of the gift.</p>
<p>The measure of the gift of Christ refers to the size of a particular member of His Body. This measure can be compared to the way blood is supplied to the members of our physical body according to their size. A shoulder, being a large member, receives a large volume of blood, whereas a finger, being a small member, receives a small amount of blood. The supply of blood is according to the size of the members of our body. In the Lord&rsquo;s Body, the Body of Christ, certain members are large. These members include the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. Paul, Peter, and John were large members of the Body, and much grace and divine life were supplied to them.</p>
<p>According to Ephesians 4:7, grace is something high and profound. Grace is actually the divine life dispensed into our being to supply us as gifts in the Lord&rsquo;s Body.</p>
<p>Grace is also mentioned in verse 29: &ldquo;Let no corrupt word proceed out of your mouth, but only that which is good for needful building up, that it may give grace to those who hear.&rdquo; Grace is Christ as our enjoyment and supply, and our word should convey this grace to others. The word that builds up others always ministers grace to those who hear. In verses 7 and 29 grace refers to Christ as the divine life dispensed into our being for our enjoyment and supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRUTH IN JESUS</h2>
<p>Another diamond in Ephesians 4 is truth: &ldquo;Since indeed you have heard Him and been taught in Him as the truth is in Jesus&rdquo; (v. 21). The truth in Jesus is the real situation of the life of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels. In the godless walk of the nations, the fallen people, there is vanity. But in the godly life of Jesus there is truth, reality. Jesus lived a life of doing everything in God, with God, and for God. God was in His life, and He was one with God. This is the truth in Jesus. We, the believers, regenerated with Christ as life and taught in Him, learn from Him as the truth is in Jesus. The truth in Jesus is God Himself. According to the Gospels, Jesus lived a life not merely of morality or ethics, but of God. His life expressed God. God is the reality of His life, and this reality is truth. Therefore, instead of saying &ldquo;as the truth is in Jesus,&rdquo; we may say &ldquo;as God is in Jesus.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Concerning truth, verse 24 says, &ldquo;And have put on the new man, which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.&rdquo; The definite article before truth in this verse is emphatic. As the deceit in verse 22 related to the old man is the personification of Satan, so the truth here related to the new man is God&rsquo;s personification. As mentioned in verse 21, this truth was exhibited in the life of Jesus. In the life of Jesus righteousness and holiness of truth were always manifested. In the righteousness and holiness of this truth, which is God realized and expressed, the new man was created.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Divine Dispensing of the Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 65</div><br></body></html>
