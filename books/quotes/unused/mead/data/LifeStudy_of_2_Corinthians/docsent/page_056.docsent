   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT AND THE BRIDE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first use of a divine title in the Bible is in Genesis 1:1: In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth lit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse speaks of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word God in Hebrew is Elohim.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But in the last chapter of the Bible, Revelation 22, we have another divine title.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Revelation 22:17 says, The Spirit and the bride say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here we do not have God, Elohim; we have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, the Spirit and the bride speak together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How can this be, since the Spirit is divine and the bride is not?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is not this kind of utterance in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no verse which says, In the beginning God and the angels created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On the contrary, Genesis 1:1 speaks only of God; it does not say God and....</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But Revelation 22:17 speaks concerning the Spirit and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to notice two important aspects of Revelation 22:17.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, as we have seen, the Spirit is mentioned with the bride; that is, the Spirit is mentioned with something additional.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second, this verse is not a demand; instead, it contains a promise related to the water of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When a young brother gets married, he is no longer single, no longer a bachelor, for he gains a wife as an addition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now instead of a single person, there is a couple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Before he is married, whatever a young brother says, he says by himself alone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But after he gets married, it is possible for him and his wife to speak as one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then it can be written concerning this couple, He and his wife say....</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A UNIVERSAL COUPLE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The principle is the same in the Bible regarding the Spirit and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The entire Bible tells us of a universal romance, the romance of a universal couple.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This couple consists of God as the Husband and His chosen people as the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, at the end of the Bible we have the revelation of this universal couple.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Lord Jesus came, John the Baptist spoke of Him as the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to John 1:29, John declared when he saw the Lord Jesus coming to him, Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to the third chapter of the Gospel of John, John the Baptist later spoke of the Lord Jesus as the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some of John s disciples were jealous because of the fact that so many were coming to the Lord Jesus and following Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They said to John, Rabbi, He Who was with you across the Jordan, of Whom you testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him John 3:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As part of his reply, John said, He who has the bride is the bridegroom; but the friend of the bridegroom, who stands and hears him, rejoices with joy because of the bridegroom s voice v. 29 . By this we see that the Lord Jesus is not only the Lamb of God, but He is also the Bridegroom who deserves to have the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The concept of a universal couple is found not only in the New Testament, but in the Old Testament as well.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even in the Old Testament we see that God desires to have a married life with His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, Isaiah 54:5 says, For thy Maker is thine husband: The Lord of hosts is his name.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God loves His people as a bridegroom loves his bride.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, God s desire is to marry His people, to have them as His addition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The provision of Eve to be a counterpart for Adam also illustrates that marriage involves a man gaining a wife to be his addition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to Genesis 2, Adam was created first.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to Genesis 2:18, the Lord God said, It is not good that the man should be alone; I will make him a help meet for him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God did not want Adam to remain single, that is, to remain a bachelor.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, He caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, took one of his ribs, and fashioned it into a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before the woman was made and presented to him, Adam could not find anything to match him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Genesis 2:20 says, Adam gave names to all cattle, and to the fowl of the air, and to every beast of the field; but for Adam there was not found a help meet for him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But when God brought the woman to him, Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh; she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of man v. 23 . Eve was Adam s increase, his addition.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This illustrates the principle that marriage means addition.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may also compare a husband and his wife to the two halves of a melon.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The husband is the first half of the melon, and his wife is the second half.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only when the two halves are put together is there a whole, complete melon.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Just as it was not good for Adam to be alone, single, so it is not good for God to be alone, to be a bachelor.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without His chosen people as His bride, God is single.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is only half of the universal couple.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I realize that this thought is frightening to the doctrinal or theological mind.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When they hear this, some may say, Are you teaching that God in Himself is not complete?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>How can you compare God to a bachelor or to one half of a melon?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is heresy!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No one should follow such a false teaching!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God is almighty, perfect, and complete.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As the great One, the King, the Ruler in the heavens, He is the object of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have been created by Him, and we must prostrate ourselves before Him in worship.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Of course, God in Himself is complete.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, many who use the truth of God s completeness to argue against the revelation in the Bible concerning the universal couple see only the outward appearance of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They know only the feathers and the skin.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we grasp the inward reality of the Word, we shall realize that God will never be satisfied with mere outward worship from His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We shall know that, deep in His heart, He wants a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>A friend may do many things for a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Nevertheless, deep within, that brother may not be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Rather, he may say, I m not happy with any of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I only care for a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What I want is not my friends to buy things for me or do things for me.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>My unique desire is to enjoy a loving wife.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we truly know the Bible, we shall realize that the Lord s unique desire is for a bride.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>For this reason, one day, according to Revelation 19, there will be a proclamation: The marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife has made herself ready Rev 19:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Ultimately, in Revelation 21 and 22, the Lord will have His bride for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He will then be satisfied, and the Spirit and the bride together will say, Come!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In China it was the custom for announcements or invitations to be signed only by the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, it is the custom in the West for both the husband and the wife to sign an invitation.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This western practice illustrates the revelation in the Bible concerning the Spirit and the bride.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In Revelation 22:17 we see that God is no longer single; He is coupled with His wife.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>For this reason, the Spirit and the bride say come.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This means that God has a wife.</S>
