   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Bible says that we should not provoke our children to anger Eph 6:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we are angry with our children, we often provoke them.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In dealing with our children, we have to take care of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to check, "Does our spirit agree with us, or are we acting according to our emotion?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should deny our emotion and turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then in our spirit, the Spirit will speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we are becoming angry with our children, the Spirit may say, "Go into your room and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Don't talk to your children at this time."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is a kind of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we pray, the speaking Spirit will continue to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He may lead us to read a portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then we are nourished, and we grow in the divine life with the spiritual nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we do not care for our spirit in our family life, we surely cannot have a pleasant household, and God cannot sanctify us for His sonship and His household.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to take care of our spirit in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a brother buys a necktie, he should not buy it according to his taste.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If he buys it according to his taste, this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even in buying a tie, he should take care of his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What would our spirit say to us when we go shopping?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we would listen to our spirit, the Holy Spirit will speak more in us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Today we are promoting the prophesying of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We want to see the saints speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some saints, however, have determined not to speak in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They come to the church meetings, but they sit at the back in silence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The leading ones who are taking care of the saints may be afraid to say anything to these ones about speaking, because they are afraid they will stop coming to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, they may come to the meetings for years without speaking anything for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They have been regenerated, and they love the Lord, love the recovery, and love the church, but they just would not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Be assured that if this is your case, you will not grow at all in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must take care of your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Get down on your knees in your bedroom to pray, and see what your spirit would say to you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Your spirit will tell you that you are stubborn and that you should go along with the church to speak for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you take care of your spirit, the divine Spirit will take the opportunity to speak many more things to you.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then you will come to the meeting by taking care of your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You may even confess to the saints, "Dear saints, I regret that I have not spoken for the Lord in the meetings."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The whole church will be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then as you continue to speak, the Holy Spirit will speak to you so that you have even more to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then you will see that the speed of your growth in life will fly like an airplane.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Within half a year, you will grow much in Christ and be much more sanctified unto much more sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>By your growth in life, you will become not just a son but an heir of God to inherit the riches of God Rom 8:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then you will be so useful in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You will become a supplier to supply, to minister, the bountiful supply of the Spirit to all the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Dear saints, this is my burden.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not think that Ephesians 1:4 and 5 transpired once for all.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sanctification for sonship is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Day by day, however, we do not live in our sonship, because we do not care for the sanctifying Spirit speaking and working in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must turn to our spirit, realizing that we have been sanctified and regenerated by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This sanctifying and regenerating Spirit has much to say to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He still wants to sanctify us more and more that we may participate in the sonship more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we will grow, and the Father will have a pleasant household.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we care for our spirit and let the Spirit speak to us, we will grow as sons to become heirs, grown-up persons, to inherit all the riches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then we can be a part of His pleasant household.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The blessings in Ephesians 1 start from God's choosing for us to be sanctified that we might be more and more in the sonship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This should be a daily matter.</S>
