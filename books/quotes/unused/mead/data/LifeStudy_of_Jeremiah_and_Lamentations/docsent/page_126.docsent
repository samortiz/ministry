   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Jehovah Being Their God,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and They Being His People</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Jeremiah 31:33b we see the second item of the new covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>"I will be their God, and they will be My people."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From the time we were saved, we have had the desire that God would be our God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For God to be our God implies a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that He will be known by us, understood by us, apprehended by us, and lived by us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It also means that we will be constituted with Him to be utterly one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>C. They No Longer Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Each Man His Neighbor</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>and Each Man His Brother,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>for All of Them Will Know Him</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"They will no longer teach, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for all of them will know Me, from the little one among them even to the great one among them, declares Jehovah" v. 34a . This word indicates that we will know God to such an extent that we will not need anyone to teach us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When I was a young Christian, I had a problem with this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I did not understand how we could do without teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually I began to see that this word about knowing God and not needing others to teach us is related to the spontaneous, automatic function of the divine life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As an illustration, let us suppose that a child is given two different things to taste, something bitter and something sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The child will automatically reject what is bitter and receive and enjoy what is sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This reaction is a matter not of teaching but of taste.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By the sense of taste, which is an aspect of the function of human life, the child knows to reject what is bitter and to receive what is sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The proper teaching the child receives regarding the sense of taste will serve to develop, but not to replace, the life capacity within the child.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The principle is the same with knowing God through the function of the divine life, the eternal life, within us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Eternal life has a special function, and this function is to know God John 17:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To know God, the divine person, we need the divine life with its function.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eventually, there will be no need for outward teachings, for we will know God by the function of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>No religion on earth can replace the new covenant or even compare with it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Confucius and Socrates were good, but they could not put themselves into their followers as life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Only Jesus Christ as the embodiment of God can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Throughout the centuries He has put His life into millions of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As believers, we all have received His eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is indicated strongly in John 3:16.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By believing into Christ we have received eternal life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This divine life is the centrality and universality of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This life is nothing less than Christ Himself, and Christ is the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since we have God within us as life, we can know Him, apprehend Him, live Him, and be constituted with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Furthermore, by dispensing Himself into us as life, God is accomplishing His economy, that He may have a corporate expression of Himself for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today we know Christ as our life Col 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is the divine life, the eternal life, the uncreated life, the life that is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because we know the divine life, we can experience the divine dispensing God's dispensing Himself into us that we may become His increase, His enlargement, for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is God's intention, God's goal, God's purpose, God's economy with His dear dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Triune God has been processed and consummated in order to dispense Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now, through this dispensing, we have the capacity to know God and to be His people.</S>
