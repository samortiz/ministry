   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Of the seventeen psalms in Psalms Book 3, these five are outstanding, showing us that God is our unique portion and then showing us Christ, the saints, the house and the city, the local and universal church full of gates, full of fellowship, for God to move on to accomplish His eternal economy.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their enjoyment is in the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and exalted Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These four matters concerning Christ His incarnation, His crucifixion, His resurrection, and His exaltation are repeatedly unveiled in the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This Christ is for the accomplishment of God's economy that we may enjoy in full the Triune God as the processed and consummated One.</S>
