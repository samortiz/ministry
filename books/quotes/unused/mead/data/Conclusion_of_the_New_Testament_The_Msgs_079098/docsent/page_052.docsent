   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>By Him They Live and Walk</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The believers in Christ should live and walk by the Spirit Gal 5:16, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul does not charge us to walk according to doctrine, not even according to certain Bible verses.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This does not mean, however, that our walk should not be according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The point here is that Paul charges us to walk by the Spirit in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to know the Bible and obey it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Nevertheless, strictly speaking, we need to walk according to the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This requires our daily practice.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is a difference between living by the Spirit and walking by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To live means to have life and also to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A Christian, as a believer in Christ, has been born of God and has the Spirit of sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He has the life of the Spirit and exists by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To live by the Spirit is to have life and exist by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To walk means to move, act, speak, and do things by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All of our living and walking should be by the Spirit who is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Galatians 5:16 Paul says, "Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Christian walk is absolutely by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the context of chapter five, the Spirit in 5:16 must be the Holy Spirit, who dwells in our regenerated spirit and mingles with it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To walk by the Spirit is to have our walk regulated by the Holy Spirit within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The word "walk" in verse 16 means to move, act, and have our being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It includes everything we do and say.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, it covers our whole daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this verse Paul is charging us to have our daily life to live, walk, and have our being by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul even had the confidence to say that if we walk by the Spirit, we shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Galatians 5:25 Paul goes on to say, "If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To live by the Spirit is to have our life dependent upon the Spirit and regulated by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To walk by the Spirit is to have our practical living and acts in our daily life guided and ruled by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul's concept is that since our life is by the Spirit so our walk should also be by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Greek word rendered "we live" implies both to have life and to live.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Initially we have life, but continually we live.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we have life by the Spirit, we should continue to live by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A fuller rendering of the Greek here would be, "If we have life and live by the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul uses a similar expression in Romans 1:17 and Hebrews 10:38.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Hebrews 10:38 it is not a matter of having life but of continuing to live by the life we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In Romans 1:17 and Galatians 5:25 it is a matter of both having life initially and then living continually.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Galatians 5:16 and 25 Paul uses two different Greek words for walk, indicating thereby that in the New Testament there are two kinds of walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Greek word for walk in verse 16, peripateo, means to have our being, to deport ourselves, to order our manner of life, to walk about.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is used with respect to ordinary daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It denotes a common, habitual daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This understanding of walking by the Spirit is confirmed by verses 22 and 23, where Paul speaks of the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The various aspects of the fruit of the Spirit mentioned in these verses are not unusual things; they are aspects of our ordinary daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, the walk in verse 16 is our habitual and common daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Greek word for walk in verse 25, stoicheo, means to march in military rank by keeping step, that is, to walk orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is the verbal form of stoicheion, element; hence, it can be translated "to observe the elements," "to walk according to the elements."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is derived from a root which means to arrange in a line.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, the Greek word for walk here means to walk in line.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It also means to march in military rank.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Walking in this way, like soldiers marching in rank, requires that we keep in step.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As we compare these two kinds of walk, we see that the second is more regulated than the first.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the second walk we need to walk like an army and keep in step, whereas in the first kind of walk we are free to walk about.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, both kinds of walk, the common, ordinary walk and the walking in line or in rank, are by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every believer in Christ should have two kinds of walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The first walk is our daily walk; the second is the walk in the divine rules and steps.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As Christians, we are not those walking about without a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have been created by God and also re-created and regenerated by Him with a definite purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, we must have the second kind of walk, a walk to fulfill God's purpose and to reach the goal of our life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The indwelling Spirit leads us to have both kinds of walk.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the first kind of walk by the Spirit, we live, have our being, and walk about by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This walk is a support to the second walk, a walk with a direction toward a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As children of God, we are not those without purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our lives on earth have a definite purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We do not walk about aimlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God has an eternal purpose, and His intention is that His people should live for His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Both God's creation of us and His regeneration are for the carrying out of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because God is purposeful and seeks to reach His goal, He charges us to have two kinds of walk by the Spirit: the walk which builds up a proper daily living and the walk in line with the divine rules and principles to reach the goal established by God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the first kind of walk by the Spirit we take the Spirit as the essence of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then whatever we are, whatever we do, and whatever we have will be by the Spirit as our essence.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This means that our essence will be the Triune God processed to become our constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we take the Spirit as our essence, every aspect of our daily life will be by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The first kind of walk by the Spirit is for the second that of taking the Spirit as the path for our way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We all must walk along a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The path of this way should be the Spirit Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For the first kind of walk, the Spirit is our essence; for the second kind, the Spirit is our way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Spirit Himself is the way, the rule, the line, the principle, leading toward God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Spirit Himself should be our rule.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we would have the second walk by the Spirit, we must take the Spirit as our rule, our way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we have the first kind of walk, that of taking the Spirit as our essence, we shall be able to have the second kind of walk toward God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we are one with the all-inclusive Spirit, He will no doubt lead us to walk in Himself as our way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>As a result, the Spirit becomes the rule, the principle, leading to God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Spontaneously the Spirit becomes the lane, the regulation on the way to God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Thus, the all-inclusive Spirit becomes the path of our way.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we walk along this pathway, we shall surely reach God's goal, and His purpose will be accomplished.</S>
