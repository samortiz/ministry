<h2 class="head1">THE BASIS OF JUDGMENT&mdash;LOVING THE BROTHERS</h2><p>There is one basic condition for knowing men's problems or diagnosing their illnesses: We must understand that the purpose of our discernment and judgment is not for checking others out. A proper Christian should not desire to know about others. Only abnormal Christians would want to pry into others' business. Although we need to know the condition of the brothers, we are not motivated by curiosity. We should not be curious about their affairs. We are forced to do this. Other than for the purpose of serving and helping them, we should not want to know much about others. We are busy enough ourselves. We have no time to pry into the affairs of others. If a man always tries to know about others and pries into their business, he is a big problem in himself; he is the first one who needs healing. What we have learned on this mountain is for the purpose of ministering Christ to others. We are not here to criticize or to find fault. We try to know men for the purpose of serving and helping them. If I know that the Lord has put a certain brother into my hand, it is because He wants me to know him and help him. This is the reason I am doing what I am doing. Unless the Holy Spirit has arranged this contact, I do not want to know about anything concerning my brother. I hope that none of you will have a craving for knowing others' business. I do not wish for anyone to examine the affairs of others and to turn them into conversation pieces. We should not take up anyone's burden lightly. We must not have any intention in knowing men other than for the purpose of helping them.</p><p>Communication among God's children is based on love, not on knowledge. We should not communicate with our brothers and sisters according to knowledge. Instead, we should fellowship according to love. The basis of Christian fellowship is always love, never knowledge. The world seeks like-minded people in its fellowship. But our fellowship is based on our love for the brothers. We love one another. If our fellowship were based on our knowledge, it would be difficult for us to be Christians at all. God has not communicated with us according to His knowledge of us. If we communicate with the brothers and sisters according to our knowledge of them, the Lord will not entrust us with the knowledge of our brothers and sisters. The more we know about men, the harder it will be for us to be a Christian. If we try to know others according to knowledge, we will shake our head about everyone. We will shake our head about this brother and that brother. In the end, I am afraid that we would not be able to fellowship with anyone, and we would even shake our head about ourselves. Our communication and fellowship with the brothers can only be built on the foundation of brotherly love.</p><p>We know the brothers for the sake of rendering help and service to them. We try to know the condition of a person only as we work on them. Our love for the brothers must be separated from our knowledge of the brothers. God can only commit Himself to those servants who are able to separate love from knowledge and who can deal with people accordingly. Those who cannot separate these two things are not qualified to be a servant of God. I should speak a word of advance warning. If we mix these two matters together, we have to take responsibility for the mixture. There should even be a distinction between love and knowledge in the way we deal with our sons. A father must know what problems his son has, but no father will lose his love for his son just because he has gained knowledge of his troubles. The communication between the father and the son is based on love. Love is "foolish." The father's knowledge of his son cannot influence his love towards him. We cannot love our brothers less than we love our son. In fellowshipping with our brothers, we have to act as if we are completely ignorant of their mistakes. This is to fellowship by love. We love the brothers, and our fellowship with them can only be in love, not by knowledge. We should act as if we do not know anything about our brothers' problems. Our communication with the brothers and sisters must always be based on love.</p><p>Let us take another illustration from God's Word. The way the Lord Jesus dealt with Judas is a good example. Judas was a thief; he always stole money from the purse. He was a greedy man. If the Lord dealt with the twelve disciples according to knowledge, He surely would not have asked Judas to keep the money. The Lord was not ignorant of Judas's stealing, yet He still asked him to take charge of the money. He dealt with Judas just as He dealt with the other disciples. During the three years of His ministry, the Lord did not indicate in any way that He knew Judas was a thief. Even on the day of Judas's betrayal, He did not expose him. Up until the time when they last broke bread together, the disciples did not find anything unusual about Judas. The Lord's relationship with the twelve disciples before the cross was not a relationship of the Head with the church. While He was on earth, the Lord was managing the Father's possessions in the capacity of the Son (Heb. 3:6). The disciples were the Father's possessions; they were not the Father's sons. The Lord did not know them as sons but as possessions. This knowledge was outward. The disciples' relationship with the Lord was not one of the Body with the Head. They were not members of the church relating to the Head of the church. The Lord seemingly tolerated Judas because as the Son, the Lord managed and administered God's household according to outward rule. This is the reason He never exposed Judas's stealing. If we judged this according to our knowledge, we would call this a political, not a Christian, move. A man in the world becomes wise and experienced when he reaches fifty; he no longer does anything foolish. He becomes shrewd and cunning. He never falls prey to anything. But this is the way of the world. No Christian should become shrewd and cunning through the knowledge he has gained of other men. If we deal with the brothers and sisters according to knowledge, we can spare ourselves many crosses and headaches by relying on our shrewdness. Today our knowledge about the brothers and sisters is limited. After a few years, this knowledge will increase. Then we will know the brothers as soon as we talk with them, and it will be hard for us to love them. Yet this should not happen among us. If we deal with the brothers according to knowledge, we will become shrewd and cunning. This is not growth, but degradation.</p><p>We must keep ourselves in the love of God. The Lord gives us knowledge of the brothers for the purpose of ministry. Those in the world cannot love after they have been fooled by others. They become afraid. But Christians should not be this way. Among Christians, love is at the very top. Love reigns. We should never become clever by gaining knowledge of the brothers and sisters. If we know men merely to avoid being fooled by them, our knowledge will only make us clever men. If this is the meaning of being clever, then our Lord was the most foolish man. Judas's stealing was a chance to manifest the Lord's glory and greatness. Men's eyes usually are blinded when others steal from them. But the Lord's eyes were open when others stole from Him. The commandment that the Lord received from the Father was that Judas should keep the money. If the Lord had asked Peter to keep the money, the money might have been spent quickly. If He had asked Matthew to keep the money, there might not have been enough to pay the food bill. Others could have stolen more. Judas could have complained that the loss could have been greater had the money been entrusted to others. One tends to accuse others of doing the same thing that he is guilty of. If someone else had been entrusted with the money, the purse might have been more tightly controlled, but the mouths would not have been controlled. At a minimum Judas would have opened his mouth to criticize. The Lord asked Judas to keep the money. Although he stole some of it, he kept it secret. The most that occurred was that money was stolen. If others had been given charge of the money, more problems could have arisen.</p><p>May God give us a greater love for the brothers. We have to pray that God would make our love for the brothers greater than our knowledge of them. May our love for the brothers transcend everything. May our cleverness not affect our love for the brothers. May we know men for the purpose of helping them, not for the purpose of avoiding trouble on our part. We ask God to fill our hearts with love for the brothers. We should act as if we do not know anything about their problems. This is something that belongs to another world. The more we know the brothers, the narrower our pathway becomes. We should not be afraid of being taken advantage of or suffering loss. We should allow love to transcend everything, and brotherly love is the only way.</p>
