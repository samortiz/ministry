   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Distributors of the Good Land</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verses 16 through 29 we have the distributors of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The leaders of the two and a half tribes are not included in the list of distributors.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The two and a half tribes possessed something, but what they possessed was not part of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In principle, this may also be our situation in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may have our choice and gain something.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What we gain may seem to be according to God's promise, but actually it is merely something according to our own choice and cannot be reckoned as a part of God's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>a. Eleazar the Priest and Joshua the Son of Nun</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"These are the names of the men who shall divide the land to you for an inheritance: Eleazar the priest and Joshua the son of Nun" v. 17 . Eleazar and Joshua both typify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the one hand, Christ is our Priest; on the other hand, He is our Leader.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One Leader of Every Tribe</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 18 says, "You shall take one leader of every tribe, to divide the land for an inheritance."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verses 19 through 28 we have a list of these leaders: Caleb, of the tribe of Judah, being the first; Shemuel, of the tribe of Simeon; Elidad, of the tribe of Benjamin; Bukki, of the tribe of Dan; Hanniel, of the tribe of Manasseh; Kemuel, of the tribe of Ephraim; Elizaphan, of the tribe of Zebulun; Paltiel, of the tribe of Issachar; Ahihud, of the tribe of Asher; and Pedahel, of the tribe of Naphtali.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"These are the men whom Jehovah commanded to divide the inheritance for the sons of Israel in the land of Canaan" v. 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There should be some significance in the fact that this list does not include the names of the leaders of the two and a half tribes.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I believe that their names do not appear because these tribes made their own choice.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today, if we have our self-choice, our names may not be included on God's "list."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Concerning this, we should not care about man's opinion, appraisal, appreciation, criticism, and condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today is "man's day" 1 Cor 4:3 , the present age in which man judges.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us wait for the day of the Lord when He will judge 1 Cor 4:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only the Lord is qualified to give the final word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, let us learn not to have our self-choice, which keeps us outside the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should care for the Lord's choice, not for our choice, and let our names be on His list, not on our list.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Difference between the Leaders</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>in Chapter One and in Chapter Thirty-four</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Finally, we need to see that there is a difference between the leaders in Numbers 1 and in Numbers 34.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The leaders in chapter one were for the numbering; the leaders in chapter thirty-four were for the distribution of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Both the boundaries of the good land and the distributors of the good land are significant.</S>
