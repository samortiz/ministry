<h2 class="head2">K'anshan, Chekiang</h2><p>We received God's promise to have a conference for two days on February 3-4. We invited Brother Kao Guang-lan, Brother Hsu Ren-hai, and Brother Chen Jung-you of Wan-An-Chiao to come bear the responsibility for the messages. More than sixty brothers and sisters came to the meetings. We received God's blessing, and the result was good. We would like to subscribe to receive four copies of The Open Door. If possible, please start our subscription with the next issue. The names on the subscriptions should be: Nee Ren-goan, Wang Ai-yi, Chen Bao-chu, Ong Shan-fu. Please remember us in prayer. The address of our meeting hall is Chen Bao-chu House Annex, Ying-Hsia-Wei, Sin-Sha-Di, Kan-Shan, Chekiang. Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your little brothers in the Lord,<br />Nee Ren-goan, Wang Ai-yi<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Tai-Shun, Chekiang Province</h2><p>I recently received the second issue of The Open Door. Thank the Lord for His abundant grace. Please continue to send it in the future. All the brothers in Tai-Shun receive their mail in care of Foo-Cheng-Hsing, Foo-Ding. Please send it with their names on it. There are more than twenty churches in our county. The largest locality has between eighty and ninety people, and the smallest only two or three. The rest have around twenty or thirty. They are very cold spiritually. Thankfully, the workers from the region of Ping-Yang in our province sometimes come to care for and cultivate us.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Chang Meng-jiu<br />Third day of the Chinese New Year<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Java</h2><p>Yesterday I received a copy of the third issue of The Open Door. Thank God for His grace! I often remember the brothers and sisters in the Lord who are suffering from the war. May the Lord reveal the last three phrases of John 16:33 in our heart continually. May the Lord also come in glory to rapture those of us who are waiting for Him. May the Lord give us grace and strengthen us to glorify the Father during our sojourn here on earth. Please greet Brother Yu-zhi and Brother Stephen, whom I met in Shanghai. Please greet all the brothers and sisters. We are all members together of Christ, even though we have never met. Please greet senior Mrs. Nee. I keep the words that she spoke to me in the Shanghai Gospel Book Room in my heart. Where is Mr. Shan Kai-fen? (Please read the news in this issue to find out&mdash;Editor.) Praise and thank the Lord that even though we come together and separate often, we will meet before Him with rejoicing forever in that day, never to depart! Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Nee Teh-sien<br />February 15, 1938<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Wenchow, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Peace in the Lord to my dear Brother Tsi-yi:</p><p>The situation in Wenchow has quieted down recently. Some of the brothers and sisters have already moved from the countryside back to the city. The meetings in the city continue as usual. I moved back to the city from the countryside yesterday. My health still has not fully recovered. Please do not forget to pray for me. What is your present situation? Are the brothers and sisters safe and well? Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Pan Huo-ling<br />March 16<br />[Address omitted]</p>
