<h2 class="head1">II. REIGNING</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Disciples Going to Galilee<br />to Meet with Him on the Mountain</h2><p>Verse 16 says, &ldquo;But the eleven disciples went into Galilee, to the mountain where Jesus appointed them.&rdquo; The constitution of the kingdom was decreed on a mountain, the heavenly King&rsquo;s transfiguration transpired on a high mountain, and the prophecy concerning this age was also given on a mountain. Now, for God&rsquo;s economy of the New Testament, the disciples needed to go to the mountain again. Only on the high level of a mountain can we realize the New Testament economy.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Appearing to the Disciples<br />and Being Worshipped by Them</h2><p>Verse 17 continues, &ldquo;And when they saw Him, they worshipped Him, but some doubted.&rdquo; When the disciples saw the resurrected King, they did nothing but worship Him; yet some among them still doubted, or hesitated, wavered, in recognizing Him in His resurrection.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Declaring That All Authority<br />Has Been Given to Him<br />in Heaven and on Earth</h2><p>Verse 18 says, &ldquo;And Jesus came and spoke to them, saying, All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.&rdquo; In His divinity as the only begotten Son of God, the Lord had authority over all. However, in His humanity as the Son of Man to be the King of the heavenly kingdom, all authority in heaven and on earth was given to Him after His resurrection.</p><p>Matthew&rsquo;s account of the resurrection is very different from John&rsquo;s. According to John&rsquo;s record, after His resurrection the Lord met with His disciples in a room where the doors had been shut (John 20:19). The disciples were frightened, being afraid of the Jews. Because they needed to be strengthened by life, the Lord came to them as life, breathed upon them, and told them to receive the holy breath (John 20:22). How different is Matthew&rsquo;s account! According to Matthew, the Lord charged the disciples to go to a mountain in Galilee. Surely He met with them on that mountain during the day, not during the night. Furthermore, when He met with them on the mountain, He did not breathe upon them and tell them to receive the holy breath. Instead, He said, &ldquo;All authority has been given to Me in heaven and on earth.&rdquo; In Matthew it is not a matter of breath, but a matter of authority. John&rsquo;s concern was for life, and life requires breath. But Matthew&rsquo;s concern was for the kingdom, and the kingdom requires authority. The Gospel of John reveals that we need life to care for the little lambs and to feed the Lord&rsquo;s flock. But in Matthew 28 there is no word about feeding the lambs. In Matthew the Lord commands the disciples to disciple all the nations (v. 19) to make all the nations part of the kingdom. This requires authority. Therefore, in John resurrection is a matter of life, power, breath, and shepherding. However, in Matthew it is a matter of righteousness, authority, and discipling the nations.</p>
