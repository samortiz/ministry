   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Meeting of the Overseers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being the Source of Things</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the responsible brothers in each locality are gradually manifested, or when any locality already has responsible brothers, they should meet together.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every week the responsible brothers in a locality should meet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When that meeting is strong, they will be able to lead the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is a very important matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The meeting of the responsible brothers is the source of many things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many things can be initiated from that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When people come to that meeting, many problems will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After the brothers have taken care of many situations before God, the second half of the meeting is the time to receive the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then the saints will realize that these overseers' meetings are not light or unimportant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, we need to walk the way ahead of us properly before God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to maintain this meeting of the overseers before God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Take care of this meeting properly so that everyone can receive help one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Epistles to Timothy and Titus</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Read 1 and 2 Timothy and the Epistle to Titus again.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>See how God charged them to lead.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You should learn from these Epistles how to help the elders and cause them to realize that they should not replace the whole Body, but that they should put themselves in the Body and let the whole Body do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE APPOINTMENT OF THE RESPONSIBLE ONES</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>OF THE LOCAL CHURCH First Helping Them Learn to Bear Responsibility</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Certain brothers asked: If we appoint some brothers to be the responsible ones of a local church, there is still some question concerning whether or not they are fit to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But if we do not appoint them, the church is paralyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Answer: You can ask the few brothers whom you feel are promising and let them first learn to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You need to guide them to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Being Difficult to Change</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I think there is one aspect that we should pay attention to when we guide them to bear responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is spoken of in the Epistle to Timothy that some become deacons first and then elders.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, you need to speak to them in a careful way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Let them know that you are preparing to ask them to be deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not tell them immediately that you may be choosing them to be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First, see whether or not they can be deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this way you can see who particularly grows in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After a period of time, perhaps two or three months, you can place them in the office of the eldership or of a deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you first appoint them as elders and change afterwards, it will be very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To make a change with a deacon is still a relatively easy matter, but to make a change with an elder is not easy at all.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Considering the Spiritual Future</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, especially in selecting the elders, your eyes must be wide open.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Consider what their spiritual future will be.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This does not mean that we cannot make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are prone to make mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The issue is spiritual; therefore, you need to be very careful before God, and lead these brothers into this realm.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you see that an elder is unfit and replace him at any time, you cause wounds.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is awkward if you set up the authority and then overthrow it later.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, learn to pay attention before God to the spiritual condition of those brothers and their spiritual future.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Many people are good material.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do not damage them, but guide them properly and cause them to learn to bear responsibility year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After some time you can ask them to bear responsibility formally when you go into their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should not be in a hurry to say that we are setting up elders.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whether or not we have the assurance, we should tell them, "Come, and I will help you, the more promising brothers, learn how to take care of the affairs of the church.''</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Demonstrate to them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To some brothers we may say, "You can be a responsible brother,'' and to some others we may say, "You can be a deacon.''</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not first ask him to be an elder and later ask him to be a deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This would be difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a person is humble, it would not do much damage, but once human feeling comes in, it is a very difficult situation.</S>
