Partaken of by Us</h2><p>Hebrews 6:4 indicates that we are partakers of the Holy Spirit. Since we have received the Holy Spirit through faith (Gal. 3:14), we are partakers of Him. The Holy Spirit is what God in His gospel promised to give us (Gal. 3:14). God called us from the heavens to the heavenly things that we might become partakers of His Holy Spirit and share in His Holy Spirit. It is by His Holy Spirit that we can live a heavenly life on earth and partake of the divine holiness. As partakers of the Holy Spirit, we partake of God as our enjoyment.<p>The Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God, is also the reaching to us of the Triune God. Unless it is through the Spirit, the Father and the Son could not reach us. Now the Triune God—the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit—has reached us through the Spirit, and in the fellowship of the Spirit we partake of Him, so we enjoy the processed Triune God with all His riches.<h2 class=head2>50. Being the Fellowship of the Triune God to Us</h2><p>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, “The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.” The apostle’s blessing here is composed of attributes of the Triune God. The love of God is the source, the grace of the Lord is the flow, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the dispensing of the grace of the Lord with the love of God to transmit the Lord with God into our being for our full enjoyment of the Triune God.<p>The grace of Christ is the rich element of Christ, the love of God is the rich element of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the aggregate of the rich elements of Christ and of God transmitted into our being for our enjoyment. Through the Holy Spirit love, grace, and fellowship are transmitted into us for our enjoyment. Therefore, the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God is the fellowship of the Triune God to us that we may enjoy the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit simultaneously, which is to enjoy the Triune God in three aspects—love, grace, and fellowship.
