   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>JOY, POVERTY, AND THE RICHES OF LIBERALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 2 Paul links the abundance of their joy and the depth of their poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This seems to be a very unusual combination.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How could the Macedonians be in the depths of poverty and yet have abundance of joy?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nevertheless, the Macedonians had both poverty and joy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>With the Macedonians the abundance of their joy and the depth of their poverty abounded unto the riches of their liberality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Greek word rendered liberality is also used for singleness and simplicity see 1:12 and Rom 12:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Liberality is generosity in giving.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Though the Macedonians were very poor, they were generous.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They had the riches of liberality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to be generous, we need to be single and simple.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A complicated person cannot be generous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who are single and simple will have the riches of liberality.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When they hear about a need among the saints, they will immediately decide to give something.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, those who are complicated may consider the matter and then decide to give much less than they originally intended.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not singleness, simplicity, generosity, or liberality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all should be generous and liberal in our giving.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For this, we need to be single and simple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I was young I wondered why the Lord Jesus allowed Judas to be responsible for the purse.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He knew that Judas was a thief, but still let him be in charge of the money.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I thought that the Lord should have let John or Peter take care of the purse.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the Lord Jesus, being generous and liberal, not a lover of money, let Judas keep the purse.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord certainly was simple, single, generous, and liberal.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 8:3 and 4 Paul goes on to say, Because according to their power, I testify, and beyond their power, they gave of their own accord, with much entreaty beseeching of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although the Macedonians were poor and in affliction, they gave generously of their own accord, that is, voluntarily.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They did this through the grace of God, through the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit indwelling them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This Christ is the grace of God working within the believers and motivating them to overcome the hold of material possessions, in particular, to overcome mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Macedonians were in deep poverty, but the grace moving within them enabled them to overcome mammon and material possessions and to use them for the fulfillment of God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need grace to overcome the usurpation of material possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To give continually by grace is more difficult than to put all our possessions together and have everything in common.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1 Corinthians 16 Paul tells us to set aside a certain amount on the first day of every week.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This continual giving takes grace, for it is contrary to our fallen, human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we would give continually, not just once for all, we need divine grace to motivate us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To have a ministry that overcomes mammon and material possessions and uses them for God s purpose requires grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE APOSTLES GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 4 says, With much entreaty beseeching of us the grace and the fellowship of the ministry to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Greek word for grace, charis, means grace, gift, and favor.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here the meaning is favor Vincent .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Macedonian believers besought of the apostles the favor that they might participate, have fellowship, in the ministry to the needy saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead of the apostles asking the saints to have a share in this matter, the Macedonian believers begged the apostles for such a share.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They considered it a favor, a grace, that the apostles would allow them such a share.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Macedonians wanted to give a supply of material things to the Jewish believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, in themselves they were not able to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Both materially and spiritually they needed the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, they begged the apostles to let them share in this grace, to give them this grace that they might participate in such a spiritual ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although this ministry was related to material things, Paul made it a spiritual ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Actually, Paul was not a fund raiser.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He was one who took a ministry of material things and made it a spiritual matter full of life, the Spirit, and building up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to participate in a ministry of material things in a way that was full of life, the Macedonians needed the apostle s grace, the apostle s favor.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Without this, the ministry of the Macedonians to the needy saints would have been only a material one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It could not have been a spiritual ministry full of life for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>According to their feeling, the Macedonians regarded it as a grace to participate in the ministry to the needy saints.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>That participation was also a fellowship in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This was the reason they begged the apostle to give them the grace to participate in it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Under the ministry of the apostles, the giving of material supply became a spiritual matter full of life and edification.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is altogether different from today s fund raising, which is without life, without spirit, and without the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In order for our material giving to become a spiritual ministry of life and building, we need grace from God and also from the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Verse 5 says, And not according as we hoped, but they gave themselves first to the Lord, and to us through the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This verse indicates that the Lord wants the believers themselves much more than what they have.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Macedonians were given not only to the Lord, but also to the apostles to be one with the apostles in accomplishing their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This was through the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It was through the will of God, through the sovereign divine agent, that the believers gave themselves first to the Lord and to the apostles.</S>
