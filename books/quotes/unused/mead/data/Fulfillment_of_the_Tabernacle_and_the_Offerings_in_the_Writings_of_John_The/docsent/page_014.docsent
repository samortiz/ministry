   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE SIX SIGNS IN JOHN 1 Scripture Reading: John 1:1-5, 14, 16-18, 29, 36, 32-33, 41-42, 12-13, 51</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider the significance of the six signs in John 1.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These signs are the Word, the tabernacle, the Lamb, the Dove, the stone, and the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Word is eternal; that is, it is self-existing, without beginning Heb 7:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is contrary to the heretical teaching that says the Word, the Logos, was created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to the revelation in John's Gospel, the Word was not created.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, the Word became flesh John 1:14 , and the flesh is a created element.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 1:1 says that the Word was in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This reveals that the Word is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh, something created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By this we may say that John reconciles the schools of thought that say respectively that Christ was God and not man and that He was man and not God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the reason some teachers say that John's writings are conciliatory.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we pointed out in the foregoing message, we prefer to say that the writings of John are all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John reveals that, on the one hand, the Word is eternal, uncreated, but that, on the other hand, He became flesh, something created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Word is living, a divine Person, Christ the Son of the living God Rev 19:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The eternal Word is our Lord Jesus Christ, and the living Word is also He.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, Christ is the written Word, the holy writings, the Bible Heb 10:7; Luke 24:27, 44 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ is also the spoken Word, the rhema, the instant word to be spirit and life to man John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, Christ is the eternal Word, the living Word, the written Word, and the spoken Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a Word signifies the mysterious and invisible God defined and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Concerning this, John 1:18 says, "No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Also, according to Hebrews 1:3, Christ is the effulgence of God's glory and the express image of His substance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As the Word, Christ is the definition and expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, He could say, "He who has seen Me has seen the Father" John 14:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through the Word all things came into existence 1:3; Heb 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to John 1:4 and 5, in Him are the divine life God imparted and the divine light God shining .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE TABERNACLE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>John 1:14 says, "The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This incarnated Word is a tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This tabernacle signifies the Word becoming flesh as God's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here the word "expression" is the same in significance as the gold in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The tabernacle was built with boards of acacia wood overlaid with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Anyone who entered the tabernacle would see the shining gold, the gold that signifies God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Christ was on earth, there was a certain kind of shining with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That shining is the expression of God, which is typified by the gold of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Eventually, we also shall be overlaid with shining gold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the tabernacle, Christ, the incarnated Word, shared in humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For the Word to become flesh means that the Word took on human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Humanity is typified by the acacia wood of the tabernacle Exo 26:15, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The shining gold and the acacia wood signify respectively the divine nature of Christ and His human nature, His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the tabernacle, Christ is God's embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Colossians 2:9 says, "For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Not only was the Father embodied in Christ, but the fullness of the Godhead was embodied in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This means that the fullness of the Godhead was embodied in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit were embodied in the tabernacle, and this embodiment is God's dwelling among men.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The fullness of the Godhead was embodied in the tabernacle so that man can enter into God and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Originally, God was mysterious, invisible, and untouchable.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But now God has been embodied in a tabernacle that can be entered, one that we may call an enterable tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that God is enterable; we can enter into Him and enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Once we enter into God, we may say that we can walk around in Him to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may enjoy Him as our life supply, signified by the bread on the showbread table, and as our light, signified by the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In particular, we may enjoy Him as the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then we may abide at the incense altar not only to commune with Him, but also to intercede for His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our God today is different from the God of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In a sense, He is even somewhat different from the God experienced by many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The God we experience and enjoy in the Lord's recovery is the One revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hallelujah, our God is enterable, and we can enjoy Him!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>With the tabernacle we have grace God enjoyed and reality God realized .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>John 1:16 and 17 say, "For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For the law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Grace is the enjoyment of God for man, and reality is the realization of God for man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, grace is God enjoyed by man, and reality is God realized by man.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When we enter into the tabernacle, we may enjoy the bread, the light, and the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All this is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>What grace we enjoy at the showbread table and at the lampstand!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We especially enjoy grace at the ark, with the hidden manna and the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As we are enjoying God, we fully realize Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He becomes our life supply, our light, our hidden manna, our budding rod, and our law.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What a marvelous reality this is!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The tabernacle in John 1:14 is just a beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This tabernacle will consummate in the eternal tabernacle in the new heaven and the new earth Rev 21:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The entire Bible consummates in one item the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Revelation 21 says that the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The tabernacle we have today will have a consummation, and the consummate tabernacle will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
