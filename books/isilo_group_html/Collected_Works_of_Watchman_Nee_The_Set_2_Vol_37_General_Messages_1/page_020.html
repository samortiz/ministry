The man who minds the flesh is the natural man, the original man, the man who is according to his natural birth. This man is not subject to the law of God, neither can he be. Yet the Word of God tells us not only that the fleshly man sins but also that the fleshly man attempts to do good, because verse 8 says, "And those who are in the flesh cannot please God." This obviously indicates that the man of flesh attempts to please God. No matter how hard he may try, in the end he still cannot please God. Regardless of how man serves God through his flesh, the result is always the same&mdash;he cannot please God. His offering, like that of Cain, can never be accepted by God. Only one offering is acceptable to God: our cross and our death. This is like the fat&mdash;a sweet-smelling offering before God.</p><p>Therefore, our greatest service to God is not how much we can do for Him or how much we can accomplish for Him but how much we can die. But this is not acceptable to many self-righteous men. Man often measures everything by his own work, thinking that if he can have fruit, if he can help others repent and believe in the Lord, he can bring all these offerings to God. But we should know one thing: We cannot serve God according to our work. Man's greatest offering to God is to be on the altar, which is death. Was there ever an offering accepted by God which did not pass through the altar? Was there ever an offering that passed through the altar and still lived? All offerings to God must go through death.</p><p>Brothers and sisters, perhaps your emphasis is revival, the repentance of many, and many great works. We acknowledge these as being important, yet they are not the primary need; they are secondary needs. The first thing we should do is confess before God: "Lord, I know I am useless, I am weak, and I am unclean. I know I am full of the work of the flesh. Therefore, Lord, I only look to You. I want to please You; I am willing to lay myself on Your altar as a burnt offering."</p><p>As an offering, Cain brought success and fruit, instead of the knowledge of the cross. Cain was successful, and he bore fruit. Yet death is the only condition that enables God to accept man's offering, and Cain's offering lacked death. God's Word says that a man of flesh cannot please God. You may try, but it will be in vain. Cain could offer his offering, but it was not acceptable to God. The pursuit of God's pleasure to many is just an activity of the flesh; there is no mark of the cross or any sign of death in it. However, there are some brothers and sisters who truly know the cross. When you touch them, you discover that they are broken and bruised and have the wound of the cross; we can sense the presence of subjective experience and the result of blows upon them. God desires this kind of person; He desires this kind of mark in a man. Therefore, work, zeal, or the fruit of work is not acceptable to God. Everything must come from the Holy Spirit. God cannot accept the fruit of man's labor for Him; He only accepts the fruit from man's reliance upon Him. We can only prostrate ourselves before Him and say, "I am only a channel, Lord. I pray that You pass through me." If we do this, we will see blessing, and we will see God's acceptance.</p><p>Paul said, "For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh" (Phil. 3:3). At that time there were people who worshipped God in the confidence of the flesh. It is possible for man to worship God in the flesh, as Cain did; however, God cannot accept man's worship in the flesh. God can only accept man's worship in the spirit.</p><p>Our mistake is to infer God's acceptance of a thing by its merit or demerit. But God does not ask whether a thing is good or bad. He asks whether it comes from Him. The goal of many children of God is for Him, but their strength is from themselves. They have a heavenly purpose, but they employ earthly strength to achieve it. The purpose of Cain's offering was not improper, because he wanted to please God just as Abel did. The difference between Cain and Abel was in what they offered. It would be a gross error for us to presume that as long as our purpose is to serve God, to please Him, to do His work, and to bring about spiritual revival among His children, we can employ whatever means there are. We may not say it this way, but this is a fact. If we serve God with our own strength, it is the flesh. The flesh is man's own strength, the strength he has originally. If we serve God with this strength, it is the same as Cain's offering.</p><p>Do not think that Abel had a loftier goal than Cain. Both of them had the same goal, that is, to make an offering. Abel was accepted not because he had a loftier goal than Cain but because what he offered was better. Abel's offering signifies the fact that man has no place before God, that man can do nothing, that man must die and not live, that man should tremble before God, and that man should have no confidence before Him. Abel's offering seemed to say to God, "God, I know that whatever comes from me is not acceptable. I cannot serve You. I can only trust in Your life and Your Spirit. I can only depend on the law of the Spirit of life." Abel's offering was made under these circumstances, and this became a sweet-smelling offering to God.</p><p>Therefore, brothers, in serving God it is not how much you have done for God. Your work may not be for the service of God, and the service of God may not need your kind of work. In serving God, the most necessary thing is the cross. The crux of the matter is this: "We are...the ones who serve by the Spirit of God...and have no confidence in the flesh" (Phil. 3:3). These are Paul's words. You may have heard this many times, but, brothers, what is your standing today? Where do you stand? What kind of an offering are you making? I am not asking whether you have offered something up. I am asking what you have offered. An offering acceptable to God must go through death. Anything that has not gone through death cannot be counted as an offering. An offering that has not gone through death can never be acceptable to God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 37: General Messages (1) &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
