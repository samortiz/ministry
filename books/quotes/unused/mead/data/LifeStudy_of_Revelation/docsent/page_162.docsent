   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE FOURTH BEAST IN DANIEL 7</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The beast out of the sea in 13:1 is the last and crucial part of the fourth beast in Daniel Dan 7:7-8,19-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Both in Daniel and in Revelation the beast out of the sea refers not only to the Roman Empire but specifically to Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, eventually Antichrist is the beast out of the sea, the fourth beast in Daniel 7.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. Dreadful and Terrible</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This beast is dreadful and terrible Dan 7:7, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the past the Roman Empire did dreadful and terrible things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the future Antichrist will also do terrible things to damage people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Both are cruel and dreadful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>B. Strong Exceedingly</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Daniel 7:7 reveals that the beast is strong exceedingly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Roman Empire was the strongest heathen power in history, and Antichrist will also be extraordinarily strong, even strong in the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As the Roman Empire conquered all the neighboring powers, so Antichrist will subdue and conquer all the powers around the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>C. Having Great Iron Teeth and Brass Nails</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The beast also has great iron teeth and brass nails Dan 7:7, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The iron teeth are for eating or devouring, and the brass nails are for standing or treading.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>D. Devouring the Whole Earth</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>and Breaking It in Pieces</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This beast devours the whole earth and breaks it into pieces Dan 7:7, 19, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Along with all the other aspects of the description of the beast, this applies firstly to the ancient Roman Empire with its Caesars and then to the coming Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>E. Stamping the Residue with Its Feet</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fourth beast stamps the residue with its feet Dan 7:7, 19, 23 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whatever remains after the devouring and breaking will be stamped by the beast.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was true of the Roman Empire in the past, and it will also be true of Antichrist in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>F. Having Ten Horns</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The beast also has ten horns Dan 7:7, 20, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These ten horns correspond to the ten toes of the great image in chapter two.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the vision of the great image in Daniel 2, the ten kings represented by the ten toes are, in God s view, the lowest part of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, in the vision in Daniel chapter seven these ten kingdoms represented by the ten kings are exalted as the ten horns.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In chapter two these kings are the lowest, and in chapter seven they are the highest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Whether these kings are the lowest or the highest depends upon our viewpoint.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we view them from the perspective of heaven, they will be the lowest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, if we view them from a worldly perspective, these kingdoms will seem to be the highest.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, worldly politics and worldly kingdoms are, in the eyes of God, like wild beasts which do nothing except damage and devour people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But in the eyes of Nebuchadnezzar, that is, in human eyes, the worldly kingdoms seem to be a great and glorious image.</S>
