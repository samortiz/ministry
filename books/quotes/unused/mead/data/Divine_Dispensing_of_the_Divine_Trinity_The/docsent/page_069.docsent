   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MINISTERING GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Every member of the Body, whether small or large, has received something of the Triune God as supply, as grace ministered to that member.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Large members, such as Peter and Paul, could minister the riches of Christ into all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But even small members can receive grace and minister this grace to others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>For example, at home you may minister grace to your wife or husband through your speaking, and this grace will build them up.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the ministry of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not think that you are too small a member to minister grace to others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Every member of the Body is able to minister grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Ephesians 4:16 speaks of the operation in measure of each one part.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the measure of every part, the Body enjoys the supply by which it grows.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, there are the joints of supply, which are large members such as Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Such members are life-joints full of supply.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But even we who are small members have a measure, and according to the measure of every part, the Body is supplied to grow.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the life-dispensing of the Triune God for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Throughout the years, I have seen many brothers and sisters, who are small members of the Body, minister grace as life supply to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because they are under the dispensing of the Triune God, enjoying grace and realizing reality, spontaneously they speak to their fellow members.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This speaking conveys grace to the other members so that they may be nourished and grow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the members in the local churches may be life suppliers.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Whether we speak to others in a message or speak to them in our daily living, we may minister grace because we are under the life-dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Both in the meetings and in our daily life the principle is the same it is a matter of ministering grace through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</S>
