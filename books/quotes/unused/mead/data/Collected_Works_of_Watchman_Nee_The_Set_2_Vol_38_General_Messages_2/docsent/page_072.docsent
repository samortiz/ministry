   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIXTY-THREE THE LAW IN THE BODY OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Acts 8:4-8, 12, 14-17; 9:3-12, 15-17; 1 Tim 5:22; 4:14; 2 Tim 1:6; James 5:14-16; Matt 18:15-17, 20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to live the life of the Body of Christ, we must first have the revelation of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we do not have the revelation of the Body of Christ, we will never cease our individual activities.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some have said that there is nothing extraordinary about seeing the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yet, brothers and sisters, if you see the Body of Christ, you will know that there are laws in the Body of Christ and that you have to act according to these laws; these are not empty words.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a man sees Christ, he will not try to save himself by his own works.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Similarly, if a man says that he has seen the Body yet is independent and individualistic in his conduct, he is not holding the Head and has not received the revelation of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a man has genuinely received the revelation of the Body, there will surely be some change in him, and he will surely seek fellowship and learn obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>AUTHORITY IN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are a few cardinal laws in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Fellowship is one, and love is another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But another great law is submitting to the Head in conjunction with other members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A member by himself does not have any authority; the authority is with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is wrong for any member to say that he has authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A member does not have direct authority; he can only derive authority from the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This authority is not a matter of position but a matter of life; it does not come by "appointment" but by one's "being."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a member is not an eye, the Body cannot appoint him to be the eye.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If a member is not the hand, the Body cannot appoint him to be the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because a member sees, he has the authority of seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because a member can function, his function becomes a help to others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the church it is wrong to consider authority as a matter of position instead of life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is wrong to make an appointment based on a person's social status rather than on his spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's Word shows that authority is in life, not in position.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Authority lies in one's living, not in his appointment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A man has authority in the church not by his position but by being dealt with in his experience and in many concrete matters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He has learned something before the Lord which others have not learned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a result, the Lord gives him authority in life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Body of Christ, all authority is in life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God has made some appointments in a local church, but these are not according to position but according to life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When life and appointment are joined together, there is the need for submission.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If one does not submit, life will stop, and he will be detached from the Body; this is the meaning of "not holding the Head" Col 2:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If there is a problem between you and the members, your relationship with the Head will not be normal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you are at odds with other members, you may still have your doctrine and work, but the word of life will be gone from you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brothers and sisters, you may have been a believer for three years, but how much genuine growth have you gained?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a pity that while your manner and knowledge seem to have improved, the life of the Body of Christ has not increased.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the church you should learn to submit to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the members do not submit to one another, the life spoken of in Romans 8 can never be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You will feel like a deflated tire, and it will be difficult for you to advance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who see the Body of Christ will spontaneously see that submission is a joyful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The case in Acts 8 shows us the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At that time the church in Jerusalem suffered the first great persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The apostles did not leave Jerusalem, but the brothers were all scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The scattered ones went everywhere to preach the word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Philip was not an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His ministry was to care for the food.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet because he had life, he went down to Samaria to preach Christ and performed miracles; he cast out many unclean spirits and healed many paralyzed and lame ones.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The whole city of Samaria was filled with the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Bible says, "And there was much joy in that city" v. 8 . This shows that many in the city of Samaria had believed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord used Philip.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But if Philip had been proud, he could have said, "In Jerusalem Peter saved many.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Samaria I saved many."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He could have considered himself a marvelous man in history.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Philip preached the gospel in Samaria, but the experience of the ones saved in Samaria was different from the experience of the ones saved in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Samaria the Spirit did not descend upon anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Samaritans had genuinely believed, and they were baptized in the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Yet the Spirit did not descend upon anyone immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the apostles heard this, they sent Peter and John to Samaria.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the two arrived, they prayed for the Samaritans to receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After the apostles laid hands on them, they also received the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What is the meaning of the laying on of hands?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Leviticus tells us that when one offered a sacrifice, he had to lay his hands on the head of the sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What does laying hands on the head of the sacrifice mean?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Why is it that only the bulls that passed through the laying on of hands could be offered up, while myriads of other bulls in the world could not be offered up?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>To lay hands on a bull's head meant that a man was identified with the bull.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The bull became him, and when the bull was offered up, it meant that he was offered up.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the bull was accepted, it meant that he was accepted.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, the laying on of hands means identification.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The New Testament speaks of the laying on of hands many times.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>First Timothy 5:22 says, "Lay hands quickly on no man, nor participate in others' sins; keep yourself pure."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Since laying hands on someone is being identified with someone, we can become identified with others' sins if we are not careful.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The meaning of the laying on of hands is identification and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the Old Testament, when kings and priests were appointed, someone laid hands and poured oil on their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Hence, the meaning of the laying on of hands is bringing men under the anointing of the Head and into the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Today in the church the apostles are the representative members in the Body of Christ; they represent the authority of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>For the apostles to lay hands on the Samaritan believers meant that they acknowledged them as part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once they were in the Body, the Spirit descended upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If the Samaritan believers had received the Spirit before the apostles came, it might have caused Philip to think, "The apostles can work in Jerusalem, and I can work in Samaria."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Then the saved ones in Samaria would have been separated from the ones in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If someone had said that there was a Philip in Samaria just as there was a Peter in Jerusalem, the principle of the Body would have been destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Then there would have been two works, one in Jerusalem and the other in Samaria, and the two would not have been under one work.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The case in Samaria shows that one has to be subject to the Body before there can be the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The anointing did not come down until the apostles from Jerusalem came and laid their hands on the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of the Body; it is not the Spirit of individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It is fundamentally wrong for individuals to seek after the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Some people are deceived, and some have received evil spirits because of their individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Some do not see the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The vessel that the Lord is after today is a Body vessel, not individual vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Individual work and fruit can never satisfy the Lord's heart and never achieve God's ultimate goal.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>All of our work should be carried out in the principle of the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The laying on of hands is an acknowledgment of identification and fellowship; it is also an acknowledgment that there is only one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Hebrews 6:1-2 says, "Therefore leaving the word of the beginning of Christ, let us be brought on to maturity, not laying again a foundation of repentance from dead works and of faith in God, of the teaching of baptisms and of the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment."</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>These six things belong to the word of the beginning, and they can be divided into three categories.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The first category includes two kinds of conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The second category includes two outward testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The third category includes two doctrines concerning the future.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The two kinds of conduct are repentance from dead works and faith in God, the two outward testimonies are baptism and the laying on of hands, and the two doctrines concerning the future are resurrection and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We may not have neglected five of these things, but we have neglected one of them the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Although the Bible does not explicitly tell us to practice the laying on of hands, it shows us that at the time of the apostles those who were saved were baptized, and they also received the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Baptism puts us into Christ, while the laying on of hands puts us into the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The laying on of hands is a testimony not only of our relationship with Christ but also of our relationship with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>It brings us under the authority of the Head so that we will no longer be independent and so that we will reject all individualistic living and work.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Paul said, "And whether one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; or one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it" 1 Cor 12:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Once you have received the laying on of hands, you are no longer an individual; you become a member in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Once a man has received the laying on of hands, he should stand in his proper position.</S>
