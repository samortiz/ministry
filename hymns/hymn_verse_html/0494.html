The testimony of God signifies Christ, the embodiment of God (Col. 2:9), as the living portrait of what God is. See note 1<sup>1</sup> in Exo. 20.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

The church is the testimony and the expression of Christ. As such, the church is the reproduction of the testimony and the expression of God in Christ.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

The faces of the cherubim were toward each other and toward the cover, signifying that God's glory watches over and observes what Christ has done.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12258' href='#ref_12258'>Col 2:9</a></span> For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily,<br><b>fn 1 </b>Fullness refers not to the riches of God but to the expression of the riches of God. What dwells in Christ is not only the riches of the Godhead but the expression of the riches of what God is. See note 19<sup>3</sup> in Eph. 3.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12261' href='#ref_12261'>John 17:6</a></span> I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world. They were Yours, and You gave them to Me, and they have kept Your word.<br><b>fn 1 </b>Your name, here and in v. 26, means the very name Father. The name God and the name Jehovah were adequately revealed to man in the Old Testament, but the name Father was not, though it was mentioned briefly in Isa. 9:6; 63:16; 64:8. The Son came and worked in the Father's name (5:43; 10:25) to manifest the Father to the men whom the Father gave Him and to make the Father's name known to them (v. 26). That name reveals the Father as the source of life (5:26) for the propagation and multiplication of life. Many sons would be born of the Father (1:12-13) to express the Father. Hence, the Father's name is very much related to the divine life.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12262' href='#ref_12262'>John 7:39</a></span> But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified.<br><b>fn 1 </b>The Spirit of God was there from the beginning (Gen. 1:1-2), but at the time the Lord spoke this word, the Spirit as the Spirit of Christ (Rom. 8:9), the Spirit of Jesus Christ (Phil. 1:19), was not yet, because the Lord had not yet been glorified. Jesus was glorified when He was resurrected (Luke 24:26). After Jesus' resurrection, the Spirit of God became the Spirit of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected Jesus Christ, who was breathed into the disciples by Christ in the evening of the day on which He was resurrected (20:22). The Spirit is now the another Comforter, the Spirit of reality promised by Christ before His death (14:16-17). When the Spirit was the Spirit of God, He had only the divine element. After He became the Spirit of Jesus Christ through Christ's incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Spirit had both the divine element and the human element, with all the essence and reality of the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ. Hence, the Spirit is now the all-inclusive Spirit of Jesus Christ as the living water for us to receive (vv. 38-39).<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12263' href='#ref_12263'>John 20:22</a></span> And when He had said this, He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.<br><b>fn 1 par 3 </b>The Lord was the Word, and the Word is the eternal God (1:1). For the accomplishing of God's eternal purpose, He took two steps. First, He took the step of incarnation to become a man in the flesh (1:14), to be the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption for man (1:29), to declare God to man (1:18), and to manifest the Father to His believers (14:9-11). Second, He took the step of death and resurrection to be transfigured into the Spirit that He might impart Himself into His believers as their life and their everything, and that He might bring forth many sons of God, His many brothers, for the building of His Body, the church, the habitation of God, to express the Triune God for eternity. Hence, originally He was the eternal Word; then, through His incarnation He became flesh to accomplish God's redemption, and through His death and resurrection He became the Spirit to be everything and do everything for the completion of God's building.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>

All the fullness of God is in Christ (Col. 2:9; 1:19). When we are brought into Him and belong to Him, we partake of all the fullness of God. Of His fullness we have received all that is of God, even grace upon grace (John 1:16). This matter is covered in detail in the first eight chapters of this book (cf. 8:9).<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
