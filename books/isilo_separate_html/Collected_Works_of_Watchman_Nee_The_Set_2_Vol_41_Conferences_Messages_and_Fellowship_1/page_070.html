The first three are apostles, prophets, and teachers. These three are the primary gifts. Then six secondary gifts are listed. The first three gifts are included in Ephesians 4; they are special gifts. The remaining six gifts are miraculous gifts. Throughout church history, many of the miraculous gifts have occasionally ceased in their operation. However, the five gifts in Ephesians 4 have never ceased in their operation. Through these five gifts, the church has been built up. These five gifts are particular gifts, whereas the rest are ordinary gifts.</p><p>Now we must ask: Who has these five gifts? We all have to settle this question before the Lord. If we are one of these gifts, we have to ask: What is my personal ministry? We have to ask because our ministry is intimately related to others. If we are not clear about our ministry, we will kick others' feet as we go along, and we will step on others' toes as we turn around. The ministry which God has assigned to every one of His workers has its own sphere. We can only work within the sphere that the Lord has assigned for our work. Whatever the sphere of our ministry may be, we have to work within that sphere. Of course, there are times when there are exceptions, when we can work beyond our own sphere.</p><p>Each person's ministry is related to the ministries of others. Some relationships require that we take the lead, while other relationships require that we submit. Once we are clear about our own sphere, we should work within our own sphere. Otherwise, we will come into conflict with others. Those who do not have a ministry should be careful and patient. They should wait on God and not act rashly. Disputes among co-workers are usually disputes concerning the ministries, rather than disputes concerning the gifts. Suppose a man is a concrete worker yet insists on doing the work of a carpenter. He may covet another person's portion, but he still cannot do what others can do. All ministries are assigned by the Lord, and all gifts are distributed by the Spirit. There should be a harmonious coordination between the workers and the churches. On the one hand, the workers should not give the churches a hard time. On the other hand, the churches should not frustrate the workers' work. The goal of the churches should be the increase of the work. Hence, the responsible brothers in the local churches should not hinder the work of the ministry or the work of the workers.</p><h2 class="head2">Directing the Ministries</h2><p>The Bible separates the workers from the churches. The work of the workers is upon the apostles' shoulders, whereas the responsibilities of the churches are on the elders' shoulders. The apostles are for all the churches, while the elders are for one church. Peter was an apostle as well as an elder. He was an apostle to the churches, but at the same time, he was an elder in Jerusalem. On the one hand, he served in the local church as an elder. On the other hand, he worked among the churches as an apostle. Both the local ministries and the workers' ministries are ministries, which in the original language is diaconia, translated also as deacons. When a meeting is first raised up, there may not be suitable brothers who can act as responsible ones. Some among them may have to temporarily pick up various responsibilities. At a certain point when the number becomes bigger, men who are more suitable than the temporary ones may become manifest. The temporary ones should then step aside and yield their work to the brothers with more manifested gifts. A responsible brother of a church should not only be gifted, but should also have a good name, be filled with the Spirit, and be full of wisdom.</p><p>The New Testament shows us that different people have different ministries. Apollos had a ministry, and Silas had a ministry. Apollos, Silas, Timothy, Epaphroditus, Titus, Mark, and Luke all had their own ministries. Paul could direct some of them, but he could not direct others. In the matter of directing others, the directing one and the directed ones must mutually agree to such a relationship. We cannot act as the denominations, in which the power of the organization is above the ministers. Whatever the organization directs the ministers to do, they have to obey. But this is not God's way. God wants to see mutual submission among the gifted ones. True authority comes from a profound work of the cross. Those who are directing others must also be persons who can be directed by others. Paul was no exception. He sent for Timothy and Titus, but he also submitted to the brothers' sending. If a believer has a problem submitting to others, we must first ask if his fellowship with God has broken down. It matters little if we agree on certain ways. If we submit, we have to submit from our heart. God desires to see us submitting to one another.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_069.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_071.html">Next</a> </body></html>
