If someone slapped your right cheek, you would be angry when you went home. However, those who are joyful before the Lord are the ones who turn their left cheek to the enemy after being slapped on the right cheek. After a person has been slapped twice, he will be joyful, and he will be able to utter praise. The Lord's way is the way of absoluteness. Those who are not absolute cannot sing. I am not begging people to come to serve. I am showing you that you are a servant of God. God wants you to serve.</p><p>This conference is a co-workers' conference, but this does not mean that the responsibility is only on the co-workers. Today the responsibility is on the whole Body. When we read 1 Corinthians 12 and Romans 12, we see that service belongs to the whole Body; it is not a service of three or five special people. Therefore, we asked all the brothers and sisters to hand themselves over. The Lord wants absolute service. We hope that every brother and sister can get through in this matter. The Lord wants such an absolute service. It is not just the co-workers who need coordination in their work; rather, every brother and sister needs to be coordinated.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ONLY SERVICE THAT COUNTS<br />BEING THE BODY SERVICE</h2><p>I want to ask the brothers a few questions. What kind of service is considered real service? The only service that counts is the service in which the whole Body serves. Only the Body service can be counted as real service. Either you are not a Christian, or you are a serving Christian.</p><h2 class="head1">FULL COORDINATION<br />BRINGING IN THE BODY SERVICE</h2><p>In order to have the Body service, there is the need for coordination. What is coordination? It is not a loose arrangement. If my hands are connected to my body, they will be useful. But if they are locked up upstairs, they will not be useful.</p><p>Since you became a Christian, have you ever inquired of the Lord concerning your job, your house, and your business? Is your job suitable for the gospel? When a man moves to a new place, he considers whether the place is beneficial to him spiritually. But he never considers whether his job will enable him to give himself to the gospel. Today our co-workers cannot seek their own convenience in the work; they cannot freely choose their own field. The brothers and sisters who hold jobs should do the same thing in principle. We have to hand over our job, and we should learn to coordinate together. In other words, all the brothers and sisters are co-workers. Everyone should hand himself over for the gospel. If there is to be coordination, it has to be a coordination of all the brothers and sisters. Some of us have to change our dwelling or occupations, and all of us have to offer up our possessions. This is a great price. It may cause some to have heartaches. From the very beginning we have to realize that the Lord requires that we serve this way. Any service that involves a dragging of the feet is not joyful and definite service.</p><h2 class="head1">CONSECRATION BRINGING IN SINGLENESS IN SERVICE</h2><p>We have to tell the young brothers and sisters that whatever they do in the future, whether it involves being a teacher or a doctor, can only be done as a secondary occupation. Every one of us lives for the purpose of serving God. We tell people to offer up their possessions because we can never serve God without offering up our possessions. The Lord says that a man cannot serve two masters; he cannot serve God and mammon at the same time (Matt. 6:24). The colt must be loosed (21:2), and everything has to be offered up and released before a person can serve. Those who are not loosed cannot serve.</p><p>If anyone asks me how much he should offer, I would answer, "Everything.'' Brother Lee said that the church will lay aside the consecrated things for us. But what would we do if the church does not lay them aside? If we want to serve God, we have to serve Him in a desperate way.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_088.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_090.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 57: The Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry &nbsp; pg 89</div><br></body></html>
