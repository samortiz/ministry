[1]  The Conclusion of the New Testament #021-033 CONTENTS
[2]  OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE CHRIST HIS PERSON 1
[3]  In the foregoing messages we have considered the New Testament and God s New Testament economy and also God in His person, nature, attributes, good pleasure, manifestation, and work.
[4]  With this message we shall begin to cover Christ s person, and in later messages we shall cover Christ s attributes, virtues, and work.
[5]  When we say that God is dispensing Himself into us, we need to realize that this dispensing God in His economy is Christ.
[6]  On the one hand, the New Testament reveals that Christ is the Son; on the other hand, the New Testament reveals that Christ is God, even the complete God.
[7]  It is not, as supposed by some, that Christ was not God from eternity past and that at a certain time Christ became God.
[8]  Speaking of Christ, Colossians 2:9 says, For in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily.
[9]  As the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, Christ is not only the Son of God but also the entire God.
[10]  Since Christ is the mystery of God, if we know Christ, we know God.
[11]  Regarding the Son of God there are two aspects: the aspect of the only begotten Son of God and the aspect of the firstborn Son of God.
[12]  Before His resurrection Christ was the only begotten Son of God.
[13]  This verse speaks of Christ as the only begotten Son of God.
[14]  However, this does not mean that after His resurrection Christ is no longer the only begotten Son of God.
[15]  Therefore, in His first birth He was born of Mary to be the Son of Man, and in His second birth He was born of God in resurrection to be the Son of God.
[16]  In John 10:30 the Lord Jesus says, I and the Father are one.
[17]  He denotes the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, all-inclusively, because this pronoun refers to He and Him in the preceding verse, which denotes the coming Son, and it also denotes Him in this verse, referring to the Father who has begotten us.
[18]  We need to be impressed with the fact that according to John 16:15 whatever the Father has is the Son s. The Son did not come in His own name; He came in the Father s name John 5:43 . The Son did not seek His own will but the Father s will John 5:30 . The Son did not speak His own word; He spoke the Father s word John 14:24 . The Son did not do His own work but the Father s work John 4:34 . Who, then, is this One? He is the Son with the Father.
[19]  In this message we shall cover more aspects of Christ in the Godhead.
[20]  It is in resurrection that Christ is the life-giving Spirit.
[21]  According to this verse, on the day of His resurrection, the resurrected Christ breathed on the disciples and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit.
[22]  In the Gospel of John we see that the Lord is the Word, the eternal God, who has passed through a long process to become the Spirit, the pneuma, the breath, that He might come into the believers.
[23]  First, He took the step of incarnation to become a man in the flesh John 1:14 , to be the Lamb of God to accomplish redemption for man John 1:29 , to declare God to man John 1:18 , and to manifest the Father to His believers John 14:9-11 .
[24]  The Giver is Christ who has become the Spirit, and the gift is also Christ as the Spirit.
[25]  Although it is commonly understood that the phrase Christ in the flesh refers to Christ Himself while He was on earth, not many understand the term Christ in the Spirit to mean that Christ is the Spirit.
[26]  Because of the influence of tradition, if we speak of Christ in the Spirit, others may think that Christ is separate from the Spirit, not realizing that Christ is the Spirit.
[27]  Christ is the Author of life in whom is life.
[28]  In his preaching in Acts 3:15 Peter declares, And the Author of life you killed, whom God raised from the dead, of which we are witnesses.
[29]  We have seen that in the Godhead Christ is the complete God, the Son of God, the Word, the expression of the Father, the One whom no one knows except the Father, the Word of life, the life-giving Spirit, the Giver of the Spirit, the Baptizer in the Holy Spirit, the Author of life in whom is life, the Lord, the Lord of glory, and another Angel.
[30]  Having considered Christ s person in the Godhead, we shall go on in this message to see Christ s person in the divine economy.
[31]  The aspects of Christ s person in the Godhead are deep, but the aspects of Christ s person in the divine economy are even deeper.
[32]  The divine economy is God s household management, God s household administrative arrangement, the divine dispensation.
[33]  God s economy, therefore, is His household administration to dispense Himself in Christ into His chosen people so that He may have a house, a household, to express Himself, which household is the church, the Body of Christ.
[34]  In the divine economy Christ is the One having the preeminence in all things.
[35]  According to Ephesians 1:23, the church, Christ s Body, is the fullness of the One who fills all in all.
[36]  The fullness of Christ issues from the enjoyment of the riches of Christ.
[37]  Christ, who is the infinite God without limitation, is so great that He fills all things in all things.
[38]  Colossians 1:12 says, Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the portion of the saints in the light.
[39]  The portion of the saints here is the all-inclusive Christ for our enjoyment.
[40]  The Father has qualified us not to inherit some heavenly mansion, but to have a share in Christ as the all-inclusive portion of the saints.
[41]  Since God is the Creator of all things and since Christ is God, He surely is also the Creator of all things.
[42]  This verse, a quotation from Psalm 102:25, is applied to Christ the Son and indicates that, as God, Christ created heaven and earth.
[43]  Christ as the Word of God to be the means through which God s creation came into being implies also that, as the means of God s creation, Christ speaks God, defines God, and explains God.
[44]  Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn of all creation.
[45]  This means that in creation Christ is the first.
[46]  Firstborn of all creation refers to Christ s preeminence in all creation, since from this verse through verse 18 of Colossians 1 Paul emphasizes the first place of Christ in all things.
[47]  The Bible says clearly that the Word, Christ, was God John 1:1 , yet Arius asserted that the Word is not the self-existent God, and he therefore maintained that Christ s divinity is imperfect and cannot compare with that of God.
[48]  In Revelation 3:14 we see that Christ is the beginning of the creation.
[49]  He is the origination of the creation of God.
[50]  Hebrews 1:3 tells us that Christ upholds all things by the word of His power.
[51]  Because all things were created in Christ, through Christ, and unto Christ and because all things subsist in Christ, God can be expressed in creation through Christ, who is the image of the invisible God.
[52]  In the incarnation Christ is God manifested in the flesh 1 Tim 3:16 .
[53]  As the God-man, Christ was born of a human virgin and therefore has the essence of man Luke 1:31; Gal 4:4 .
[54]  Such a conception of the Holy Spirit in a human virgin, accomplished with both the divine and the human essences, constitutes a mingling of the divine nature with the human nature, producing the God-man, the One who is both the complete God and a perfect man, possessing the divine nature and the human nature distinctively, without a third nature being produced.
[55]  The conception of the God-man was God s incarnation, constituted not only by the divine power but also of the divine essence added to the human essence, hence producing the God-man of two natures divinity and humanity.
[56]  It is a great heresy to say that Jesus Christ is not quite God nor quite man but a third entity with a third nature, something neither God nor man.
[57]  Jesus is Jehovah-Savior, the One who saves us from everything God condemns and from all negative things.
[58]  In this message we shall cover Christ s person in His human living.
[59]  The foregoing messages on Christ s person have been mainly concerned with His person in the divine element.
[60]  Before God could dispense Himself into us, He first had to dispense Himself into the man Christ Jesus.
[61]  We have pointed out that in His incarnation Christ was conceived of the Spirit of God and was born of a human virgin.
[62]  The Lord Jesus was a carpenter, a son of a carpenter Mark 6:3; Matt 13:55 .
[63]  In Revelation 1:5 Christ is called the faithful Witness.
[64]  Without Him, we cannot know God or gain God.
[65]  Although He was a despised Nazarene and even a slave, His living was a testimony of God, for He was a living witness of God.
[66]  In this message we have covered six aspects of Christ in His human living: the Son of Man found in fashion as a man, a despised Nazarene, a carpenter who was a son of a carpenter, the One who took the form of a slave to serve God and man, the faithful Witness of God, and the Holy and Righteous One.
[67]  In this message we shall cover the six aspects of Christ in redemption: the Lamb of God John 1:29 , a man in the flesh Rom 8:3 , the last Adam 1 Cor 15:45 , a creature Col 1:15 , a serpent in form John 3:14 , and our peace and Peacemaker Eph 2:14-16 .
[68]  In John 1:29 we see that in redemption Christ is the Lamb of God: Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!
[69]  This verse indicates that Christ as the Lamb of God takes away sin from the human race.
[70]  When Christ died on the cross, He also died as a man in the flesh.
[71]  Some may be very surprised to hear that Christ died on the cross even as a serpent in form.
[72]  As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life John 3:14-15 .
[73]  It takes the power of God to defeat through the cross of Christ, Satan, the world, sin, fallen man, the flesh, the natural life, the old creation, and the ordinances.
[74]  Christ was made wisdom to us from God as three vital things in God s salvation: righteousness for our past, by which we have been justified by God so that we may be reborn in our spirit to receive the divine life Rom 5:18 ; sanctification for the present, by which we are being sanctified in our soul, that is, transformed in our mind, emotion, and will, with the divine life Rom 6:19, 22 ; and redemption for the future, that is, the redemption of our body Rom 8:23 , by which we shall be transfigured in our body with His divine life to have His glorious likeness Phil 3:21 .
[75]  In this message we shall cover some deep and profound matters concerning Christ s person in reproduction and resurrection.
[76]  Christ has a reproduction, and in His reproduction He is a grain of wheat.
[77]  Concerning this, Peter says, The God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ...has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead 1 Pet 1:3 .
[78]  Christ s resurrection was His transfiguration into the life-giving Spirit in order to enter into His believers 1 Cor 15:45b .
[79]  The last Adam, Christ, became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.
[80]  In resurrection Christ is the Lord Spirit: We all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18 .
[81]  The Lord Spirit may be considered a compound title like the Father God and the Lord Christ.
[82]  This expression strongly proves that the Lord Christ is the Spirit and that the Spirit is the Lord Christ.
[83]  The previous verse says that the Lord is the Spirit, and this verse definitely speaks of Christ as the Lord Spirit.
[84]  When the Lord Jesus was being judged by the Sanhedrin, the high priest said to Him, I adjure you by the living God that you tell us if you are the Christ, the Son of God Matt 26:63 .
[85]  Moreover, I say to you, Henceforth you shall see the Son of Man sitting at the right hand of Power and coming on the clouds of heaven v. 64 . The high priest asked the Lord if He was the Son of God, but He answered by referring to Himself as the Son of Man.
[86]  The Lord was the Son of Man on earth before His crucifixion, and He is still the Son of Man in the heavens at the right hand of God after His resurrection and ascension.
[87]  Stephen saw the ascended Christ as the Son of Man: Being full of the Holy Spirit, looking intently into heaven, he saw the glory of God and Jesus standing at the right hand of God; and he said, Behold, I see the heavens opened up and the Son of Man standing at the right hand of God Acts 7:55-56 .
[88]  Hebrews 12:2 says that Christ is now seated at the right hand of the throne of God.
[89]  According to the book of Revelation, the throne on which the ascended Christ is sitting is the throne of the divine administration: I saw in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, a Lamb standing as having been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God, sent forth into all the earth Rev 5:6 .
[90]  Christ in His ascension is also the Christ for His heavenly ministry.
[91]  But in His ascension He was made the Christ to carry out God s commission through His heavenly ministry.
[92]  Not until His ascension was Christ officially inaugurated as the Christ.
[93]  On the day of Pentecost Peter said, Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly that God has made Him both Lord and Christ this Jesus whom you crucified Acts 2:36 .
[94]  Furthermore, as God s sent and anointed One in His humanity, He was Christ from the time He was born Luke 2:11; Matt 1:16; John 1:41; Matt 16:16 .
[95]  According to Ephesians 1:20-22, God s surpassingly great power has been wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead, and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship, and every name that is named, not only in this age, but also in that which is coming; and He subjected all things under His feet, and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church.
[96]  First John 2:1b says, If anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.
[97]  Instead of saying Jesus Christ the Righteous, we may say Jesus Christ, the right One.
[98]  Christ was the righteous One in His earthly life, for He was right with God and man.
[99]  In ascension Christ is also a propitiation-cover mercy seat .
[100]  Romans 3:25 says that God has set forth Christ a propitiation-cover through faith in His blood.
[101]  For this reason, Romans 3:25 uses the word hilasterion to reveal that Christ is the propitiation place, the propitiation-cover, whom God set forth for showing forth His righteousness by passing by the sins of the Old Testament saints, for, as the propitiatory sacrifice, Christ made the full propitiation on the cross for their sins and fully satisfied the requirements of God s righteousness and glory.
[102]  In this message we shall consider Christ in His coming back and in the kingdom.
[103]  Matthew 25:1 indicates that in His coming back Christ will also be the Bridegroom: Then shall the kingdom of the heavens be likened to ten virgins, who took their lamps and went forth to meet the bridegroom.
[104]  We are the virgins going and Christ is the Bridegroom coming.
[105]  The reign of God, the kingdom, is related to the marriage of Christ, and the marriage of Christ is the issue of the completion of God s New Testament economy.
[106]  According to Revelation 10:1-7, Christ will come as another Angel to possess the earth.
[107]  Revelation 10:1 says, I saw another strong Angel coming down out of heaven, clothed with a cloud; and the rainbow was upon His head, and His face was as the sun, and His feet as pillars of fire.
[108]  Here the rainbow indicates that Christ in His judgment on the earth and in His coming to take possession of it will keep the covenant God made with Noah concerning the earth Gen 9:8-17 .
[109]  In this upcoming kingdom, which Christ as the Son of Man will bring in Dan 7:13-14; Luke 19:12-15 , He will surely be the Son of Man, not only as a sign of God s victory and glory but also as a sign of Satan s defeat and shame.
[110]  This indicates that in eternity we shall be enjoying what God has prepared for us through Christ as the Lamb.
[111]  We shall remember how Christ gave His body for us so that we might become His mystical Body, and how He shed His blood for our sins so that we might be redeemed back to God and have the right to come to Him and enjoy Him as the tree of life.
[112]  According to the Bible, the temple is where God dwells and where His people worship Him.
[113]  In eternity Christ with God will be such a temple, a temple that is both God s habitation and our dwelling place.
[114]  That type was first fulfilled in Christ as God s tabernacle among men John 1:14 , and will eventually be fulfilled in the fullest way in the New Jerusalem, which will be the enlargement of Christ as God s dwelling place.
[115]  Outside of Christ God s shining would be a killing, but inside of Christ God s shining is an illumining.
[116]  Revelation 21:6 indicates that in the New Jerusalem Christ will be the spring of the water of life: I will give to him who thirsts from the spring of the water of life freely.
[117]  Through the redemption of Christ the way to touch the tree of life, which is God Himself in Christ as life to man, has been opened again Heb 10:19-20 .
