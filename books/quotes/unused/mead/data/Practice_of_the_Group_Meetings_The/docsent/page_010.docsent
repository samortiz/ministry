   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR BEING RELEASED, LIVING, AND FRESH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE GROUP MEETINGS THE CARRYING OUT OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO MEET AND TO SERVE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first step in the carrying out of the God-ordained way to meet and to serve is to exercise the New Testament priesthood of the gospel by helping people to be saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is to beget new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may help people to be saved and baptized through visiting them in their homes by knocking on their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, we should not be legal about our way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Sometimes we may help them in other ways, such as inviting them to a meeting or simply speaking to them on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The second step in carrying out the God-ordained way is to feed the new ones by meeting with them in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These new beginners may be those who have been saved and baptized among us, or they may be other new believers whom we have met.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The third step is to perfect the new believers in group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After feeding the new ones for a short time, we should bring them together to form a group meeting, not just for feeding but for perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This meeting is the main part of the church life, and it should include fellowship, intercession, care, shepherding, teaching, perfecting, and all the other items of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fourth step in the God-ordained way is to prophesy in the larger church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These four steps for carrying out the God-ordained way to meet and to serve should not merely be something we learn.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They should be our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should take this way and walk in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE WAY TO HAVE A GROUP MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There are many ways to have a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the attendants of the meeting come together, they may spontaneously begin to sing and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then one brother may tell the others that one of the new sisters has become ill, and the group may pray for her.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There are many things about which we can fellowship in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Someone may ask about a brother s job situation, and the group may again pray and seek the Lord s leading in caring for him and his family.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One who is exercising to care for a group meeting will be able to know when one person has been speaking for too long about a particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then he can introduce something else into the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He may offer a prayer, and his prayer will change the atmosphere of the meeting and bring it into another stage.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The teaching in the group meetings should be carried out not by a particular person but by all the attendants in that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>During the group meeting, a brother may raise a question concerning a point from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everyone in the group can teach the others by saying something in answer to that question.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even those who have been saved for a very short time have something to speak and can offer it in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Likewise, there are often some attendants who are able to speak something deeper in answer to the questions, and some who are able to give a concluding word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone has a small portion, and when everyone presents what he has, all the portions are added together to make a good teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone can ask a question, everyone can answer, and everyone can teach.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whatever is spoken in the group meeting is heard by all the attendants, and everyone receives the help.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the way to teach the saints in a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the saints attend this kind of group meeting week after week for two or three years, they will be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we practice having group meetings, we will learn the proper way to carry them out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The best way to learn is to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more we practice, the more we learn.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should not say that we do not know how to cook.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should simply buy some groceries, put them into water, and place them on a stove.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then we will learn to cook.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we would practice having group meetings for several months, we will know how to meet, and we will receive the benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we have learned the proper way to have group meetings, they will become indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The group meetings comprise eighty percent of the church life if we practice them properly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, we may not know how to have group meetings in life, in spirit, and according to everyone s current situation and need.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is because we have been accustomed to having meetings in a traditional, formal, ritualistic way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the old way of meeting, we could meet for some years and still not know the other attendants in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There might be no contact, care, or shepherding among the members.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In a church with several hundred newly baptized believers, it would be impossible to have enough elders to care for them all.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If such a church meets in the old way, the number of new ones will be impressive, but there will be little content of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, if this church meets in a proper way, the several hundred members will be formed into groups of eight to fifteen persons.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Each group will care for the persons in that group.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The members of the group will come to know one another very well, and the entire church will be under a daily, mutual care.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This mutual care is carried out in many ways in the group meetings.</S>
