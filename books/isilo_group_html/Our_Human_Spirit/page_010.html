In verse 10 he says, &#8220;Renew a right spirit within me.&#8221; Then in verse 12 he says, &#8220;Restore unto me the joy of thy salvation and sustain me with a willing spirit&#8221; (lit.). Then in verse 17 is a &#8220;broken spirit.&#8221; Psalms 51 shows us a contrite spirit, a right spirit, a willing spirit, and a broken spirit.<h2 class=head1>MY SPIRIT</h2><p>Psalms 77:3 says, &#8220;I complained, and my spirit was overwhelmed.&#8221; Psalms 77:6 says, &#8220;I call to remembrance my song in the night: I commune with mine own heart: and my spirit made diligent search.&#8221; I communed to myself with my heart, but my spirit made a diligent search in the presence of God.<h2 class=head1>A STEADFAST SPIRIT</h2><p>Psalms 78:8 says that the children of Israel were not steadfast in their spirit with God. We need a steadfast spirit with God. We don&#8217;t only need to make up our mind or have a strong will, but we need to have a steadfast spirit with God.<h2 class=head1>GOD WEIGHS OUR SPIRIT</h2><p>Proverbs 16:2 says, &#8220;All the ways of a man are clean in his own eyes; but the Lord weigheth the spirits.&#8221; God puts your spirit on the balance, on the scale, to weigh it. God cares for what we are in our spirit. We consider our ways; He weighs our spirits.<h2 class=head1>A SEEKING SPIRIT</h2><p>Isaiah 26:9 says, &#8220;With my soul have I desired Thee in the night; yea, with my spirit within me will I seek Thee early.&#8221; To desire the Lord is something of the soul, but to seek the Lord is something of the spirit. With my soul I desired thee. With the spirit within me I seek thee. We have to seek the Lord with our spirit.<h2 class=head1>A CONTRITE AND HUMBLE SPIRIT</h2><p>In Isaiah 57:15-16 you have a contrite and humble spirit. Verse 16 says that the Lord would not be so hard with us. If He would be too hard with us, then our spirit would fail. Sometimes the Lord allows certain things to happen to us, but still there is a certain kind of limitation because the Lord is careful about our spirit. He knows our spirit cannot suffer that much in a certain hard situation, so He would not allow too much suffering in order that our spirit would not fail. This tells us that God is concerned for our spirit.<h2 class=head1>A PROVOKED SPIRIT</h2><p>Psalms 106:33 tells us that the children of Israel provoked Moses&#8217; spirit. This shows us that the spirit is the deepest part of a person and the most important part. I may provoke your mind. That doesn&#8217;t mean much. But if I provoke your spirit, that is really something serious.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Our Human Spirit &nbsp; pg 10</div><br></body></html>
