   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REQUIREMENTS OF A WORKER A Proper and Pure Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>One brother asked: When is it the time to say, "Speak, O Jehovah; for Your servant is listening'' 1 Sam 3:9 ?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Watchman Nee: In the past the brothers in all the localities gave the co-workers many headaches.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people were quite zealous outwardly, and they wanted to work full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The brothers in those localities went ahead and acknowledged such ones as co-workers, and they received such ones as co-workers on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This brought us many problems.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We cannot recognize such acknowledgments.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Those who serve with the ministry of the word should learn to touch others' spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A servant of God should know, when others are speaking, whether the speaker's spirit is in accord with him or is in contradiction to him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The spirit of some is improper or defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no way for us to remove their defilements.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, you may come and tell me that Brother Suen is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If Brother Hsu comes along and asks me how Brother Suen is doing, I cannot tell him Brother Suen's mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even if I were to tell Brother Hsu the mistakes, he may not believe me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, we hope that all those who wish to serve the Lord full-time will first learn some lessons in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Waiting for Confirmation</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I am not saying that those who want to give themselves to the work have to be perfect in any sense.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, their spirit has to be pure and simple before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may not know the kind of spirit you have.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Up to a certain point, everyone else may say that now is the time for you to drop your job.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By that time you should drop your job.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even though some have a heart to serve full-time, they should still wait in their jobs for a while.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The question is whether or not the Lord wants such a one to drop everything to serve God at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our brother Philip Luan died because of our unfaithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He left his job but did not receive adequate care.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can hardly find another brother who loved the Lord as much as he did.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We did not have enough light.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we did, and we realized the hardship in the environment, we would have persuaded him to go back to his job.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everyone should have the same need in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brother Hsia Hsi-ling has a good job at the customs department.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He has been working there for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He has not asked if he should drop that job, but we feel that he should drop it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone has to offer up himself to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those brothers and sisters who are in their jobs are not the first-class citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Unless everyone offers up everything, we have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>"Offer Up Yourselves''</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Suen Chang-ming: Everyone should be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This kind of service is a matter of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In our factory we have to support one hundred workers, and the burden is already very heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Acts 2 and 4 there were over eight thousand people that needed support.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>How did they do it?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Watchman Nee: After the war the CBC Laboratory was worth eight hundred thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Last year it was worth only four hundred thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This year it is worth 1.2 million.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yet we owe others seven hundred thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have no idea what will happen next year.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we were going to buy the land from Mrs. Chow, some consecrated all they had by selling everything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I felt that that money was blood money.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After I made the announcement the first and second time, I dared not make any more announcements, because all the ones who were giving money were middle-class and lower middle-class saints.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Those who had the money and who should have offered were slow to move.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After that first failure I dared not ask others for money again.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I told others that, should we have to build a meeting hall, I would do it myself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sister Ruth Lee may have harbored some complaints against me, that I did not take care of so many works that were necessary, and that instead I went into business.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But in order for the work to be done properly, some have to sacrifice themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I can say this word to you today: I have done my work, and I have sacrificed myself.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Today I am a part of those who are sharing responsibilities in the work, and I am also a part of those who are holding jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am not an insensitive person.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For you to go into business, there is no sense of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But for me to go into business, there is the sense of shame.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I know that with this matter some have something to say about me, and I can tell you that some have come and questioned me.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even now, I risk bearing the shame of receiving no greetings on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I risk bearing the shame of "remarrying'' myself as a widow, so much so that the children are gone, and I am left wondering why I was doing what I was doing, with a dead child in my arms.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>For eight years I could not lift up my face and look into the brothers' and sisters' eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do I not have the right today to say to you, "Offer up yourselves''?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Why would you not offer up yourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today is the time for all the working brothers and sisters to offer up themselves.</S>
