   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Oneness of the One Father as the Source</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The oneness in reality is also the oneness of the one Father as the source, who is over all, through all, and in all Eph 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paul described the oneness in such a fine way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He showed us that God the Father is the source of our oneness, the Lord is the element of our oneness, and the Spirit is the essence of our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Father as the source, the origin, is now over us, through us, and in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is the saturating One and the permeating One.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, the Father Himself is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He is the triune Father because He is in three directions over all, through all, and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Over all refers mainly to the Father, through all to the Son, and in all to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the source, the element, and the essence of the oneness in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to be in a trance to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We do not want to remain in the natural field.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We want to be in a trance, in an invisible sphere, to see the invisible reality of the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we are in such a trance, we can see Christ in one another.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why are we one?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why do we sing the same and pray the same?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although we are of different races and from different places we are one because the same One is over us all, through us all, and in us all.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are in something that is invisible the oneness in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we were born again, we were immediately delivered into this oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When a child is born, he is delivered into a family and becomes a member of that family.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the same way, when we were born again, we became members of God's family.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Recently, a Russian couple came to a church meeting in Anaheim and asked how they could become members of our church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I dared not to disturb the meeting, but within me I said, "You have already received your membership."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After being delivered, a newborn son has already received his sonship, his membership into his family.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since we have been born of God, we all are members of the great oneness of God's family.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the reality, and we are in this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After we have been regenerated, however, we Christians have a long way to walk, a long way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have been on this way for over sixty-six years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The longer the way is, the more trouble there is.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today we may all be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may declare, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are one!"</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Later, however, a "barking dog" may trouble us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Philippians 3:2 Paul told the Philippians to "beware of the dogs."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These dogs were the religious Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today you may be so happy in the enjoyment of the divine oneness, but later someone may come to poison you with doubts, rumors, and other negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They may even give you some negative literature to read.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then you will wonder, "Is the local church like this?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You may then begin to think that you came to the wrong place and that you were born into the wrong family.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>By receiving these negative things, your enjoyment of the oneness has been cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This one who came to you from outside the recovery may be considered as an "outdoor barking dog."</S>
