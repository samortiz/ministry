   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON Putting Off the Ordinances and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Turning to the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 2:15 says, Abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, so making peace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances in His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are ordinances in the Old Testament laws that forbid Jews from contacting Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These ordinances cause Jews to stay away from Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, on the cross Christ abolished all the ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we have ordinances, we can never take Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In order to take Christ as our person, we must put off all ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 18 says, Through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In order to take Christ as our person, we must not only put off the ordinances but also be in one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For this reason, we should pay attention to the Spirit, not to ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We each have many self-made ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Ordinances are our forms or ways of living and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For example, when I sleep at night, I must close the window; this is my ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There may be a young brother who likes to sleep with the window open.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, my ordinance is to close the window at night, and his ordinance is to open the window.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How can we be together in peace?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The main ordinances in Judaism include dietary regulations, such as not eating pork.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, Gentiles eat pork.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These dietary regulations are a middle wall of partition between Jews and Gentiles v. 14 . Ordinances separate and bring in enmity between people.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Regardless of whether we are Jews or Gentiles, we need to drop our ordinances and turn to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If the Spirit wants us to eat meat, we should do so whether it is beef, pork, or lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the Holy Spirit does not want us to eat meat, we should not eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When John the Baptist came, he neither ate nor drank.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But when the Lord Jesus, the Son of Man, came, He both ate and drank Matt 11:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, do not pay attention to ordinances; pay attention to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It does not matter whether or not we eat meat or whether we open or close the window; none of these matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is crucial is to follow the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the church life we should never hold on to our ordinances; we should be in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some saints have an ordinance to sit quietly in their chair during the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This becomes an ordinance of being quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some younger saints like to pray loudly and shout.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They are not satisfied unless they shout.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This also becomes an ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, being quiet is an ordinance, and shouting is also an ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the end, those who are quiet cannot be one with those who shout.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Since the Lord has abolished the ordinances, we are one in the Lord in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, when we hold on to our ordinances, we cannot be one in practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible clearly says that the Lord nailed all the ordinances to the cross Col 2:14; Eph 2:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, we should drop all the ordinances and turn to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the Spirit wants us to shout, we should shout, and if the Spirit wants us to be quiet, we should be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Psalm 90:14 says, Satisfy us in the morning with Your lovingkindness / That we may give a ringing shout and rejoice all our days.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This verse says that we should give a ringing shout not only in the morning but from morning to evening all our days.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do not quote this verse to encourage you to shout.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This verse shows that in our Christian life we touch the Lord inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we touch the Lord and are released, we will shout.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A Christian who has never shouted has not touched the Lord in a released way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A brother said that the young saints were shouting too much.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Even though I concur with this comment, I feel that those who are opposed to shouting should shout.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If we insist on not shouting, we make it an ordinance, which will become a chain that binds us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Please do not misunderstand me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whether we should shout or be quiet is not a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The problem is that the demand for others to be quiet or to shout comes from the self.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we make such a demand, we are the person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must give ourselves completely to the Lord and let Him be our person.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once the Lord becomes our person, we will have joy and peace within.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Of course, the young saints should not be too loud.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They should take care of the older saints who may have heart problems or high blood pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To insist on shouting is an ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Satan, the cunning one, hides behind every ordinance in order to create division and cause people to be in discord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must allow the cross to eliminate all our ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who promote shouting should leave their shouting on the cross, and those who are in favor of being quiet should leave their being quiet on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The Lord has abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances and slain the enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Let us turn to the Spirit and not be under any regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The quiet saints should not rebuke the saints who shout, nor should the saints who shout criticize the quiet saints.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The cross has abolished all the ordinances, and we are in one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We should not decide to be quiet or to shout; rather, we should let Christ be our person in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then we will be full of joy, the Lord Jesus will be very precious, and the brothers and sisters will be lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have said that if we, as Christians, are not beside ourselves, we are not qualified to be Christians, because the Bible says that we should be beside ourselves toward God 2 Cor 5:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are blessed to enjoy God to the extent that we are beside ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>However, this is not a performance or an ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is the result of living in our mingled spirit and taking Christ as our person.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Taking Christ as our person is not an ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is the way for us to live in our spirit.</S>
