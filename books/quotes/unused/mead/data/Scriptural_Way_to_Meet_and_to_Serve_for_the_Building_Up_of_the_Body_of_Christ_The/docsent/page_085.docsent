   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT TRUTH AND LIFE SUPPLY Scripture Reading: John 14:6; 8:32; Eph 3:8; Phil 1:19; Eph 5:29 TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Truth is Christ with God as the reality John 14:6; 8:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With us Christians, the believers in Christ, it is always possible that we could take something as a truth without the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The reality of the truth is the processed Triune God in Christ for us to partake of and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we only have truth without the processed Triune God as the reality, that truth is empty.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Truth without the reality of life falls into doctrine of letters, and it forms deadening regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Truths should not be regulations, but it is very possible that we can make them regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I am concerned that after receiving the fellowship in these chapters, we may make each point of these truths a regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may go to the church in our locality and say that it is wrong to have a big meeting in which one person speaks and the rest listen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we only say this much, our speaking will make this item a regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The church may be convinced by our speaking and change to meetings in which all the attendants may speak and with no definite, assigned speaker.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, however, no one may speak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Formerly, there was a regulation that the meetings would have one speaker with all the others as the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now we may have another kind of meeting in which all the believers come together with no definite speaker, yet they come together without life, without the life supply, and without the real content.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This practice is not the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, it is a regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is quite possible that in the big meetings we may not have an assigned speaker, but we may have a group of dear saints assigned in a hidden way in order to make a show that we now have many speakers instead of one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this case, whether we would have one speaker or many speakers, they would all be assigned.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not the reality; it is a change of regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Formerly, the meetings in the churches were regulated in one way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Now the regulated way has been changed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The way has been changed in outward form but not intrinsically in the spiritual and divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The essence remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the former kind of meeting there was no life, and in this new kind of meeting neither is there life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This kind of change means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The situation will still remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is no difference between having one person assigned to speak or many assigned to speak without life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The one kind of meeting was empty, and the other kind of meeting will also be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The new way of meeting will be different in the form, the practice, the outward way, but in actuality there will be emptiness, not reality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The actuality and practicality of our meeting must be in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This reality is not in many persons speaking concerning doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This reality has to be the very processed Triune God Himself as our real life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We do have such a reality, and this reality changes not only the outward way of the meeting but also its inward, intrinsic essence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>With this change we do not merely have an outward appearance but the inward reality.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, whatever we do, whatever we speak, and whatever we carry out will be the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Truth and Grace</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>John 1:14 says, And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us...full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This verse says that the Word was not full of practices or doctrines, but full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Grace is God in the Son as our enjoyment; reality is God realized by us in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the Triune God became flesh, He did not bring us practices and doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He brought us Himself as our enjoyment in the aspect of grace and as reality to be realized by us in the aspect of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God is the reality to be seen, touched, realized, and received by us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we receive Him, we receive Him as the very reality.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then we enjoy Him as the very grace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is truth and grace coming with the incarnation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We now have the reality; we do not care for empty doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There are many doctrines in the Bible, but every doctrine in the Bible points to a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do not have the Triune God Himself as the reality of our teaching concerning the Trinity, our teaching is just vain and empty theology.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We care to speak the truth, the very God Himself who is triune and who has passed through all the processes to be our reality and our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such a God is truth and grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, He Himself could say, I am...the reality John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He did not say, I am the doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He was the very reality of what He spoke to the disciples, of what He brought to them, and of what He intended to give them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He did not intend to give us doctrines; He intended to give us God Himself, and this divine Self is simply the divine Spirit.</S>
