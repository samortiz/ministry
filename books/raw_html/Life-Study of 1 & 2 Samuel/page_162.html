<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE LAST WORDS OF DAVID</H2><P>In 23:1-7 we have the last words of David.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Declaration of David the Son of Jesse</H2><P>These words are the declaration of David the son of Jesse (v. 1b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Declaration of the Man<br>Who Had Been Raised Up on High</H2><P>Verse 1c says that these are the words of the man who had been raised up on high, the anointed of the God of Jacob, the one lovely (pleasant) in the psalms of Israel.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Spirit of Jehovah Speaking through Him</H2><P>In verse 2 David said that the Spirit of Jehovah spoke through him and that His word was on his tongue.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Speaking of the God<br>and the Rock of Israel to Him</H2><P>David went on to declare that the God and the Rock of Israel spoke to him (v. 3a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. He, Typifying Christ, Ruling<br>among Men Righteously with the Fear of God</H2><P>Verse 3b says that David, typifying Christ, ruled among men righteously with the fear of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. He, Typifying Christ, Being Like the Light<br>of the Morning When the Sun Rises without Clouds</H2><P>Typifying Christ, David was like the light of the morning when the sun rises without clouds, as when the tender grass sprouts up from the earth at the sun's shining after a rain (v. 4). When Christ rules among men righteously with the fear of God, He is like the light of the morning when the sun rises, as when the tender grass sprouts up from the earth at the sun's shining after a rain.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. His House Being So with God</H2><P>In verse 5a David continued by indicating that his house was so with God, for God had made an eternal covenant with him, ordered in all things and secure. Then David asked, "For all my salvation and all my desire,/Will He not indeed make them grow?" (v. 5b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>H. The Wicked Being Like Thorns<br>to Be Thrust Away</H2><P>David concluded by saying that the wicked will be like thorns to be thrust away and will be burned with fire in their place (vv. 6-7).</P>
