   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>REGENERATION THE FIRST STEP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE REPRODUCTION OF THE GOD-MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BY THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first step of the reproduction of the God-man by the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit is regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord Jesus spoke about regeneration to Nicodemus in John 3.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To this ethical, cultured, and religious gentleman, He said, You must be born anew John 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To be born anew, or again, is to be born of another essence, the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord seemed to be saying to Nicodemus, You were born of the human essence, and now you need to be born of another essence the essence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Nicodemus, you must be born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Born of the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To be born of God is to be born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit is the extract of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, this extract is not merely of God; it is also of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The regenerating Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we compare John 3:6 with John 3:14 and 15, we shall see that the Spirit here is the extract of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In John 3:6 the Lord Jesus says, That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we would have the divine life, we must be born of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In John 3:14 and 15 the Lord Jesus goes on to say, And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that every one who believes in Him may have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here the Lord refers to Himself as the crucified and resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whoever believes in Him will have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Having eternal life is equal to being reborn.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In other words, to be reborn is to have the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What does it mean to be born again, to be born of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be born of the Spirit is to receive the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In these verses from John 3 we first have the Spirit and then the crucified and resurrected Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we compare these verses we see that here the Spirit is the extract of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit of whom we are born to have eternal life is the extract of the crucified and resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Crucifixion is a pressing that produces an extract.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When pressure is applied to an orange, we get the juice as the extract of the orange.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We may compare the crucifixion of Christ to the pressing of an orange.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Christ was on the cross, He was pressed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After being pressed on the cross, He came forth as the juice of the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, just as the essence, elements, nature, and substance of an orange are in the extract, so the essence, elements, nature, and substance of Christ are in the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is by this Spirit that Christ, the God-man, is reproduced.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Receiving the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>by Calling on the Name of the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In our preaching of the gospel we need to tell others that Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to tell them that Christ was pressed on the cross to become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now if sinners repent, believe in Him, and call on Him, they will receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever a person calls on the Lord Jesus, he receives the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This Spirit is actually the reality of Jesus Christ as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Acts 2 we have the outpouring of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Acts 2:17 Peter quotes Joel s word about the pouring out of God s Spirit upon all flesh and his word that whoever calls on the name of the Lord, shall be saved Acts 2:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Since God has poured out His Spirit, what people need to do in order to be saved is to call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whoever calls on the Lord s name will be saved, and to be saved is actually to receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As we have pointed out a number of times, the name denotes the person.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Jesus is the name of the Lord, and the Spirit is His person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, when we call on the Lord s name, we receive His person, the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is what it means to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some Christians oppose this matter of calling on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They say falsely that this is mere shouting or vain repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, calling on the Lord s name is not vain.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we call on the name of the dear, all-inclusive One, the One who is above all.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God has given this One a name that is above every name Phil 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can testify that when we call on the name of Jesus, the Spirit comes.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Jesus is His name, and the Spirit is His person, the extract of His being.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The reality of a person s name is the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For this reason, when we call the name of a particular person who is present, the person responds.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The principle is the same with calling on the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whenever we call on this name, we get the person.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Since the person is the Spirit, when we call on the name of Jesus, we receive the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>From experience we know that when we believe in Jesus and call on His name, the Spirit comes as the all-inclusive Person to be our life.</S>
