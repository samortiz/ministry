<h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Watchman Nee, England</h2><p>My work here has experienced much blessing from the Lord. Praise His name. Many people hope that we will be able to put the truth that we have been given and have learned from the Lord into English. I myself see the real need for this work. The English-speaking world is indeed poor. However, unless this is absolutely of the Lord, I would not like to initiate anything. We ourselves must be bound in order for the work to remain pure and of spiritual worth. Many people are exalting me highly here. Yet my eyes are set only on the Lord. I refuse to do anything based on outward prompting. As one who has learned the lesson of the cross, none of these things can cause me to regard myself one bit higher. If a man knows the meaning of conformity to His death, how can he seek glory from men again? But I must say that the Lord has indeed been gracious to me here. Praise His name.</p><p>One thing has been on my mind for many years, which is that the brothers are so easily satisfied. There are indeed many ways not yet traversed. But some are satisfied with what they have already! It seems that much solid food does not have the right kind of recipients! This time the Lord has been gracious to me. I have met a number of people (not too many) who are deep in the Lord and who speak of the deeper things of God. You know that I never demand to be considered a teacher by others. (What an evil attitude that would be!) I have always waited for others to ask me. The same is true this time. The Lord has touched others to come to ask of me. They receive the help, and I receive the reviving. I feel that if I write any book, I should write it in Chinese first and then have it translated into English. But I cannot say under the present circumstances that I am clear about the Lord's mind. The money sent to you was from two or three brothers and sisters who exhausted their means to support the Lord's work. Other than these few people, material giving among most others, and even among the zealous ones, does not come up to the standard of our own brothers in China. Some will give only if others ask them. Such people have nothing to do with us. No matter how difficult our condition is, we have to maintain what we are holding fast to before the Lord. Trials are everywhere, but the God we believe in is the living God! Once the Lord shows me that I have gained what He wants me to gain here, I will set out for my homeward journey. How I long to walk in God's will exactly according to His timing, without being too quick or too slow! Realizing the urgency of the situation around us, I am all the more fearful of having my own way. Sometimes I feel forlorn at the thought that the co-workers are all scattered everywhere and we are not able to gather together in one place. May our scattering be for the accomplishment of the Lord's will. The reports in the The Open Door have stirred up praises to the Lord. Yet our prayer to the Lord is that the younger co-workers will know the cross and how it deals with the flesh and the natural life!</p><p>Brother Watchman Nee, the evening of the fifteenth</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Chang Kwang-rong</h2><p>I left Shanghai on August 12 and arrived in Fu-Ting on the afternoon of the fourteenth. Praise the Lord. I believe this trip was under the Lord's leading, having received the light from the book Rethinking Our Work. After a long period of prayer and waiting, I unexpectedly met the responsible brother of Fu-Ting, Brother Wu Sho-liang. He came as a buyer for merchandise but related the need of workers in the churches there. Subsequently, I went with him to Fu-Ting.</p><p>Fu-Ting is a border region between the provinces of Fukien and Chekiang; it is surrounded by mountains on four sides. When I first arrived, I was not well-adjusted to the climate and felt somewhat ill. By the Lord's grace I soon recovered. I conducted some perfecting work internally for the believers and preached the gospel for a few days to the outsiders. Most of the brothers and sisters are illiterate. Yet their desire to know the Lord is stronger than their desire to read. Their prayers are sincere. The meetings are held at Brother Wu's house. He and his three sons have a dye shop. In addition to their own living quarters, they have built two more rooms to be used for the meetings, with one upstairs to be used for guest houses. Brother Wu manages his house very well and is very hospitable. I was quite touched by him. Although there are only about twenty people breaking bread together, they all love one another. When it comes time to preach, over a hundred come. Although Fu-Ting is between two provinces and is surrounded by mountains, the brothers from Ping-Yang and Tai-Shun come all the time for fellowship. Brother Chan Chin-fa said, "The meeting hall in Fu-Ting is a station for the brothers from Ping-Yang." After I arrived in Fu-Ting, the co-workers from Ping-Yang and Tai-Shun, such as Brothers Chen Chin-fa, Hwang Li-chuan, Jin Tze-fang, and Chou Dah-chin, all came and participated in instructing and teaching us. Over a few dozen places invited me to go to them. I felt quite fearful. I ask that the Lord be merciful to me and trim me so that I can be more humble and obedient. I only want to be a pure vessel and a faithful slave in His hand. I do not want to disappoint the brothers' love or bring shame to the Lord's name. After I finish the portion that the Lord has assigned to me, the Lord willing, I will leave Fu-Ting on the ninth of this month and go to Ya-Yang Village in Tai-Shun, Chekiang, and from there I will go to Shi-Si. Please pray for this.</p><p>Brother Chang Kwang-rong, Fu-Ting, September 3</p>
