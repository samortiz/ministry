   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE HANDING OURSELVES OVER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BY THE WHOLE BODY Date:Monday, February 6, 1950</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place:Jordan Road, Kowloon, Hong Kong THE CHURCH BEING GOD'S GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>AS WELL AS HIS MEANS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Christians are God's goal, but they are also God's means.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today, we also have to see clearly that the church is God's goal as well His means.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Ordinarily, if an object is a goal it cannot be a means, and if it is a means it cannot be a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, God makes His goal and His means one and the same.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What do we mean when we say that Christians are God's goal?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's goal is to redeem us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Once God redeems us, He has reached His goal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is God's intention and goal that we be saved, but God does not stop there.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He wants to use us to save others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, we are God's goal, then we should place ourselves in His hand and allow Him to use us to save others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this way we become God's means.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To God, we are His goal, and to the world, we are His means.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If God does not use us, He will have no way to spread the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today every one of us can say that we are God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have no argument about this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The issue today is that God wants us also to be His means.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do you have a problem with this?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God can use many people to be His goal but not many people can be His means.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although they are saved, God cannot get through in them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result, He cannot reach His goal in others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the early apostles forsook everything to follow the Lord, their goal was not to go to heaven, but to bring others to the same salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They were not only God's goal but also God's means to bring others to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God used other men to gain us and to accomplish His goal in us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today we should do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God first made us the goal and then the means.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do we want to be God's means?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God wants to use us in such a way that He can promptly say, "I want to save a certain person, and he only needs to come in contact with you."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How many people today can say that they are God's means?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If God finds any reservation, any frustration, or any blockage in us, He cannot reach His goal of saving others through us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, many sinners will not receive any blessing from us; they will not hear the gospel from us nor will they be saved through us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God does not have many means on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If He wants to save fifty thousand people here in Hong Kong, He does not rely on fifty thousand isolated means.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No, God does not work separately one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He has established the church and has baptized everyone into one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The many members have become one new man, one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They can no longer be separated; they are all fitly joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we were saved, we were saved individually one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we spread out as God's means, however, we spread out as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we were saved we became living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we spread out, we are coordinated as a spiritual house 1 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In other words, God's means is the corporate Christian the church, not the individual Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Let me say a direct word to you tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to save the world, God has instituted a body, an organization, or you may say a group of people, and has made it the very means whereby He saves the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our sole purpose of living on this earth is for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We do not save a few souls here and there when we feel like it.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God joins all the believers together into a harmonious whole, like a body, and uses it to preach the gospel and to save others.</S>
