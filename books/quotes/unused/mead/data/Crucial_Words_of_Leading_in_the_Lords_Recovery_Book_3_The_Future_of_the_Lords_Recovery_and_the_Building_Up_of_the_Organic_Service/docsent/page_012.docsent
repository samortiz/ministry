   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEGINNING WITH THE BASICS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND NOT TAKING ANY SHORTCUTS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Question: At the beginning of the one-year training we sensed that the burden of the leading brothers was to gather together ones who have a heart for the Lord from each locality and to lead us in a way that is similar to operating a normal school, such as a school for training teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thus, we thought that the training in all of its process, arrangement, and pursuit would be like the operation of a school.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Is this how you envisioned the training?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Answer: In order to learn the truth, you cannot skip any grades.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You must at least graduate from elementary school so that you can have a solid foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even though you have a wealth of assets, you have not gained any of these riches.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Few of us can speak concerning the condition of man, but you are eager to speak about the twelve precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This can be compared to attending graduate school before graduating from elementary school.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some of you have been helped to know how to get material from the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, you should not wait until you have to speak before you study.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This will not work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is not a matter of whether the ministry is full of riches; we need a basic education in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you have not even attended elementary school, but you want to attend a school to become an elementary school teacher, you are not being practical.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For the past twenty-three years we have emphasized giving messages, but we have not paid attention to perfecting the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In principle, giving messages is the same as preaching in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have not done the practical work of building up the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have a great wealth of material, but we do not know how to use it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It has been over twenty-three years since I went to America to begin the work there, and during this time I have been raising a cry of warning concerning the work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Regrettably, this word has not been received; consequently, the saints are not being perfected in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today we must go back to make repairs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If during the past twenty years we had faithfully carried out some education, then even if we did not have the teachers, we would have an educational system in place, and the saints would be somewhat built up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the co-workers in both Taiwan and Southeast Asia have not done an adequate work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our work should not merely consist of giving messages that inspire the listeners but do not impart something solid into them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All elementary school teachers know that teaching a lesson is not a matter of giving an interesting lecture, but instead it depends on getting the lesson into the students so that they can learn how to apply it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is the way to carry out a practical education.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should preach the gospel of God s salvation in a clear way so that people will be saved in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not a matter of being eloquent but of enlivening people s spirits through the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should then lead the newly saved believers to follow the Lord, read the Bible, and know the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must teach them sequentially, topic by topic, the basic truths, such as forgiveness, justification, and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should all be able to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Up to the age of twenty-five is the best time for a person to receive an education.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is relatively difficult for a person to receive more education after the age of twenty-five.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the problems with the work in Taiwan must be solved from their roots.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The saints in the church in Taipei need an elementary education in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In our daily living we must know the flesh and exercise to deal with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to my observation, the young people, and even the leading ones, are not in harmony or in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A lack of harmony and one accord are manifestations of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A divisive element in a locality reveals the presence of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The reason for lack of harmony and discord is that we do not know the flesh; neither do we know the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Providing the saints with a practical education in the basic truths requires a labor without opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All good teachers labor diligently without opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those with many opinions have difficulty teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the problems in the church life are related to opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are opinions about not receiving this or that person and opinions about honoring this or that person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul rebukes such opinions and practices as being according to the manner of man, according to the flesh 1 Cor 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In 1 Corinthians 1:12 Paul says, Each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The church life is the same as a family.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The children who study diligently and seriously do not have opinions, but the children who like to express their opinions are the ones who do not like to study and do not like to do their chores.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They express their opinions about everything, and as a result they never do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not good for children to have opinions, especially since they do not have responsibility for the family.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May the Lord have mercy that we would not have opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not sufficient merely to have a desire to serve the Lord; you must be humble and receive the necessary help by beginning with the basics.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even though this appears to be a slow process, the results will come very quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you try to skip grades and enter an advanced school before you have finished elementary school, it will not be helpful at all; besides, it is not practical.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You must graduate from elementary school and secondary school before obtaining a university education; there is no shortcut.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you rely on your cleverness and consider yourself to be an advanced student who can skip grades, you will gain nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You must spend the time to move forward step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even when you understand a basic truth, you must spend more time to gain additional knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is no shortcut to the learning process in an educational system.</S>
