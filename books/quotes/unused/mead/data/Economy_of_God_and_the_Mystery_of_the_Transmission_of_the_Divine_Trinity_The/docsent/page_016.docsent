   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ENTERING INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD, NOT THROUGH TEACHING BUT THROUGH REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we desire to serve the Lord and walk on His way for our whole life, we must have a pure knowledge of the Word according to God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must see that the drawing near of God's kingdom is the drawing near of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must also see that man's becoming a part of God's world is man's entering into God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As soon as man becomes a part of God's world, man has entered into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nicodemus was concerned mainly with morality when he came to see the Lord and said to Him, "Rabbi, we know that You have come from God as a teacher" John 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He thought that the Lord had come from God to teach ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the Lord immediately interrupted him and said, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God" v. 3 . The Lord Jesus was patient and refined.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was not like us; we are always so rude.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What He meant in actuality was: "Do not speak nonsense.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Have you not seen what John the Baptist did?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless a person is born anew, he can by no means enter into the kingdom of God, and he cannot even see it."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nicodemus was anxious when he heard this word, so he asked, "How can a man be born when he is old?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord Jesus answered, "Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What He meant was: "You have to remember what John the Baptist said and go into the water first, and then I will baptize you into the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Unless you are born of water and the Spirit, you cannot have a share in God's world; that is, you cannot participate in God's kingdom."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order for a dog or a cow to enter and participate in the human world, the human kingdom, it has to receive the human life by being born again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A dog or a cow can be in the human kingdom only by birth.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I was born a man with man's life, so naturally I entered into the human world, the human kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When I am in the human world, I am in the human kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today we all are descendants of Adam born in the human world; we entered the human kingdom by being born of our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we want to obtain the citizenship of a certain country or join a certain club in society, we need to meet certain requirements or pay a fee.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be in the human kingdom, however, the only requirement is to be born.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In fact, we had already entered into the human kingdom even while we were still in our mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is why the Chinese count the age of a person from the time he is conceived in the mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today God desires that we would enter into God's world, God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to our natural understanding, we would say, "This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Lord, please teach me how to enter into the kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But His answer would be: "How can I teach you?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Even if I would teach you until you became an old man, you would still be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is impossible for Me to make you God by teaching you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You cannot become God unless you are born anew of Him."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>For example, teaching is absolutely necessary when you are trying to get a monkey to act like a human.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, regardless of how much the monkey has been taught and how much the monkey is able to mimic human behavior, the monkey is still a monkey.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The monkey cannot become a human unless it is born again of man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thirty years ago when I first came to Taiwan, I went to the zoo and watched a show in which a monkey ate a meal with a knife and fork.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the monkey came out onto the stage, the trainer would hit it with a whip, and the monkey would stand up right away, put on a small cap, and pick up a knife and a fork.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then when the trainer would hit the monkey again, the monkey would start eating the meal like a Westerner.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That kind of performance is an attempt to teach a monkey to enter into the human kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In my opinion, however, no amount of teaching can enable the monkey to enter into the human kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The monkey had the monkey's life and did not want to enter into the human kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In fact, it was quite a suffering for the monkey to try to be in the human kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The monkey was forced to learn obediently because of the whip that was flying at him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But once the performance was over, the monkey immediately climbed down from the table, exposing its real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Today all religions, including Christianity, are just like trainers teaching monkeys to enter into the human kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the end, however, man's true nature is completely exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A monkey having only the monkey life can enter only into the monkey kingdom; a monkey cannot enter into the human kingdom through education.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order to enter into the human kingdom, a monkey has to possess the human life.</S>
