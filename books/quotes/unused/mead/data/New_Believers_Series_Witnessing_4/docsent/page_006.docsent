   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE IMPORTANCE OF WITNESSING A. Being a Great Joy</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The two happiest days in every believer's life are the day he believes in the Lord and the day when, for the first time, he leads another person to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first one, of course, is a particularly happy day.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, the joy of leading another person to the Lord for the first time may be greater than the joy experienced on the day of his own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many Christians do not have much joy because they have never spoken anything for the Lord; they have never led a person to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. Learning to Be Wise</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Proverbs 11:30 says, "He that winneth souls is wise."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From the very beginning of our Christian life, we should learn to win souls by various means.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should learn to be wise.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This will make us useful persons in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I am not talking about delivering a gospel message on the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Platform preaching can never replace the personal work of leading people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A person who knows only to preach from the platform may not know how to lead people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are not exhorting you to give a message on the platform.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are asking you to save men.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many people are good at preaching, but not at saving men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They do not know what to do when a person is brought to them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They are of little use.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The really useful ones are the ones who can lead men to Christ one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>C. Begetting Life</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No tree will sprout without further growth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Likewise, no one can have God's life without begetting more life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Those who never witness to sinners are probably in need of others witnessing to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who have no desire or interest in leading others to repentance unto the Lord are probably in need of repentance themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who are silent for the Lord in front of others probably need to listen again to the voice of God's gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No one can be so advanced that he no longer needs to save others.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No one can advance to the degree that he no longer needs to witness to others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>New believers need to learn to witness to others from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is something we have to do for the rest of our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When you become a little more advanced in the spiritual life, others may tell you, "You have to be a channel of living water.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You should be one with the Holy Spirit so that the living water the Holy Spirit can flow into you."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, a channel has two ends.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This channel of the Holy Spirit, this channel of life, also has two ends.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One end is toward the Holy Spirit, toward life, and toward the Lord, while the other end is toward man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The living water will never flow if the end toward man is closed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>No one can be so wrong as to assume that just opening to the Lord is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The living water does not flow through those who are opened just to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One end must be opened to the Lord, and the other end must be opened to man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The living water will flow out only when both ends are opened.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people are powerless before God because the end toward the Lord is not open.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But many more people are powerless because the end for witnessing and leading others to Christ is closed.</S>
