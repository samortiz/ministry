Dying to Himself but Living to the Father</H2><P>He died to live. He was dying every day during His whole life of thirty-three and a half years. He died to Himself that He might live to the Father (John 5:19, 30; 8:28).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Dying to Live Out the Divine Attributes<br>as His Human Virtues</H2><P>I like this phrase dying to live. Christ died to Himself in order to live out the divine attributes as His human virtues.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Expressing Not Himself but the Father under the Cross All the Time in His Life on the Earth</H2><P>Christ was under the cross all the time on the earth, expressing not Himself but the Father. One day Philip asked Him, "Lord, show us the Father and it is sufficient for us" (John 14:8). The Lord responded, "Have I been so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father; how is it that you say, Show us the Father?" (v. 9). The disciples saw the Lord Jesus, but when they saw Him, they saw the Father. This shows that He was the expression of the Father.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Until Being Practically Crucified on the Cross</H2><P>Christ lived a life under the cross all the time until He was practically crucified on the cross to accomplish His all-inclusive death for God's eternal redemption of His chosen people. God's chosen people became fallen and lost, but He redeemed them back through the wonderful death of that wonderful Person, Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. Making Himself, the First God-man,<br>a Prototype for the Mass Reproduction<br>of Many Brothers&#151;Many God-men</H2><P>Christ made Himself, the first God-man, a prototype for the mass reproduction of many brothers&#151;the many God-men (Rom. 8:29). I have been a Christian for about sixty-nine years. After so many years, I have been made by God to know only one thing&#151;God became man so that man may become God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. This is my unique burden, my unique message. God and man will become one entity, and that one entity is the mingling of divinity with humanity. This mingling will consummate in the New Jerusalem, which is the conclusion of the entire Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE BELIEVERS IN CHRIST AS HIS BROTHERS<br>THE MANY GOD-MEN NEEDING TO LIVE:</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. A Life as a Copy of the Life of Christ<br>the First God-man</H2><P>First Peter 2:21 says that Christ as the first God-man was a model for us. We need to live a life which is a copy, a reproduction, of the life of Christ.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Practical Way to Live a Life According to the High Peak of the Divine Revelation in the Holy Scriptures &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
