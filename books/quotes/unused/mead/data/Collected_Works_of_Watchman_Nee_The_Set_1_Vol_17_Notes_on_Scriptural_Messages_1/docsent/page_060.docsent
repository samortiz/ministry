   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We should learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In particular, the workers of the Lord should learn this lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although men may turn their face towards us today, they may kick their heels at us tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ones who cried, "Hosanna," to the Lord one day were the same ones who cried, "Take Him away," the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord was not discouraged or disappointed by them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He rejected in a hidden way all the excellent treatment from men.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He would never have any direct relationship with His environment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His direct concern was God and His will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is why His way in the world was not crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But our way in the world is crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our Lord did not allow His friends to make His way crooked; He did not allow men's praise to influence His pathway, nor did He allow the enemy's opposition to change His journey.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Peter said to Him, Lord, why can't I follow You now?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I will lay down my life for You.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jesus answered, Will you lay down your life for Me?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Truly, truly, I say to you, A rooster shall by no means crow until you deny Me three times" John 13:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the temptations mentioned above were either from men's glory or the enemy's suggestions.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This was a harder temptation for the Lord from Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peter said, "Why can't I follow You now?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I will lay down my life for You."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord replied to Him saying, "A rooster shall by no means crow until you deny Me three times."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To our impression, Peter often went before the Lord to help Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the Lord would not entrust Himself to him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If I had a disciple of course, I do not have any and if he was always helping me at my side, I am afraid I would give him a fierce look if he denied me in the middle of my trial in court.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The look would say, in effect, "Why do you deny me?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But the Lord turned and looked at Peter Luke 22:61 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That one look caused Peter to go out and cry.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>One of the our hymns says:</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What has stripped the seeming beauty</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>From the idols of the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not a sense of right or duty,</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But the sight of peerless worth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>'Tis that look that melted Peter,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>'Tis that face that Stephen saw,</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>'Tis that heart that wept with Mary,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Can alone from idols draw.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once He takes a look at us with His two eyes, we melt.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But there is another revelation in His looking at Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have put too much hope in "our Peter."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When he says some untrustworthy words, offends us, or talks about us, we become disappointed, discouraged, and even grieved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot stand our Peter's misunderstanding and unfaithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if we drink of the water of this world, hoping that our friends, relatives, or others will satisfy us, we will surely be thirsty again.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are happy about our house, friends, food, and all the other things because they are from God, we can be satisfied with God and will not be disappointed when our situation changes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We will not be stumbled or hurt.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"Jesus answered them, Do you now believe?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Behold, an hour is coming, and has come, that you will be scattered each to his own place and will leave Me alone; yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me. These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the world you have affliction, but take courage; I have overcome the world" John 16:31-33 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that time, the disciples had all believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord asked, "Do you now believe?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He also said, "You will be scattered each to his own place and will leave Me alone; yet I am not alone, because the Father is with Me."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>John 17 is the last prayer of the Lord, while John 16 is His last discourse with the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The consummation of His discourse is in the last few sentences of chapter sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He said that everyone would be scattered and that He would be left alone.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We would have complained to God if we had been left alone, but the Lord said that the Father was with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He could try to draw comfort from all the disciples who had been with Him for years, but He did not put His hope in any one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although they all left Him, He did not feel hurt or unsettled.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the contrary, He told them His experience so that they would have peace in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He knew that those who drink of the water of this world will be thirsty again, and He would not drink it even when there was water readily available to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Those who do not drink of this water but drink of the living water will never thirst again.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why can we not live a satisfied life?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Why are we disappointed?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is because we have hopes.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In fact, we have great hopes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But when we cannot get what we hope for and cannot be satisfied, we become disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I can testify that many times I was ridiculed, but many times I was praised also.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sometimes even Satan would praise me.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>At such times the Lord would remind me of this verse, and I was reminded to drink less of this water.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In this way I would not become thirsty after a while and be disappointed again.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When human love, help, money, fame, ease, and comfort come our way, we may think that they are ours and that we may drink as much of them as we want.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But if we drink so much of them, one day we will become thirsty!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The amount we drink in the world will be the degree of thirst we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some Christians have asked me why they do not feel the preciousness of the Lord when others feel so much of His preciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>My answer to them is that they have drunk too many kinds of water besides the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is why the Lord is not precious to them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We only need to see how much we have consecrated on earth and how much we have forsaken on earth to know how much we treasure the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Paul did say that he was for the excellency of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>But that was not all he said; he also said that he forsook something.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He considered all things as loss.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>He forsook all things, and at the same time he went after the excellency of the knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If we have nothing apart from the Lord, we will see that everything in the Lord is precious to us and will satisfy us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>According to John 4, the amount we forsake will be the amount we receive.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>However much we reject the world, we will enjoy that much of the Lord's riches.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Friends, if others give you love, fame, comfort, glory, and fortune, what will you do?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do you think that the Samaritan woman stopped drinking the world's water just because she had the living water?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>No, she still had to drink of the world's water.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We cannot stop drinking water.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is why when the world, friends, and relatives render us glory, fame, fortune, comfort, and help, we can let them do it.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, we must not indulge ourselves in these things; we must not entrust ourselves to them and should not be moved by them.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We should not demand anything from them and should neither drink nor ask to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If you do this, you will not be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Isaiah 53:2 is a word concerning the Lord Jesus which I treasure very much: "For He grew up like a tender plant before Him, / And like a root out of dry ground."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In a place where there is water, trees grow easily and quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>However, the Lord's environment was such that it did not render Him any help at all.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>His surroundings did not give Him anything.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>The world did not help Him at all.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>His enemies did not give Him any help; neither did the devil nor the angels give Him any help.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Everything He had was from God; He did not receive anything from His surroundings that would encourage, support, or comfort Him.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>His life was a straight line.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We know that a straight line is the shortest distance between two points.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Our Lord took the straight path from this world to His destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>He said that no one who puts his hand on the plow and looks behind is fit for the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Those who have their hands on the plow must look forward; otherwise, the furrows will be crooked.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When the eyes look forward, the plow will run straight.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>If a person looks behind him, the furrow he plows will not be straight.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>God does not want us to turn or to circle around.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He is our satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Why can we be satisfied?</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>We can be satisfied because the water that He will give us will become in us a spring of water gushing up into eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>All outward fame and glory, everything outward is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Unless Christ is in us, and unless God's Spirit is in us, nothing will satisfy us.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Indeed, other than the Lord, nothing can satisfy us.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>At the same time, if we are not satisfied with Him, we cannot remember Him here.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>I thank Him because He has trodden the way for us.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>He is indeed our lovable Lord!</S>
