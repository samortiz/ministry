   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Being Forced to Leave</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the Loving Mother</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>and the Father's Home</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Look at the picture of Jacob's experience.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was not his choice that Esau be his brother, nor that Isaac and Rebekah be his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The father Isaac, the mother Rebekah, and the brother Esau were all an exact match for Jacob's need.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we have seen, when Jacob was in his mother's womb, he struggled and was under the dealing of God's sovereign hand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From the very beginning of his life, Jacob was defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That was the start of his transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Jacob's father was an enjoying person who did not exercise much discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Being a simple person, he just enjoyed grace all day long.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not like to think, consider, or exercise himself very much.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He did not like to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As he was meditating in the field, Rebekah came to him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Isaac simply enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whether the sky was clear or cloudy did not make any difference to him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as he could eat and enjoy, he was satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Jacob came to him disguised as Esau, Isaac did not exercise his discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When Rebekah was concerned that Jacob might marry one of the daughters of Heth 27:46 , Isaac called him, charged him not to take a wife of the daughters of Canaan, and sent him to Laban, his mother's brother.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Isaac's simplicity was for Jacob's benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If Isaac had not been so simple but had exercised more control, it would have been difficult for Jacob to get the birthright and receive the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we have already pointed out, Rebekah was the opposite of Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She was full of consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>She might have exercised her mentality day and night considering how to obtain the birthright for Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>She might have been constantly watching to see how Isaac was dealing with Esau.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If she had not been watching, how could she have overheard the conversation between Isaac and Esau regarding the blessing 27:1-5 ?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After overhearing this conversation, she immediately called Jacob in and told him what to do 27:6-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because Isaac and Rebekah were so different from one another, Jacob obtained the birthright and received the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Esau was a careless person.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Regarding the birthright, he seemed to say, "Jacob, do you want the birthright?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It doesn't mean very much to me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you give me something to eat, I'll give it to you."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By this we see that Esau was rude and careless.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The simple father, the ingenious mother, and the rude and careless brother caused Jacob to suffer and to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After Jacob had supplanted the birthright 25:27-34 and the father's blessing 27:5-29 , Esau hated him and intended to kill him 27:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When Rebekah learned of this, she told Jacob to go to her brother Laban until Esau's fury had turned away 27:32-45 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After telling Jacob this, she manipulated the father to send Jacob away.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This brought Jacob into the pit of God's transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although it was difficult for Jacob to leave his loving mother and his father's home, he was forced to escape 27:42 28:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He had no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was forced to flee into a strange land.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Later on we shall see that when Jacob was in Laban's home, he was in the oven.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Laban, Leah, Rachel, the maids, and all the children were used by God to burn Jacob on every side.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Jacob suffered from every angle, in every corner, and in every aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God placed him in such a situation that he might be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As we read Genesis 25, 27, and 28, we see that God's sovereign hand was upon Jacob to transform him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At that time, however, Jacob did not realize that he was under God's transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He only knew his brother's rudeness and hatred, his mother's cleverness, and his father's simpleness.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Actually, he was under God's dealing day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Not one day was wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every person he met and everything that happened to him was a dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Jacob surely represents the aspect of transformation in our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we would know what transformation is, we must read Jacob's story again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>By reading Jacob's story, I have become fully convinced regarding God's dealing hand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After I began to comprehend this, I realized that everything that happens between others and myself is a dealing for me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The elders, the brothers and sisters, my wife, and my children are not to blame.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Everything is under God's sovereign hand as a dealing for my profit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have needed it all.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Perhaps tomorrow I shall need another dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Lord knows what kind of wife, husband, children, in-laws, and grandchildren we need.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Nothing is accidental.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Everything has been prearranged and happens according to God's plan and schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Nothing is either too late or too early.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Everything occurs on time.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Eventually, we shall say, "Father, thank You for Your sovereign hand.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thank You for Your dealing, for Your prearrangement, and for everything You have done.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Now I know that everything has been under Your sovereignty.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I am just a chosen Jacob under Your hand."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Do you think that Jacob liked to go to Laban's home?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>No, he was forced to go.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He was not sent by his father or mother; he was sent by the sovereign hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Yes, Jacob was God's choice, and God planned to give him the birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Nevertheless, God knew that His chosen one required a great deal of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Thus, it was not merely a matter of the birthright nor of the blessing; it was also a matter of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>From the first day until the last, God's hand was upon Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>How we must thank and praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He has chosen and predestinated us, and now we are under His sovereign hand that we might be dealt with day after day.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God is dealing with us through all kinds of persons and circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the past, a brother said to me, "Everyone in my life has been arranged by God except my wife."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I said to him, "Brother, your wife is the number one person whom God has arranged for you."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Without exception, every person in our life is used by God for our transformation.</S>
