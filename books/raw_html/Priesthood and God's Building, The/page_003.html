        <h2 class="head1">AUTHORITY AND FELLOWSHIP<br />
BEING TWO LINES IN THE BODY</h2>
<p>When we observe the human body carefully, we see that there are two indispensable lines, or systems, that function in the human body. In spiritual terms these two lines are authority and fellowship. Authority is often described in relation to order and coordination. For example, my upper arm is below my head, my forearm is below my upper arm, my wrist is below my forearm, my palm is below my wrist, and my fingers are below my palm. From this order, we can see the matter of authority at every level. If my wrist or upper arm becomes dislocated, my entire body will be affected. Thus, there is a line related to authority and order in the human body.</p>
<p>Our body also depends on the circulation of blood, which is its &ldquo;fellowship.&rdquo; Although there are many members in my body, there is only one circulation of blood. My hand cannot say that my blood serves only it, nor can my foot make this claim. Every member is connected with the other members in my body through the circulation of blood. Every member renders a supply to the other members and receives a supply from the other members. We depend completely on the authority and fellowship of the members of our body. If there is a problem with either line, our body will be sick.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISRAELITES HAVING AUTHORITY AND FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>When the Old Testament refers to the building up of God&rsquo;s people, from the time of the building of the tabernacle until the end of the book of Malachi, it reveals that God regarded the Israelites as one entity, in which there was a line of authority and a line of fellowship.</p>
<p>As soon as the children of Israel were formed into a nation at the foot of Mount Sinai and began to participate in God&rsquo;s building, there were two lines among them: one line, involving Moses, was the line of authority, and the other line, involving Aaron, was the line of the priests. Every time Moses stood up, he represented authority, and every time Aaron appeared, he represented fellowship. In the line of Moses, there were elders, leaders of the tribes, leaders of families, leaders of thousands, and leaders of hundreds, and among these there was an order of authority (Exo. 18:25-26). In the line of Aaron, there were the high priest, the priests, and the Levites, who represented fellowship with God.</p>
<p>The duty of the priests was to go into the Holy of Holies and fellowship with God. This was especially true related to the high priest. When he went into the Holy of Holies to fellowship with God, he bore the names of the twelve tribes of Israel on his breastplate; this means that he brought all the people of Israel before God so that the Israelites could fellowship with God (28:29-30). On his breastplate there were precious stones inscribed with the names of the twelve tribes of Israel. He wore the breastplate in order to understand God&rsquo;s heart&rsquo;s desire and to bring God&rsquo;s fellowship to His people. Thus, the high priest received and relayed God&rsquo;s intention to God&rsquo;s people. On one hand, he brought God&rsquo;s people into fellowship with God, and on the other hand, he enabled God&rsquo;s people to understand God&rsquo;s intention. As a result, God&rsquo;s people were in one accord.</p>
<p>Before the priest relayed God&rsquo;s desire to His people, the twelve tribes of Israel could have had twelve different opinions. With regard to a particular matter, the tribe of Judah could have proposed one way, whereas the tribe of Benjamin could have proposed another way. The tribe of Dan could have suggested one thing, whereas the tribe of Naphtali could have suggested another. It could have been that every tribe had its own opinion so that it was not possible for them to be one. However, when the high priest brought the names of the twelve tribes before God on his breastplate and fellowshipped with God, he received God&rsquo;s desire. When he came out from God&rsquo;s presence and brought God&rsquo;s fellowship to the twelve tribes, there was only one opinion, one view, and one feeling among the twelve tribes. They were in one accord, and this one accord was based on God&rsquo;s fellowship.</p>
<p>The two lines among the Israelites&mdash;authority and fellowship&mdash;complemented each other. If authority had been exercised without fellowship, the children of Israel would have merely reflected a human arrangement. If fellowship had been practiced without authority, the children of Israel would not have been able to carry out the fellowship. If Moses and those under him&mdash;elders, leaders of the tribes, leaders of the families, leaders of thousands, and leaders of hundreds&mdash;only exercised authority, the children of Israel would have been in a human arrangement under man&rsquo;s rule. However, Moses&rsquo; authority was always carried out in coordination with fellowship. Hence, the line of authority was not according to human arrangement or man&rsquo;s rule. Furthermore, God&rsquo;s fellowship was coordinated with God&rsquo;s authority so that there was no confusion. When the high priest touched the desire of God&rsquo;s heart in fellowship, this fellowship was carried out by God&rsquo;s authority. Authority needs to be coordinated with fellowship, and fellowship needs authority in order to be carried out. Among the Israelites, these two lines were always coordinated. They were like two cords that were entwined as one. The situation of the Israelites corresponds exactly to that of a physical body, in which there is authority, order, and the circulation of blood. Authority keeps order among God&rsquo;s people, and fellowship produces a flow among God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>When Moses died, Joshua was raised up as God&rsquo;s authority, and Eleazar, the high priest, coordinated with him (Josh. 14:1; 19:51). Then during the time of the judges, the judges continued the line of authority from Joshua, and there were priests who coordinated with the judges. At the time of the judges, the two lines were coordinated, even though the priesthood was more prominent.</p>
<p>In the age of the kings, David, Solomon, and the kings who followed them were in the line of authority. However, even during this time, David never neglected the line of the priests. As soon as David began to reign, he arranged the divisions of the priests for their service in order to recover the priesthood. Solomon also appointed the divisions of the priests for their service (2 Chron. 8:14). From the time of David onward, the priests and kings coordinated together. Before the children of Israel became desolate through captivity, these two lines existed continually. After returning from their captivity, the Israelites recovered both of these lines through Zerubbabel the governor and Joshua the high priest. Zerubbabel was in the line of authority, and Joshua the high priest was in the line of fellowship (Hag. 1:12, 14; 2:4). From this point forward, there was the coordination of authority and fellowship until the end of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>The entire record of the Old Testament shows that the children of Israel were coordinated like a body. In this body there were two systems: one related to authority and order and the other related to fellowship and flow. Whenever the two systems were working together properly, there was the building of God among them. When the tabernacle was being built, Moses, who represented authority, was properly coordinated with Aaron, who represented fellowship. When the temple was built, David and Solomon, who represented authority, were properly coordinated with the recovered priesthood. When the temple was rebuilt, Zerubbabel the governor, who represented authority, was properly coordinated with Joshua the high priest, who represented fellowship.</p>
<p>We must have such a clear view. God&rsquo;s building depends upon His people being blended, and the blending of the people is maintained by the lines of authority and fellowship. Without the two lines of authority and fellowship, the people of Israel would not have been able to be blended. The children of Israel could act as one man and maintain their oneness because of these two lines. There must be fellowship related to the priesthood and authority related to the kingship in order for God&rsquo;s people to be blended as one for the accomplishing of God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>If we consider the history of the children of Israel further, we will realize that every instance of desolation began with the priests. This indicates that desolation is a result of the loss of fellowship; that is, it is a problem related to fellowship. When the tabernacle was built, there was a positive situation because of the coordination of authority and fellowship. Gradually, however, problems arose among the priests. In the book of Judges, the priesthood was nearly nonexistent. There was even an incident where a Levite was hired as a &ldquo;family priest&rdquo; (17:7-13). Once there is a problem with the priesthood, the kingship will be affected and cease to function properly. Whenever there is a problem with fellowship, there will also be a problem with authority. Hence, in the book of Judges, the authority with the judges was mostly improper, and the priesthood continued to deteriorate. This was particularly obvious in the case of Eli, who represented the fellowship in the priesthood. When there was a problem with Eli, there was also a problem with the tabernacle, which had been built out of the coordination of authority and fellowship. In the time of Eli, the Ark was taken from the tabernacle. The tabernacle became empty, and the Ark was without a covering; the two were separated (1 Sam. 4:3-18). At this time, the Israelites fell completely into a situation of desolation.</p>
<p>When David and Solomon were raised up by God, the people of Israel were revived. As soon as David was raised up, he understood God&rsquo;s desire and restored the priesthood. Although David was a king, he paid close attention to the recovery of the priesthood. He arranged the divisions of the priests and strengthened their service, to the extent that he even put on the priestly garment, the ephod (2 Sam. 6:14). In this regard, David is a type of the Lord Jesus, who joined the priesthood with the kingship.</p>
<p>Through proper fellowship and in coordination with the proper authority, the holy temple was built. The Israelites were completely revived, and the glory of God was manifested among them. Nevertheless, history often repeats itself. Eventually, there was a problem in regard to the priesthood. During the age of the kings, the function of the priests was not always manifested. As a result, the doors of the temple would be closed, and no offerings would be made upon the altar. However, whenever a king was revived, he would open the doors of the temple and call the priests back to resume their service. He also would ask them to read the books of the law. In this way, God&rsquo;s people were brought back into fellowship with God, and God&rsquo;s fellowship was brought to His people. In the books of 1 and 2 Kings and 1 and 2 Chronicles, many kings were not proper before God, because they lost the coordination of fellowship in the priesthood. However, whenever a king was revived, there was a recovery of the priestly fellowship.</p>
<p>This situation continued until the temple in Jerusalem was torn down, and the people of Israel were taken into captivity. This was a second occurrence of desolation. After seventy years elapsed, they were revived again through the coordination of the priestly fellowship and authority. Through this coordination the holy temple was recovered and built up again.</p>
<p>According to the history in the Old Testament, the Israelites had three great revivals. The first revival involved their coming out of Egypt. Then through the coordination of fellowship and authority, they built God&rsquo;s tabernacle at the foot of Mount Sinai. The second revival took place with the rising up of the kings, such as David and Solomon, who built the temple through coordination with the priests. The third revival occurred when the children of Israel returned from the land of captivity. At this time, the temple was rebuilt through the coordination of Joshua the high priest and Zerubbabel the governor. Then, under the leadership of Ezra the priest and Nehemiah the governor, more Israelites returned, and the city of Jerusalem was rebuilt. This record shows that every time the people of Israel were revived, there was building through the coordination of fellowship and authority. Whenever there was a coordination of fellowship and authority, God&rsquo;s people were in a normal condition. However, whenever there was a loss of fellowship, there was desolation. With the loss of fellowship, the exercise of authority lacked balance, and their condition became abnormal.</p>
<p>Consequently, the recovery of a proper condition among the Israelites depended upon the coordination between fellowship, represented by the priesthood, and authority, represented by the kingship. When Joshua the high priest and Zerubbabel the governor returned to Jerusalem and began to rebuild the holy temple, the first thing that they restored was the altar. Later, under the leadership of Ezra the priest, the book of the law was restored. Through the priesthood, God&rsquo;s people were brought into fellowship with God, and God&rsquo;s fellowship was brought to His people. This enabled Nehemiah to continue to restore Jerusalem, the holy city. The city represented the matter of authority, and Nehemiah, who was the governor, represented the line of authority. Joshua and Ezra represented the line of the priesthood, which restored fellowship with God. Zerubbabel and Nehemiah represented the line of authority, which restored matters such as administration, authority, and order. At this time, both the holy temple and the holy city were recovered, and God&rsquo;s people were brought back to a normal condition and formed into one entity.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
