<h2 class="head1">THE MATTER OF THE ELDERS&rsquo; CHILDREN<br />
BELIEVING IN THE LORD</h2>
<p><em>Question:</em> The Bible indicates that the children of the elders should believe in the Lord. Among us there are a few elders in the church whose children have not yet believed in the Lord. Their children, however, are only in their teens and are not that old. They come to hear the gospel, but they have not yet been saved. What do you think about this?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> I think that your question on the matter of requiring children to believe in the Lord refers to the elders&rsquo; ability to manage their household. This is the point of emphasis. Therefore, if the children are very young, this does not apply. If a child is very disobedient and rebels against believing, this is a clear indication that the brother has no way to take care of the church. Perhaps he is able to be an apostle, but he does not know how to be an elder. If the young children are not that rebellious or negative and are able to come along with you to listen to the messages, then there is no problem. Of course, when they are young in age, it is impossible to know whether they have genuinely believed. But when they reach a certain age, they should be asked to receive the Lord. I think that the point of emphasis is still on managing one&rsquo;s own household. Therefore, the brother whom you referred to may still be an elder.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEETING BECOMING TOO LARGE<br />
AND THE ORIGINAL RESPONSIBLE BROTHERS<br />
NOT BEING ABLE TO BEAR RESPONSIBILITY</h2>
<p><em>Question:</em> In the past when various localities began to have meetings, the leading brothers there seemed to be able to bear the responsibility. Later, when the number of saints increased, the responsible brothers did not seem to be able to bear the responsibility as before due to their spiritual condition. What should these responsible brothers do?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> In a certain place there may be a group of saints beginning to meet, with some learning to bear the responsibility. According to God&rsquo;s arrangement in the church, when some better ones are brought in, the responsible brothers in that place should be able to allow the better ones to bear the responsibility. The responsible brothers should then listen to these brothers. I hope that we can reach this stage.</p>
<p>Paul said, &ldquo;We do not have such a custom of being so, neither the churches of God.&rdquo; We do not like to have traditions, but we like to have customs. If one church does things in a certain way, spontaneously other churches will follow. This is a most beautiful thing. Formerly, you were bearing responsibility in a certain locality. Now other brothers have moved to your place. It would be a wonderful thing if you were able to step aside. You may say, &ldquo;Brother! Come and do it. I will submit to you.&rdquo; This is not being passive. Many people, as soon as they stop bearing responsibility, behave like outsiders and do not care for anything anymore. You should say, &ldquo;I am willing to help you. You bear the responsibility. You are the one taking the lead.&rdquo; If every church would practice this, such a custom could be established among the churches. When younger brothers encounter those who are more advanced in the Lord than themselves, they should be able to ask them to step forward. The children of God need to learn to recognize those who have higher authority when they meet them. It is not proper to have a confusing situation.</p>
<p>When several brothers go out together or talk together in a room, spontaneously someone will take the lead, and some others will follow. God keeps the order in every matter, whether great or small. God is a God of order. We should also learn to have everything in order, even more so regarding the things of the church. If a brother who bears responsibility knows spontaneously that another brother who has just come in is ahead of him in the Lord, he should lead him to become acquainted with the brothers and gradually withdraw. If he does not recognize that brother, there could be a big problem. If such a custom of order could be established in every locality, it would be a beautiful thing. This is the church of God. Those who have God&rsquo;s authority should always be in the forefront.</p>
 <p><em>Question:</em> What can we do if he does not see?</p>
<p><em>Answer:</em> I think that sometimes the brothers who are workers traveling through such places should bear more responsibility in such matters. When a brother who is a worker travels through such a place, he should be the one to make a decision according to the situation in that locality. The apostles should look into it and determine who should or should not bear responsibility. It is clear in 3 John that there was a person who had a view different from that of the apostle John. John has one view, and he has another. &ldquo;Diotrephes, who loves to be first among them, does not receive us&rdquo; (v. 9). The local brothers were not clear concerning Diotrephes, and thought that he was indeed a person of authority. He loved &ldquo;to be first among them.&rdquo; He was not willing to receive people, nor was he willing for others to do so. Therefore, John said, &ldquo;If I come, I will bring to remembrance his works which he does&rdquo; (v. 10). Hence, strictly speaking, the responsible ones in all the places should be considered by the workers who are reliable in the Lord. The latter should determine who may or may not bear responsibility in a locality.</p>
<p>If we can train the brothers and sisters in various localities with a basic education of knowing authority, it will be easy for them to submit when they go to other places to raise up meetings. The problem today is that the basic training is not sufficient; therefore, this kind of situation exists. Once the basic training is sufficient, the problem will be greatly reduced.</p>
