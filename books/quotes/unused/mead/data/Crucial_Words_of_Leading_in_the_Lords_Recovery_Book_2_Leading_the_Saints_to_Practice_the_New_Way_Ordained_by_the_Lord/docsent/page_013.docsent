   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NEEDING TO ADVANCE AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ABOUND IN THE KNOWLEDGE OF THE TRUTH First Having the Knowledge</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of the Truth Themselves</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The elders need to advance and abound in the knowledge of the truth 1 Tim 5:17b .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we want to pursue the truth today, the simple way is to properly study the Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many have dropped their jobs, forsaken the world, and joined the full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the training, during a twenty-four hour day, apart from eating, resting, and sleeping, the trainees spend all their time pursuing the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although there are teachers in the training center who teach courses, they cannot read the Life-studies for the trainees; the trainees must study and enter into the Life-studies for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let me use myself as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I did not graduate from a university or receive any kind of diploma, but, may the Lord s blood cover me, I have been able to take charge of the translation work of the Recovery Version of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At times I found that a word was not according to the original language, and my helpers would then verify whether it was so.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In such cases they would find that it was truly so.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I came to know all these things because I have many dictionaries from which I have learned many things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It can be said that I have acquired much knowledge without being taught.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today all the full-time trainees have the best opportunity in the training.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a twenty-four hour day, other than doing some community work in the evening, they can take advantage of the rest of their time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If they can read six hours a day, they can read through the Life-studies in a little more than a year.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is real pursuing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Through the literature work in the Western world, not including the Far East, over six hundred churches have been raised up in the past twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These approximately six hundred churches were first established in North America, then in Mexico, Central America, South America, Africa, Europe, Australia, and New Zealand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I have never been to some of these places, and others I have visited only once; nevertheless, these churches have been raised up mainly through the literature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The literature work began in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>At that time my family lived in a Japanese-style flat that was less than 300 square feet: the front section was about 150 square feet and the rear section was about 100 square feet, and the corridor was another 40 square feet.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I asked someone to build a small kitchen and bathroom in the backyard using wooden boards.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was in this kind of environment that I began the literature work.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I began by working on the sixty topics of Crucial Truths in the Holy Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today the scale of the literature work is quite large.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There are two stations in the United States: one in Anaheim, California, and the other in Irving, Texas.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Books are currently published in over ten languages, including French, German, Japanese, Korean, Spanish, and Portuguese.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These books are distributed to the six continents, supplying over one thousand churches.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 1973, because of the increasing number of attendants at the conferences held in Los Angeles, at times exceeding three thousand, we decided to begin to have trainings in 1974.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone who registers for the training is required to give a donation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This serves the purpose of providing a better estimation of our budget for the arrangement of various aspects of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Concerning this point, I learned the lesson from Brother Nee s practice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At the beginning, when he published The Present Testimony, he did it by faith; that is, the number of issues he published depended on the offerings he received.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If there were not many offerings, he would wait.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, sometimes nothing was put out for two years, and at other times two issues were put out in a single year.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the offerings came, he would put out an issue, and when the offerings did not come, he waited.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This made it difficult to work and to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For instance, if persons are hired for the publication work, but later no offering comes, do those who are hired stay or leave?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a problem in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, when he published The Christian, Brother Nee had the subscribers pay a dollar per year, which was to be used by the work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our trainings are carried out according to this same principle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a little fellowship related to the spread of the literature work.</S>
