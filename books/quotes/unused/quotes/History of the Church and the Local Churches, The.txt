In this book we want to see how the Lord has moved in the past among His children for the accomplishment of His purpose
We want to see the history of the church in a general way, and then we want to see the history of the local churches beginning from 1922
The enemy Satan has used three main items to damage the church: Jewish religion, Greek philosophy, and human organization
We can see an instance of this in the second century with a strong leader and defender of the church named Ignatius
The term elder denotes a person of maturity, while the term bishop, or overseer, denotes the responsibility and function of an elder
In the early days of the church, some great teachers stood up to defend the truth that Christ is both God and man
When this philosophy became mingled with Christian teachings it became known as Gnosticism which taught that all matter is essentially evil
Those who held to the teaching of Gnosticism could not believe that Christ could have had the defilement of human flesh
The Nicene Creed stresses that God is triune, that the Godhead has three persons the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
As we have seen, due to the defending of the truth, different opinions were brought in among the so-called Christians
Eventually, western Christianity became the Roman Catholic Church, and eastern Christianity became the Greek Orthodox Church
Because many free groups were breaking off from the general church, some designated the general church as the Catholic Church
Small free groups were formed because some Christians saw that the so-called general church had become worldly
They attempted to stay in the general church, but eventually they saw that there was no way to help it, so they began to meet by themselves
Within a short time after the completion of the divine revelation, the church fell into degradation, so there was the need of a recovery
The Lord's recovery took a definite form with Martin Luther's stand for the truth concerning justification by faith
The king of Denmark is the head of the Lutheran state church of Denmark, and the king of Sweden is the head of the Church of Sweden today
By the Lord's mercy, the vision of the church, the revelation concerning God's corporate goal, is so clear today
According to my knowledge, Brother Nee did not make mistakes because he was so clear about God's corporate goal the church
If we have really seen the vision of the church and that God only cares for the church, we will never be divided by any doctrine
After the reformation with Martin Luther stressing justification by faith, the state churches eventually became empty and dead
The reaction to the deadness of the reformed churches was among the mystics who were still in the Catholic Church
These saints, who were known as the mystics, were the start of the recovery of the living reality of the inner life
The mystics, whom the Lord used for the recovery of the inner life, also made some mistakes because they did not see the Body, the church
We need to be impressed deeply that the safeguard of our whole Christian walk and the balance of our Christian life is the church
For one to place bishops above elders indicates that he has not seen that the church is a living Body, an organism
Just as the life within our physical body takes care of sicknesses, the life within the Body of Christ can take care of any problem
Because the defenders of the truth in the past lacked the proper knowledge of the church, they made mistakes that damaged the church
May the Lord be merciful to us that we may see that opinions, organization, rank, and different teachings damage the church life
In Matthew 20 and 23, the Lord Jesus told us clearly that among His disciples there should not be any kind of human rule or human position
They have to be the examples, taking the lead to follow the Lord's way, and they should not exercise any lordship over the church
They should be examples, taking the lead to serve and care for the church so that the believers may follow in the same way
Perhaps some in the church would go astray or would bring in sinful, worldly things that would insult the Lord
They are only the examples, taking the lead to follow the Lord's way, and the saints should follow their example
In Matthew 23:9-10 the Lord said, 'And do not call anyone your father on the earth; for One is your Father, He who is in the heavens
Based upon these two portions of the Word, there is no ground for any kind of hierarchy or clergy in the church
Ephesians 2:15 tells us that on the cross Christ abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances to create the one new man
Christ has abolished all the ordinances, including circumcision, the keeping of Sabbaths, and the dietary regulations of the Old Testament
Any teaching, even scriptural, that distracts us from Christ and the church is a wind that carries us away from God's central purpose
Galatians 1:13 reveals that when Paul was in religion he persecuted the church of God excessively and ravaged it
Paul was so zealous in religion, but it pleased God to reveal Christ in this one who was so advanced in religion
Paul told us that all these religious factors which had been a gain to him were counted a loss by him on account of Christ
Everything, including worldly things, fleshly things, and religious things, was counted as dung by the apostle Paul
In Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily , and all the treasures of wisdom and knowledge are hidden in Him
Philosophy here refers to the teaching of Gnosticism, a mixture of Jewish, Oriental, and Greek philosophies, which is an empty deceit
We should not receive or walk according to any worldly philosophy, worldly teaching, or any kind of worldly natural thought
We have to walk in Him and according to Him because all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily, and we have been made full in Him
In this new man there cannot be Greek and Jew circumcision and uncircumcision barbarian Scythian slave freeman but Christ is all and in all
What we do may be quite good, fundamental, and scriptural, but if what we do is without Christ as the life-giving Spirit, that is religion
Philosophy refers to the human thought, the human concept, and the human understanding which is embodied in the human opinion
Something may appear to be a scriptural doctrine when actually it is the expression of a person's thought, opinion, or Christian philosophy
We need to realize that our mentality is the ground where the tree of knowledge grows to produce all kinds of fruit of knowledge
The dividing teachings are organized and systematized by Satan to cause serious error and thus damage the practical oneness of the Body life
In the church there should be no religion no philosophy no vain doctrines or teachings and no hierarchy clergy rank positions or titles
They loved the Lord, loved the Bible, and stood for the Lord according to what they had seen, but nearly all of them made some mistakes
Some of the faithful saints did not agree with this, and they fought against the worldliness in the Catholic Church
In a sense, that was good, but in another sense, they made a mistake in that they became a mere free group of unworldly Christians
There are many Christians today who are acting in the same principle of caring for other things besides God's goal
They declared that the church should be under the authority of the Holy Spirit, and they fought against human rule in the church
Eventually, these kinds of free groups gave up the Catholic Church, the general church, and began to meet by themselves
They left the Catholic Church for different reasons and they stressed different points, and sadly they began to exclude one another
One story speaks of all the theaters in Wales being closed and of no one going to any worldly entertainment on Sunday
It was only a revival; not much was accomplished for the fulfilling of God's eternal purpose, that is, the building up of the Body of Christ
Revivals are very positive for bringing people to salvation, but there is not much result for the fulfilling of God's eternal purpose
In order for us to be safeguarded from making any mistakes in defending something of God's interest, we need to see the church
They are members of the Body in actuality, but according to their outward appearance they do not express much of Christ
In order to practice the proper church life, we have to be in the Spirit, be strong in the Spirit, and be rich in the Spirit
The elders should not regulate the church outwardly, but they need to get themselves sevenfold intensified with the Spirit
The church life will be full of liberty, yet there will be the demanding from the inner life and the inner control of the Holy Spirit
When some come in among us, they will either be convinced, subdued, captured, and wrecked, or they will stay away
My burden is that we would pick up some lessons so that we would learn not to repeat the mistakes of this sad history
We do not care for religion philosophy vain teachings natural opinions human authority human organization rank position hierarchy or clergy
Although we do not agree with any of these negative things, we would not use any rules to regulate or to demand in an outward way
We will have something living and burning with the impact, with the power, and with the way to minister the riches of Christ to people
We believe that the power, the reality, the weight, and the impact of Christ as the life-giving Spirit is with the church
We have to be on guard against these things creeping into the church because they damage the church to the uttermost
Even though there have been thousands and thousands of real believers, there has been a shortage of the proper church life
The Lord used him to recover the truth concerning justification by faith and to make the Bible open to the general public
At the cost of his life, Luther stood for this truth, but when he came to the truth concerning the church, he was weak
In the seventeenth century, the Lord raised up a group of saints as a reaction to the deadness and emptiness of the reformed churches
These mystics such as Madame Guyon Father Fenelon and Brother Lawrence were used by the Lord to recover the experiences of the inner life
These saints, who still remained with the Roman Catholic Church, began to realize that life is God Himself in His Son by His Spirit
Although these saints knew something concerning Christ as the inner life, there was no practical church life with them
The Bible churches do not belong to the Roman Catholic Church the Greek Orthodox Church the state churches or to any private denominations
They could not express this inward desire, but actually there was something in them seeking or hunting the proper church life
These Moravian brethren suffered the persecution not only of the Roman Catholic Church but also of the state churches
They were persecuted because they stood for the truth, and they fled to Zinzendorf's estate in Saxony for refuge
Because of Count Zinzendorf's love for the Lord, he received many of these seekers who came from different backgrounds
They signed an agreement to keep the unity among them and to lay aside their differences in doctrine and in their religious backgrounds
He said that if it were not for his burden for England, he would have stayed with the Moravian brethren for his entire life
In the nineteenth century, from 1825 to 1828, the Lord raised up the so-called Brethren under the leadership of John Nelson Darby
Darby was strong concerning pre-tribulation rapture, whereas Newton was strong concerning post-tribulation rapture
He was so much with the Lord, but there was a big discrepancy between his understanding and Darby's realization
By this time there were three main groups among the Brethren Benjamin Newton's group, the closed Brethren, and the open Brethren
Within ninety years after the formation of the Brethren in 1828, they were divided into over one hundred divisions
Pember, and Paul Rader believed in the rapture of the overcomers, which is called the partial rapture, or the mid-tribulation rapture
Nearly ninety percent of what he wrote in his reference Bible and his Bible correspondence course was adopted from Brethren teaching
Moody said that if all the books in the entire world were to be burned, he would be satisfied to have a copy of the Bible and a copy of C
In a sense, the Brethren teaching helped the so-called church, but in another sense, these teachings issued in divisions
One hundred years after the beginning of the Brethren movement, the Lord started something new in mainland China
He was a person who knew the Bible, who knew life, who knew the Lord, who knew the church, and who knew the history of the church
We collected many good things that the Lord had recovered through all the saints, and we put them together in our church life
When her ship reached Marseilles, France, she went to the captain and told him that she had to go back to China to preach Christ
In 1920 she was invited to Brother Nee's hometown, Foochow, which is close to the province of Kwantung, near Hong Kong
Before being saved, his mother was very fond of playing mah-jong, a game of chance played by many of the Chinese
After their mother was saved in that gospel meeting, she came home and made a thorough confession to the whole family
That night, according to his testimony, he saw the Lord Jesus on the cross, and through that he was called by the Lord
After being called by the Lord, the Lord began to prepare him and use him in a marvelous way for His intention
When she was young, around thirty years old, she was sent by a Methodist mission to Brother Nee's province in China
She was a person who knew the Lord in a living way, and she was always exercising to learn the lessons of the cross
He said to Miss Barber, 'I know you are learning the lessons of the cross and that you would not say anything for yourself
Brother Panton came to know the evils of denominationalism, and he met with a group of others outside of the denominations
After much prayer, she became clear that the Lord would send her back to China according to His leading and not through any mission
She went back on her own to work for the Lord, and she selected a very small town just outside of Brother Nee's hometown, Foochow
Initially, Brother Nee was among a group of young brothers and sisters who had just been saved and went to contact Miss Barber
He said to me, 'Brother Lee, if Miss Barber were still living, we would be much better than what we are today'
Of course, she did not have many personal things, but she willed Brother Nee her Bible with all her notes in it
According to what Brother Nee told me, Sister Barber was a person who always lived in the presence of the Lord
When they turned the corner to another street she said to Brother Nee, 'Maybe as we turn this corner, we will meet Him'
Brother Nee would tell people that it was through a sister that he got saved, and it was also through a sister that he was edified
As a British person from the Western world, Sister Barber came to know the famous spiritual giants in Christianity at her time
The best publications on the exposition of the Bible and church history were introduced to Brother Nee through her
Nee was a marvelous reader and an excellent discerner and selector of the things of Christ for the Christian life and the church life
Brother Weigh was a classmate of Brother Nee's, he was saved through Brother Nee, and he was also a co-worker with Brother Nee
We want to fellowship concerning the sufferings of Brother Nee the attacks and the persecution he suffered throughout his ministry
Their concept was that they believed in the Lord Jesus, and they would do their best until the day they would see Him
In a sense, they realized that they were children of God, but if you checked with them, they would not say that they were saved
He was so clear about the assurance of salvation, and this was the first thing which he saw from the Lord and ministered to the believers
We would ask people to read a verse like John 3:16 until they realized that they were assured of their salvation
Christians have denominated themselves with many different names such as Lutheran, Wesleyan, Anglican, Presbyterian, Baptist, etc
In the Roman Catholic Church, there are the priests, the bishops, the archbishops, the cardinals, and the pope
In the Protestant churches, there are the pastors, and in the state churches there are the bishops and the heads of state
Denominationalism cuts the Body into pieces, and the clergy-laity system kills the functions of the members of the Body
We spent much time to teach the believers that all of them were priests and that they could function in a priestly service to the Lord
The church does not need any organization or any kind of human government or rule, but the church does need a proper presbytery
Every local church needs a group of experienced brothers to be the leading ones the overseers taking the oversight of the churchs activity
The Lord showed Brother Nee the real meaning of head covering and the real practice of laying hands on the saints
We learned to serve the Lord in the way of not being hired by anyone, that is, by any mission, organization, or so-called church
Through Brother Nee's experience, we were brought into a realization of the proper divine healing that builds up the inner life
The divine healing which Brother Nee saw and experienced was not just an outward gift, but a healing that resulted in inward building up
The Lord showed Brother Nee so much concerning the all-inclusive death of Christ in both its objective and subjective aspects
He also showed Brother Nee much truth concerning the resurrection, the ascension, and the second coming of Christ
They pointed out what the Lord said in Matthew 23 concerning the temple sanctifying the gold and the altar sanctifying the gift
Through Brother Nee's ministry, we were brought into the vision and experience of the inner life in a rich way
The mystics in the seventeenth century saw something concerning the inner life, but they did not see as much as the Lord has shown us today
In the general teaching of today's fundamental theology, people are told that the entire church will be raptured before the tribulation
He saw God's divine purpose and that there is the need of spiritual warfare for the accomplishment of God's divine purpose in this universe
Brother Nee called a conference in 1928 in Shanghai and gave a number of messages concerning spiritual warfare
Brother Nee called a conference in Shanghai in January of 1934 to speak concerning the centrality and universality of Christ
These were marvelous messages showing us that Christ is the center and the circumference of the entire universe for God's eternal purpose
In January of 1934, he gave four main messages on this truth, and these were published in the same year in a book entitled The Meeting Life
At the beginning of 1937, Brother Nee began to see not only the boundary of a local church but also the ground of a local church
According to his study and research of the New Testament, he found out that one city should have only one church
The Chinese edition was entitled Rethinking Our Missions, and the English edition was entitled Concerning Our Missions
Many of us retreated to the interior of China, and we assembled at Hankow where Brother Nee gave all the messages again to a greater number
After seeing the ground of the church, Brother Nee became clear concerning the practicality of the church life
We enjoyed such a revival through the practice of the church life according to the blueprint Brother Nee had received from the Lord
He gave message after message and conference after conference, always stressing this one thing seeing the Body
He would ask if we had seen the Body, and then he would ask some to give a testimony of what they had supposedly seen
He would point out what they said to prove that they had not seen the Body and that the Body was merely a theory or a doctrine to them
He went on to say that it is not so easy to have our spirit released as long as we are still living in the natural life
He said, 'You may be a good speaker who can give many messages on building up, but with whom have you ever been built up'?
After the war, every time Brother Nee spoke, he was always either on the breaking of the outer man or on the building up
In 1970 we saw the revelation of Christ versus religion in an international conference in Los Angeles, California
Not more than ten of them began to meet in a sister's home, but after two years, something very negative happened
He advised this brother to be formally ordained so that he could be invited by all the so-called Christian churches
When Brother Nee found out about this, he gave a message in one of the meetings on the history of the ark in the Old Testament
Brother Nee applied this by saying that God does not care for outward things such as being formally ordained to be a so-called minister
He told them, however, that he felt deeply that he had to learn the lesson of the cross, so he decided to leave
At the end of 1926, he was led by the Lord to go to Shanghai and Nanking, the capital of China at that time, to start a work
Eventually, the church in Shanghai became the biggest church, the leading church, and the central church in China
Within about one year, over forty local churches were raised up in Inner Mongolia through seventy who migrated there from Chefoo
The Present Testimony contained articles concerning the principles of the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ
Through those messages on the seven epistles, the fallen situation of Christianity was exposed, and the proper church life was revealed
He shared that the land which appeared on the third day out of the waters was a picture of Christ coming out of death
During the years 1925 through 1927, Brother Nee read some of the writings of the British Brethren, the closed Brethren
The strictest group was under the leadership of Benjamin Newton, who disagreed with Darby concerning the rapture of the saints
Brother Nee picked up all the good points from different kinds of Christian practices and put them together in the church life
Of coming to us as simple believers according to their agreement, they brought the so-called Brethren practice with them
James Taylor wrote many letters, and there is a record of his correspondence with Brother Nee during this time
The Brethren promised him that if he would take their way, they would buy him some land to build a big hall in Shanghai
In October of 1934, he held a conference in Hangchow, a city beside the West Lake, and he spoke on God's overcomers
He had a conference there that brought in a deeper revival among us by speaking concerning Christ as the overcoming life
In 1937 Brother Nee began to see that the co-workers needed to travel from one city to another to establish local churches
From that time in August 1939 through September 1942, Brother Nee had a conference in Shanghai nearly every month
Those who were there were fully convinced that although they had the term the Body, they really had not seen it
Many people may use the term the Body, and they may like to talk about Body ministry, but they really have not seen what the Body is
Most of these writings on spiritual warfare were translated by Brother Nee and put into his three-volume book The Spiritual Man
From 1940 through 1942, he saw the Body and realized that spiritual warfare is not an individual matter but a Body matter
The Lord eventually granted a big revival among us, and Brother Nee's ministry was recovered through that revival
During the time when his ministry was stopped, Brother Nee took the opportunity to buy many houses on a small mountain close to his hometown
After that training, these eighty to one hundred saints came down from the mountain and were scattered throughout China
As a rule, the Communists would give people two years of freedom after they took over a place, and they did the same thing with Brother Nee
In those two years he did his best to publish as many books as possible because he anticipated that he would be arrested and put into prison
In 1956 he was sentenced to fifteen years imprisonment, but from that day he remained in prison until he died in 1972
We thank the Lord that through Brother Nee's sufferings, we received the help the edification and the building up
After we received his cable to come to that conference, we got on a train that took thirty-six hours to reach Shanghai
She told my wife that while she was at home, there was something in her heart which caused her to have no rest
It was very hard to live by faith in God, without being hired by anyone, in the financial situation of China in those days
Also, before he went to conference meetings, there were many times that he had to lay on the bed until the time came for him to speak
In addition to his poverty and bad health, Brother Nee also suffered all kinds of persecution from Christianity
Especially in those days, we were reminded of Hebrews 13:13: 'Let us therefore go forth unto Him outside the camp, bearing His reproach'
In the twenty-four issues of his magazine The Christian, published in 1925 and 1926, Brother Nee 'demolished' all of fallen Christianity
The missionaries thought they had sacrificed their country, their homes, and so much for the Lord Jesus to go to a pagan country like China
The Presbyterian missionaries built up the Presbyterian church, the Baptist missionaries built up the Baptist church, etc
By ministering the truth of the Word, he demolished the divisive standing of the denominational churches built up by the missionaries
He declared that the denominational churches were wrong and that there should only be the church in a locality
He said that all the divisive names should be put aside, and that we should simply meet as the church, exalting only the name of Christ
He helped us to realize that when we minister a teaching, that teaching must be full of reality according to our experiences
Although there was so much opposition to Brother Nee within Christianity, there was also some vindication from the Lord
He told Brother Nee that what the Lord had commissioned him to do in China was according to Hudson Taylor's burden
From 1927 when Brother Nee established the church in Shanghai until the day he died, he was only invited to speak to a denomination once
He presented his ministry to Christianity, but in return he received despising, criticizing, opposing, attacking, and rumors
He was working in the city of Hangchow, which is very close to Shanghai, when he received a letter telling him that he was excommunicated
Most of the brothers and sisters there were students saved through him, and they were furious about what had happened
When he arrived, they told him that he should not stand for this excommunication and that he had to do something
He was seasick from his journey, so he told them to come to his home that night to have fellowship about this matter
Before they came, he had received a word from the Lord telling him not to vindicate himself and to leave the city the next day
From the beginning of the church life in mainland China, there was a sister who was dissenting toward Brother Nee
She was a gifted sister who eventually became a traveling preacher and was considered very highly by Christianity
Following the six brothers who excommunicated Brother Nee, she was the major one who was always dissenting toward him
In January of 1934, while we were in the third Victory Conference in Shanghai, she was in the meetings in a dissenting way
He was bearing the responsibility with the brothers, but there was no comparison between him and all the other brothers
In the early days of the Lord's recovery in mainland China, Brother Watchman Nee was a unique, extraordinary person
Suppose that a brother who is thirty-four years old had to serve and bear responsibility with a brother who is only fifteen years old
One day a learned man was saved among us, and he desired to be baptized before he left China for the United States
Brother Nee was so clear about this newly saved one, and he agreed that this man should be baptized before he left China
Brother Nee said that if something was mistaken, he would be willing to bear all the responsibility before the Lord
Because Brother Nee insisted on doing everything in fellowship, he would not baptize this new one without the co-worker's agreement
At the beginning of the church life, he picked up the way to have our meetings mostly from the practice of the Brethren
The leading sisters agreed with Brother Nee, but most of the so-called leading ones believed that the sisters should not utter anything
Brother Nee fellowshipped with them that we should release the sisters in the meetings to pray, but nearly all the brothers said 'no'
From 1927 when this particular brother came into the church, he was always ambitious to be one of the elders, but he truly was not qualified
Eventually, in 1948 after he had been in the church life for twenty-one years, he left the church and caused a division
He started a meeting in his home and hired a traveling preacher, similar to what Micah did in Judges 17 in hiring someone to be his priest
Brother Nee always told people that the church is not an organization with position but an organism with living members
Anything that is positioned on a person's physical body, such as false teeth, is an inorganic item which is foreign to the body
Nearly all the famous preachers among the Chinese who were around my age passed through the Lord's recovery in China
At the beginning, nearly the whole church in Shanghai was fooled by this young brother, but gradually the 'fox tails' came out, one by one
In this meeting one of the co-workers announced something concerning this brother's falsehood, and many others also stood up to condemn him
They would say that the church was wrong in this certain doctrine, and because they were clear about this they had to leave
Brother Nee suffered not only the attacks from the outsiders but also the attacks and rebellion from those inside the church life
Brother Nee was forced to deal with this situation, and this brother had to be removed from the fellowship of the church
Brother Nee, however, was under the protection of the Lord, and this mail that was sent to him several times was never discovered
He was married to Sister Charity Chang, Brother Samuel Chang's sister, on October 19, 1934, the day after a ten-day conference
Brother Chang and his sisters lost their parents when they were young, and they were under the care of their aunt
Although the aunt would not agree with the marriage, her niece, Charity, was very much for Brother Nee, so they were married
In order to understand why this storm occurred, we need to know the background of the situation in China at that time
If there was the feeling for someone to go somewhere, they went by faith, without help from the work for their material supply
Two dollars from the offering box, ten dollars from a brother, and a money order for twenty dollars totaled exactly thirty-two dollars!
Brother Nee's second brother was an expert in pharmaceutical chemistry, and he began to produce some medicine in China
He went to the interior of China and carried on his pharmaceutical factory in Chungking, the capital of China during the war
There was a rumor that he was too occupied with his pharmaceutical business and did not have the time to minister
The church then decided to buy a big piece of land for a meeting hall that could seat three thousand inside and two thousand outside
The price of the land was about one hundred thousand dollars, and the price to build the meeting hall was about the same
During this time he would not minister because so many were rebellious toward him, but some of us had many times of fellowship with him
He did not have any children, and his wife went to the Lord about seven or eight months before he died in prison
In the previous two chapters, we saw the sufferings of Brother Nee and the spiritual lessons he learned through them
They despise, criticize, oppose, attack, and spread false rumors about those who follow the Lord in His recovery
Besides enduring such attacks from Christianity, we have seen that Brother Nee also suffered from certain ones among us
He also suffered from the brothers' stubbornness, their unwillingness to say 'amen' to his leading from the Lord
We have to learn, on the one hand, to suffer others' stubbornness, but on the other hand, to drop our stubbornness
We have also seen that Brother Nee suffered from others' ambition for position and from rebellion among the saints
If we have the revelation, God will put us into the furnace, the oven, so that we can pass through the sufferings
After he received the revelations of the Lord, the Lord put him into the oven, into the fire, to be burned, to suffer
It was miraculous for Balaam's donkey to speak a human language, but we should not be overly excited about something like that
He does not have mere teachings, knowledge, or gifts, but something of God in eternity has been wrought into his being
The vision he received was concerning Christ as the believers' life and everything for the building up of the church
We must come out of our private interests and come together with Christ as the reality to practice the church life
We can testify, even to God's enemy, that we are one and that we have not only the reality but also the practicality of the church
It presented the revelation of the person and work of Christ, the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the ascension of Christ
Many in Christianity accept Brother Nee's ministry on Christ, but they reject his ministry on the practicality of the church
When he went to visit the Brethren in 1933, he also went to visit Brother Austin-Sparks at Honor Oak in London
In our consideration we realized that we could neither follow the way of the Brethren nor follow the way of Brother Austin-Sparks
Later Brother Nee went to Europe again in 1938, and he stayed there for one and a half years to have more fellowship
These messages were collected and edited by Angus Kinnear, who was a medical student under Brother Nee's teaching
Of course, The Normal Christian Church Life is about the practicality of the church and the truth concerning one church in one city
He gave a short word saying that people's talking about the church is like carpenters' talking about making a chair
Regardless of how good, how spiritual, and how high one's ministry is, it still must be for the local churches
In 1938 and 1939, Brother Nee was fully accepted by the seeking Christians in northern Europe in his ministry on Christ as life
On the practicality of the church, the spiritual situation in that area did not allow him to fulfill his ministry completely
They saw something concerning the principle of the Body, but they did not see the practical side of the church life
Some of the leading ones in Taiwan received some letters from abroad encouraging them to invite Brother Austin-Sparks
We invited him to come a second time, but during his second visit he opposed the practicality of the church, the ground of the church
The second aspect was that because Witness Lee is so much for the practicality of the church life, he is different from Watchman Nee
In these messages Brother Nee confirmed that what he had seen in 1937 concerning the practicality of the church life was absolutely right
Because of Brother Austin-Sparks' dissenting speaking in the Far East, some young people were influenced and became rebellious
The battle is still raging today over the revelation and ministry of Brother Nee, which was concerning both Christ and the church
If people are fair, they should put out all the writings by Brother Nee and let the readers have their own discernment
We need to see where we are standing today and the real ministry which the Lord has given us through Brother Nee
Christ and the church this is our vision, this is what we are suffering for, and eventually this becomes our ministry
Some might expect Paul to say that Christ gave Himself for our sins so that we might be delivered from hell, but Paul did not say this
Satan has formed this anti-God world system to systematize men with religion, culture, education, industry, commerce, entertainment, etc
As long as we are kept away from the Body of Christ, we are kept away from the will of God and are systematized into Satan's system
Satan uses worldly entertainment, sinful things, and even religious things to systematize people away from God's will
In Paul's day, Satan used Judaism to systematize all the Pharisees, scribes, priests, and elders among the Jewish people
Today Satan uses the religion of Christianity to systematize many of the Lords people away from Gods will to have the organic Body of Christ
Today the real Christians and seekers of Christ have to be delivered out of the religious system of Christianity
The Nicolaitans must have been a group of people who esteemed themselves to be higher than the common believers
They formed a clergy to rule over and conquer the people with the excuse that the people were mere laymen who did not know the Bible
Many pastors are even designated with the title Reverend, to show that they are in this special class of clergy
They say that between the denominations and the local churches there is a gap, and they consider themselves as the bridge to bridge the gap
We have burned the bridges between us and Christianity, but some among us have tried to build a bridge to bring us back
Nee was persecuted and opposed because he came out of the present evil age to accomplish Gods will to have the organic Body of Christ
From that time until Brother Nee was caught by the Lord in 1920, the assurance of salvation had not been made clear
In those early days of the Lord's move in China, Brother Nee fasted and prayed every Saturday for the entire day
Everywhere at the school, students could be seen reading the Bible, praying together, or fellowshipping together
In Acts 2 on the day of Pentecost, Peter indicated that when the Spirit is poured out upon people, they will dream dreams
While he was standing there at a distance, he saw a young lady walking from the boat toward the people welcoming her
When he awoke in the morning, he considered that this could have been a dream from the Lord, so he had better go to meet her
The news of this revival spread to many places, and many were helped to become clear about the assurance of salvation
Through that revival we were brought into a full realization and a rich experience of the overcoming life of Christ
During one afternoon, a young man, who was a student of about nineteen or twenty years of age, was reading the Bible

Eventually, seventy saints traveled by boat from Chefoo to inner Mongolia, migrating there for the spread of the church life
We have seen how Brother Nee was unable to minister for six years, from 1942 to 1948, because of the rebellious turmoil in Shanghai
Through the revival there in 1947 and the first few months of 1948, the rebellious and dissenting ones were brought back

In the beginning the saints were focused on the divine Spirit mingled with their human spirit the mingled spirit
The saints the chosen ones the saved ones were in the spirit enjoying Christ experiencing Christ and expressing Christ in a corporate way

The saints were exercised to be in the spirit to enjoy Christ, to experience Christ, and to express and speak Christ in a corporate way
To each of the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the Lord says, 'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches'
We all have to realize that today the Lord is going on and on to fully recover us and bring us fully out of Christendom
Some use scriptural things with an intention to divide the saints, but division is the most unscriptural thing
