   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUR SELF NEEDING TO BE DENIED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Matthew 16:24 says that our self needs to be denied.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This shows that the self has been condemned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God has condemned it, so we have to deny it.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>VIII.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>OUR BODY BEING OF SIN AND OF DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our body is a body of sin and of death Rom 6:6; 7:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is very active in sinning because it is a body of sin, and it is altogether dead in doing the will of God to please God because it is a body of death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sin in our body makes us very active to sin, and death in our body deadens us in doing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our fallen body can only sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It cannot do anything to accomplish God's will or to please God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>LEARNING TO HAVE NO TRUST</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>IN OUR NATURAL BEING IN THE THINGS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After reading the above eight points, we should realize that we cannot have any trust in our natural being in the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In Philippians 3:3 Paul said, "For we are the circumcision, the ones who serve by the Spirit of God and boast in Christ Jesus and have no confidence in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To have no trust in our flesh is to have no trust in our natural being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to learn to reject our natural being and exercise our spirit in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's salvation makes our spirit the inner man Eph 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This implies that our spirit is our new person as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, we should not live another man; we should live only the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our spirit worships, prays, and should take the lead to do everything in our Christian life and service.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should not exercise our spirit only when we come to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to exercise our spirit when we speak to our spouse and our children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should purchase things by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we do not exercise our spirit, we are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we come to the meeting, we may act as one person, but at home and in our daily life we may be another person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to do everything by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Otherwise our meeting is altogether theatrical, and our meeting hall becomes a theater.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We do not want to be actors and actresses who merely talk about the things of God in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We want to be those who exercise our spirit, deny the self, and reject the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not have a double personality, being one person in the meetings and another person outside the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is hypocrisy and is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Our entire being must be strengthened into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must live the inner man, that is, we must let our spirit do everything, and reject everything of our natural being.</S>
