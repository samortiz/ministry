   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-FIVE THE KINGDOM REVEALED IN HEBREWS Scripture Reading: Heb 1:8; 2:10-11, 1-3a; 3:1-3, 14; 4:1, 8-9, 11-12; 5:9-10; 6:1, 4-8; 8:10-11; 9:14; 10:25-31; 12:1-2, 25, 28-29</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we need to see something concerning the kingdom from the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>With the exception of Matthew and Revelation, Hebrews has more related to the kingdom than any other book in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Most Christians have never considered that Hebrews is a book on the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many think that Hebrews is simply a book which tells that Christ is superior to all the main items of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>While this is correct, we must realize that Christ is superior to all the items of Judaism for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the revelation of the New Testament, Christ has come for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The concept of most Christians is that Christ came only for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They never consider that Christ came for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While it is true that Christ did come for redemption, redemption is not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Redemption is a process toward the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The goal is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's intention is to have a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God created man in His image so that man could have dominion over all things and express His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that God created man in His image so that He could have a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>GOD'S GOAL</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's goal is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even the church is for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Why does God need the church?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is because through the church, by the church, with the church, and in the church, God can have a kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God has no other way to get a kingdom for expressing His glory except through the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These two matters, the church and the kingdom, are closely related in Matthew 16:18-19.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 18 the Lord Jesus said that He would build His church, and in the following verse He said that He would give the keys of the kingdom to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The keys of the kingdom are related to the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is builded for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During these years which are near the end of the age, the Lord has burdened us with the matter of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are not here merely for redemption, the gospel, salvation, sanctification, and other things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are here particularly for the church to bring in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are here for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For such a long time, the Lord has been delayed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus has been seeking the kingdom for over twenty centuries, but still it has not come.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The delay is not due to Him, but due to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The problem is that we do not have the adequate maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For many years we have been stressing one thing: life and the maturity of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The maturity of life is for the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Matthew Christ is the seed to produce the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the first chapter there is such a wonderful One!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is the issue of forty-one generations mingled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His name is Jehovah-plus and God-plus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the seed to be worked into all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This seed will eventually become the harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The seed is Christ, and the harvest is the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Please remember the vision in Daniel 2.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In that chapter a stone is cut out without hands which smites all the Gentile world, and eventually becomes a great mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The stone in Daniel 2 signifies the Lord Jesus, and the great mountain signifies the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The stone becomes the mountain, signifying that Christ becomes the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This indicates that the kingdom is just the enlargement of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It may sound strange to hear that the kingdom is the enlargement of Christ, but according to Daniel 2 the stone became the great mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The stone signifies Christ, and the mountain signifies the kingdom.</S>
