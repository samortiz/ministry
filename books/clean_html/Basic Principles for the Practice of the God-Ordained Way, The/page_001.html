<h1 class=title>THE BASIC PRINCIPLES FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:11-16; Rom. 15:16; 1 Pet. 2:5, 9; Heb. 10:24-25; 1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 23a, 24, 26, 31; Eph. 3:8-10</h1><h2 class=head1>THE LORD’S RECOVERY OF THREE MAIN ITEMS</h2><p>The Lord’s recovery is the recovery of three main items. These items are vital for our practice of the church life, and it is crucial for us not to miss any of them.<h2 class=head2>The Oneness of the Body of Christ</h2><p>First, the Lord’s recovery is the recovery of the oneness of the Body of Christ. Throughout the past centuries, Christians have been divided again and again. In the eighteenth century, Count Zinzendorf saw the need of keeping the oneness of the Body of Christ, and a century later the Brethren in England saw more concerning the oneness of the Body and practiced it to some degree. Then in 1920 the Lord raised up Brother Watchman Nee in China and showed him the Body of Christ. He put what he saw into writing, and we received much help from him. From that time many young saints in China took the stand for the testimony of the oneness of the Body. The Lord’s recovery is testifying that regardless of differing races, cultures, or levels of education, all Christians should be one. There is no reason for us to be divided. This is clearly revealed in the New Testament.<h2 class=head2>Christ</h2><p>Second, the Lord’s recovery is the recovery, not of any doctrine, but of Christ as our all in all. Christ is everything. He is the center, and He is also the circumference. We only care for Christ. In the past sixty years, the Lord has used us to put out many publications concerning Christ, the church, and the Body of Christ in oneness.<h2 class=head2>The Function of All the Members of the Body of Christ</h2><p>Third, the Lord’s recovery is the recovery of the function of all the members of the Body of Christ. The Lord desires that every member of His Body be a functioning member. Almost all Christian groups practice the system of the clergy and laity. The clergy are the professional preachers, pastors, and ministers, who serve God in place of the other members of the church. Actually, the clergy replaces the members of the Body of Christ, and this replacement spontaneously annuls and kills the function, the capacity, and the usefulness of the members of Christ. This is an offense to the Lord. The Lord’s recovery is for the annulling of the clergy and laity and the developing of the gifts, functions, and capacity of all the members of the organic Body of Christ (Eph. 4:11-16).<p>According to the parable in Matthew 25:14-30, the Lord has distributed talents  to all of us. To some He gave five talents, to some He gave two talents, and to some He gave only one talent. Brother Nee told us that the problem today is not with the five-talented ones, but with the one-talented ones. He pointed out that not many churches have five-talented members, but they all have many one-talented members. Moreover, if we add together five one-talented members, they will equal a five-talented member. In a big family, all the members, including the parents, grandparents, and children, must do something for the family. Every member of the Body, regardless of how long he has been saved and how many talents he has received, must serve. As long as he has been saved, he must participate in the church service.<p>Brother Nee also pointed out to us that, according to 1 Corinthians 14, there is the need of the proper prophesying in order to build up the church as the organic Body of Christ. To prophesy is the best way to build up the Body. However, in most Christian meetings on the Lord’s Day, there is a congregation with one or two speaking while the rest listen. The rest of the congregation are “pew members.” After many years of meeting in this way, the functioning capacity and gifts of the members are spontaneously annulled.
