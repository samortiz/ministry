   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE VEIL OVER THE GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At this point we need to ask why Moses ministry of glory became a ministry of condemnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In itself Moses ministry was not a ministry of condemnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It became such a ministry because the people were in darkness and because their hearts were hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The book of Exodus says at least thirteen times that Pharaoh s heart was hardened, or that Pharaoh hardened his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the children of Israel were at the foot of the mountain of God, their hearts were the same as the heart of Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that the hearts of the people had become hard.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The kind of person you are is determined by the kind of heart you have.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you have an evil heart, you are an evil person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But if you have a good heart, you are a good person.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Likewise, if your heart if full of hate, you will be a hateful person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if your heart is full of love, you will be a loving person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When they were at Mount Sinai to receive the law, the children of Israel had a hardened heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As a result, the ministry of glory became for them a ministry of condemnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It definitely was not God s intention to condemn the people or to bring them into death.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But because the people were hard and blind in their heart, like Pharaoh in Egypt, the ministry of glory became a ministry of condemnation and even of death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The principle is the same in reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do not think that it is impossible for the Bible to condemn you or kill you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If your heart is hard as you read the Bible, the Bible will become to you a book of condemnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do not hold the superstitious concept that people always receive blessing in reading the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This simply is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whether the Bible is a ministry of life or of death, of righteousness or of condemnation, depends on our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If our heart is soft, the Bible will be a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But if our heart is hard, the Bible will be a book of condemnation and death, even as the ministry of Moses became a ministry of condemnation and death to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the foregoing message we pointed out the aspect of the law as killing letters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this message we are concerned with the matter of the veil over the glory of the ministry of condemnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Concerning the night aspect of the law, the two main things are the killing and the veiling.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The letters kill, and the veil covers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The law was given, but there was a veil over it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In like manner, in our experience there may also be a veil over the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When Moses came down from the mountain, he did not know that the skin of his face shone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It was the people who saw that the skin of Moses face shone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Eventually, Moses himself came to realize this.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are told that he later put a veil on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, the strange thing is that Moses did not put this veil on until after he had finished speaking with the people v. 33, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>. Before he came down from the mountain to speak with the people, Moses did not have a veil on.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not even know that his face shone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only after he had spoken to the people did he put a veil on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 34 says, But when Moses went in before Jehovah to speak with him, he took the veil off, until he came out lit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>. Then we read that when Moses spoke to the children of Israel, he put the veil upon his face again, until he went in to speak with him v. 35 . Thus, when Moses spoke with the people, he put on the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But when he spoke with God, he removed it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moses face shone because of God s speaking with him v. 29, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>. The more God talked to Moses, the more his face shone.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Moses did not wear a veil when he spoke to the Lord, but he did wear one when he spoke to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The people might have been displeased and even insulted by this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They might have said to Moses, When you speak with God, you don t wear a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Why must you put on a veil when you talk to us?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The answer to this question is that Moses covered his face with a veil because after speaking to the people, he realized that their hearts were hard.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Paul s interpretation and exposition of Exodus 34 in 2 Corinthians 3, we realize that the veil was simply the hardened heart of the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the reason Paul says that when the heart turns to the Lord, the veil will be taken away v. 16 . This is also the reason Exodus 34 says the veil was on Moses face, whereas 2 Corinthians 3:15 says that the veil is on the heart of the people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The veil was not actually the fabric used to cover Moses face.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It was the hardened heart of the people, a heart which had been turned away from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When our heart is turned toward the Lord, there is no veil.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if our heart is turned away from Him, such a heart becomes a veil which keeps us from beholding the face of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, the heart turned away from the Lord is the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Moses put a veil on his face as a sign to the people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After talking with them, Moses realized that they were stiff-necked and that their hearts were hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They could not understand God s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This was the reason Moses put a veil on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because the hearts of the children of Israel had become hardened, Moses ministry of glory became a ministry of condemnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, if the hearts of the people had been soft and had been turned to the Lord, Moses ministry would not have been a ministry of condemnation and death.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But because the people were hard of heart, they were condemned and even killed by the ministry of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This condemnation and death was passed to their descendants, including the Pharisees and the Judaizers.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All were condemned and slain by Moses ministry, even though it was a ministry of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The principle is the same in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We have pointed out that the ministry in the New Testament, a ministry of righteousness and of the Spirit, is more glorious than the ministry of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But if our heart is hard and turned away from the Lord, in our experience even the glorious ministry of the New Testament will become a ministry of condemnation and death to us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>According to John 12:48, the Lord Jesus told the religionists, He who rejects Me and does not receive My words has one who judges him: the word which I spoke, that will judge him in the last day.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This indicates that those who do not believe in Christ will be judged and condemned by His words.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Those who perish in the future will be condemned not by the law, but by the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Today the gospel is a word of righteousness, Spirit, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But those who harden their hearts will be condemned and sentenced to death by this very gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For them, the glorious ministry of the New Testament will become a ministry of condemnation and death.</S>
