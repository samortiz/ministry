   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>b God's Appearing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jacob also experienced a progressive advancement in the matter of God's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God appeared to him in a dream in chapter twenty-eight, but that appearing was not substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nothing that we see in a dream is substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It may be correct, but it is not concrete.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nebuchadnezzar saw a great image of a human body in a dream Dan 2:31 , but that image was not as substantial as a real human body, and the two iron legs in the dream were not as solid as the two sections of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While Nebuchadnezzar beheld those things in a dream, he had no experience of them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Likewise, although Jacob experienced God's appearing in his dream, in El-Bethel he solidly experienced God's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord spoke to Jacob when he was in Padan-aram 31:3 , but that was not a solid appearing of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 35:1, the Lord also spoke to him, but that also was not a solid appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only in El-Bethel did Jacob experience God's appearing in a substantial way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the progress in Jacob's experience of God's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many of us can testify that before entering into the church life we had some experience of God's appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God did appear to us, but that appearing was not solid.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But after coming to the church life and being in it for a time, we can testify that here God's appearing is not only real but also solid.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If anyone would leave the church life after remaining in it for a time, he could never deny that while he was in the church life he had experienced the appearing of God in a solid way.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before we came into the church life, the appearing of God was rather vague.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the appearing of God in the church is always substantial.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is so concrete that it seems that we can almost touch it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The best experience of God's appearing is only in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>c God's Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is also a progression in God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the vision in Bethel 28:13-15 , in Padan-aram, and in Shechem 31:3; 35:1 , Jacob was not given God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God did bless Jacob in Peniel, but there He did not bless him solidly 32:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Jacob was not given God's substantial blessing because he was not yet in the place where God intended him to be.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At Peniel, we are told that God blessed Jacob, but we are not told in what way He blessed him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, in chapter thirty-five, at Bethel, the blessing is very solid.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>There, God blessed Jacob, saying, "I am God, all-sufficient: be fruitful and multiply; a nation and a company of nations shall be of thee, and kings shall come out of thy loins; and the land which I gave Abraham and Isaac, to thee I will give it, and to thy seed after thee will I give the land" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>11-12, Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These are the solid items of God's blessing in Bethel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>d Jacob's Experience of His New Name</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Bethel, Jacob experienced his new name.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His name had been changed at Peniel 32:28, 30 , but he experienced his new name at Bethel 35:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At Bethel, Jacob's entire being was changed and he became a new person Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>No matter how good we were as Christians before we came into the church life, we were not new.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But after we came into the church life, something within demanded us to be new.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We had to be a new husband, a new parent, a new child.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all experience this inward demanding daily.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We realize that, from now on, we must be another person.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the experience of transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The church life is a transforming life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the church, everyone is under the process of renewal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We are being renewed day by day Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are not being corrected, for that means nothing, but we are being renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The church is altogether a new man Eph 2:15 , and the church life is the life of the transformed Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is a new life with a new person and a new being.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Here, in Bethel, we experience the new life, which is God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here, in the church life, we are becoming newer every day.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The longer we stay in the proper church life, the newer we become.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Your chronological age may get older, but your being becomes newer.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the elderly brothers and sisters must become newer, quicker, stronger, and fresher.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In their sharing they need to be louder and faster than the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I expect that all the points in this message will become your practical experience.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the church life, we need the highest consecration, the consecration for the house of God, not for individual enrichment.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we have this, then we shall have God's appearing in a substantial way and enjoy His full blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then we shall daily become newer and newer.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is the experience at Bethel, the experience of the church life.</S>
