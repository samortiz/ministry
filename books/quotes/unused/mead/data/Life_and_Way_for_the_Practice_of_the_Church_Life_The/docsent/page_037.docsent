   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN THE GROWTH AND THE BUILDING Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:2-5; 1 Cor 3:7-13, 16-17; Eph 2:21-22; 4:13-16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we want to fellowship concerning the building up of the church by the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE GROWTH IN LIFE FOR THE BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First of all, we want to consider several passages in the Bible that link together the growth in life and the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Peter 2:2-5 says that if we have tasted the Lord, not only believed in Him, we will long for the nourishing milk in His word and then we will grow vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By this growing, we will be built up as a spiritual house v. 5 . Hence, these few verses show us mainly two things: one is the growth in life and the other is the building up of a spiritual house.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The building up of the church as a spiritual house depends upon the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are built up by growing in the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, growing is for building up, and building up depends on growing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Now let us read 1 Corinthians 3:7-9: "So then neither is he who plants anything nor he who waters, but God who causes the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now he who plants and he who waters are one, but each will receive his own reward according to his own labor.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For we are God's fellow workers; you are God's cultivated land, God's building."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Notice here that the apostle used two kinds of description for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, he likened the church to God's cultivated land, God's farm, God's plantation, God's husbandry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then, he likened the church to God's building.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>With the cultivated land, the farm, there is the need for growth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With the building, or the house, there is the need for building up.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verses 10 through 13 tell us what kind of materials should be used for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then verses 16 and 17 go on to say, "Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If anyone destroys the temple of God, God will destroy him; for the temple of God is holy, and such are you."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The temple of God in verse 16 refers to the believers collectively in a certain locality, whereas the temple of God in verse 17 refers to all the believers universally.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All the believers are the unique temple of God in the universe, which has its expression in many localities on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The temple is the building, and the building depends upon the growth of the cultivated land.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, we can see the matter of growth and building in Ephesians 2:21-22.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 21 says that in Christ "all the building...is growing into a holy temple in the Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Not only are we being built up, but we are also growing into a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then verse 22 says, "In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Again, we see that the building up of the church as the dwelling place of God depends on the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then in Ephesians 4:13-16 we see again that the building depends on the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 13 says, "Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 14 goes on to say that "we may be no longer little children..."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are no longer little children because we have grown up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 15 says, "But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to grow up into Christ, who is the Head of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then verse 16 tells us that out from the Head, Christ, "all the Body...causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In brief, this passage shows us that the building up of the Body, the church, depends on the growth of life in Christ.</S>
