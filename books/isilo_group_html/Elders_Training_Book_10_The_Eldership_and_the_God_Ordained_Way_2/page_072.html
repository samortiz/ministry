To Keep the Truth at Any Cost</H2><P>In 2 John 1-2 and in 3 John 3-4, the aged Apostle John was happy to know that his children kept the truth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. To Exercise to Quarantine</H2><P>I do feel that all the churches must do something to help the saints to know the real situation in the recovery. The saints must be helped to realize that a "contagious disease" is now among us, and, as in the field of medicine, we must quarantine the diseased ones. To quarantine does not mean that we do not love those who are "ill," nor does it mean that we cut them off. It means that we do something to preserve both the contagious ones and the rest of the Body.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Divisive Ones</H2><P>According to Romans 16:17 and Titus 3:10, we need to exercise to quarantine the divisive ones. Romans 16:17 charges us to turn away from those who make divisions. To turn away from them is to exercise to quarantine them. Titus 3:10 says that we should refuse a factious (sectarian, divisive) person after a first and second admonition. To refuse such a one also is to exercise to quarantine him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Heretical Ones</H2><P>We also need to quarantine the heretical ones, those who go beyond the teaching concerning Christ (2 John 7-11). According to 2 John 10, we should not receive such persons into our home, and even we should not greet them. This also is to quarantine them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Fornicators</H2><P>In addition, according to 1 Corinthians 5:2, 11-13, we need to quarantine the fornicators, who live in such a gross sin, by removing them from the fellowship of the church.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 10: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (2) &nbsp; pg 72</div><br></body></html>
