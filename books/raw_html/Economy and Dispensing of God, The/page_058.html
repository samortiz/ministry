<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>By the Gifted Persons' Perfecting<br>of the Saints in the Divine Dispensing,<br>That All the Saints May Be Able to Do<br>the Work of the New Testament Ministry,<br>That Is, to Build Up the Organic Body of Christ</H2><P>All the saints who have been perfected become the able members of the Body. Before being perfected, they were not able; but they are made able through the perfecting of the gifted persons. All the able members can do the work of the New Testament ministry, which is to build up the Body of Christ. For example, through the summer school for the young people, many have been perfected to do the work of the New Testament ministry. My speaking of these messages also is a perfecting that enables the saints to build up the Body of Christ directly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Until All the Members of the Body of Christ<br>Arrive at (a) the Oneness of the Faith and<br>of the Full Knowledge of the Son of God,<br>(b) a Full-grown Man, and (c) the Measure of<br>the Stature of the Fullness of Christ</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. That They May Be No Longer Babes<br>(a) Tossed by Waves and (b) Carried About by<br>Every Wind of Teaching in the Sleight of Men,<br>in Craftiness with a View to<br>the Satanic System of Error</H2><P>The result of this perfecting is that we will all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. This will cause us to be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to the satanic system of error (Eph. 4:13-14).</P>
