   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Experiencing Christ as the Peace Offering</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Moreover, Christ became God's food to satisfy God's need; He also became our food to satisfy our need.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God is fully satisfied in Christ, and we too are fully satisfied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At this moment within us we are joyful, at ease, peaceful, and comfortable; moreover, our heart is full of thanksgiving and praise.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have a sense that Christ is so good and so precious and that He is our peace, our reconciliation, and our acceptance to God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this way we experience Christ as the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The peace offering is based on the trespass offering and the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our trespasses and our sin were dealt with through Christ's redemption, so there is no more problem between God and us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God is satisfied, and we are also satisfied; thus, we have peace with God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Experiencing Christ as the Meal Offering</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, we will eventually say to the Lord, "Lord, I want to be like You.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You are so balanced, so fine, so obedient, and so blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, I want to be like You in experiencing the death of the cross with the power of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You are without sin and You are not natural."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At this time we will experience Him as unleavened cakes, made with fine flour mingled with oil, having frankincense and salt added into it, but without honey or leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We bring the cakes before God, offering them as food to God, and they also become our food.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We bring the Lord's life, the Lord's living, and the Lord's conduct and walk and offer them all to God as an offering for our enjoyment as well as God's enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the experience of the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Perhaps what we experience is a very small cake, and what Paul experienced was a very large cake; however, no matter what the size of the offering, we who have been saved all have a certain amount of experience of Christ as the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Experiencing Christ as the Burnt Offering</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For a person to experience Christ as the meal offering is still not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At this moment he will see that just as Christ was absolutely for God, he also ought to be for God; just as Christ offered Himself to live for God, he also ought to present himself as a living sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Romans 12:1 says, "Present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The one who is offering the burnt offering does not let the priest slaughter the sacrificial animal for him; rather, he himself has to slaughter it, skin it, cut it into pieces, and then arrange the pieces on the altar to be burnt for God's acceptance.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The result is that with God there is a satisfying fragrance, but on the earth there is only a heap of ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the same manner, all that we have must be for God alone; if God accepts us, then all that we have will become ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we become ashes before men, we will be a satisfying fragrance before God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We do not regard ashes as something pleasant, yet God delights in the satisfying fragrance that comes from the burning which turns the sacrifice into ashes.</S>
