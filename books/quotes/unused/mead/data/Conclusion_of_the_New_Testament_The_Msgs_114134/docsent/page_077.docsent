   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>9 From the Religious World</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and Its Elements Ordinances</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the books of Galatians and Colossians we see that the believers have been freed from the religious world and its elements.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Galatians 1:4 says that Christ gave Himself for our sins, that He might, rescue us out of the present evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this verse the present evil age refers to the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Galatians 6:14 and 15 confirm this: Far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For neither is circumcision anything nor uncircumcision, but a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The world in verse 14 refers mainly to the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For at the beginning of verse 15 indicates that this verse is an explanation of the foregoing verse.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Circumcision, being a religious matter, indicates that the world in verse 14 must be mainly the religious world from which the believers in Christ have been released.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By the cross we are separated from the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are still involved with the religious world, we shall not be able to live a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should be able to say that the religious world has been crucified to us and that we have been crucified to the religious world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should be able to testify that even if we tried to go back to that world, we would be rejected by it, for we have been crucified to it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If Paul had desired to return to Judaism, the religionists would not have accepted him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Rather, they would have commanded him to leave, for he was in another realm.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To Judaism Paul had been crucified, and Judaism had been crucified to him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Between him and the religious world there was the separation of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is this separation which qualifies us to live a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everything practiced in the religious world is part of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But through the cross of Christ we are finished with religion and are in another world, another realm.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this realm we live a new creation by the Spirit, not the old creation by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Colossians 2:20 indicates that as those who died with Christ from the elements of the world we should no longer subject ourselves to ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The elements of the world are the elementary principles of worldly society, the rudimentary principles invented by mankind and practiced in society.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>With Christ we have died to these elements of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Christ was crucified, we were crucified also.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In His crucifixion we were released from the elementary principles of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>10 From Their Vain Manner of Life</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Handed Down from Their Fathers</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Finally, the believers have been freed from their vain manner of life handed down from their fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Peter 1:18 reminds us that we have been redeemed from our vain manner of life handed down from our fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A vain manner of life is not necessarily sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the contrary, in certain respects it may be quite moral.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, it is still vain having no goal, no aim, no purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Anything without goal or purpose is vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The believers should live a life without vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everything we do and say should have God s goal in view.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This kind of life is weighty and full of content; it is a life with purpose, goal, and aim.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to 1 Peter 1:18 and 19, the blood of Christ has redeemed us from our vain manner of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This vain manner of life is in contrast to the holy manner of life v. 15 . Christ s redemption and the Spirit s sanctification v. 2 are for this to separate us from our vain manner of life handed down from our fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Knowing that this was accomplished with the highest price, the precious blood of Christ, we should be encouraged to live a holy life, a life to express God in His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have seen that the believers have been made a new creation by being regenerated, by receiving the Spirit of God, by having the eternal life, by being renewed, by being transferred, and by being released.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>These six matters constitute the making of the new creation.</S>
