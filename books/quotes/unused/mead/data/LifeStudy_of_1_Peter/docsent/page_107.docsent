   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CO-CHOSEN IN BABYLON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 5:13 Peter says, The co-chosen in Babylon and Mark my son greet you.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Greek word rendered the co-chosen and its article are feminine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It may refer to Peter s wife, who traveled with him 1 Cor 9:5 , or to a prominent sister in the Lord, who had been co-chosen by God not only with the receivers of this Epistle, but also with Peter and all the other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some suppose that it refers to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Through the centuries the great teachers have held two different interpretations of the name Babylon as used in 5:13: one is figurative, referring to Rome, the capital of the Roman Empire; the other literal, referring to Babylon, a large city on the Euphrates.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reasons for the latter are more logical than for the former.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, it seems that Peter had no reason to use a figurative name to hide the city of his whereabouts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second, all the names he used for the places in the address of his Epistle 1:1 were literal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Third, in the New Testament the name Rome is clearly mentioned Acts 19:21; 28:14, 16; Rom 1:7, 15 , at least up to the time when Paul s last Epistle, 2 Timothy, was written 2 Tim 1:17 , probably after 1 Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is when John s Revelation, a book of figures, was written, about A.D. 90, that the figurative name Babylon the Great was used for the city of Rome Rev 17:5; 18:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>MARK, PETER S SON</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The name Mark in verse 13 refers to John Mark Acts 12:12, 25 , the writer of the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As Peter s spiritual son, he was there in Babylon with him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later he was taken to Paul by Timothy 2 Tim 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>PETER S GREETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In 5:14 Peter concludes, Greet one another with a kiss of love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Peace to you all who are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the beginning of this Epistle Peter says, Grace to you and peace be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the end he says, Peace to you all who are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Peace results from grace; it issues from the enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Such enjoyment of God as the multiplying and multiplied grace 1:2 , the varied grace 4:10 , the all grace 5:10 , and the true grace 5:12 as the reality of the contents of the Christian life under the government of God issues and results in a condition of peace with both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Peter s writing is not at all superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is deep in truth and very experiential.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We see this even in what Peter says regarding peace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Peter s understanding of peace is deep.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, most Christians today think of peace in a very shallow way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to 5:14, Peter s desire is that peace be with all who are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Peter stresses the fact that the believers are in Christ 3:16; 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is of God and through our faith and baptism that we are in Christ 1 Cor 1:30; John 3:5; Gal 3:27; Rom 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This results in an organic union with the Triune God Matt 28:19 and makes us one spirit with the Lord 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
