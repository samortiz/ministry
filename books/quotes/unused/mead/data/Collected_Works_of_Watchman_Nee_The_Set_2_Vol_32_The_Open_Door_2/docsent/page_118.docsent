   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ADDITIONAL NEWS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1 A letter from Ch'eng-tu on August 25 said: "Brother Stephen Kaung went with Brother Chao Rue-tze to Guan County on August 23.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brother Kaung will work there for a week and then return to Ch'eng-tu."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>2 Brother Hsu Jung-jieh wrote on August 15 that he and Brothers Hu Yi-min and David Hsu had set off from Wei-Si on June 28 for work around the Nu River.</S>

   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A WORD ON BEHALF OF THE EDITOR</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Issue No. 18 of this magazine was published in June.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have delayed the publishing of this issue for two reasons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, mail delivery has been very difficult in many places during the past two months.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Since this magazine cannot be considered government-registered printed matter, it is better to wait before mailing it out than to have it stuck in the post office.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, the chief editor, Watchman Nee, returned from abroad at the beginning of July, and I have respectfully handed the responsibility of editorship back to him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After Mr. Nee arrived in Shanghai, he had a special conference for eleven days.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In addition, many affairs of the church were waiting for his decisions, and there was the need for the work to go on in a positive way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a result, he was not able to do any editing work on the magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because two months had already elapsed since the publication of the last issue, we were afraid that many would become concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As a result, I reluctantly agreed to prepare another issue of this magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot say anything about the future until Mr. Nee has settled other aspects of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>During this period of my substitute-editorship, I have only been able to gather and collect news from various sources.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It remains Mr. Nee's job to fulfill the original intention of this magazine, which is to edify the workers, improve the work, give guidance to the churches, and answer questions.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We take this opportunity to make this clarification and ask that all the brothers and sisters pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have not been granted a license to publish this magazine as official printed matter yet.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since there are many problems in mail delivery, we cannot put too many pages into the magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we have again postponed publishing "The Dynamics of Service."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We did not inform too many people about the special conference in Shanghai this time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many of the co-workers in nearby places were not able to attend because of the inaccessibility of transportation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brothers Witness Lee, Chao Chi-gwang, and Chang Tze-jieh returned to Tsingtao and Chefoo after the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brothers Hwa Shi-bin, James Chen, Chang Yu-zhi, and Liu Bei-min are still in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Brother Chu En-seng was the first one to testify for the Lord in Chi-Shien-Chiao, Pu-Dong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>During the past two or three years, he has been conducting a small business on the one hand and preaching the gospel in the villages on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When he came to Shanghai for the conference, he mentioned that he intended to sell his shop so that he could serve the Lord full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Unfortunately, he died of sickness three days after he returned home from the conference August 13 !</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The co-workers were both shocked and saddened!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By the Lord's grace the local church in Shanghai has remembered the needs of his family.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>May the Father comfort and protect the widow and orphans of this family!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have passed on the money designated for the family of Brother Zhang Gun-jih to the designees.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is better to forward money to the provinces in the southwest directly rather than transferring it through Shanghai.</S>
