   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Here I should mention another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whenever we meet and whenever we fellowship with one another mutually, we should remember that, as believers, we are one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let us read some verses:</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 12:13 says, For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word whether means that there is no distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Body of Christ there are no worldly distinctions.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body and were given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Galatians 3:27-28 says, For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We were baptized into Christ, and we have also put on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There cannot be Jew or Greek, slave or free man, male or female, because we have all become one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Colossians 3:10-11 says, And have put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him, where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, free man, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Both Galatians 3:28 and Colossians 3:11 use the phrase there cannot be.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There cannot be any distinctions because we have put on the new man; we are being constituted into one new man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This new man is created according to God Eph 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the new man there cannot be Greek or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian or Scythian, slave or free man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is only one entity, and all have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In reading these three portions of the Scripture, we notice that the believers are one in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Lord there is no distinction of past status.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the new man and in the Body of Christ, there is no difference whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we introduce these manmade distinctions into the church, the relationship among the brothers and sisters will be shifted to the wrong ground.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have mentioned five distinctions so far: the distinction between Greek and Jew, between free man and slave, between male and female, between barbarian and Scythian, and between circumcision and uncircumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The distinction between Greek and Jew means two things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First the Jews and the Greeks are two different races; they belong to two different countries.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Body of Christ, in Christ, and in the new man, there cannot be Jew or Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Jews should not boast that they are descendants of Abraham and God s chosen people, and they should not despise all foreigners.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We must realize that both Jews and Greeks have been made one in Christ already.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Boundaries no longer exist in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the Lord all have become brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We cannot divide God s children into different classes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Body of Christ and in the new man, there is only one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you bring the idea of kinship and regional flavor into the church, you do not know what the church of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You are in the church now, and you must see that we have no distinction between Jew and Greek here.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is a hard thing for the Jews to give up this distinction.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the Bible says that in Christ there cannot be Jew and Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the church there is only Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is another distinction between the Jews and the Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Jews have a zealous and religious temperament, while Greeks represent an intellectual temperament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Historically, whenever you speak of religion, people think of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever you speak of science and philosophy, people think of the Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a distinction in character.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, no matter how different their characters are, Jews can be Christians, and Greeks also can be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who are zealous for religion can be Christians, and those who are intellectual also can be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In Christ, there is no distinction between Jews and Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One is concerned with the feeling of the conscience, and the other is concerned with reasoning and deduction.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Are these two different?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to the flesh, they definitely are different in disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One acts according to feelings, and the other acts according to intellect.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But in Christ there is no distinction between Jews and Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A warm person can be a Christian, and a cold person also can be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The one who walks by intuition can be a Christian, and the one who walks by reason also can be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All kinds of people can be Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Once you become a Christian, you must leave your past temperament behind.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is no such thing in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Often the church suffers because many people try to bring their natural flavor and peculiar traits into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When those who do not like to talk gather together, they become a quiet group.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When those who chatter gather together, they become a chattering group.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When those who are cold gather together, they become a group of cold people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When those who are warm gather together, they become a group of warm people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As a result, many distinctions are built up among God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, there is no place for natural dispositions in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In Christ and in the new man, there is no place for natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Do not think that others are wrong because their disposition is different from yours.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You must realize that your own disposition is also unacceptable to others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whether you are quick or quiet, cold or warm, intellectual or emotional, once you become a brother or a sister, you must put off these things.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you bring these natural elements into the church, they will become the basis of confusion and division.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When you bring your disposition and temperament into the church, you will make yourself the standard and the criteria.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Those who are up to your standard will be classified as good Christians, and those who are not up to your standard will be classified as poor Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who get along with your character will be deemed right and those who do not get along with your character will be deemed wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When this happens, the church will suffer through your disposition and temperament.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Such distinctions must never exist in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The second distinction is between free men and slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This distinction has also been eliminated in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In Christ, the distinction between free men and slaves does not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Paul wrote the Epistles of 1 Corinthians, Galatians, and Colossians during the Roman era when slavery was practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>At that time slaves were like animals or tools; they were their masters possessions.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Children born to slaves were automatically slaves; they had no freedom their whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The distinction between the free man and the slave was very great.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, God does not allow this distinction to exist in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Epistles of 1 Corinthians, Galatians, and Colossians all say that there cannot be free man or slave.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This distinction has been eliminated in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The third distinction is between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>In Christ and in the new man, the male and the female have the same status; there is no distinction between them.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The male does not occupy a special position; neither does the female.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Because Christ is all and in all, there is no distinction between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>In spiritual matters there is no difference between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>A brother is saved by the life of Christ, that is, by the life of God s Son.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>A sister also is saved by the life of Christ, the life of God s Son.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The brother has become God s son, and the sister has become God s son as well.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In Christ we are all God s sons, and there is no distinction between male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The fourth distinction is between barbarians and Scythians.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is a distinction of culture.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>There are differences in cultural standards, yet Paul told us that the cultural distinctions of barbarians and Scythians alike have been abolished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Of course, we should learn to be a Jew among Jews, and to be as under law to those under law 1 Cor 9:20-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Among people of other cultures, we should behave according to their culture.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We should learn to be one with all people in all places.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>When we contact those of a different culture, we should learn to be one with them in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The final distinction is between circumcision and uncircumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>This distinction has to do with marks of piety in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The Jews have the mark of circumcision on their bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It shows that they belong to God, that they fear God, and that they reject the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Yet they overemphasize circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Acts 15 speaks of some Jews who tried to compel the Gentiles to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Christians also have their marks of piety in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>For example, baptism, head covering, the breaking of bread, the laying on of hands, and so on can all become marks of piety.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Baptism has a spiritual meaning, but it can also be a mark of piety in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Head covering with the sisters has a spiritual meaning, but it can also be a mark of piety in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Bread-breaking and the laying on of hands have spiritual meanings, but they can also become marks of piety in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>All of these things have spiritual meaning; they are all spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>However, we may use these things to separate God s children, boasting about marks which others do not have, and the result is disunity.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>If we do this, we have downgraded these matters from their spiritual level and made them mere physical marks in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>When this happens, we become, in principle, the same as the Jews who boasted in circumcision; our baptism, head covering, bread-breaking, and hand-laying have become our circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>If we differentiate between God s children based on these things, we have made distinctions according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>However, in Christ there is no distinction between circumcision and uncircumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>No physical mark of the flesh can be used to differentiate God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>In Christ we are made one.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The life in Christ is one.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>All of these things are outside of the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Of course, it is good to have the spiritual reality that accompanies these physical marks.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>But if one has the spiritual reality yet is lacking in the physical marks, we cannot count him out.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>God s children should not allow physical marks to damage the oneness in the Lord and the oneness in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We all are brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>We are the new man in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>We all are members in the Body, and we all are parts of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Once we are in the church, we should not have any distinction outside of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Everyone stands on new ground.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Everyone is in the new man created by the Lord and everyone is in the Body built up by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We must see that all of God s children are one.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>There is no place for superiority or inferiority.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>We must eliminate the denominational and sectarian thoughts from our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>If we do this, there will be no division in the meeting of the church of God and in the fellowship between the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>We have to pay attention to these matters in the meeting, and we have to live out such a life in our daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>May God bless us.</S>
