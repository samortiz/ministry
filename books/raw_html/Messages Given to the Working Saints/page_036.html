<h2 class=head3>Arriving at a Full-grown Man</h2><p>If the working saints will rise up today, the church will become a full-grown man. This is not a dream. A full-grown man is a mature man. This kind of maturity in life is necessary for the practical oneness.<h2 class=head3>Arriving at the Measure of the Stature of the Fullness of Christ</h2><p>The fullness of Christ is His Body. This Body has a stature which has a measure. The arriving at the full-grown stature of the fullness of Christ is also a necessary step. Today in the church in Taipei, the measure of the stature of the Body of Christ cannot be considered as being full, because we have not yet arrived. That is why there is the need for the working ones to rise up.<h2 class=head3>No Longer Babes</h2><p>At times some local churches are still in the stage of the babes. They are tossed to and fro by the different winds of teachings, doctrines, concepts, and opinions. But if the working saints would rise up, they will be delivered from the condition of the babes.<h2 class=head3>Holding to Truth in Love, Growing Up into Him in All Things, Who Is the Head, Christ</h2><p>The meaning of holding to truth in love is to hold to Christ and His Body in the love of Christ, and not to be affected by the winds of teachings, nor to bring in elements foreign to the Body. To grow up into the Head in all things is to have Christ increase in us in all things until we become a full-grown man. Whether the church can arrive at this condition or not depends on the working brothers and sisters. Perhaps you would say that I am putting all the burden on your shoulders. That is right, because you are the backbone. The weight of the whole body is supported by the backbone.<h2 class=head3>Out from the Head All the Body, Fitted and Knit Together through Every Joint of the Supply, according to the Operation in Measure of Each One Part, Causing the Growth of the Body unto the Building Up of Itself in Love</h2><p>First we grow into the Head. Then out from Him we have something for the building up of His Body. The Body of Christ grows by itself and is built up by itself, through every joint of the supply, which refers to the specially gifted ones, and the functioning parts, which refer to every member.<p>The reason we have to take the new way is that in the old way, it is very difficult for the brothers and sisters to be built up organically. A human body not only needs food, but needs exercise as well. The way in the past of one speaking and all the others listening was to give people food without giving them the organic exercise. Now for us to change to the new way means for us to let the children roll and jump. It may not be too orderly. But the organic capacity of every one will be realized. Hence, the present new way is to make every one a living person. You can realize that now there are unlimited needs. We need people to visit men and preach the gospel to them. We need people for the home meetings, the small group meetings, and the district meetings. Everywhere, there is the need for people to put in their share.<p>If all the working ones would rise up, some in the homes, some in the small group meetings, and some in the district meetings, with every one being a pillar and a core member, they will become fully useful, and the situation will be very glorious. Imagine how many people you will be built up with if, from the beginning of the year to the end, you bring in people every week and take care of them and supply them. I fully believe that these people will line up to welcome you in the future. Even today, they are already your crown and joy. For many of us, we have two kinds of children, the spiritual ones and the natural ones. Those who have the experience can testify that although we rejoice in seeing our natural children, we have more joy in seeing our spiritual children. Do not have as much consideration for your natural children. You have to consider a little your spiritual children before the Lord. Today the new way is somewhat laid out in Taipei. The framework is quite complete. The opportunities that have been generated are countless. The Lord brought us into this way in order to put all the opportunities before us. He is waiting for all to come. It will be glorious if you would become a part of it. It will be glorious not only when the Lord returns, but even right now today.<p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Taipei on May 29, 1988)
