   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOURTEEN NEEDING TO KNOW THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN LIFE AND TRUTH 4 Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4, 14, 17; 8:32, 36; 14:6; Gal 2:14; Eph 1:13; 4:24</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Prayer: Lord, bring us into Your light.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We long to see light in Your light.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, thank You that although we were born in darkness, we have been regenerated into light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We are no longer sons of darkness but are children of light.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need more light.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Speak something to us that will bring us into light.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, we trust in You.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE BASIC FACTORS IN JOHN</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In previous chapters we have seen that we need to know the Lord s recovery in life and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this chapter we will continue to consider the matter of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In order to know what the truth is, we must come to the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The word truth is rarely mentioned in Matthew, Mark, or Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Its revelation begins in John, the Gospel of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because the Word is the first item mentioned in the Gospel of John, it must be very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 4 says, In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Word, which is God, is life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Life is in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 14 says, The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father , full of grace and reality.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Greek word for reality in this verse is translated as truth elsewhere e.g., 8:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John 1:17 says, The law was given through Moses; grace and reality came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The matters that we need to see in these verses are the Word, life, grace, and reality, or truth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In chapter 8 the truth is mentioned again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 32 says, You shall know the truth, and the truth shall set you free.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 36 says, If therefore the Son sets you free, you shall be free indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These two verses use the truth and the Son interchangeably, revealing that the truth is actually a person, Christ the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Chapter 14 also reveals this in verse 6, which says, Jesus said to him, I am the way and the reality and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Both the truth and the life are a person, Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 17 mentions the Spirit of reality, which is the another Comforter mentioned in verse 16.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first Comforter is the Son, and the second Comforter is the Spirit of reality, which is also mentioned in 15:26 and 16:13.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In 17:17 the Lord prayed to the Father, Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The word of the Father is the truth, and this truth sanctifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Gospel of John also covers the matter of light.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John 1:4 says, The life was the light of men.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In 8:12 the Lord said, I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The term the light of life indicates that life becomes light.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Word, life, grace, reality, the Spirit of reality, and light along with the Son and the Father are the basic factors in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, John is composed with the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit the Word, life, light, grace, and reality, or truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These terms may be familiar terms to us, but we need to see that all these factors are a person, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Father, the Son, the Spirit, the Word, life, and light are God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Grace is God for our enjoyment, and truth is God revealed and realized.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On God s side, truth is God revealed; and on our side, it is God realized.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When God reveals Himself, that is truth; and when we realize and touch God, that is also truth, or reality.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When God is hidden, we do not have truth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The revelation of God is truth, but it needs our realization.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our realization goes along with God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We cannot have realization without revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The revelation of God brings forth the realization of God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is truth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As we have seen in previous chapters, when we have the truth, we have light, for truth is the shining of light.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The shining of light is actually light itself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Furthermore, light brings in life; light becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Life is our enjoyment of God, which is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Grace is God Himself the Father embodied in the Son and the Son realized as the Spirit enjoyed by us and God is the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, the basic factors in John are like a circle the beginning is joined to the end. The beginning is the Word; the end is the truth, reality; and the Word and the truth are one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The basic factors in John are one; they are all aspects of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must see this in order to understand what the truth is.</S>
