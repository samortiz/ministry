   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DAVID'S ABSOLUTE UPHOLDING OF GOD'S AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let me quote a third incident.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This will show you more clearly the matter of submission to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After 1 Samuel, we come to chapter one of 2 Samuel, which details David's reaction to Saul's suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In man's eyes, it was good news for David that Saul had died.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second Samuel 1 tells us that a young man came and reported to David how he had killed Saul, based on Saul's plea as he approached his death vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>6-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The young man thought that he would surely receive a reward from David.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, David responded, "How is it that you were not afraid to stretch forth your hand to destroy Jehovah's anointed?" v. 14 . He then ordered the young messenger to be killed because he had said with his own mouth that he had killed Jehovah's anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This shows us that not only did David himself refrain from rebellion and tearing down God's deputy authority, but he forbade others from doing the same.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here we find the extent to which David upheld God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is wonderful to see David's maintaining of such a relationship with God's authority; he was not careless in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the reason God loved David and established an everlasting kingdom for him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God said that David was "a man after His heart" 1 Sam 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God allowed his kingdom to continue.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even our Lord was a descendant of David according to the flesh Rom 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order for us to be a king, we must first submit to the King.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In order for us to be an authority, we must first submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In order for us to be anointed, we must first humble ourselves before the Anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God allows only those who submit to the King to be the kings.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He only allows those who submit to authority to be the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have to eradicate the root of rebellion in us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we want to be an authority, we must first submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>An authority must never be rash in action or words; he must never act impulsively.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today many workers and conference speakers are satisfied with their good works and fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But often I have thought of asking them, "You are boasting about so many things that you have done, but how many times have you submitted in your life?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do you know what submission means?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am afraid that some people have never learned to submit to anyone in their whole life; they have never submitted to anyone's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Today those who want to be an authority must first learn to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>SUBMISSION BEING THE UNIQUE CRUCIAL MATTER</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order to deal with the brothers and sisters and bring them into submission, we ourselves must first eradicate the spirit of rebellion and the thoughts of rebellion within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are not here merely to earn a living or to play games.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These are sober days!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The most basic issue is the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we do not settle this issue, it is useless for us to talk about other things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not know authority, we will not have a way to go on in our work, our service, or even our personal walk as a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must remember that the kind of person we are determines the kind of persons we raise up.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the unique crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we do not settle this matter in a fundamental way, we cannot go on.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church is the institution of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>My heart is not on the power or weakness of the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am not afraid of foolishness or lowliness in men.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The only thing that I am afraid of is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A nation's first concern is not the poverty or weakness of its citizens but whether or not there is division and rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Once there is division and rebellion, the nation perishes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the same way, when division arises in a family, it is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Where authority is absent, confusion reigns, and no building can be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a solemn thing that we are gathered together here.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I hope that we will all see the seriousness of the matter of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God's deputy authority can be found in our government, our society, our family, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to learn to submit to deputy authority before we can assume deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>GOD ENTRUSTING HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>TO THE DEPUTY AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Some may ask, "What happens if the deputy authority makes a mistake?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Should we still submit to him?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have to see that God has entrusted Himself to the deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I must shout loudly that God's deputy authority is God's revealed authority.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God's deputy authority is in fact God's very authority.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God charges children to submit to their parents, wives to submit to their husbands, employees to submit to their superiors, and citizens to submit to those in authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some wonder if these deputy authorities are worthy of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They wonder how God could ever have entrusted Himself to such husbands or officers.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Brothers and sisters, do you think that God does not know that among government officials, half of them are avaricious?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Do you think that God is ignorant to the mistakes of those in authority?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We are so worried that those in authority may make mistakes, but we must realize that God's greatness lies in the very fact that He is able to entrust His authority to man.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Man is afraid of entrusting authority to other men.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Since God wants man to submit to deputy authority, we can see the great responsibility that a deputy authority bears.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is not an easy thing for God to entrust His authority to man.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, since God is not afraid to hand His authority to man, it means that He can put His trust in the deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have to realize that even though it is difficult to submit to deputy authority, it is even more difficult for God to appoint deputy authority.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is not a light matter for God to entrust Himself to His deputy authority.</S>
