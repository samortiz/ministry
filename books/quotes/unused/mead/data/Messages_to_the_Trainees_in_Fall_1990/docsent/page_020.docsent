   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just as Genesis 1:2 shows us the beginning of God's work in the old creation, Luke 1:35 and Matthew 1:20 show us the beginning of God's work in the new creation.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If a man lives in his soul, he will be better, but he will be a natural man logical, considerate, careful, and thoughtful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To live in the soul is not as bad as living in the body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, when a man comes back to his spirit and remains in the spirit, he is living by the highest standard.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every time we come back to our spirit and remain there, we are right with our wife or husband, our parents, children, neighbors, classmates, colleagues, and the brothers and sisters in the church life.</S>
