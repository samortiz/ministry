<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THIRTEEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>LIVING WITH THE DIVINE TRINITY</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(4)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14; Jude 20-21; Rev. 1:4-5; John 17:22-23; Rev. 21:22-23; 22:1-5</H1><P>Our fellowship in this chapter may be considered as covering the concluding section of the entire revelation concerning the Divine Trinity in both the New Testament and the Old Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ENJOYING THE DIVINE TRINITY IN FULL</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Having Been Baptized into the Name (the Person)<br>of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit</H2><P>At the conclusion of the Gospel of Matthew, the gospel of the kingdom, the Lord revealed that we have been baptized into the name [the person] of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (28:19). M.R. Vincent said that the word "into" in Matthew 28:19 indicates that baptism brings us into a spiritual and mystical union with the Triune God. The name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit in this verse is the sum total of the divine Being, equivalent to His person. To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to bring them into the person of the Triune God that they may have an organic union with this divine person. Our organic union with the Triune God brings us into a deep enjoyment and a rich experience of the Triune God. We were baptized into the Triune God so that we could experience Him and enjoy Him.</P><P>At the end of the New Testament in Revelation 22, a marvelous picture is presented, revealing the Triune God for our enjoyment. A river is flowing out of the throne, and a tree is growing along the two sides of the river (vv. 1-2). This tree is the tree of life yielding its fruit every month. In Revelation 2:7 the Lord Jesus said that He would give those who overcome to eat of the tree of life. The tree of life was first mentioned in Genesis 2. God's desire in Genesis 2 was for man to eat the tree of life, but man fell by eating the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Sin entered into man, and man became flesh. Because of man's fall, Genesis 3 records that God closed the tree of life to man, keeping man away by His righteousness, holiness, and glory (v. 24). Over four thousand years later, Jesus came and accomplished redemption to fulfill God's requirements. Then He declared in Revelation 2 that if we would overcome according to His will, He would give us to eat of the tree of life. The way to the tree of life has been opened again for all the redeemed ones who are willing to overcome according to the Lord's demand.</P><P>At the end of the Bible, this tree of life is growing along the two sides of the river of water of life, which proceeds out of the throne of God. The tree of life signifies Christ as the very embodiment of the Triune God to be our food, our life supply. John 7:38 and 39 show clearly that the Spirit will be rivers of living water flowing out of our innermost being. Thus, the river of water of life is a symbol of the Spirit. I hope that we can see that the Trinity revealed in the Bible is not for doctrinal debate or for us to understand or study in a mere theological way. The very Trinity revealed in the Bible is altogether for our eating and drinking&#151;for our enjoyment. We have been baptized into the Triune God who is to be our enjoyment, our food and our drink, that we may live by Him. Thus, we can say that Matthew 28:19 reveals to us the divine enjoyment, and our divine enjoyment is to feed on the Triune God and drink the Triune God. He is our tree of life and our river of water of life.</P>
