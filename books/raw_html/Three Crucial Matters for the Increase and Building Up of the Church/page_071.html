	 <h2 class="head1">THE CONTENTS OF NOURISHING<br />
IN THE HOME MEETINGS</h2>
<p>We should nourish a person immediately after he is saved. This is not according to our former practice of baptizing someone and then immediately rushing off to baptize another person. From now on we must change our practice. Immediately after baptizing a person, we should remain in his home and feed him his first meal. Then we should visit him the day after his baptism and visit him again a few days later. By visiting a new one in this way, we should be able to meet with him at least ten times in the first month. All we should do is visit and feed the new ones. When we visit the new ones, we must feed them with the word of the Bible. We can do this with <em>Life Lessons.</em> However, we must use <em>Life Lessons</em> organically, not mechanically.</p>
<p>We must avoid being rigid and using formal methods. For example, at the beginning of a home meeting we always say, &ldquo;Today we are going to read <em>Life Lessons.</em>&rdquo; This is unnecessary. As soon as we enter a new one&rsquo;s home and sit down, we should exercise our spirit by praying or singing out loud so that our spirit rises up. We should even begin singing when we leave our home and pray while we are in the car. Then the meeting will begin before we even arrive at the new one&rsquo;s home.</p>
<p>It is best to sing hymns while we are waiting at the door. Then when the new one hears us, his spirit will be stirred up, and the home meeting will begin spontaneously. After we enter the home, the new believer may say, &ldquo;I am so glad you came. I have a question to ask you.&rdquo; By this mutual asking and answering we may be led to a particular lesson in <em>Life Lessons</em> that is an appropriate response to the question. It is not necessary to read the entire lesson. It may be sufficient to read one point and the important verses. After half an hour the new one will be nourished. We should not leave as soon as the new one is nourished; instead, we should fellowship with him and talk to him. This is not a worship service; it is the best meeting.</p>
<p>Sometimes we will be able to answer a new one&rsquo;s questions simply by reading <em>Life Lessons</em> with him. Every lesson in <em>Life Lessons</em> has a hymn at the end that is appropriate to sing in coordination with our speaking. If we use the hymn, we will not be rigid and our method will not become a ritual. When we are spreading the gospel in the rural places, we must do things absolutely according to the new way. We are taking a new way; we are not doing a reforming work. Moreover, if we apply these methods mechanically, they will become old. We must instead be renewed daily and have a fresh spirit to supply others with Christ every day.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRISTIAN MEETINGS BEING PRAYING, SINGING,<br />
READING, AND SPEAKING</h2>
<p>In Christian meetings we pray, sing, read, and speak. These are the elements that compose our meetings. In addition, there is fellowship, petition, and mutual care. When we visit people in their homes, we must stir up their spirit, but in order to do this, our spirit must first be stirred up. In the past when we visited people, we did not understand the matters of exercising our spirit or releasing our spirit, because we had not received any leading related to this. Actually, <em>releasing the spirit, exercising the spirit,</em> and <em>using the spirit</em> are terms that we invented. When we were still in mainland China, Brother Nee emphasized and frequently used the phrase <em>use your spirit.</em> At that time we did not yet have the phrases <em>exercise your spirit</em> and <em>release your spirit.</em> We did not begin to use these until we were in Taiwan.</p>
<p>When we visited people in the past, we knew that we should dress neatly and take our Bible. We knocked on doors in a formal way, and when people answered the door, we were polite and formal. However, our formality became stiff and rigid, and as soon as things are rigid, they become dead. After we sat down and our host also sat down, we would look at one another, not knowing what to do or say. After a while we would select a hymn, and after singing the hymn, we prayed. This was a formal ritual. These were meetings according to the natural human concept of worship and service. It is difficult for a person&rsquo;s spirit to be moved in such a meeting.</p>
<p>However, when we researched the Bible, we saw a different situation. In Acts we saw that the saints sang hymns, praised, and rejoiced spontaneously. In chapter 4, when Peter and John were released from jail, they went to the brothers, who immediately rejoiced, praised, and prayed out loud. After praying, the place where they were meeting was shaken, and they were filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak the word of God with boldness (vv. 23-31). What caused the disciples to speak with boldness? When Peter and John were in custody, the Jewish Sanhedrin charged them not to utter anything at all nor teach based upon the name of Jesus (vv. 17-18). But the more the Sanhedrin exhorted and charged, the more the apostles praised. After praising, they were filled with the Holy Spirit. This enabled them to speak even more boldly. In chapter 5 the apostles were arrested again and reminded of the charge &ldquo;not to teach based upon this name&rdquo; (v. 28). However, Peter and the apostles said, &ldquo;It is necessary to obey God rather than men&rdquo; (v. 29). This shows that the disciples were freed from formality.</p>
