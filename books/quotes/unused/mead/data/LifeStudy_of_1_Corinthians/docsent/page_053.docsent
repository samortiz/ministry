   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE EIGHTEEN THE TWO SPIRITS IN KNOWING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS THE DEPTHS OF GOD Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 2:2, 7-16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2:1 Paul says, And I, when I came to you, brothers, came not with excellence of speech or wisdom, announcing to you the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Paul did not come to Corinth to display excellent speech or philosophical wisdom in proclaiming the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This does not mean that Paul did not have excellence of speech or wisdom; it means that he deliberately dropped those things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 2 he goes on to say, For I determined not to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul deliberately decided not to know anything other than the crucified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This implies that Paul came to the Corinthians as a crucified person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He was willing to appear foolish and not knowledgeable because he had made such a determination.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>GOD S WISDOM IN A MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In verse 6 Paul tells the Corinthians, But we speak wisdom among those who are full-grown, yet a wisdom not of this age, neither of the rulers of this age, who are being brought to nought.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Here Paul seems to be saying, Don t think that we do not have wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have wisdom and we can speak wisdom, but we speak wisdom only to those who are full-grown.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You Corinthians are still babes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How is it possible for me to speak this wisdom to you?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verse 7 Paul goes on to say, But we speak God s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which God predestined before the ages for our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The expression wisdom in a mystery implies that the wisdom is the mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This wisdom, this mystery, is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Furthermore, Christ as the wisdom in a mystery has been predestined by God before the ages for our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ as the wisdom and the mystery will be our portion in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE DEPTHS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ as God s wisdom in a mystery is even the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 10 Paul says, For God has revealed them to us through the Spirit; for the Spirit searches all things, even the depths of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ Himself is the deep things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every genuine Christian knows that Christ is the Savior who died on the cross for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, to know Christ in this way is to know only superficial things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What, then, are the depths?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ as the depths of God includes such matters as God s wisdom and mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before you were saved, did you know the purpose of the universe, and did you know the meaning of human life?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Certainly you did not know these things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You did not know the purpose of your life on earth or what your destiny would be.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Both the purpose of the universe and the meaning of your life were a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Only when we receive a vision concerning Christ and experience God s salvation can we understand the mysteries of the universe and of our life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many Christians have received Christ s salvation, but they have not seen the vision concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As a result, they still do not know the meaning of life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But when we see the vision of Christ in God s economy, we begin to realize that Christ Himself is the purpose of the universe and also the meaning of our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We were created by God for Christ, and today we are living for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is our life, the purpose of our life, and also the goal of our living.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Furthermore, Christ is our destiny; we are heading toward Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we receive such a vision concerning Christ, we begin to know the mystery of the universe and of human life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Spontaneously we become wise, for we have Christ as God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then, little by little and step by step, we begin to know Christ as the depths of God.</S>
