<h1 class="title">PREACHING THE GOSPEL<br />
AND ESTABLISHING A LIVING<br />
OF EATING THE LORD</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRIST WHOM WE EXPERIENCE<br />
BEING THE CENTRAL CONTENT OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p><em>Question: We have only a dozen saints in my locality. How should we preach the gospel?</em></p>
<p>Answer: We preach what we are. We are the way to preach the gospel. We should not follow the methods used in Christianity. Even if these methods are good, they are merely methods that present the transitional gospel. We need to experience and enjoy Christ; then we can preach the gospel based on the Christ whom we enjoy. We need to preach according to our living, that is, preach the gospel that we experience. The content of our gospel should not be limited to the shallow gospel commonly preached by Christians.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 3:8 Paul says that God commanded him to announce the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel. Hence, we should preach the Christ whom we enjoy. Sometimes we may need to heal the sick or cast out demons when we preach the gospel; signs and wonders may also accompany our preaching at times, but we should not make these items our center. The center of our gospel is the Christ whom we experience. The purpose of preaching the gospel is not to save people so that they may &ldquo;go to heaven&rdquo;; rather, we preach Christ so that we may preach the church. According to Romans, such a gospel has four stations. It begins with justification, passes through sanctification and the Body of Christ, and ends with the local churches. This is the gospel that we should preach.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT REPLACING CHRIST WITH CULTURE</h2>
<p><em>Question: Some co-workers say that if we want the Japanese people to gain Christ, we must tailor our gospel to match the needs of the Japanese and use their culture, including literature and proverbs, to make the gospel easier for people to receive. According to the revelation in the Bible, however, preaching the gospel is simply to minister the life of Christ in a pure way to people. There is no need to use anything other than Christ. Furthermore, according to Paul&rsquo;s perspective concerning the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus (Phil. 3:8), culture is refuse. Since this is the case, should we use the Japanese culture as a means to preach the gospel?</em></p>
<p>Answer: Culture is helpful if it is used properly. If culture is used improperly, it will replace Christ. People without culture are like animals; therefore, culture has a function. Culture covers a very broad range of items. It includes nearly everything in human life, such as giving birth and raising children, and many items, such as clothing, food, housing, transportation, education, entertainment, society, public security, national governance, and different occupations. To say that we do not need culture means that we do not need these things. It is wrong to say that culture is not needed. However, we must realize that culture should not replace Christ, no matter how good it is. Culture is similar to the law in the Old Testament, because both should bring us to Christ (Gal. 3:24).</p>
<p>The Ten Commandments are very good. The first commandment says that there is only one God and that we should have no other gods beside Him (Exo. 20:2-3). The second commandment says that we should not make or worship idols (vv. 4-6). The third commandment says that we should not take the name of God in vain (v. 7). The fourth commandment requires us to keep the Sabbath (vv. 8-11). Although we may not keep the Sabbath according to the Mosaic law, there is nothing wrong with taking a day of rest after six days of work. The fifth commandment requires us to honor our parents (v. 12). The last five commandments say that we should not kill, commit adultery, steal, lie, or covet (vv. 13-17). If we abandon these commandments, we will worship idols, commit sins, steal, murder, and do all kinds of evil; there would be bandits and robbers in every place. We should not have the concept that the law is refuse and can be thrown away. We must understand that the function of the law is to bring people to Christ, but the law should not replace Christ. If the law replaces Christ, then it is wrong.</p>
<p>In understanding and applying the words of the Bible, we should not interpret them out of context, nor should we be extreme. For example, in Colossians 3:11 Paul says that there can be neither Greek nor Jew in the new man. However, it would be absurd to give up our nationality because of this. Our living must be balanced. On the one hand, Paul stresses that there can be neither Greek nor Jew in the new man, but on the other hand, he wisely utilized his Roman citizenship in order to be delivered from persecution when he was bound by the Romans. He said to the centurion, &ldquo;Is it lawful for you to scourge a man who is a Roman and uncondemned?&rdquo; (Acts 22:25). When the centurion heard that Paul was a Roman, he reported it to his commander. Although the commander acquired his Roman citizenship with a large sum of money, Paul was born a Roman. Therefore, those who were about to examine Paul withdrew from him. The commander also was afraid, realizing that he had bound a Roman (vv. 26-29). Paul wisely used his Roman citizenship to be saved from persecution.</p>
<p>In Acts 25 Paul told Festus that he was appealing to Caesar (vv. 10-11). Those who are extreme might accuse Paul, saying, &ldquo;Did you not say that you have forsaken all things and consider them as refuse? Surely Caesar is included in &lsquo;all things&rsquo; and is therefore refuse. Why do you appeal to Caesar instead of depending on God?&rdquo; Paul appealed to Caesar so that he might fulfill his desire of going to Rome in order to spread the Lord&rsquo;s testimony (19:21). This desire was also according to the Lord&rsquo;s instruction (23:11). If Paul had not appealed to Caesar, he would have been killed (cf. vv. 12-15; 25:1-3).</p>
<p>Countries have traffic rules as part of their culture. A person who ignores traffic rules, thinking that they are refuse, will eventually have an accident. National governance is of God for the purpose of maintaining an environment in which man can live in order to receive the Lord&rsquo;s salvation and be His testimony. All things are for the Lord, but they should not replace the Lord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_040.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_042.html">Next</a> </body></html>
