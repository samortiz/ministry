<h2 class="head2 alignleft">Excerpts from the Ministry:</h2>
<p>I would like to bring out the matter of multiplying the five loaves (Mark 6:35-44; 8:1-9) with respect to God&rsquo;s blessing. It is not a matter of how many loaves we have in our hands, but whether or not God has blessed them. Even if we had more than five loaves, this would not be enough to feed four or five thousand people. Even if we had ten times or even one hundred times more, we still would not have enough to feed four or five thousand people. It is not a matter of how much we have. Sooner or later, we must be brought to the point of seeing that it is not a matter of what we can pull out of our storage shed, nor is it a matter of how great our gift is or how much power we have. The day must come in which we say to the Lord, &ldquo;Everything depends on Your blessing.&rdquo; This is a basic matter. How much blessing has the Lord really given us? It does not really matter how many loaves there are. The Lord&rsquo;s blessing nourishes people and gives them life.</p>
<p>One matter is troubling my heart: Do we truly treasure God&rsquo;s blessing? This is a basic question concerning the work. Perhaps we do not even have five loaves today, but our need is greater than four thousand or five thousand people. I am afraid that we have less in our storehouse than the apostles, but our need is greater than the need at the time of the apostles. Our own store, source, power, labor, and faithfulness will be manifest one day that they are useless to us. Brothers, our future holds great disappointment for us because we will see that we can do nothing.</p>
<p>Brothers, if God brings us to the point of seeing that everything in God&rsquo;s work depends upon His blessing, it will bring about a basic change in our labor for God. We would not consider how many people, how much money, or how much bread we have. We would say we do not have enough, but the blessing is sufficient. The blessing meets the need that we cannot meet. Although we cannot measure up to the size of the need, the blessing is greater than our lack. When we see this, the work will have a basic change. In every matter we must look at the blessing more than we consider the situation. Methods, considerations, human wisdom, and clever words are all useless. In God&rsquo;s work we should believe in and expect His blessing. Many times we are careless and damage the work, but this is not a problem. If the Lord gives us a small blessing, we can get through any problem.</p>
<p>We truly hope that we would not make mistakes or speak and act loosely in the work. When we have the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, however, it seems that we cannot err even when we are wrong. Sometimes it seems that we have made a serious mistake, but with God&rsquo;s blessing the result is not really an error. I once said to Brother Witness that if we had the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, the things we did right would be right and the things we did wrong would be right as well. Nothing could damage the blessing.</p>
<p>The basic concern today is that we must learn to live in a way that does not hinder God&rsquo;s blessing. Some habits force God to withhold His blessing, and these must be eliminated. Some temperaments keep God from blessing, and these must be done away with. We must learn to believe in God&rsquo;s blessing, rely on it, and eliminate the barriers that prevent us from receiving it.</p>
<p>We must see that the Lord withholds no good thing from us. If the work is not going well, if the brothers and sisters are in a poor condition, or if the number of saved ones is not increasing, we should not use the environment or certain people as an excuse. We cannot blame the brothers. I am afraid that the real reason lies with our harboring of some frustrations to the blessing. If the Lord can get through in us, the Lord&rsquo;s blessing will be greater than our capacity. Once God said to the Israelites, &ldquo;Prove Me, if you will, by this,...whether I will open to you the windows of heaven and pour out blessing for you until there is no room for it&rdquo; (Mal. 3:10). God is still saying this today. The normal life of a Christian is a life of blessing, and the normal work of a Christian is a work of blessing. If we do not receive blessing, we should say, &ldquo;Lord, perhaps I am the problem.&rdquo;</p>
<p>What is blessing? Blessing is God working without any cause. Logically speaking, one penny should buy one penny&rsquo;s worth of goods. But sometimes, without spending a cent, God gives us ten thousand pennies&rsquo; worth of goods. This means that what we have received is beyond reckoning. God&rsquo;s blessing is any work He performs without cause. This work surpasses what we should receive. Five loaves fed five thousand people, and there were still twelve full baskets left over! This is blessing. Some people should not get a certain kind of result. They should only have a little, but surprisingly they have much. Our entire work is built upon God&rsquo;s blessing. The blessing is the result of receiving what we do not deserve, that is, the result of receiving beyond what our gift warrants us to receive. The result that we get, which is beyond what our strength earns, is the blessing. Putting it more strongly, we do not deserve any results because of our weaknesses and failures, but astoundingly we obtain something, and what we obtain is the blessing. If we look for God&rsquo;s blessing, He will give us unexpected results. In our service do we hope for God to give us great results? Many brothers and sisters only look for results that can be expected from themselves alone. Blessing means that the result is not in proportion to the cause.</p>
<p>If we only look for results based on what we are, if we only look for a little fruit, and if we do not hope for great results, we run the risk of losing God&rsquo;s blessing. Since we only pay attention to the fact that we are laboring night and day, God cannot do anything beyond our expectation. We must put ourselves in a position in which God can bless us. We must say to the Lord, &ldquo;Based on what we are, we should not obtain any results, but, Lord, for the sake of Your name, Your church, and Your way, we hope You will give something to us.&rdquo; Having faith in the work is believing and expecting God&rsquo;s blessing. In God&rsquo;s work, having faith means having the conviction that the result will not be in proportion to us. When we practice this, I believe God will bless our way. I hope that as the brothers discuss the matter of the migrations, the Lord&rsquo;s blessing will exceed our expectation.</p>
<p>The entire future of the work depends on God&rsquo;s blessing, not on being right. If God blesses, then many sinners will be saved. If God blesses, we will be able to send people out to the remote regions. If there is no blessing, people will not get saved. If there is no blessing, workers will not be produced. If there is no blessing, no one will offer anything. If there is no blessing, no one will migrate. When the blessing is here, even things that seem wrong are right. When God blesses, we cannot go wrong even if we try. One time there was a meeting in which it seemed that we sang the wrong hymn, but we had a good result because we had God&rsquo;s blessing. Sometimes when we preach, it seems that we are speaking the wrong word to the wrong audience, but God still blesses some in the audience. When we speak again, we still may speak the wrong word, but God blesses another group of people. I am not saying that we can be loose intentionally. I am saying that we cannot go wrong when we have God&rsquo;s blessing. It seems that our mistakes should be a frustration, but He cannot be hindered. God said, &ldquo;Jacob have I loved, but Esau have I hated&rdquo; (Rom. 9:13). God blesses whom He likes. This is a very serious matter. We should not think that the blessing is a small thing. The blessing is souls and consecrated people. Behind the word <em>blessing</em> perhaps there are fifty souls or one hundred consecrations. The words, attitudes, and opinions of certain people can stop the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. We must ask the Lord to prick us inwardly until we obtain His blessing. If we do not do this, our sin of losing the Lord&rsquo;s blessing will be greater than any other sin. The blessing could be hundreds or thousands of souls. We must look to God for the blessing and not let it escape. We must beg God to give us grace. (<em>Expecting the Lord&rsquo;s Blessing,</em> pp. 1-3, 5-7, 7-8, 13-15, 16-18)</p>
<h2 class="head1">FEEDING THE PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Matthew 14:19 says, &ldquo;And after commanding the crowds to recline on the grass, He took the five loaves and the two fish, and looking up to heaven, He blessed and broke the loaves and gave them to the disciples, and the disciples to the crowds.&rdquo; The Lord fed the people; He ministered the life supply to them. By having the crowds recline on the grass, He put the people into good order. This shows the Lord&rsquo;s wisdom and orderliness. By looking up to heaven the heavenly King indicated that His source was His Father in the heavens. Then He blessed the loaves and fish and broke them. This indicates that whatever we bring to the Lord must be broken for it to become a blessing to others.</p>
<p>After the Lord broke the loaves, He gave them to the disciples. The loaves were from the disciples, and they brought them to the Lord. After being blessed and broken by the Lord, they were given back to the disciples for distribution to the crowds, to whom the loaves became a great satisfaction. This indicates that the disciples were not the source of blessing; they were only the channels used by the Lord, who was the source of the people&rsquo;s satisfaction. The broken bread was passed on to the disciples, and the disciples distributed it to the crowds. This broken bread became the satisfaction to all the hungry people, and there was great blessing. The principle is the same today. No doubt there has been great blessing in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery in this country. Nevertheless, we must realize that some dear ones have offered themselves to the Lord. In the Lord&rsquo;s hand, they all have been broken, and those broken pieces have brought in the blessing. (<em>Life-study of Matthew,</em> pp. 517, 518)</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE ONENESS OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</h2>
<p>The believers need to practice the oneness of the Divine Trinity in the Divine Trinity as the Divine Trinity does (John 17:21-23). We need to ask ourselves what kind of oneness we are practicing. Some claim to be practicing the oneness of the Body, but they are actually practicing a sectarian, factious oneness. The oneness of the Body is the oneness of the Triune God. We practice the oneness of the Divine Trinity not in ourselves but in the Divine Trinity. The three of the Divine Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are continually practicing the divine oneness. For example, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I and the Father are one&rdquo; (10:30). The oneness of the Father and the Son includes the Spirit, who is the consummation and totality of the Triune God. The Spirit is also the Triune God reaching us. When Christ came into us, He came as the Spirit. Wherever the Father and the Son are, there the Spirit is also. (<em>The Secret of God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation: &ldquo;The Spirit Himself with Our Spirit,&rdquo;</em> p. 53)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>We must realize that the practices in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery are not matters for others to copy. You must have the life. To do anything you need the life. You have to see what the landmark was of the one hundred twenty in the book of Acts. The landmark that divides the Gospels and the Acts was not the baptism in the Holy Spirit. The landmark was the one accord of the one hundred twenty. If you want to experience the baptism in the Spirit, you must have the one accord. If all the members of a local church have the one accord, the baptism in the Spirit will be there. If you really want to practice the proper way to preach the gospel, you need the one accord. Without this key, no door can be opened. The one accord is the &ldquo;master key to all the rooms,&rdquo; the master key to every blessing in the New Testament. This is why Paul told Euodias and Syntyche that they needed this one accord (Phil. 4:2). Paul knew that these sisters loved the Lord, but that they had lost the one accord.</p>
<p>What we need is to recover this one accord. If we mean business to go along with the Lord&rsquo;s present-day move, we need this one accord. Who is right does not mean anything; we need this one accord. We need to have the same mind and the same will for the same purpose with the same soul and the same heart. Philippians tells us that this matter starts from our spirit (1:27), yet we must realize we are not persons of spirit only. We are persons also of the mind, will, purpose, soul, and heart. For us to be in the same one spirit with the same one soul, one mind, and one will is to have the one accord, which is the key to all the New Testament blessings and bequests. Otherwise, we will repeat the pitiful history of Christianity by being another group of Christians repeating the same kind of disaccord. (<em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Book 7: One Accord for the Lord&rsquo;s Move,</em> pp. 18-19)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>On one side, God&rsquo;s move depends upon Himself as the consummated Spirit. He needs us as the other side so there could be the possibility of accomplishment. If we do not render Him any kind of cooperation or give Him any kind of response, nothing can happen, regardless of how powerful, dynamic, and mighty the Holy Spirit of the Triune God can be. God can do the work of creation by Himself but not the work of the new creation. The new creation work must be carried out in the principle of incarnation, the principle of God being one with man, making one entity out of two elements with no third element produced. The Holy Spirit is the power, the means, and the factor for God&rsquo;s move on this earth, but that is just on one side. There is the need of another side, the human side. There is the need of another factor&mdash;the one accord.</p>
<p>The matter of one accord controls the entire revelation concerning the Lord&rsquo;s move on one side. If there were no Spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s side, it would be impossible for the Lord to move on this earth at all. In the same principle, without the one accord on our side, God cannot move. We have to match God. He is now the consummated Spirit, and we have to say, &ldquo;Lord, we are ready here as the very one accord. We want to not only render but we are also ready to offer to You this one accord.&rdquo; Immediately there is a kind of marriage, and a couple comes out. Then anything can be done. (<em>Elders&rsquo; Training, Book 7: One Accord for the Lord&rsquo;s Move,</em> pp. 99, 100)</p>
