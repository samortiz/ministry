   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST AS PRIEST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This God-Man is also a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He has all the virtues with no shortage whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose His priestly garment were short, exposing His feet and legs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This would indicate that He lacks some virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, His long robe signifies that He is short of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Bible, a priest should not be exposed in any part Exo 20:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All parts of His body must be clothed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Clothing in the Bible means righteousness Isa 64:6; Rev 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that we have been justified by the righteous God; we can stand in the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This God-Man has human virtues that are sufficient to cover His whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is indicated by His long priestly robe.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He is fully qualified to be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But now He is not a priest at the altar in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That work is over.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now He is in the Holy Place, taking care of the lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>CHRIST AS THE SHINING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This wonderful Christ is also the shining One.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His face is like the shining of the sun, and His eyes are like flaming fire.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>His two feet are also like shining brass.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that He has passed through all kinds of testing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was tested and He was burned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Every step He took on this earth was tested.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He passed all the tests, and now He is qualified to test others.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He does not test us by His opinion, but by His two feet.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From His head to His feet, He is a shining Person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we come into His presence, there is no darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead we are under the absolute shining.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nothing can be hidden or concealed in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Everything is exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do you like this kind of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our brother John was frightened to death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not forget that the Apostle John was the one who leaned on His breast when Christ was on earth John 13:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At that time there was no burning and shining, but here John fell at His feet as dead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the church life, everyone needs to have such an exposure.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sooner or later, whether it is this year or next, we will be in His presence and have an exposure that will frighten us to death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We will see that whatever we are, whatever we have, and whatever we do cannot stand His testing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we will fall down at His feet as ones dead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>SHORT OF EATING</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why will we be so exposed in His presence?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is simply because we are short of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are undernourished.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In reading chapters two and three of Revelation, we see the concept of degraded Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This religious concept is altogether a matter of doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is the doctrine of Balaam, the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, and the teaching of Jezebel Rev 2:14-15, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The word doctrine is mentioned three times and teaching once.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is religion?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Religion is something composed of doctrines upon doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The more doctrines there are, the better religion it is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The degraded churches only care for doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the concept of the living Christ who has such a care for the churches is to give His dear ones something to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In all seven epistles to the churches there are three promises of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There is one in the first epistle concerning the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is one in the middle concerning the hidden manna.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There is also a promise of eating in the last epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Behold I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will feast with him, and he with me Rev 3:20, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>. This is a promise of feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some Christians only use this verse half way.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They speak of the Lord knocking at our heart s door, wanting to come in. If we will open the door, He will come in. This is all they say.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is right, but it is only half of the verse.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What about the other half?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When I was in Christianity, I listened to this message concerning the Lord s knocking many times.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I never heard anyone say that when Jesus comes in, He will feast with us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They do speak about the coming in, but they forget about the feasting.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But the coming in is for the feasting!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Jesus did not say that when we open the door in answer to His knocking He will come in and feast by Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He said that He would feast with us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The first two promises were concerned just with eating, but in the last promise there is the feasting together with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is wonderful!</S>
