<h2 class=head2>Walking according to the Spirit by the Inner Anointing</h2><p>Romans 8:4 tells us to walk according to the spirit. To walk according to the spirit means to go along with the spirit. How can we know the spirit? It is by the sense of life and peace. To understand the sense of life is rather difficult, but to say something about the sense of peace is easier. Whatever we do, we must check within us whether or not we have the peace. Of course, this peace is not an outward peace but an inward peace. Do we have the inner peace or not?<p>This peace is the issue and result of the inner anointing. When we set our mind on the spirit, the Spirit moves and works within us. If we go along with the anointing, we will feel peaceful, comfortable, and very much in the light. We will be refreshed, strengthened, and satisfied. This is the anointing, and this is the sense of life. We should simply follow this consciousness within. To follow this inner sense, this inner consciousness, means that we are walking according to the spirit.<p>How do we know that we have life? We are refreshed, strengthened, energized, and satisfied within. Similarly, we know that we have peace because we are at ease and in the light. When we feel empty and darkened within and when we sense a lack of inner peace and comfort, this means that we are not walking according to the spirit. However, when we walk according to the spirit, within us we are always refreshed, satisfied, and strengthened. We continually experience life, peace, and comfort. This means that we are following the Spirit.<h2 class=head2>Being Led by the Spirit</h2><p>Romans 8 uses another term—led by the Spirit. Verse 14 says, “For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.” Even though led is a small word of three letters, it is very important. When we set our mind on the spirit and walk according to the spirit, we are constantly led by the Spirit. In this way we live the life of the genuine sons of God. We are sons of God not only in life and nature but also in daily walk. In daily walk and in everything we are led by the Holy Spirit, and we cooperate with Him in every way.<h2 class=head2>Being Conformed to the Image of the Son of God</h2><p>Following this, Romans 8:29 speaks of being conformed to the image of God’s Son. By walking according to the spirit, we are progressively conformed to the image of Christ. This is a progression; it is not something accomplished once for all. This is a work that lasts our entire life. The more we walk according to the spirit, the more we are conformed to the image of Christ. This is God’s intention. God’s intention is to conform us to the image of His Son, that is, to make His Son the Firstborn among many brothers. His intention is to reproduce many sons by and with His Son as the model, the form. Therefore, we must be conformed to the very form, the very image, of Christ.<p>Day by day, little by little, and part by part the Holy Spirit progressively conforms us to the image of Christ. Verse 28 says, “All things work together for good.” This is for the purpose to conform us to the image of Christ. For our conformation we need the Holy Spirit within and “all things” outside of us. This may be compared to baking a cake. To bake a cake, we need the batter within, and we need the heat from the outside. The “batter” on the inside is the Holy Spirit, and the “heat” on the outside is “all things.”<p>Romans 8 has two sections. In the first half there is the Spirit working within, and in the second half, the “all things” work together for good without. All things include sufferings, tribulation, anguish, persecution, famine, nakedness, peril, sword, death, life, angels, principalities, things present, things to come, powers, and so forth (vv. 35, 38). Even our dear wife and children are included in the all things. We praise God that these all things are under His sovereign hand. His sovereign hand is working to arrange all necessary things for our good. This is for the purpose of conforming us to the image of Christ, that is, to produce many brothers for Christ as sons of God so that the only begotten Son might become the Firstborn among many brothers.
