<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1><h1 class="title">THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 26, 1948, evening<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">GOD'S SALVATION AND DEMANDS BEING<br />THE SAME TODAY AS AT THE BEGINNING</h2><p>I believe that God is going to do great things today, and I believe that God has done something great already. God has given us a great salvation, a thorough salvation. In the first century God saved men. Today He is doing the same thing. The extent to which God saved men in the first century is the extent to which He is saving men today. God has not changed the gospel in the course of two thousand years of human history. There has been no change in the result and the demands of the gospel. We should not think that first century Christians were required to pay a great price, but that we do not need to pay the same price today. Those who follow the Lord today must pay the same price as those in the first century. At that time men had to forsake everything. The requirement has not changed. There is, of course, a difference between putting a lamp under a bushel and putting it on the lampstand, but the lamp itself has not changed.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DEGRADATION AND<br />THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</h2><p>During the past two thousand years, the gospel has not changed. On the very day that the church was produced, God saw this new creation and considered that it was good. This is like God considering everything as good in Genesis after He created everything in six days. After some time, the situation changed. Although the situation changed, the beauty of the original creation remains the same. The beauty of the church on the first day at Pentecost was comparable to the beauty of Eve on the day of her creation. However, the church gradually changed. It changed from Ephesus to Sardis. At the time of Martin Luther, God began to take the way of recovery step by step. For the past four hundred years, God did some recovery work every fifty years. During the past one hundred years, His work has been especially strong. It seems as if the last few decades have seen the peak of recovery. There has never been a time when the church has been as rich as it is now.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BODY TESTIMONY BEING GOD'S FINAL RECOVERY</h2><p>We believe that God is recovering the most difficult thing today. What worries us the most today is the fulfillment of Ephesians 4. It seems as though we do not have to worry about the fulfillment of John 3:16. We are not afraid that it will not be fulfilled, and we are not worried. Suppose someone says that he has believed and asks what he should do if he still has not received eternal life. He has believed, yet he has not seen any result. What should he do? We are not worried about this. I have read the New Testament more than two hundred times. I am not worried about any other passage. I have even read Revelation a few hundred times. I am not worried about that book either. However, I am worried about Ephesians 4. I am concerned about how this passage of the Scriptures will be fulfilled.</p><p>Ephesians 4 says that the work of the ministry is to arrive at the oneness of the faith. The church is the Body of Christ, and it builds itself up in love. We are not concerned about things like the new heaven, the new earth, and the lake of fire. But when I lie on my bed, I am always apprehensive about the fulfillment of Ephesians 4. I have studied the Bible, and I have prayed, but I still do not have the assurance that the condition in Ephesians 4 will be fulfilled in the church today. Among God's children today, there is much confusion, and there are all kinds of divisions. When will we be one? Today there are all kinds of ministries; the situation is very complicated. How can this chapter be recovered?</p><p>Yet, brothers and sisters, we believe that there will be a day when God's recovery will reach the fulfillment of Ephesians 4. God is doing a recovery work everywhere. The ultimate work among all these works may very well be the recovery of the Body testimony. God's leading today is to bring us back to the beginning and to recover us to the condition at the beginning.</p>
