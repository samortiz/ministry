   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second office is that of an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The office of an elder is also spoken of often in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the Purpose of Taking Care of the Church</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The office of the elder is for the purpose of taking care of the church, that is, for administrating the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Possibly Being</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>a Minister of the Word at the Same Time</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The elder does not necessarily need to be a gifted person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In other words, he is not necessarily a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If he is a minister of the word, he is even more worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Bible the ministry of the word is one thing, and an office in the church is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The elders belong to the side of the office of the church and are altogether for executing, administrating, and overseeing the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But the eldership is an office.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the same time an elder may or may not be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If he is a minister of the word, he is even more worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As Paul says, he is "worthy of double honor'' 1 Tim 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because he is a minister of the word before God, being apt to teach, and an elder of the church at the same time, he is worthy of double honor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Basic Requirement Being Spirituality</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The words in the Bible concerning the requirements for an elder are quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are two things which I wish to point out to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The basic requirement of an elder is that he should be one who has understanding in spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>An elder should be a person who has spiritual value, who knows spiritual things, who has spiritual understanding, who knows the way in spiritual things, and whose spiritual course is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>An elder needs to have considerable experience concerning spiritual things and to know before God what the spiritual condition of other children of God is; then he can take care of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the spiritual side the elders must have this spiritual foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In addition, they need God-given abilities and gifts so that they can take care of the affairs of the church and administrate them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such a person can be an elder of the church before God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I hope that you will not select an elder for the church who only knows how to handle practical affairs and how to direct things and yet has no spiritual understanding before God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I know that many localities have problems, and the failure is altogether related to selecting those who are famous in the world, who have position, who know how to handle practical affairs, who have ability, and who are experienced in the ways of the world to be elders in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Please remember that a person who is capable of handling practical affairs, managing a social organization, and taking care of a family may not necessarily be able to take care of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is because the basic requirement in the church is to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Administrative Experiences Being Useless</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There is a brother who has twenty years of administrative experience.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many brothers have come and asked me, "Why not ask that brother to be an elder?''</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I said, "His twenty years of administrative experience do not count as even one year in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even though he is a good Christian, he does not have enough understanding concerning spiritual things.''</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The church is spiritual, and a person must have spiritual weight before God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He must have spiritual ways and a condition of being spiritual in order to be an elder; otherwise, if this brother were to come in, he would produce problems immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We would rather select one who has spiritual weight, even if he has no ability in handling practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Of course, it is best for him to have both aspects: to know the spiritual things and also to be able to handle practical affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If a person does not know how to manage his own household, how can he take care of the church of God?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But this is only half of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Does this mean that a person who can manage his own household can take care of the house of God?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No, it does not!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Being spiritual is the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Not everyone who can manage his own household can take care of the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Many people can manage their household well, but they are not even saved.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Can we then invite them to take care of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only one who has a way in spiritual things and who can also manage his household can be an elder and administrate the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, when you select a responsible brother, always select one who has spiritual weight, who has spiritual ways, and who does not easily become proud, overly excited, or puffed up.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The life of this person before God needs to be reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Select one whose life is reliable, but do not select anyone who is proud.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Select one who is stable, but not the so-called genius.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the spiritual side this person should be stable and firm, having spiritual insight, spiritual knowledge, and spiritual understanding before God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Only such a person can be selected.</S>
