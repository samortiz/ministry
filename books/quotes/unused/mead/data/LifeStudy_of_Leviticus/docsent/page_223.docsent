   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eating the Flesh of Their Children</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"And you will eat the flesh of your sons, and the flesh of your daughters you will eat" v. 29 . This signifies that the church becomes so poor that it is unable to satisfy its members but bereaves them of their food supply.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In such a situation the shortage of the food supply reaches the extent of there being nothing to eat except the "children," that is, what the church members produced in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Their Carcasses Being Cast upon the Carcasses of Their Idols</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"I will destroy your high places, and cut down your incense altars, and cast your carcasses upon the carcasses of your idols; and My soul shall abhor you" v. 30 . This signifies that the fleshly churches place themselves as carcasses upon the goals other than God that were sought by them as idols and destroyed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here we see that in such a church God comes in to destroy both the idols and those who worship them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In such a church there is nothing but a heap of carcasses.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>3.</S>

   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"I will lay waste your cities, and desolate your sanctuaries; and I will not smell your satisfying fragrance" v. 31 . This signifies that the churches are laid waste and their worship is desolated, and there is no satisfaction as a fragrance to God.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Land Being Desolated and Inhabited by Their Enemies</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"I will desolate the land, so that your enemies who dwell in it will be appalled over it" v. 32 . This signifies that the church's enjoyment of Christ as the rich land is desolated and stolen by the enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In such a church there is no longer the enjoyment of Christ, for this enjoyment has been stolen by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A church in which this happens is a church which has lost the enjoyment of Christ to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>5.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being Scattered among the Nations and Chased by the Unsheathed Sword</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"And I will scatter you among the nations and unsheathe the sword after you; your land shall be a desolation and your cities a waste" v. 33 . The unsheathed sword signifies God's death-judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The people being scattered among the nations and chased by the unsheathed sword signifies that the church is scattered among the Gentiles and driven by the death-judgment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Land Enjoying Its Sabbath during Their Captivity</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"Then the land will enjoy its sabbaths all the days that it lies desolate, while you are in the land of your enemies; then the land will rest and enjoy its sabbaths.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the days that it lies desolate it will keep a sabbath, a sabbath which it did not keep in your sabbaths, when you lived upon it" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>34-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The land enjoying its sabbath during their captivity signifies that the church's enjoyment of Christ as the rich land lies waste after the believers are scattered among the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Thus far in my church life, I have not seen this kind of situation.</S>
