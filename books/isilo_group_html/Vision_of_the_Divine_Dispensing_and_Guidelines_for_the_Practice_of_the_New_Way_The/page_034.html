I would like to fellowship with you some serious matters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TWO SHORTAGES OF THE SERVING ONES</H2><P>Brother Watchman Nee once gave an illustration concerning those serving the Lord. He said that they are like clay in the hands of the potter. In the process of making vessels, many become useless. In the end, not many become useful vessels. I heard this warning over fifty years ago. It has given me a great deal of help over the years. I would like to say to you that, as those serving the Lord, we have four problems, that is, we have two shortages and two snares.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Coming Short of the Glory of God</H2><P>The first shortage is that of coming short of the glory of God (Rom. 3:23). What does it mean to come short of the glory of God? It means that we do not express God. We are created in the image of God. He lives within us. God is love, light, holiness, and righteousness. We should also live a life of love, light, holiness, and righteousness. In this way, we express God. If we do not do this, we come short of the glory of God. In the Lord's work, when a few coordinate together and work together for a while, a mutual understanding develops, and it becomes very easy for them to form into a party. Subconsciously, a feeling may arise: "This is our group" or "The others are different from what we are." The result is that we only care for our own work and do not care whether others have the opportunity to work or not. If this is the case, even if we are very successful, we are not building up the Body of Christ.</P><P>We have to realize that when we serve the Lord, we are not doing our own work. Rather, we are building up the Body of Christ. Hence, our work should not turn others to us but to the church. If those that you have brought to the Lord would go to another nearby church for the sake of convenience, you should rejoice over it. You should even encourage them to do this. You should not consider that, since he was one that you brought to the Lord and one that you have spent a lot of time and labor on, he should therefore not go to meet in another locality. This kind of thought does not glorify God. John 17:22-23 tells us that the Lord has given the believers the glory that the Father has given to Him and that they are now able to receive His sonship with the Father's life and the divine nature, so that they may express the Father in the Son. Today every one of us as a saved person has received God's life and nature and has become God's expression. However, in the Lord's work, if we are divided among ourselves or are fighting with one another for the people that we have brought to the Lord, it will be a great shame to God and will not be a glorious thing at all for the saved ones.</P><P>Furthermore, in serving the Lord, we should not have too intimate a relationship with anyone. I was with Brother Watchman Nee for eighteen years. Although we were not together all the time, we had much contact with each other for the sake of the Lord's work. We never dined with each other or had tea with each other for any reason that was exclusively personal in nature. Throughout the years, I have had close fellowship with many brothers, but we have never had a kind of special contact. We have always avoided worldly social contacts. You have to settle this matter in your heart. You cannot condemn many things as sin, and certain things may not be wrong in themselves, yet they will cause us to come short. As a result, we will not be able to glorify God. Many evils arise from this matter. You must avoid this matter at all cost.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_033.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_035.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision of the Divine Dispensing and Guidelines for the Practice of the New Way &nbsp; pg 34</div><br></body></html>
