<h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Witness Lee, Tientsin</h2><p>I arrived safely in Tientsin on the sixteenth of this month. The brothers and sisters are all doing well. Thank the Lord that we have His grace! By the Lord's grace I hope to have a few meetings with the brothers and sisters here and to learn to enter God's great riches through the matter of consecration. The Lord willing, I will be going to Peking on the second of next month, and I will stay there for at least half a month. Then I will see how the Lord leads. Brother Lee Jin-biao has written to me and asked me to go to Sui-Yuan. I am still not clear what the Lord's will is.</p><p>Brother Witness, July 30</p><h2 class="head2">Letter from Chang Tze-jieh, Tsingtao</h2><p>I read Issue No. 9 of The Open Door today. After reading Brother Hsu Jung-jieh's letter, my heart was pressed to obey the Lord willingly and go forward on the one hand, and to fill up the lack of my work in the past on the other hand.</p><p>From my conversation with Brother Witness Lee and from his prayers and letters, I can see that he is burdened for the work of the gospel in the northwest. He is so pressed that words cannot describe his feelings. It seems as if a fire is burning within him....I wish that I could have the opportunity to work together with Brother Witness again for a few days and receive help from him. Presently, I do not ask for power; I only ask that the portion the Lord has assigned to me be fulfilled. Nor do I hope for the work to expand. On the contrary, I am most fearful of falling into the condition of those in Matthew 7:22. I remember reading about God's chosen people being left on the east side of Jordan because some were for the pleasure of the flesh. Although they could help in warfare, receive blessing, and have the altar, they eventually became common. When I read that, I poured out my heart before the Lord and told Him that I was willing to die in the battlefield. I asked the Lord not to allow me to retreat in the heat of the battle or to crave ease and comfort. Oh, there is indeed the need for a people who would bring God to earth. Unless there is such a people, men will not obey God.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Tze-jieh, August 4</p><h2 class="head2">News from a Few Workers in Fukien Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>After Brother Chai completed his work in Yu-Si, he went to Ping-Tan and Su-Ao. Brother Jai-seng said that thirty-five people were baptized in Yu-Si, most of whom had been brought to the Lord through local ones. Praise the Lord! Brother Jai-seng has returned to Han River. The Lord willing, he will travel to villages around Dong-Yuen and Feng-Ji and will be working there. (Feng-Ji is the hometown of Brother Fang Jia-ze.) Sisters Wang Yu-chu and Chen Tien-leh have gone to work in Sien-You. They will also be working in the countryside. Last Lord's Day I met Sister Weigh Kwang-ying at Han River and found out that the Lord's calling has been very strong within her lately. She has decided to quit her tutoring job at Wang's house. May the Lord lead her.</p><p>Recently, I have followed the Lord's limitation and have rested in Him. Because of the lack of strength for further advance, I feel that I should pause a little before the Lord. Thank the Lord for His love and for His willingness to deal with us and trim us. During this period, I read The Spiritual Man again and treasured it very much. I was particularly enlightened and helped by the point about the passivity of the mind. During this week, by the Lord's grace, I studied the Bible with the brothers and sisters every evening. If the Lord is willing and if the co-workers obtain their passports, we will do some work in the upper part of Fukien. Please pray much for us.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chen Ke-san, August 9</p>
