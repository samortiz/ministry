<h1 class="title">THE WHOLE WORLD LIETH IN THE EVIL ONE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: 1 John 5:19</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Men are captives of the evil one
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Once men followed the evil one to commit sin, they became captives of the evil one.</li>
	<li>As soon as a man is born, he is in the position of a captive.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Men are in the power of the Devil
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To say that man became the Devil&rsquo;s captive means that man fell into the power of the Devil.</li>
	<li>To be in the power of the Devil is to be dominated by him.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Men are lying in the hands of the evil one
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Men are not only dominated by the Devil, but they are also manipulated by him.</li>
	<li>To be dominated means that one is refused his freedom; even worse, to be manipulated means one is led to act unwittingly, with no consciousness of being manipulated.</li>
	<li>To dominate is to deny one the freedom to do anything; to manipulate is to make one do something without the realization of what he is doing. A man lying in the hands of the Devil is like a patient on the operating table who, having been anesthetized, allows the doctor to operate freely.</li>
	<li>Give examples to show how man is in the Devil&rsquo;s hand, committing sin without consciousness and without self-control.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to escape from the hands of the Devil
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Confess that you are in the hands of the Devil.</li>
	<li>Believe in Jesus as your Savior because He has destroyed the Devil and nullified the works of the Devil.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
