   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Considering Them Divisive Sects</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we should consider these divisions as divisive sects, like the denominations, not according to their condition but according to their standing, their ground.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you were to go to a meeting of the divisive ones, as a pretense they might behave in a very spiritual way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This kind of behavior is a matter of their condition.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this book I have used the illustration of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Marriage is based upon the chastity of the wife, not upon her niceness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A wife may be very nice, but if her husband is Mr. Smith and she begins to call herself Mrs. Jones, regardless of how nice, humble, and submissive she may be toward her husband, the base of her marriage will be annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The base of a marriage is not the wife's condition but her chastity.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a wife is chaste, even though at times she may not treat her husband nicely, that is, even though her condition may be somewhat poor, she still has the proper standing as a wife.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Concerning today's situation among us, we need to exercise the proper discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must discern whether a certain group of believers is a genuine church or a division, not according to their condition but according to their standing, their ground.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Regarding one's condition, it is possible to pretend, but concerning the ground on which one stands, no one can pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are either on the proper ground or we are not.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just as a woman cannot pretend to have one unique husband, we cannot pretend to be on the proper ground of the church in the unique fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Not Recommending Any Believer</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>in the Local Churches</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>to Have Any Share in the Divisions</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Second, we should not recommend any believer in the local churches to have any share in the meetings and activities of the divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, there may be some who attend the Lord's table meeting in a local church and, after taking the table, they leave to go to a meeting of the divisive ones to listen to a message.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If any believer in the local churches would attend the meetings and share the activities of those divisions, the local churches should not put him away from the fellowship of the church, as long as he is not infected by and does not promote anything that is divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our dealing with such a person depends on whether or not he has been infected by the "germs" of division, and whether or not he is passing on those germs to others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If he does pass on those germs, we must advise him not to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We cannot tolerate any germs of division.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Not Rejecting Any Believer</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Who Does Not Promote Anything Divisive</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If any believer who is meeting with any of these sectarian divisions would attend the meetings of the local churches, or contact the believers meeting in the local churches, he should not be rejected, as long as he does not promote anything divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Considering as Divisive and Rejecting Anyone Who Promotes Sectarian Divisions</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, anyone who is aggressive for and promotes the sectarian divisions should be considered divisive and should be rejected after a first and second admonition Titus 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I believe that this is the fair and scriptural way to deal with the divisions that have separated themselves from the genuine local churches and have broken the unique fellowship of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Anyhow, according to the apostles' teaching in the New Testament, anyone who makes the division, who is divisive and bears the "germs" of division, that is, who is factious, sectarian, we should refuse them Titus 3:10 and turn away from them Rom 16:17 .</S>
