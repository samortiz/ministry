   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Submitting to Authority and</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Receiving the Riches of the Members</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's work today is the recovery of the testimony of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This Body testimony is not a doctrine, but a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this Body, there is the perfecting ministry Eph 4:12 , and there is spiritual authority.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A close relationship exists between ministry and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Where there is ministry, there is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In fact, ministry is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Ephesians 4, we see that the Body requires all kinds of gifts, the goal of which is the perfecting of all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In order for the members to be perfected, there is the need to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To submit to authority is to submit to the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Today, the sisters cover their heads with respect to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, everyone should cover his head with respect to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not have individual heads; only Christ is the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Those who want to retain their heads are trying to practice individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who promote individualism in the Body are troublemakers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only Christ is the Head; on the other hand, Christ covers His head before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Although my hands and my feet are far away from my head, they are still under the direction of the head.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, for us to submit to the members is in reality for us to submit to the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The mouth may be very important, but it still needs help from the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without the eyes and the ears, the mouth alone will be useless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is why I do not believe in the so-called personal revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Bible, there are such things as individuals receiving grace from the Lord, and there are such things as individuals being sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet at the same time, there is the aspect of our relationship with the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What do we have today that is not received from others?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The greatest heresies in the world came from those who received so-called direct revelations from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If an individual can receive revelation alone, then a person needs only to be a Christian individually; there is no need for us to come together to meet any longer, and all the "one another's," the "we's," and the "they's" in the Bible can be cut out.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A man has to humble himself and has to receive what others have already received.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a person has received something, it is much easier for another to receive from this one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For example, twenty years ago, it was difficult to find a person who was clear about his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But after we met one person like that, it became easier to meet more.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is true with the understanding of the truth of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is equally true with the understanding of all the other truths.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A STANDARD CHRISTIAN BEING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>ONE WHO BEARS THE BODY TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Bible reveals one great truth: the kind of Christian God wants is one who is after a Body testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, He wants Christians who will act as members of the one Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What we need today are standard Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What does it mean to be a standard Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A standard Christian is one in whom others can detect certain characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, when you sit down with a Presbyterian, he will tell you about God's predestination and will tell you that our salvation, regeneration, and justification are all based on God's predestination.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, if you sit down with a Methodist, he will tell you that everyone has to work out his own salvation, that repentance is an act of one's free will, that salvation is a result of one's willingness to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Everything depends on ourselves; if we do not do anything, we cannot even be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Among certain kinds of Christians, you can find certain kinds of characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christians today are not standard.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They lack a few basic characteristics, such as selling their possessions, consecrating themselves, repentance and confession of sins, and experiences of deliverance from the power of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In addition, there is one characteristic that is lacking the most among them, which is the realization of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to help the believers to experience these things as soon as we can.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A newly saved person will do whatever you tell him to do at the initial stage of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If he is allowed to go on for too long, he will become set, and it will become difficult to deal with him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hence, we have to speak to the believers some of these truths as soon as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Everybody likes to be nice and to say nice words; everyone likes to be polite to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But a person cannot be an up-to-standard Christian this way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the future we have to spend much time to study how to be a standard Christian, so that our next generation can become a brand-new breed of Christians.</S>
