Romans 12:11 says, 'Not slothful in zeal,' and Proverbs 6:6 says, 'Go to the ant, thou sluggard; consider her ways, and be wise'
The Chinese language uses an expression meaning 'ocean' to illustrate a person's capacity to be as large as the ocean
Since sand encompasses the sea, the biblical requirement concerning broadness is greater than that conveyed by the Chinese expression
Both the teacher who expounds the Scriptures and the elder who administrates the church must possess a just character
In dealing with important matters, a person who serves the Lord must remain calm in his mind, emotion, and will
The way to practice calmness is by not acting quickly and not believing rumors, which inevitably cause agitation

In considering the matter of character, we must give heed to our daily life, which is able to mold our character
Accomplishing ninety-nine percent of a task, leaving one percent undone, is the same as not having done it at all
In Romans chapter twelve, Paul mentions consecration, serving in coordination, and gifts, and follows his word with 'not slothful in zeal'
One who is lazy can never clean thoroughly, because he is stiff-backed and will not even bend his waist to sweep the floor
An unconcerned person is lazy, but he who is concerned yet does not take action is a person who has not been dealt with
The more a person works the more he will become humble practical and careful and the more he will control his temper and reject his flesh
Some people are actually too lazy to believe and to ask; thus, they miss such a great matter as their salvation
A worker must learn to be broad, to study the Bible with a broad perspective, and to study the great items in the Scriptures
Such a person commands a wide view, and his leading of others and his knowledge of the Lord are likewise broad
They receive much grace and know how to pray, but they have not built up the proper character that enables them to accomplish things
To be stable is not to be stubborn, stiff-necked, or obstinate, but to have an inner quality that is immovable and unchangeable
A shallow person always makes superficial observations, whereas a deep person always searches and digs when he looks at things
A shallow person readily believes others' words, and his relaying of information is often inconsistent and incomplete
According to James chapter five the farmer who wishes to obtain the fruit of the earth cannot be anxious he must wait for the appointed time
As we serve the church daily we should wait patiently concerning all the situations which confront us and concerning the results of our work
Those who would be proper persons, and especially be weighty in the hand of the Lord, must possess all of the preceding nine characteristics
Our being must correspond with the work we wish to accomplish, and our character must match the business we plan to do
We may think that those of us who serve the Lord need to have a proper character, but that the Lord Jesus had no such need
If we study the Gospel of Matthew, we can witness how the King of the kingdom of the heavens conducted Himself
In seeking for a friend, you would often look for a pleasing disposition, not necessarily a proper character, in the other party
He may regularly get up and go to bed on time, but if his disposition is not pleasant, you will not want to make friends with him
He may be very gentle, patient, loving, and moderate, but if he is also very lazy, sloppy, slow, and forgetful, would you hire him?
He still must be diligent, girded in his work, and always in his place, all of which are needed in his character
Matthew speaks of the Lord as the King of the kingdom of the heavens; whether the King ate or not is unimportant
The Lord was so busy serving others that He did not care to eat, giving people the impression that He was crazy
One can observe the character of the Lord Jesus as God's Servant in every chapter and every paragraph of the book of Mark
Whereas this incident was recorded in a brief way in the other Gospels, it was recounted in the Gospel of Mark in great detail
That record shows us that He not only cared for the crowd, but He also thoroughly discerned and understood the whole situation
He calmly charged the people to sit down row by row, took the bread and the fish, blessed them, and distributed them row by row
He was diligent, considerate, perceptive, sympathetic, and concerned for others, and He never shirked responsibility
The Lord wanted to show the disciples that one who works for God in service to Him must do things in this manner
We must see that in the matter of serving the Lord and being a servant of God, the one thing that is indispensable is a proper character
In the Apostle Paul's writings in his Epistles concerning the Lord Jesus, we can actually see the writer himself
We can see the apostles from the epistles they wrote, because it was Christ whom they bore, and it was Christ who lived through them
When we read the Epistles of Paul, it is not difficult to see that some matters in them are related to character and some to life
We should not have only life without a proper character; neither can we have only a good character without life
One day in Manila, during a car ride with some brothers to the countryside, we saw an elegant Catholic cathedral situated on a small hill
As she went forward to get a Bible, her stride, posture, and movements commanded our utmost respect and admiration

As a rule, if you are about to go through a door and a younger brother wants to do the same, you should let him go first
Another sister rarely speaks or becomes angry, because both her tongue and her flesh have received the dealing of the cross
We should not only display outward sobriety, thoroughness, and consideration for others, with no life inwardly
Today, our need before the Lord is to pay attention to the fact that in serving the Lord, without life we have nothing to minister to others
Every truth in the Bible is twofold, showing us something in one aspect and then something else in another aspect
Now you have seen a vision that your natural life is nothing but a thorn-bush and your self, nothing but leprosy
It is true that his natural life, self, temperament, and disposition need to be touched by the Lord, broken, and torn down
Although the thorn-bush was not the material which fueled the fire, it nevertheless upheld and showed forth the flames
On the other hand, it may be questionable whether you can be used by the Lord and whether His work can be carried out through you
Similarly, even though God does not use what is of us, our proper condition and situation qualify us to be used by Him
He also said, 'We have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us'
Every student of law considers the Roman law a requirement in his studies, and the Roman law derived its principles from the Old Testament
Even until now, no law is more complete or more lofty than the law of Moses, because the law written by Moses was from God
Undoubtedly, it is the fire that burns upon the bush, but still the bush must be qualified in order for God to ignite this fire upon it
God's fire could burn upon Moses but not upon them, because Moses was qualified for God's burning, whereas they are not
Suppose there is a downpour today and you have put several basins under the building's eaves to collect rainwater
The leaking simply offsets the filling and regardless of how much it rains all the water that comes into the basins will eventually run out
It is true that the basins themselves cannot produce water, and it is true that what we actually use is the water and not the basins
Brothers and sisters, remember that the extent of our usefulness to God depends on the extent of His building work in us
Students of the sciences used to be required to read German because most of the scientific publications were in that language
It was not that they liked to speak German; rather, they needed to research the scientific materials in German
Similarly, throughout church history spiritual materials were written either in Hebrew, Greek, Latin, or English
Since it is more difficult to translate from Chinese to English, an ability to translate from English to Chinese will be sufficient
When we speak of a person's character, it is difficult to say whether it is a matter of the spirit, the soul, or the body
If we send a Chinese child to America as soon as he is born, when he grows up he will be full of American temperament
Dear brothers and sisters neither your spirit nor your soul nor your body can replace you nearly your whole being exists in your character
Do you think God can entrust anything to a person who will accept a request carelessly, but who will not fulfill his word afterwards?

In 2 Corinthians 3 Paul said that we are made sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, not of ourselves but of God
Moses did not rely on his own ways to deal with Pharaoh; rather, it was God's authority manifested through Moses that dealt with Pharaoh
The cross works on us to deal exactly with this matter; it breaks us and kills us in order to deal with this very issue
Because if our cleverness, wisdom, and ability are not subdued by the Lord, what we do will definitely be of ourselves, not of the Lord
We must see that when we serve in the church and participate in the Lord's work, we absolutely cannot minister what we have in ourselves
Even though those who serve the Lord must not bring in what they have, their character must be suitable for the Lord's use
He needs to have a revelation that God's eternal purpose is to work Christ into us and to express Christ through us
You will surely dispense Christ and minister Christ, though perhaps only once a year, or to one person in six months
He also sees that what hinders Christ the most is his self, his flesh, and his natural life, and seeing this, he has fallen down
Through our continuous probing and research, we have reached the conclusion that all of the above four aspects are indispensable
Many assume that as long as they love the Lord, see Christ, and know the way of the cross, they have reached the peak
Once a prince in the Egyptian palace he now shepherded a flock learning patience and humility and spontaneously acquiring a lowly character
Later, because of his forty years of training in the wilderness, Moses was able to lead the Israelites for forty years
Since God was manifested through him, God must have been the life, but Moses needed such a character to uphold God's manifestation
Rising early in the morning is not an aspect of the spiritual life; neither is remembering what people entrusted to you
The spiritual life is the Christ constituted in you, the Christ seen by you, the Christ known by you, the Christ with whom you are filled
Especially with regard to the young brothers and sisters, if you do not build up a diligent character, your work will have no future
At most you can be only a pretty flower for people to admire; you can hardly be a vessel to supply God's children
There are those people who are careless in everything; this characteristic makes them unsuitable for God's use
If you check with yourself, you will see that there are still many areas of your character which are unfit for the Lord
As one who lacks the many qualities which are useful to the Lord, you must spend sufficient time to exercise to build up your character
Never think that it is easier to oversee the church, to preach the gospel, or to save people's souls than to do worldly business
If these qualities are not in your character, it makes little difference whether you are available for the Lord's service or not
In order to serve the Lord, to preach the gospel, and to establish churches, you must build up a character that is useful to the Lord
In your daily life you need to attend to and diligently learn everything related to character, whether it is great or small
When you administrate the church, you will do nothing carelessly, since a certain conscientiousness will already be in you
Some brothers comment that it is very difficult to serve in coordination in the church in Taipei because so many older sisters interfere
His nature is like a sensitive plant, always shrinking back, always withdrawing, and his usefulness thus comes to a standstill
Chinese children seem to be speed readers; they study their material once and then try their luck on the test the next day
Everyone knows that the Japanese are not inventive yet they are diligent to learn eventually their imitation is better than your invention
Though the Chinese are smart and capable, our national character is marked by an ability to do things hastily and skimpily
In time the roll contained only twelve ounces of silk and the quality was lowered to such an extent that the people did not want it anymore
To do things hastily means to finish a task sloppily in three days when normally it would take a week to complete
They would labor ten days to finish a job that requires only a week to complete, working until the result is perfect
The Chinese are really capable in this regard; no matter how you want to change, they will understand even before you make yourself clear
In principle, our faithfulness and diligence in serving the Lord should exceed our faithfulness and diligence in other business
Since we have consecrated ourselves to the Lord and have given up our future and everything to serve Him, we should be very useful
Unfortunately, we are extremely limited by our disposition and, as a result, too little of our function is manifested
It is primarily due to dispositional limitations that the usefulness of our co-workers cannot be fully developed
You must realize that in our work it is almost impossible to have a perfect environment, because we have no organization
Some term this a problem of habit, but we do not think that is a fitting description; rather, we like to call it a problem of character
If we were more broken or if we had learned more concerning proper spiritual temperament today we would be receiving even more grace
For some brothers and sisters, it is not that they do not like to contact others but that they like to contact only a few special ones
If we contact two people before and after every meeting, throughout a week we will have contacted at least ten in five meetings
You may then consider this a real discipline of the Holy Spirit, because everyone you wanted to see was not home
Many times a profitable business deal is consummated on a tennis court over a match or in a coffee shop over coffee
If He did not contact anyone, it was intentional, because of God's will, because He lived under the governing of God's will
He adapted His messages to changing circumstances, speaking the proper words to each kind of person and for each occasion
He was available at all times; therefore, He could give grace at all times and could contact all kinds of people
