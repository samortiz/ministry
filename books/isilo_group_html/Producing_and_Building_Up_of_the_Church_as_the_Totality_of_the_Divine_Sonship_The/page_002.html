<h1 class="title">THE CHURCH, THE TOTALITY<br />
OF THE DIVINE SONSHIP</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph 1:4-5, 7, 9, 20-23; 3:8-11, 14-21</h1>
<p>Ephesians reveals the eternal purpose of God. This Epistle is high, deep, and profound, and in it the apostle Paul uses extraordinary terms and expressions to utter what was on his heart. If we spend time to consider these expressions, we will know Paul&rsquo;s thought in this Epistle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHOSEN IN CHRIST TO BE<br />
HOLY AND WITHOUT BLEMISH</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:4 says, &ldquo;Even as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world to be holy and without blemish before Him in love.&rdquo; God chose us, selected us, not in ourselves but in Christ. Our being chosen does not depend on what we are or what we do. It depends on what Christ is, what He has done, and what He will do for us. We should not look at ourselves. If we look at ourselves superficially, we may be proud, but if we consider ourselves in an honest way, we will be thoroughly disappointed. None of us is worthy of God&rsquo;s selection. However, God selected us, not in ourselves, in our situation, or in our sphere but in Christ as the means, the sphere, the condition, and the circumstance. Christ is everything for God&rsquo;s selection of us.</p>
<p>God selected us not only before we were born but also before the foundation of the world, even before the creation of the heavens, the earth, and Adam. Only God Himself was there in eternity past. When nothing had yet come into existence, God made a selection. A person can select only those things that he sees. This proves that in eternity past, even before we came into existence, God saw all of us. We may wonder how this can be. With human beings there is the matter of time. In all our homes we have clocks and watches; we are very much controlled by time. With God, however, there is no limitation of time. Eternity past, eternity future, and today are all the same to Him. In His eternal nature, God is unlimited. This is a wonderful matter. Our salvation was not an accident. It was something planned and purposed in eternity. In that plan God selected us, not in ourselves but in Christ.</p>
<p>God chose us to be holy and without blemish. A blemish is an imperfection. A good piece of wool, for example, may be free from any blemish in its color, texture, size, and design. According to our improper concept, we may think that God chose us in Christ to be free simply from perdition. Even until now this may be our subconscious thought. We may say, &ldquo;Thank the Lord. He chose me before the foundation of the world to be saved from perdition.&rdquo; However, this is not the Lord&rsquo;s thought. His thought is that we should be holy and without blemish. To be holy is to be separated unto God and for God. God has chosen us that we should be separated unto Him and for Him for His purpose and be without any blemish. God is a God of perfection. Anything that is imperfect has nothing to do with Him. However, we should look at Him, not at ourselves. We are not in ourselves; we are in Christ. In ourselves we are imperfect, but in Christ we are perfect. We all must believe this. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery is to recover us back to the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>We were chosen in Christ to be holy and without blemish. Because of our fallen state, our concept regarding our present, our future, and our ultimate destiny is always according to our situation. However, we must all declare that it is possible for us to be holy and without blemish. Sometimes the young people are not able to believe this. They often turn the question to me, asking, &ldquo;Do you believe that you can be holy and without blemish?&rdquo; With us this is impossible, but there is no impossibility with the Lord; with Him everything is possible (Matt. 19:26). If God could create us, can He not make us holy? To be sure, He can make us holy, perfect, and without blemish. Therefore, whether we are good or bad, wonderful or pitiful, or in heaven or in hell does not matter. We must not look at ourselves according to ourselves, and neither should we consider the brothers according to themselves. We all need to consider one another according to Christ. We need to say, &ldquo;This brother is holy and without blemish. I do not care to hear how unholy or worldly he is. One day he will be absolutely holy. If he is not holy today, he is in the process of becoming holy. God can do it, and He will do it.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We believe that all the dear saints will be holy. They are holy brothers and holy sisters. In ourselves we are poor, unholy, and full of imperfections; therefore, we must look at one another according to Christ and say, &ldquo;Hallelujah, here is a brother in Christ.&rdquo; Because there is nothing unholy or imperfect in Christ, we are all holy in Him. If we do not believe this now, one day we will believe it. In the New Jerusalem we may look at one another and be surprised. We may recall the time that we considered one another and could not believe that we were holy. Then we will say, &ldquo;Praise the Lord, holy brother.&rdquo; Our being holy is not according to ourselves but according to Christ. The book of Ephesians is different from the book of Romans. The beginning of Romans reveals a pitiful situation in which we were all sinners and were all condemned (1:18&mdash;3:20), but in Ephesians 1 we are not condemned but chosen. Ephesians begins not with us but with God. God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Producing and Building Up of the Church as the Totality of the Divine Sonship &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
