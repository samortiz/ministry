   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO LONGER ACCORDING TO THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Corinthians 5:16 says, "So then we, from now on, know no one according to the flesh; even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Here the apostle revealed one of the most elementary doctrines in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Christ that we preach is no longer the Christ in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is very different from the One whom the twelve disciples knew in Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then Christ walked with them, ate with them, lived with them, and traveled together with them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They saw His face and touched His hands; they heard His voice and watched His miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everything they knew about Him was after the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But this amazing passage tells us that we know Him no longer after the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fleshly relationship is no longer valid.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why is there the need for such a verse?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is a very strong reason for it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If Christ were still in His flesh, He would still be encumbered by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We could only contact Him some of the time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He would be available at one place only.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone who was not at the same place and the same time as He could not touch Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Please give your full attention to this peak of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If the Christ that we preach today were still in the flesh, imagine what would happen!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If at this moment He was in Jerusalem, He would not be available here in Tientsin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If He came to Tientsin, the ones in Jerusalem would miss Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then He would become a prisoner of space like us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What if He wanted to stay permanently in Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How could we see Him?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Perhaps once in a while we would have to pay the expense to travel to Jerusalem to visit Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At least we would have to make this pilgrimage once a year to behold the incarnated God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Jerusalem we might be able to stay very close to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the minute we left Jerusalem, we would be separated again from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, if Christ were still in the flesh, our faith would be a materialistic religion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christianity would have a universal center on earth from which it would control and direct all the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When the twelve disciples were with Christ, He still had His flesh with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When He talked to three disciples, the other nine missed it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When He walked with eleven, one was left out.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even when they all dined together, some were closer to Him than others.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Not everyone could recline on His bosom as John did.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He was limited by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>CHRIST MUST PUT OFF HIS FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you asked me whether I would like to see Christ walking today in the flesh in the manner that the twelve disciples knew, I would tell you a strong no. This would be absolutely useless to me! If Jesus of Nazareth were here today, He would be isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He could not come into me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Neither could I get into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He would still be with His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>His flesh could not be part of mine, nor my flesh part of His.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, there was a crucial need!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ had to put off His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>BY DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ put off His flesh by death!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Please remember that the death of Christ was not merely for our sins and old man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was also a putting off of His own flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Henceforth, He is no longer in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By death He has put off His flesh and is now in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I am not saying that the resurrected Christ does not have a body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am saying that Christ has become the Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He still possesses a spirit, soul, and body, but everything is spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is the difference between being in the flesh and being in the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To be in the flesh is like putting on a garment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When Christ was on earth, He had the garment of flesh on Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>At His death He put off this garment, and in resurrection He took on a new body with a different garment the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The present Christ has been clothed with the Spirit in exactly the same sense as when He was clothed with the human flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, we can know Christ in one of two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can know Christ in the flesh, or we can know Him in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Some treasure the Christ in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>But more precious than that is the Christ in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christ in the Spirit can now come into us and allow us to be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now He and we can have an insoluble union.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>IN US</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Bible shows us time and again that God is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At one time God put on the flesh to become Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Now He has put on the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God, Christ, and the Holy Spirit are all one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Christ who was clothed with the flesh was limited in many respects.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Christ who is clothed with the Spirit is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He can reside even in you.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Everyone who desires Him may obtain Him, and everyone who believes in Him may receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He is no longer confined by time and space.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We can be one with Him wherever we are and whenever we will.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If Christ is not living in the Holy Spirit, our faith is dead and Christianity is a dead religion.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If Christ is not in the Spirit, our beliefs are mere teachings and theories, and we possess nothing in reality because nothing can come into us from the Christ in the flesh.</S>
