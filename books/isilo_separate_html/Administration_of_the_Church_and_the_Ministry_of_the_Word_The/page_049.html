<p>In the same principle, when we give a message, we should avoid speaking in a scientific way. For example, we have failed if we teach people only according to the main headings and subheadings of an outline. Even though it is not bad to read an outline, it is more important to learn to touch people&rsquo;s feeling. If we overemphasize memorizing an outline, the saints might not be able to remember the points. Even if they are able to remember the points, they will forget them if they have not touched something. The brothers who minister may speak much, but their first priority must be to give people something living and to touch their inner being. In this way, even if people forget the outline, something solid will still remain in them.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we should learn not to bring the training into the meetings. Trainings are different in nature from church meetings. We must not treat the brothers and sisters like trainees. The brothers and sisters may forget the outline and Scripture verses, but if they are touched by something, after the meeting they will pray, confess their sins, and even preach the gospel. If this is the case, the speaking is living and supplying. The meat of a steak is attached to the bones, but when we serve the steak, we should give meat instead of bones. An outline is important because many points on the outline can touch people&rsquo;s feeling. However, when we feed people, we should give them &ldquo;meat&rdquo; instead of &ldquo;bones,&rdquo; because few people can chew bones. This is a great matter.</p>
<p>Hence, we should learn to use material that can touch people&rsquo;s feeling so that they are touched even if they do not understand much of the message. Such speaking is powerful because it is clear and rich in content without stressing logical reasoning skills. Rather, it touches the feeling deep within people.</p>
<p>We have a heavy burden concerning our ministry of the word. The ministry of the word is very weak on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning, in the midweek meeting, in the home meetings, in the young people&rsquo;s meeting, and even in the children&rsquo;s meeting. There are problems with the ministry of the word. The speaking is too weak, resulting in a weakened situation among the saints. The main reason for the weak speaking is that it is dead. When the speaking is dead, the overall supply is weakened. Hence, all the brothers who bear the responsibility to minister the word must endeavor to look for a way for our speaking to render a living supply and not be dead. This requires that we no longer speak as if we are conducting a class with the rigid use of outlines. Our spiritual life requires teaching, but we cannot be rigid. We must avoid materials that resemble teaching materials in a school. We should not give the brothers and sisters homework; rather, we should touch their feeling to plant something solid into them.</p>
<p>If we fail to do this in our ministry of the word, we do not have the ability to minister the word. If we have the ability to minister, we will touch the feeling of the saints and supply them with life whether we stutter or are eloquent, and whether the brothers and sisters like or dislike us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH URGENTLY NEEDING<br />
TO DO THE BUILDING WORK<br />
THROUGH THE MINISTRY OF THE WORD</h2>
<p>We have reached the critical point of urgently needing the building. If we merely save sinners and edify them, we are repeating the work of Christianity for the past one hundred years. This work has not resulted in the building or the dwelling place of God. When a person is built up in Kaohsiung, if he leaves Kaohsiung to go to either Hualien or Tainan, he is still built up. Even though he leaves Kaohsiung, he has not left the building; he is still a part of the spiritual house, which is not limited by time or space. Wherever he goes, he is built up in the Body of Christ. In God&rsquo;s unique building in the universe he is a built-up person. He is different from a person who is merely saved. He is different from a person who is spiritual. He is built up. Only such a person can be part of God&rsquo;s dwelling place and can function as a member of the Body of Christ wherever he goes.</p>
<p>God needs such a group of people on the earth today. He urgently needs a work of building. If we want to participate in this work, we need the administration of the church, and even more, we need the ministry of the word. The ministry of the word is first, and the administration of the church is second. Presently our greatest lack is in the ministry of the word. This is a serious problem. All our meetings are poor, weak, low, cold, dead, and shallow because we lack the ministry of the word. The administration of the church is second in importance. Therefore, the brothers who often speak on the podium must regard this matter seriously and endeavor to learn the lesson concerning ministering the word. We must never depend on our seniority. We should not think that because we have been speaking for many years, we can simply put together a message from our notes and reference books. Such a message will have no value or impact. It will not touch others, and it will not hit the mark.</p>
<p>We need to learn to always trouble the brothers and sisters when they listen to a message. They should be pricked even if they forget the subject and miss the content. They should feel as if they were stung by a mosquito. As a result they will be unable to rest after the meeting because something has been injected into their being.</p>
<p>The sisters should also have this skill when they visit others. Asking others whether they have read the Bible or prayed embarrasses people. We must not be dead; rather, we should learn to be living and learn some skills. We may not touch anything spiritual, but unknowingly a spiritual shot is injected. We may speak with people about the world they love, but by the end of our speaking they are &ldquo;stung.&rdquo; They cannot rest and are troubled. We need to learn how to do this.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> </body></html>
