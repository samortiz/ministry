Christ Is Both God and Man</h2><p>In all the verses mentioned above whether in the Old or New Testaments, we can clearly see that on the one hand Christ is God and on the other hand He is man. On the one hand He is man, and on the other hand He is God-He is a mysterious One, God as well as man, man as well as God.</p><h2 class="head3">A. In the Old Testament</h2><p>On the one hand Christ is &#147;a child&#148; and on the other hand He is the &#147;Mighty God&#148; (Isa. 9:6). He is both.</p><p>Christ is the Shoot of David, the descendant of David; yet, He is also &#147;The Lord Our Righteousness,&#148; God becoming our righteousness (Jer. 23:5-6). He is a descendant of man-He is a man, and He is the very God Himself-He is both.</p><p>Christ is a man who came out of Bethlehem, but He is also God who is from of old, from eternity (Micah 5:2). On the one hand He is a man in time, and on the other hand He is God in eternity. He is both.</p><h2 class="head3">B. In the New Testament</h2><p>Christ is both the Son of David-a man, and the Lord of David-God Himself (Matt. 22:42-45). Christ is the Son of Man &#147;who came out of the seed of David&#148; having humanity; and He was designated to be the &#147;Son of God&#148; in power, having divinity-God&#8217;s nature (Rom. 1:3-4). Christ is a man of flesh who came out of Israel, yet He &#147;is over all, God blessed forever&#148; (Rom. 9:5).</p><p>He is the One &#147;subsisting in the form of God,&#148; but who became &#147;in the likeness of men,&#148; and was &#147;found in fashion as a man&#148; (Phil. 2:6-8). For He is God who became a man. Hence, He is God, and He is also man; He is man, and He is also God.</p><p>The Lord Jesus said with His own mouth, &#147;I am the Root and the Offspring of David&#148; (Rev. 22:16). &#147;The Root of David&#148; refers to God out from whom came David; &#147;the Offspring of David&#148; refers to a seed, a man, who came out of David. Therefore, this is to say that Christ Himself acknowledges that He is man as well as God. He is both.</p><p>Thus, the Bible clearly reveals to us that our Lord is God as well as man, the true God and the true man, the perfect God and the perfect man. He is nothing less than God and nothing less than man, having complete divinity and complete humanity. He is God with the divine nature; He is also man with a human nature. The Gospel of John continually shows us these two aspects of Him. He is God who knows everything and sees everything (John 1:47-48), who is omnipresent, and who descended out of heaven yet is still in heaven (John 3:13). He is a man who can get weary and thirsty (John 4:6-7). He can also weep (John 11:35). Both God and man are complete in Him. This is really mysterious. It is no wonder that His name is called &#147;Wonderful!&#148; (Isa. 9:6).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Concerning the Person of Christ &nbsp; pg 15</div><br></body></html>
