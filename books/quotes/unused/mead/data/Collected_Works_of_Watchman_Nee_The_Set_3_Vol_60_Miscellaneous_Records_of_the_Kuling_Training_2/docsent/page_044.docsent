   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Peking-Tientsin, Canton, and Swatow Hakka can wait for one or two months; they can join together to boost Wenchow first.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can gather the brothers and sisters who have a heart to serve in Wenchow, train them for two or three weeks, and then send them out to different places for the work after the training.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Yet it is a promising region, and there are many promising ones from this region.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brother Zi-jieh can return to this region.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sister Sung and Sister Dong may return to Tsingtao.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hakka region: The Hakka region is too weak at present.</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The work in this region should begin from Swatow.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The brothers and sisters who come from this region should perhaps go back to this region and begin working there.</S>
