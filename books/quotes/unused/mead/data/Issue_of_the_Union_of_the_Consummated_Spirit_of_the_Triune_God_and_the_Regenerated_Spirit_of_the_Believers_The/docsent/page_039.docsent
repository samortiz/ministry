   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. The Local Churches in the Various Localities Take God's Eternal Economy as Their Center</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Bear the Unique Testimony of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the practice of the church, although there are many local churches, they all take God's eternal economy as their center to bear the unique testimony of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They do not teach any doctrine that is unrelated to God's economy and has nothing to do with the testimony of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 1 Timothy chapter one Paul wanted Timothy to remain in Ephesus to charge certain ones not to teach things that are different from God's economy vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the practice of the church, we should not teach any doctrine that is unrelated to God's economy and has nothing to do with the testimony of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do, this will cause division.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>G. In These Local Churches There Should Be Righteousness, Peace, and Joy in the Holy Spirit as the Reality of the Kingdom of God</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the practice of the church there should be righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit in the local churches as the reality of the kingdom of God Rom 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The kingdom of God is the sphere in which God exercises His authority so that He may express His glory for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In such a kingdom, what matters is not eating and drinking but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Righteousness denotes that which is right and proper.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Those who live in the kingdom of God should be right and proper toward others, toward things, and toward God; with them there should be nothing erroneous, improper, crooked, slanted, or biased.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This requires that they be strict in dealing with themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Peace is the fruit of righteousness Heb 12:11 and note .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It characterizes the relationship that those who live in the kingdom of God should have with others and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we are righteous, right, and proper toward others, toward things, and toward God, we will have a peaceful relationship with others and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, we will have joy in the Holy Spirit and, in particular, before God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In this way, we will be filled with joy and with the Holy Spirit Acts 13:52 and will live out righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit, which are the reality of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This proves that the normal church life is the kingdom of God on the earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In conclusion, the Lord's recovery has not only the revelation of God but also the God-man life; and the God-man life requires a proper practice of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I cannot say that in the church everyone is a God-man, an overcomer; but I can say that in the church the opportunity for us to be a God-man is greater, and it is easier to be an overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is because in the Lord's recovery, every local church is daily nurturing us to be overcomers, to be God-men.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hope that the elders and the co-workers in every locality will create an environment in the church to nurture the saints to be God-men to live an overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE PRESENT URGENT NEEDS</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Lord's recovery there are a few matters that are urgent at the present time to which we should pay special attention.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, every brother and sister needs to ask the Lord for a new revival.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although we have so much vision, we still need to ask the Lord for a new revival.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This revival is the God-man life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In every church, we all need to live the God-man life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whether we are at home or in the workplace, we all need to live the God-man life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second, we need to produce vital groups and endeavor to gain people to be members of the Body of Christ for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every member should be living, organic, and not in organization, especially not in arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is through the vital groups that we all can become the living members in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Third, every brother and sister in the Lord's recovery needs to pursue prophesying for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should not make any excuses, saying that we are weak and without strength.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every one of us has the consummated Triune God, who has become the life-giving Spirit, living within us to enable us to pursue prophesying, to speak for the Lord for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These are the present urgent needs of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I hope that the Lord will be gracious to us so that we can receive these words and actually practice them in our living and in our church.</S>
