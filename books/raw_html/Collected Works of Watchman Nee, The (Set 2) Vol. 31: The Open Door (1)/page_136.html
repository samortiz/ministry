<h2 class="head1">MISCELLANEOUS NEWS</h2><p>Sister Tang Mei-lih sent a letter from Shanghai on April 11 saying that Sister Lee Shi Sai-ho fell out of a car and was injured. She is in the hospital.</p><p>Brother Ho Yueh-chiao sent a letter from Shanghai on April 14 saying that The Christian cannot be sent to any locality in Shantung province except for Chefoo and Tsingtao. It cannot be sent to most of the localities in Kiangsu and Chekiang. Many readers have moved but have not notified us. Of course, we must bear some responsibility in this respect because The Christian is not published on schedule many times, and it is easy for the readers to forget. For now, we can only place the mailings into the Lord's hands.</p><p>Sister Shen Shi-kwei sent a letter from Shanghai on April 13 saying that her mother is recovering at home. Her father has believed in the Lord. Her younger sister, Shi-shuan, sent a letter home. She is safe. Her brother, Shi-jia, went to Ch'ang-sha and has entered school. His school is moving to Shensi province. May the Lord protect him. The sisters in the hospital are all safe and well. Please do not worry. [Address omitted]</p><p>Brother Chao Yung-chuen came from Nanking to Hankow. He is now in Hanyang. He came to the meeting last Lord's Day, and he came to buy books today. He talked with the brothers and has an inward burden to go to Sinkiang to begin the gospel work there (April 4).</p><p>Telegrams cannot reach Chefoo. We can only pray for them (April 12).</p><p>Beginning on April 16, there will be two weeks of gospel meetings at the Hanyang Refugee Center. There will be two meetings a day. Please pray for this (April 15).</p><p>Not many churches in Southeast Asia have sent in their subscriptions for The Open Door. Would any brother who is familiar with the churches there send a list to Hankow of the addresses of the churches in Southeast Asia and the responsible brothers in each place, along with the number of copies of The Open Door that each locality needs? We will send their subscriptions directly to them in the future. My wife returned safely to Hankow on the eighteenth. Brother Liu Ai-wu accompanied her (April 22).</p><p>The China Airlines flight between Chungking and Hong Kong passes through Kuei-yang, but it no longer stops there. Mail will go to Chungking by air and then return to Kuei-yang by car. The airline says that it will probably restore service to Kuei-yang in one month (April 23).</p><p>Brother Liu Ai-wu has resigned from the orphanage because there was persecution. Brother Zhang Gun-jih has already found a suitable, cheap house for Brother Liu and his family in Yi-Yang. Brother Liu needs to rest for at least six months. We commit the burden of his entire family to God (April 26).</p><p>Three of the eight brothers in the orphanage have found jobs. Brother Tsung Kung has finished his job and is waiting for further notification (April 27).</p><p>(The preceding are excerpts from Brother Lan Tsi-yi's letters from Hankow.)</p><p>Thank the Lord. The meeting last Lord's Day was very living. Indeed, unless one's water bottle is empty, he will not cry to God (April 19).</p><p>At one o'clock in the morning on April 21, the city was suddenly hit by a great thunderstorm. The winds were strong, and it rained heavily. The rain was so heavy that it engulfed the entire city. Thank the Lord. Not one of the brothers and sisters was injured....The entire region did not have electricity last night, but there were still seven brothers and sisters in one accord who met to pray as usual (April 22).</p><p>(The preceding are excerpts from Mrs. Yuan How-tsai's letter from Chungking.)</p><p>Sister Yuan Jing-hwa went from Nanking to Su County on August 21 of last year. She came from Su County to Hankow on March 18 of this year. She is now waiting for a job (Hankow Newsletter).</p><p>Sister Ji Hwei-jen is still living in the China Inland Mission in Yin-Shang County, Anhui.</p><p>Sister Huang Jen-zhi sent a letter asking us to send ten or twelve copies of The Open Door to 45 Tang-Tze Alley, Cheng-Dong, Peking, or to the meeting hall at 5 Foreign Ministry Street, Peking. She is doing the work of visiting homes, and many people want The Open Door. (We received this letter on April 14.)</p><p>Sister Sun Zhu Ming-seng has returned to Canton. Her mailing address is [omitted].</p><p>The church in Ku-Tien has moved its meeting place to [omitted]. Letters concerning the church there can now be sent directly to that address.</p>
