<div class='line'><b>1</b> In daily walk and in our meetings too,</div>
<div class='line'>Christ is the center, Christ is everything;</div>
<div class='line'>'Tis not for form nor doctrine good and true,</div>
<div class='line'>But 'tis for Christ alone we're gathering.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> Christ is the way and Christ the light of life,</div>
<div class='line'>In Him we walk and by Him we are led;</div>
<div class='line'>Christ is the living water and the food;</div>
<div class='line'>Of Him we drink and we with Him are fed.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> Christ is the truth, 'tis Him we testify,</div>
<div class='line'>Christ is the life, 'tis Him we minister;</div>
<div class='line'>Christ is the Lord, 'tis Him we magnify,</div>
<div class='line'>Christ is the Head, and we exalt Him here.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> Christ is the All in all to God and man -</div>
<div class='line'>With Him both we and God are satisfied;</div>
<div class='line'>Christ, the reality within the Church -</div>
<div class='line'>By Him are life and numbers multiplied.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> By all the hymns and prayers we offer here,</div>
<div class='line'>Christ the reality we would express;</div>
<div class='line'>All the activities in fellowship -</div>
<div class='line'>Christ thus in operation manifest.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>6</b> 'Tis in His Name we meet, in Spirit act,</div>
<div class='line'>With nothing in our mind to formalize;</div>
<div class='line'>'Tis by His pow'r we pray, in unction praise,</div>
<div class='line'>And with Himself in spirit exercise.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>7</b> All things forgetting, cleaving unto Christ,</div>
<div class='line'>Applying Him until maturity;</div>
<div class='line'>Let us count everything but loss for Him,</div>
<div class='line'>For Him, our All in all, eternally.</div>
