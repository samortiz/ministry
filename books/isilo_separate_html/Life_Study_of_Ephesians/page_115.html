A prophet is one who is full of light, one who sees what others do not see. Those who are in darkness have nothing to say, but those who are in the light have a great deal to speak forth. Whenever we see something by revelation, we automatically have something to talk about. If we would be today&rsquo;s sent ones and prophets, we must receive both grace and revelation.</p><p>By receiving grace and revelation, we shall spontaneously become burdened to contact others. One who gets into the Word daily and who prays consistently will have a burden to speak to others about what he has seen and experienced. At the very least, he will have the desire to call someone on the telephone. Do not think that the grace and revelation you receive will allow you to remain passive or inactive. No, the grace and revelation will burden you to go to others and to minister to them. This is to be an apostle and a prophet in a practical way. It is useless for me or anyone else to charge you to be such a sent one and spokesman. The only thing that avails is for you to get into the Word, pray, and receive grace and revelation. Whenever you are enlightened by the Lord, you will be eager to tell others what you have seen.</p><p>The way to receive revelation is to get into the Word. I believe that Paul received revelation through his study of the Old Testament. Because he spent so much time in the Word, revelation could come to him by means of the Word. The Pharisees, however, could not receive revelation from the Word because they were closed and disobedient. Paul, however, was open. All the veils that covered him were taken away by the Lord. As we come to the Word, we should ask the Lord to remove the veils from our eyes. Although we do not know what veils are still upon us, the Lord knows, and He is willing to remove them. We need to pray, &ldquo;Lord, I am coming to Your Word. Take away anything that veils my sight, and make Your Word open to me.&rdquo; If we pray in this manner, light will come in, and we shall receive revelation. Then we shall speak to others according to the light we have received from the Lord. Such a speaking, a speaking full of divine light, will greatly surprise the religious ones. Oh, the church people must be full of light, full of revelation!</p><h2 class="head1">ASKING PROPER QUESTIONS</h2><p>In receiving revelation, we should not be concerned with minor things such as foot-washing, the method of baptism, or the size of the cup used at the Lord&rsquo;s table. I am troubled when saints question me regarding secondary matters, but neglect the matters of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and God&rsquo;s economy. Once I visited a certain place where the people were supposed to be quite spiritual. During a fellowship meeting held for the purpose of answering questions, I was disappointed by the kind of questions that were asked. I was asked questions about minor things, but no one asked me about significant things such as the difference between the mystery of Christ and the mystery of God.</p><p>The questions we ask indicate where we are and what we are. For example, many of the questions addressed to me by my little grandchildren are nonsensical. I do not expect them to ask questions about profound subjects. In order to ask a high question, we need to have considerable knowledge and experience. As we read chapter three of Ephesians, we need to ask question after question. Here are some questions we should ask: What is the stewardship of the grace? What is the mystery of Christ? What is a joint-heir? What are the unsearchable riches of Christ? What is the dispensation of the mystery? What is the difference between ages and generations? What is the purpose of the ages? What does it mean to be strengthened into the inner man? How can Christ make His home in our hearts? If we seek out the answers to questions like these, we shall receive revelation.</p><p>After we receive light and revelation in answer to questions such as these, we shall have a great deal to share with others. We in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery must be speaking people, those who speak day by day because we have received revelation. The more we see, the more we shall desire to speak. This is the reason that I always have something to speak in the ministry. Actually, the more I speak, the more there is to speak. If we would be such speaking ones, we need to receive revelation. All the saints, not just the leading apostles, should receive revelation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_114.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_116.html">Next</a> </body></html>
