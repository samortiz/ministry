   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GALATIANS MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE BORN OF THE SPIRIT TO RECEIVE THE SPIRIT 2 Scripture Reading: Gal 4:29; 3:2, 5, 14; John 3:6b; 7:39; 14:17; 20:22; 6:63; Rom 8:15b; Eph 6:17-18; 1 Thes 5:17-19; 1 Cor 6:17; Matt 10:19-20 GOD S ULTIMATE INTENTION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The most crucial and mysterious matter revealed in the Bible is that God s ultimate intention is to work Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God s desire to work Himself into our being is the focal point of the divine revelation in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because this matter is so mysterious, it is hidden in the Scriptures, although it is not altogether hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On the one hand, it is indeed a mystery; on the other hand, it is a mystery that has been revealed in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Throughout the centuries, Christians have not seen this matter clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Most readers of the Bible have paid their attention to many things other than this crucial and mysterious point in the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We admit that it is not easy to see this crucial point in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Just as a person s physical life is mysterious and hidden within him, so it is with the matter of God s intention to work Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is hidden in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Life is the most vital element in a person s being.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But who can analyze it or adequately explain it?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>With the Bible, as with a human being, there are many things that are outward and easily identified.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But there is also a hidden element, which we may call the life factor in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may say that this life factor is Christ or the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, the life factor in the Bible is actually God s intention to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the kernel of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many theologians and Bible teachers have not seen the kernel of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In their writings they speak of many other things, but they do not mention this basic life factor.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have not pointed out definitely and particularly that according to the divine revelation in the Bible, God s intention is to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the reason that in the Lord s recovery we have given message after message on this point.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even after hundreds of messages have been given on the subject of God s intention, I still do not have the confidence that all the saints have an adequate understanding of it or that they have all truly seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I can testify that the vision of God s eternal intention has never been more clear to me than it is now.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Throughout the years, this vision has become crystal clear.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God s intention truly is to work Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>TWO GIFTS AND TWO TRAGEDIES</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has given us two great gifts by which He works Himself into us the Spirit and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These gifts are actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God is the Spirit, and God is also the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Gospel of John is a book which clearly reveals God, the Spirit, and the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 1:1 says, In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to John 1:14, the Word, God Himself, became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eventually, this incarnate Word was crucified, and after His resurrection He, the last Adam, became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Gospel of John also links the Word to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is the Spirit Who gives life, the Lord Jesus said in John 6:63, and, the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is life, the Spirit is life, and the Word is life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to the Gospel of John, these three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is the Word, the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you consider church history, you will see that throughout the centuries two great tragedies have taken place, one related to the Word and the other related to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God s intention is that the Bible be used to impart Himself as life into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But many Christian teachers have neglected this proper use of the Bible and have taken the Bible only as a book of knowledge, not as a book of life for the divine impartation.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Different opinions and interpretations of the Bible have led to controversy and debate.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many of these debates have been centered on Christology, the theological study of Christ s Person.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In their argument about the Person of Christ, some of the great teachers, including certain church fathers, neglected the living Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They paid more attention to Christology than to Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God s intention is that the Bible should be the tree of life, but in their use of the Bible, certain teachers turned it into the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>First they brought themselves into death, and then they spread death in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Today there is still controversy among Christians about many matters in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Take baptism as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Who can count how many divisions have been caused by differing opinions about baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There has been argument about the kind of water used, about the way people are put into the water, and about the name in which people are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What a tragedy that the Word has been used in such a way as to become a factor of division!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It has been used to divide Christians into thousands of groups.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, the Bible itself is not to blame for this.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The blame rests with those who pay attention to knowledge, but neglect the living Person.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The second tragedy to occur in the history of the church concerns the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Concerning the Bible and its interpretation, there has been division, whereas concerning the Spirit there has been confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because of this confusion, many fundamental Christians do not even want to hear about the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some are actually frightened by any mention of the Spirit, regarding the Spirit as something too mysterious to talk about.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What a tragedy is this neglect of the Spirit!</S>
