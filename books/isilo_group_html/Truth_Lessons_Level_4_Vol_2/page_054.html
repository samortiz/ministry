<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will continue the last two lessons on the prophecies concerning the restoration of Israel in the books of the Minor Prophets. Furthermore, we will also see the New Testament prophecies concerning Israel being restored.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Hosea&rsquo;s Prophecy<br />
concerning the Restoration of Israel</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Becoming the Sons of God</h2>
<p>Hosea 1:10&mdash;2:1 is God&rsquo;s promise to restore the children of Israel. This promise is a matter of grace. Grace follows sin. Where sin abounds, grace superabounds (Rom. 5:20).</p>
<p>Hosea 1:10 says that in the restoration the number of the children of Israel will be like the sand of the sea, which is immeasurable and innumerable. Verse 10 also says, &ldquo;In the place where it will be said to them, You are not My people, / It will be said to them, You are the sons of the living God.&rdquo; Being sons of God indicates regeneration. When God makes a new covenant with the children of Israel (Jer. 31:31-34), they will have God written into their hearts. This means that they will be regenerated. God will put Himself into them as their life to make them the sons of God. Thus, Israel will be not merely God&rsquo;s people but also the sons of God.</p>
<p>In the restoration when the children of Judah and the children of Israel are gathered together, they will appoint for themselves one head, and they will go up from the land of their captivity; great will be the day of Jezreel, meaning &ldquo;God sows&rdquo; or &ldquo;God will sow,&rdquo; the day for the people of Israel to be sown in the Holy Land by God (Hosea 1:11; cf. 2:22-23). God has sown the children of Israel in their fathers&rsquo; land, and no one can pluck them out again. In that day the Lord will charge the children of Israel to call their brothers Ammi, meaning &ldquo;My people,&rdquo; and their sisters Ruhamah, meaning &ldquo;she has obtained compassion&rdquo; (2:1). Thus, Israel will be perfected. Under the victory of God&rsquo;s love, Israel will become His people and obtain His compassion.</p>
<p>Hosea said that God loves Israel with an everlasting love (11:1; 14:4). Although God is loving, He is also a God of purity and righteousness. He cannot tolerate any kind of uncleanness or unrighteousness. Wherever these things are found among God&rsquo;s people, God&rsquo;s chastisement will follow. For this reason, even though Israel has been re-formed as a nation, they are still under God&rsquo;s chastisement. Nevertheless, even though they are being chastised by God, He still loves them. It is the Lord&rsquo;s lovingkindness that they have not been consumed (Lam. 3:22). Because of His compassion, Israel remains and will eventually be restored.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth Lessons, Level 4, Vol. 2 &nbsp; pg 54</div><br></body></html>
