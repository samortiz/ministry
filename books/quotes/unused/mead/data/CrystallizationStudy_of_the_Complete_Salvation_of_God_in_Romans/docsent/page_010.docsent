   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our spirit is joined to the Lord as one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 , and His Spirit witnesses together with our spirit that we are children of God Rom 8:16 , that we may live together, exist together, work together, and speak together as one spirit.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What realm we are in depends on where we set our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When our mind is set on the spirit, our mind is full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We also have peace because there is no discord between our outward behavior and our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then when we speak, life is embodied in our words because we are one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The righteous requirement of the law is fulfilled in those who walk according to the mingled spirit v. 4 . If we try to be a Christian, we are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That is the old man trying to keep the law.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Lord, give Yourself to me as grace for my enjoyment."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Grace means that we cannot do what God requires, but the Triune God can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot be what we should be, but there is One living in us, the consummated Spirit as grace, who can be.</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just as a person's being is the totality of his life, the New Jerusalem is the totality of the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The consummation of the gushing living water that we drink will be the New Jerusalem as the totality of the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For grace to reign unto eternal life means that we are now enthroned as kings and we are reigning in life over all things unto an issue, a consummation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The issue of our present reigning in life will be the New Jerusalem as the universal incorporation of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Revelation 22:5 says, "And they will reign forever and ever."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That reigning is an issue, a glorious, eternal, corporate consummation of our present reigning in life through the abundance of grace and of the gift of righteousness unto eternal life.</S>
