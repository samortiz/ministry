<h2 class="head1">THREE</h2><p>Let us consider the history of the ark a little. This shows us the relationship between the ark and the Israelites, and from it we can find the relationship between Christ and us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Ark Crossing the Jordan</h2><p>How did the Israelites cross the river Jordan when they were about to enter Canaan? Joshua 3:10-17 says, "And Joshua said, Hereby ye shall know that the living God is among you....Behold, the ark of the covenant of the Lord of all the earth passeth over before you into Jordan....And it shall come to pass, as soon as the soles of the feet of the priests that bear the ark of the Lord, the Lord of all the earth, shall rest in the waters of Jordan, that the waters of Jordan shall be cut off from the waters that come down from above; and they shall stand upon a heap. And it came to pass, when the people removed from their tents, to pass over Jordan, and the priests bearing the ark of the covenant before the people; and as they that bare the ark were come unto Jordan, and the feet of the priests that bare the ark were dipped in the brim of the water, (for Jordan overfloweth all his banks all the time of harvest,) that the waters which came down from above stood and rose up upon a heap very far from the city Adam, that is beside Zaretan; and those that came down toward the sea of the plain, even the salt sea, failed, and were cut off: and the people passed over right against Jericho. And the priests that bare the ark of the covenant of the Lord stood firm on dry ground in the midst of Jordan, and all the Israelites passed over on dry ground, until all the people were passed clean over Jordan." This passage of the Scripture tells us how the ark led the Israelites into Canaan. The first thing that went into the water was the ark, and the ark was the last thing that came out of the water. This shows us that a power greater than death was leading the Israelites safely across Jordan to the bank on the other side. Our death and resurrection with the Lord is like the Israelites crossing the Jordan; the ark is there taking the lead ahead of us.</p><h2 class="head2">The Ark in Shiloh</h2><p>After the Israelites entered Canaan and when the warfare was over, the whole congregation gathered in Shiloh and erected the tabernacle (Josh. 18:1). When Eli the priest was old, his two sons were evil and did not know the Lord; yet they were taking over the work of the priest. Eli could do nothing about them because he honored his sons more than the Lord. Later a man of God prophesied: "And thou shalt see an enemy in my habitation in all the wealth which God shall give Israel" (1 Sam. 2:32). This means that God would forsake the tabernacle. "And the word of the Lord was precious in those days; there was no open vision. And it came to pass at that time, when Eli was laid down in his place, and his eyes began to wax dim, that he could not see; and ere the lamp of God went out in the temple of the Lord, where the ark of God was, and Samuel was laid down to sleep; that the Lord called Samuel" (3:1-4). Although the lamp of God, which was in the temple of Lord where the ark was located, had not gone completely out and although the tabernacle was the same outwardly, God's presence was about to depart. At that time, God no longer called Eli, He called Samuel. He did not convey His word to Eli but to Samuel. From that time on, Eli was put aside, and God chose a child, Samuel, to be His prophet (v. 20).</p><p>Soon after this, the ark left the tabernacle in Shiloh. First Samuel 4:3 says, "And when the people were come into the camp, the elders of Israel said, Wherefore hath the Lord smitten us today before the Philistines? Let us fetch the ark of the covenant of the Lord out of Shiloh unto us, that, when it cometh among us, it may save us out of the hand of our enemies." The Israelites went to war with the Philistines and lost, and they thought they could avert their defeat if they brought out the ark. God's tabernacle was in Shiloh, and they carried the ark from Shiloh to their camp and shouted with a great shout (v. 5). But what was the result? "And the Philistines fought, and Israel was smitten, and they fled every man into his tent: and there was a very great slaughter; for there fell of Israel thirty thousand footmen. And the ark of God was taken; and the two sons of Eli, Hophni and Phinehas, were slain" (vv. 10-11). When these men were in peril, they tried to utilize the ark. But in the end, even the ark was captured. They thought that God would surely help them when the ark was in their midst, that God would surely not forsake His ark. But God did not do this. He allowed them to be defeated and the ark to be carried away. How serious this is! If anyone thinks that by proclaiming, "I have God" or "I come in the name of the Lord," they can overcome, they are making the same mistake as the Israelites. The Israelites were defeated before the Philistines because they did not deal with their sins. They did not realize that there could be no victory unless sin was first dealt with. They had forgotten the fact that they had rebelled against God, and they thought they would be victorious by clinging to the ark. They were wrong. God's ark cannot be used this way. We must forever remember that the flesh can never exploit spiritual things. The name of Christ can never be exploited by the flesh. If anyone tries to exploit spiritual things or use the name of the Lord in vain, the result will be total failure. The Israelites tried to exploit God's ark. They did not realize that God's glory had left Israel already. God allowed the ark to be taken away. We must remember that God's glory did not leave the tabernacle in Shiloh as a result of the ark being captured. God left the tabernacle in Shiloh first, and then the ark was captured later (Psa. 78:60-61). Once God's ark left the tabernacle in Shiloh, it never went back to Shiloh again!</p>
