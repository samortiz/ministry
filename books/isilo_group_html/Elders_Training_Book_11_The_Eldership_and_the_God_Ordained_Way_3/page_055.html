As priests of the gospel, we must get sinners saved that they may be offered to God as sacrifices (Rom. 15:16). We must also feed the new believers in home meetings and perfect the saints in the group meetings, that the saints may be able to do the work of the New Testament ministry (Eph. 4:12).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GROUP MEETINGS IN MUTUALITY</H2><P>The group meeting revealed in Hebrews 10:24-25, strictly speaking, is not a meeting for gospel preaching, feeding the new believers, or for prophesying. The group meeting is a meeting for mutuality. The reason I do not use the word small in regard to the group meeting is because a small meeting is a home meeting. The group meeting, however, may not be very small. Its size may be from twenty to forty members.</P><P>Some among us have not yet entered into the proper realization and practice of the group meeting. According to the New Testament, the group meeting comprises mutuality in shepherding, caring, interceding, teaching through asking and answering questions, perfecting, and equipping. The group meeting is eighty percent of the practical church life. The church life is inadequate without the group meetings. We are weak and very short in our practice of the church life today because we do not have the proper group meetings in mutuality.</P><P>The meetings of the church should be in mutuality. Mutuality is different from plurality. The responsibility of the eldership in the church should be borne in plurality. The responsibility of the eldership in the church life should be taken care of by at least three persons. In a local church, there should not be less than three elders. Actually, the more elders the better. The eldership is a matter of plurality.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 11: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (3) &nbsp; pg 55</div><br></body></html>
