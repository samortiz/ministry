   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2 Jacob Being Stricken with Famine</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Suddenly, beyond Jacob's control, he was struck with famine, for "the famine was in the land of Canaan" 42:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God used this famine to deal with Jacob and to lift up Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have seen that in the twenty years between the loss of Joseph and the coming of this famine, Jacob had nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He probably felt that his life was over and that he was waiting to go to his people, that is, to die.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He never thought that he would go to Egypt to have another new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Of course, he never considered that Joseph would be there waiting for him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Jacob might have thought, "What new thing can happen to me?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I am old, I have had four wives, and I have many children and grandchildren.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>My life is over."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But as he was thinking this, God's hand suddenly came upon him, and Jacob was stricken by famine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What an exercise this severe famine must have been to Jacob's entire being!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Before the famine struck, he was at peace; he was not short of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But suddenly there was no food.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the head of such a large family, he was certainly exercised about what to do in the midst of this famine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God used it to press Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God also used this famine to uplift Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To Joseph, the famine was a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If there had been no famine after the seven plenteous years, Pharaoh would have said to Joseph, "Joseph, you have fooled me in interpreting my dream.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After the seven years of plenty, the famine has not come."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But the famine did come, and it was Joseph's power and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The seven years of plenty were a partial fulfillment of Pharaoh's dream, but Joseph's interpretation of that dream had not been completely confirmed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Pharaoh was probably waiting to see what would happen after the seven years of plenty.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the famine had not come, he might have executed Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, Joseph needed the seven years of famine in order to be uplifted.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This famine was Joseph's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God used it to crown him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Joseph's reign was a type of the millennium, of God's heavenly reign over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>3 Jacob Being Forced to Send His Sons</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>to Egypt to Buy Grain</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because of the famine, Jacob was forced to send his ten sons to Egypt to buy grain 42:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He had lost Joseph, and now he had to send away ten of his remaining eleven sons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In ancient times it was a long journey from Hebron to Egypt; it took about eight to ten days to travel this distance.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the ten sons had left for Egypt, only the youngest, Benjamin, who was in his early twenties, remained with Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The ten sons must have been away from Jacob for nearly a month.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This period of time was a great exercise to this old man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He might have thought, "Now my ten sons are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I wonder what will happen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Will they return safely?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Will they be able to buy food and bring it home with them?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What an exercise this was to Jacob!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This dealing was not for Jacob's transformation; it was for his maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God used it to fill Jacob with the very element of the divine life.</S>
