   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MINISTRIES IN THE DENOMINATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Regarding this matter of the ministry, we need to be clear both about the truth in the Bible and about the situation of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Originally, during the time of the Apostles, there was one Body with one ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But due to the degradation of the church, the divisions and denominations came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now every division has its own so-called ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Baptists, the Presbyterians, the Lutherans, the Episcopalians, and the Pentecostals all have their own ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The ministers, pastors, and preachers in the various denominations are working to build up the denominations, not the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because each is building up his own denomination, he cannot work together with others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We can have nothing to do with the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Lord s recovery we are for the recovery of Christ as life and everything to us for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For the fulfillment of God s purpose in His recovery, we need to go back to the beginning, back to the pure Word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the New Testament there is one unique ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From the time of the Apostles until now, this ministry has not been terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I believe that we are the continuation of this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am happy to say that I am in this ministry, that I am part of this ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are in the unique ministry according to the New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>NOT RECEIVING MINISTRIES</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THAT DAMAGE THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the time of the Apostles there were no denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because of the degradation of the church and the existence of many divisions, there apparently are now many ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Can we in the Lord s recovery, who share in the unique ministry, the continuation of the ministry of the Apostles, accept the ministries of the denominations and divisions?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No, we cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we accept them, the recovery will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The proper ministry, the ministry according to God s New Testament economy, is for the building up of the Body of Christ, but the other ministries are for the building up of the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because this is the case, we cannot receive the ministries that build up the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I was in Taiwan, some denominational missionaries told me that they appreciated the work of my ministry and that they wanted to invite me to speak to their people and to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They also suggested that I invite them to speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How would you reply to such a suggestion?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The correct way to answer is to say that Brother Lee and his co-workers have been commissioned by the Lord to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, those in the denominations are building up the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not burdened to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, our burden is to continue the ministry in the New Testament for the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because the ministries of those in the denominations are for the building up of the denominations, we cannot invite them to speak to us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we were to give place to such ministries, the Body would be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the reason we cannot receive those ministries.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We admit that there is something genuine in them, but as a whole their goal is to build up the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a frustration and an opposition to the building up of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Regarding this matter of the ministry, we need the Lord s shining.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need to go to the Lord and open ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we do this, the light will shine upon this teaching concerning the ministry, and the teaching will become the truth, the reality, to us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From the time the Lord made me clear about this matter many years ago, I have never been distracted from it, because the shining of the light is so bright.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The light shines upon all my steps; therefore, I cannot help the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, we cannot invite those in the denominations to speak to us and thereby cause damage to the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because the ministries of those in the denominations are for a purpose other than God s eternal purpose to build up the Body of Christ, we cannot cooperate with them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can neither help them nor receive help from them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some may think that we are narrow-minded for taking this stand.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Actually, we are not narrow-minded.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, the light regarding the ministry is shining upon us; we cannot deny that we have seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because of this light, we cannot change in this matter.</S>
