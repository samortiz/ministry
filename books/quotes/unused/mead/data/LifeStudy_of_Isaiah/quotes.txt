[1]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: Isa 1:1; 2:1; 13:1; 15:1; 43:3; 49:26; 9:6; 7:14; 4:2; 53:2-3; 42:1-4; 53:7-12; 52:13; 40:10; 64:1; 9:1-7; 49:6; 12:2-3; 2:2-5; 11:6-9; 35:1-10; 30:26; 65:17
[2]  The book of Isaiah is the first of the books of the prophets.
[3]  The content of Isaiah is this: God's dealing in love with His beloved Israel and His righteous judgment upon the nations bring in Christ, the Savior 43:3; 49:26 , who is God 9:6 incarnated to be a man 7:14 , possessing both the divine and human natures 4:2 , living on this earth 53:2-3; 42:1-4 , crucified 53:7-10a,12 , resurrected 53:10b-11 , ascended 52:13 , and coming 40:10; 64:1 to meet the need of God's chosen people and the nations 9:1-7; 49:6 in God's all-inclusive salvation 12:2-3 , that the restoration of all things 2:2-5; 11:6-9; 35:1-10; 30:26 may be brought in, which will consummate in the new heaven and new earth for eternity 65:17 .
[4]  This section reveals that the action of God in His economy first will benefit Israel and then will bring in the wonderful Christ to meet the need of every situation.
[5]  Hence, although God gave up the nations temporarily, He would not do this for the long run, because He has chosen many from the Gentiles to be believers and to constitute the Body of Christ, which is much more crucial to God than Israel is.
[6]  According to Isaiah 1:3, Israel does not know Jehovah, not even as the ox knows his owner, and the donkey, his master's manger.
[7]  If Israel does not know their Master as a person, they should at least know His manger as a place of eating.
[8]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE THREE THE SALVATION OF JEHOVAH
[9]  After Jehovah's chastisement on His beloved children, we have His loving exhortation and promise to His chastised people.
[10]  TO HIS BELOVED PEOPLE AND THE NATIONS 3 JEHOVAH'S HUMILIATING JUDGMENT
[11]  The more God judges the nations, the more Christ is ushered in; and the more Christ is ushered in, the more the restoration of Israel issues out.
[12]  God also judges all the lofty mountains and all the lifted-up hills v. 14 . In figure and in typology, these mountains and hills signify countries, nations, and kingdoms.
[13]  God's judgment on the haughty nations ushers in the God-man, Christ 4:2, 5-6 , issuing in the restoration of the nation of Israel 4:3-6; 2:2-5 .
[14]  In Isaiah 4:5 and 6 there are another two striking expressions, revealing to us more of Christ in His divinity and humanity.
[15]  The God-man, Christ, will also be a canopy, which is the covering glory of Christ in His divinity that covers the entire region of Mount Zion and all its convocations, that is, all the interests of Jehovah God on the earth.
[16]  This overshadowing tabernacle is the God-man, Christ, in His humanity with His grace, as illustrated in 2 Corinthians 12:9.
[17]  Jehovah will create over the entire region of Mount Zion and over all her convocations a cloud of smoke by day and the brightness of a fiery flame by night v. 5a to be a canopy of His divine glory over all His interests on the earth, that is, the God-man, Christ, as the great canopy covering Zion and the children of Israel.
[18]  In the day of restoration, the God-man, Christ, as the divine Shoot of Jehovah, will be beauty and glory to Israel, and as the human seed of the earth will be excellence and splendor to them 4:2 .
[19]  In the coming restoration, the all-inclusive Christ will be the children of Israel's beauty and glory in His divinity and their excellence and splendor in His humanity that expresses the beauty and glory of His divinity.
[20]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE FIVE A WORD CONCERNING CHRIST
[21]  In the previous message, I used the expression the ushering in of the God-man, Christ, and now I would like to explain why I use the term ushering in with respect to Christ.
[22]  In chapter four, after speaking of Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth, Isaiah goes on to refer to this One as a canopy and a tabernacle.
[23]  TO HIS BELOVED PEOPLE AND THE NATIONS 4 THE VISION OF CHRIST IN GLORY
[24]  The People Having Become Fallen, but Christ and His Throne Remaining the Same in His Glory
[25]  The people had become fallen, but Christ and His throne remained the same in His glory v. 1a . On this earth, everything changes and fluctuates, but Christ remains the same today and forever Heb 13:8 .
[26]  In Isaiah 6:5 we have the response of Isaiah.
[27]  Isaiah 6:6-7 speaks concerning the purging of Isaiah.
[28]  Who will go for Us?" v. 8a . The words I and Us indicate that the One speaking here is triune, that this One is not merely Christ but Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God.
[29]  C. Jehovah Wanting Ahaz to Ask for a Sign
[30]  Jehovah wanted Ahaz to ask for a sign 7:10-25 .
[31]  This sign is related to the ushering in of Christ, who was born of a virgin.
[32]  Finally, Christ as Immanuel causes God's people not to inquire of the necromancers and the familiar spirits, but to inquire of God, and not to inquire of the dead on behalf of the living v. 19 . God's people were to go to the law and to the testimony, speaking according to this word with the dawn in them, and not going through the land hardpressed and hungry, so that they rage and curse their king and their God, turning their face upward and looking to the earth, but there being nothing except distress, darkness, and gloom of anguish and they being thrust into darkness vv.
[33]  OPPOSITION COMING FROM BABYLON Babylon in the Old Testament
[34]  The divine revelation always has its own principle, and according to the principle of the divine revelation, the first nation used by Satan to frustrate God from accomplishing His eternal economy was Babel in Genesis 11.
[35]  This is the land which Christ will inherit for the establishing of His millennial kingdom with two peoples chosen Israel as His earthly people and the chosen believers as His heavenly people.
[36]  In Isaiah Christ is unveiled first as the Shoot of Jehovah 4:2a and then as the Fruit of the earth 4:2b , as a canopy to cover all the interests of God in the whole universe 4:5 , and as a tabernacle overshadowing God's chosen people 4:6 .
[37]  Eventually, this Christ becomes the center of an all-inclusive sign the sign of a virgin conceiving and bearing a son.
[38]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE NINE THE SALVATION OF JEHOVAH
[39]  TO HIS BELOVED PEOPLE AND THE NATIONS 6 THE UNVEILING OF CHRIST
[40]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE TEN THE SALVATION OF JEHOVAH
[41]  In chapter six Christ is the One sitting on the throne in glory v. 1 . In chapter seven Christ is the child who is called Immanuel v. 14 , and in chapter eight Christ is the sanctuary to His people but a striking stone, a rock of stumbling, and a trap, and a snare to His opposers v. 14 . In chapter nine Christ is the great light v. 2 , a child born, a son given, the Mighty God, the Wonderful Counselor, the Eternal Father, and the Prince of Peace v. 6 .
[42]  Here God is saying that it was He who used Assyria as an ax to chop His people, but now this ax is glorifying itself above the One who chopped with it.
[43]  Then in that day the remnant of Israel and those of the house of Israel who have escaped will no longer rely upon him who strikes them the king of Assyria but they will rely upon Jehovah, the Holy One of Israel, in truth v. 20 . To rely upon Jehovah in truth is to rely upon Him in honesty.
[44]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE ELEVEN THE SALVATION OF JEHOVAH
[45]  TO HIS BELOVED PEOPLE AND THE NATIONS 8 THE RESTORATION BROUGHT IN THROUGH CHRIST
[46]  Concerning Christ as the twig and the branch, verse 2 goes on to say, "The Spirit of Jehovah will rest upon Him,/ The Spirit of wisdom and understanding,/The Spirit of counsel and might,/The Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah."
[47]  The Spirit of counsel and might here equals the wisdom and power in 1 Corinthians 1:24, which tells us that Christ is God's wisdom and God's power.
[48]  Here we see that Christ is also the root of Jesse and that His resting place will be the glory.
[49]  C. The Return of the Restored Remnant of Israel
[50]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE TWELVE THE JUDGMENT OF JEHOVAH
[51]  UPON THE NATIONS AND ITS ISSUE Scripture Reading: Isa 13 23; Eph 6:12b; Dan 10:13, 20; Rev 3:7
[52]  In this message we will cover eleven chapters, chapters thirteen through twenty-three, a long portion concerning Jehovah's judgment upon the nations and its issue, which is Christ's coming and the restoration that follows.
[53]  These chapters show us one major point that the nations are used by God's enemy to disturb God's chosen people and to frustrate God from carrying out His economy.
[54]  The Assyrians put a yoke and a burden upon Israel.
[55]  Isaiah 21:13-17 reveals that Jehovah would desolate Arabia by the harshness of battle because of its warlikeness.
[56]  Another issue of Jehovah's judgment upon the nations is the restoring and establishing of His beloved Israel.
[57]  The ultimate issue of Jehovah's judgment upon the nations is to provide the all-inclusive Christ as the Savior to meet the need of the beloved Israel and the judged nations.
[58]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE THIRTEEN THE VISION OF THE ECONOMY OF GOD
[59]  HIDDEN IN ISAIAH'S PROPHECY Scripture Reading: Isa 22:19-25; Rom 6:6; 11:17; John 15:5; Gal 2:20; Col 2:16-17
[60]  In this message I would like to give a word concerning a very crucial matter the vision of the economy of God hidden in the first twenty-three chapters of Isaiah's prophecy.
[61]  The content of chapters one through twelve of Isaiah is the all-inclusive Christ.
[62]  After God's firing and replacing of everyone and everything with Christ, there will first be the restoration for the kingdom, and then there will be the restoration for the new heaven and new earth for the New Jerusalem.
[63]  Christ is the vine, and we are the branches v. 5 . As wild olive branches, we have been grafted into Christ Rom 11:17 . Thus, we are united with Christ, and in this union Christ replaces us.
[64]  Because of man's reaction, God, who had hired everyone, eventually fired everyone that He might replace everyone with Christ.
[65]  When everyone and everything is replaced with Christ, Christ becomes everything.
[66]  In Isaiah, everything is fired, discharged by God, and then the discharging God comes in to replace everything with Christ.
[67]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE FOURTEEN JEHOVAH'S REACTION TO ISRAEL'S DEGRADATION
[68]  In chapter twenty-four we also see Jehovah's reaction to Israel's degradation.
[69]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE FIFTEEN JEHOVAH'S REACTION TO ISRAEL'S DEGRADATION
[70]  According to 25:9, in that day Israel will say, "Behold, this is our God;/We have waited that He may save us./This is Jehovah, for whom we have waited;/Let us be glad and rejoice in His salvation."
[71]  Through His incarnation Christ brought to us the very reality of the universe the Triune God, the Divine Trinity, embodied in a person, Jesus Christ.
[72]  In Isaiah 29:1-12, 14-16 we see Jehovah's judgment on the hypocrisy of the worshippers in Jerusalem.
[73]  The house of Jacob will not be ashamed, nor will his face turn pale v. 22 . They will sanctify the name of Jehovah, the Holy One of Jacob v. 23 . This means that they will point to, in the distance, the coming Christ as the wisdom and reality to God's redeemed people 1 Cor 1:24, 30; John 1:17b that they may be the true worshippers of God John 4:23-24 .
[74]  This divine philosophy included God's chastisement of Israel, His judgment upon the nations, the restoration of Israel, the restoration of the created yet fallen things, and the ushering in of the all-inclusive Christ.
[75]  God's chastisement of Israel and His judgment upon the nations who exercised excessive action upon Israel issues in three things: 1 Israel is brought back to God; 2 the created things are restored; and 3 the all-inclusive Christ is ushered in. The restoration of the created yet fallen things goes along with Israel's return to God.
[76]  Jehovah will cause the majesty of His voice to be heard and the descending of His arm to be seen, with the blasting of anger and the flame of devouring fire, in cloudburst, downpour, and hailstones v. 30 . For at the voice of Jehovah, Assyria will be dismayed; with a staff He will strike v. 31 . Every pass of the appointed rod, which Jehovah will lay upon him, will be with tambourines and harps; and in battles of brandishing weapons He will fight against them v. 32 . Their king will be burned in the fire of Topheth v. 33 . Topheth, a valley of continual fire not far from Jerusalem where filthy and evil things were burned, is a symbol of the lake of fire Rev 20:15 .
[77]  In 30:15 and 31:6 and 7 we have a word concerning Jehovah's dealing with Israel's reliance on Egypt and His dealing with the nations issuing in Israel's turn to Jehovah.
[78]  When Jehovah returns to Israel, He will return with the restoration.
[79]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE EIGHTEEN JEHOVAH'S DESTRUCTION OF THE NATIONS
[80]  I. JEHOVAH'S DESTRUCTION OF THE NATIONS A. Woe Being to Those
[81]  God hired us to be kings, but we did not do very well; therefore, we were fired that Christ could be the King as our replacement.
[82]  In 33:2 Isaiah says, "O Jehovah, be gracious to us; we have waited for You;/Be our arm every morning,/Our salvation also in the time of distress."
[83]  In the morning revival we need to enjoy Christ as our arm and our salvation.
[84]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE NINETEEN AN EXAMPLE OF SEEKING AFTER JEHOVAH
[85]  The first thirty-five chapters to this book cover God's loving chastisement on His beloved Israel and His righteous judgment on the nations, in order that His elect might have a turn to Him so that the created things might be restored and that the all-inclusive Christ might be brought in. At this point, everyone and everything has been fired by God, and Christ, the only one who is qualified, is here.
[86]  After Hezekiah received this miraculous deliverance, he became mortally ill.
[87]  Then Hezekiah again prayed a very godly prayer, saying, "O Jehovah, please remember how I have walked before You in truth, with a perfect heart, and have done that which is good in Your sight" v. 3 . God heard Hezekiah's prayer and answered it by healing him and saying, through Isaiah, that He would add fifteen years to his life vv.
[88]  Some readers of Isaiah might think at first that Hezekiah was a person who was absolutely for God and not at all for himself.
[89]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE TWENTY AN EXAMPLE OF SEEKING AFTER JEHOVAH
[90]  AND TRUSTING IN HIM 2 Scripture Reading: Isa 36 39
[91]  Rab-shakeh stood and cried out with a loud voice in the Jews' language, and said, "Listen to the words of the great king, the king of Assyria: Thus says the king, Do not let Hezekiah deceive you, because he is not able to deliver you; neither let Hezekiah cause you to trust in Jehovah, saying, Jehovah will surely deliver us, and this city will not be given into the hand of the king of Assyria....Who among all the gods of these lands have delivered their land out of my hand, that Jehovah should deliver Jerusalem out of my hand?"
[92]  In 37:9-11 we read of the enemy's further attack.
[93]  The king of Assyria heard the report about the king of Ethiopia which said, "He has come to make war with you" v. 9 . When he heard this, he sent messengers to Hezekiah, saying to him, "Do not let your God in whom you trust deceive you, saying, Jerusalem will not be delivered into the hand of the king of Assyria.
[94]  Jehovah said that He would save Jerusalem for His own sake and for the sake of David 37:33-35 .
[95]  Isaiah 38:10-20 is the writing of Hezekiah, the king of Judah, when he was sick and had recovered from his sickness.
[96]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE JEHOVAH'S WORD OF COMFORT TO ISRAEL Scripture Reading: Isa 40; John 1:19-27; 1 Pet 1:23-24
[97]  In the Old Testament of thirty-nine books, the main thing covered is the old creation, and in the New Testament of twenty-seven books, the main thing revealed is God's new creation.
[98]  Now we need to see that in the first thirty-nine chapters of Isaiah, the old creation is covered, including God's chastisement of Israel and His judgment of the Gentiles, whereas in the last twenty-seven chapters, the center of Isaiah's prophecy is the new creation.
[99]  After Isaiah 40 speaks of the coming of John the Baptist and the appearing of Christ as the glory of God, this chapter tells us that, like the grass and the flower of the field, all men will wither and fade, but the word of God remains forever vv.
[100]  1 35 , the prophet's vision concerning Jehovah's governmental dealing with Israel and His punishing judgment on the nations, ushering in the all-inclusive Christ with the expected restoration of all things, has been adequately unveiled.
[101]  40 66 is the kind word of Jehovah spoken to the heart of Israel, His beloved people, which unveils the prophet's vision concerning the redeeming and saving Christ as the Servant of Jehovah and the all-inclusive salvation brought in by Him to Israel and the nations, with the full restoration of all things, consummating in the new heaven and new earth.
[102]  The coming Christ is to be announced as Jehovah our God v. 3 and as Jehovah of glory, to be revealed and seen by all flesh together v. 5 . Furthermore, the coming Christ is to be announced as the Lord Jehovah coming with might to rule with His arm, having His reward with Him and His recompense before Him vv.
[103]  Christ as the Servant of Jehovah was also typified by Israel for the carrying out of the kind word of comfort spoken by Jehovah to Israel Isa 41:8-20 .
[104]  Since we have been replaced by Christ, we must realize that we are nothing a drop from a bucket, specks of dust on the scales v. 15 . God Himself is the only One in the universe who remains forever.
[105]  Isaiah 42:2 says, "He will not cry out, nor lift up His voice, / Nor make His voice heard in the street."
[106]  In this message we will see that in chapters forty-three through forty-five Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is typified by Cyrus king of Persia to be Jehovah's Shepherd and to fulfill all the desires of Jehovah.
[107]  Isaiah 43:5-7 says, "Do not fear, because I am with you; / I will bring your seed from the east,/And gather you from the west./I will say to the north, Give them up,/And to the south, Do not keep them back./Bring My sons from afar, / And My daughters from the end of the earth, / Everyone who is called by My name,/Whom I have created, formed, and even made for My glory."
[108]  Verses 10 and 11 say, "You are My witnesses, declares Jehovah,/And My servant whom I have chosen,/In order that you may know and believe Me/And understand that I am He./Before Me there was no God formed,/Neither will there be any after Me./I, even I, am Jehovah;/And there is no Savior besides Me."
[109]  Jehovah confirms the word of His servants and fulfills the counsel of His messengers.
[110]  Jehovah also says to Jerusalem, "She will be inhabited," and to the cities of Judah, "They will be built," and "I will raise up their ruins" v. 26 . He says to the depths, "Be dried up," and "I will dry up your rivers" v. 27 . Furthermore, Jehovah says to Cyrus, "He is My shepherd," indicating that Cyrus is God's shepherd for the shepherding of Israel.
[111]  God carries out His salvation by using His Spirit to bring down Christ as righteousness and by opening us to receive Christ as salvation and righteousness.
[112]  God in Christ and Christ with God have reached this point, that is, to have Christ expressed as God's centrality and universality, to such an extent that Cyrus, a Gentile king, became one with Christ and that even pitiful Israel also became one with Him.
[113]  Regarding this, 46:9 says, "Remember the former things of old,/That I am God and there is no one else;/I am God and there is no one like Me."
[114]  Israel makes mention of the God of Israel, but not in truth or in righteousness v. 1 . Verse 4 says that Israel is obstinate, and verse 8 indicates that Jehovah knew that Israel would deal treacherously.
[115]  Verses 14 and 15 continue, "Assemble all of yourselves together and hear!/Who among them has declared these things?/Jehovah loves him; he will do His pleasure/On Babylon, and His arm will be upon the Chaldeans./I, even I, have spoken; indeed, I have called him;/I have brought him, and his way will prosper."
[116]  Since we are in this corporate Christ, and Christ is the Servant of God, we also are one servant of God, one witness of God.
[117]  Verse 12 says, "Behold, these ones will come from a distance,/And some will come from the north and the west / And others from the land of the Sinim."
[118]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH 5 IN RELATION TO JEHOVAH'S LOVING DEALING
[119]  WITH HIS BELOVED ISRAEL Scripture Reading: Isa 51 52; 53:1-2
[120]  Verses 4 through 8 speak of Jehovah's righteousness and salvation for Israel.
[121]  In 51:9-16 we see Jehovah's arm for Israel.
[122]  As 53:1-2 indicates, Jehovah's arm is Christ the Servant of Jehovah.
[123]  Hence, Jehovah's arm for Israel is actually Christ for Israel.
[124]  Isaiah 52:9 and 10 go on to say, "Break forth, give a ringing shout together,/You wasted places of Jerusalem,/For Jehovah has comforted His people,/He has redeemed Jerusalem./Jehovah has bared His holy arm Christ, the Servant of Jehovah /In the sight of all the nations,/And all the ends of the earth will see/The salvation of our God."
[125]  Verses 11 and 12 reveal that these chapters concerning Christ as the Servant of Jehovah are related to Israel's departure from Babylon.
[126]  Presently, political Babylon is less prominent than religious Babylon.
[127]  Political Babylon is somewhat in a state of repose, whereas religious Babylon is flourishing.
[128]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE TWENTY-SEVEN CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH 6 HIS DYNAMIC REDEMPTION
[129]  "He was oppressed, and it was He who was afflicted,/Yet He did not open His mouth;/Like a lamb that is led to the slaughter / And like a sheep that is dumb before its shearers, / So He did not open His mouth" v. 7 . He did not have any reaction toward those who were persecuting Him.
[130]  Whereas Isaiah 53:10 says that God put Christ to death, making His soul an offering for sin, verse 12 says that "He poured out His soul unto death."
[131]  If Christ merely put Himself to death on the cross, and God did accept Him as an offering for sin, Christ's death would not have been a vicarious death for us; it would have been only martyrdom.
[132]  Likewise, if God was pleased to put Him to death, and He was not willing to die, then His death would not have been a vicarious death.
[133]  Isaiah's writing in this chapter presents a clear defense in the heavenly court, testifying that God was pleased to put Christ to death, that Christ was willing to die for others, and that He was altogether sinless v. 9 . Thus, His death was truly a vicarious death.
[134]  "He will see a seed, He will extend His days,/And the pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand" v. 10b . The seed here is the church, comprising all the believers produced as the many grains by the death of Christ as the one grain and His reproductive resurrection John 12:24; 1 Pet 1:3 . He was the one grain who died to produce many grains.
[135]  "The pleasure of Jehovah will prosper in His hand" v. 10c . The pleasure of God is to see many sons born of Him to become the members of Christ, who constitute the church as the corporate expression of Christ.
[136]  God Dividing to Him a Portion with the Great,
[137]  Because of Christ's vicarious death and reproductive resurrection and because He has decided to accept the believers and bear their iniquities, God will divide to Him a portion with the great, and Christ Himself will divide the spoil with the strong.
[138]  This indicates that God will divide to Christ a portion with God as the great One and that Christ will divide the spoil with God as the strong One.
[139]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH 7 HIS BEING AN ETERNAL COVENANT TO ISRAEL,
[140]  In Isaiah 55 the most striking word is waters v. 1 . Water is also mentioned at the end of the first section of this book 12:3 . This indicates that in the book of Isaiah, God always considers that He is our salvation as living water.
[141]  "I will make an eternal covenant with you,/Even the sure mercies shown to David" v. 3b . Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is the waters, and this Christ, who is the Servant of God, is also an eternal covenant with Israel 42:6; 49:8; 54:10 , even the sure mercies shown to David.
[142]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE TWENTY-NINE CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH 8 THE EVIL CONDITION AND THE NEED
[143]  The righteous and godly ones are the ones who come to God, contact God, and enjoy God.
[144]  "It will be said,/Cast up, cast up; prepare the way;/Take up the obstacle out of the way of My people" v. 14 . The greatest obstacle to our Christian life is our failure to contact the Lord.
[145]  Isaiah 58:1-9a describes the hypocrisy of the house of Jacob.
[146]  To those who remove the yoke and cease from the pointing of the finger and the speaking of wickedness, Jehovah says, "Then your light will rise in the darkness,/And your gloom will be like midday;/And Jehovah will guide you continually, / And satisfy your soul in the dry times,/And strengthen your bones;/And you will be like a watered garden,/And like a spring of water,/Whose waters do not deceive./And those who are of you will rebuild the ancient ruins;/You will raise up the foundations of generation upon generation;/And you will be called the repairer of the breach,/The restorer of the paths in which to dwell" vv.
[147]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE THIRTY CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH 9 AS THE REDEEMER TO SAVE JACOB
[148]  FROM THEIR SINS AND INIQUITIES AND BECOME ISRAEL'S LIGHT AND GLORY FOREVER Scripture Reading: Isa 59 60; 42:6; 49:8; 54:10; Rev 21:23
[149]  To keep the Sabbath is to be "fired" and replaced by Christ so that we may get into Him and rest in Him for eternity.
[150]  This is to be crucified with Christ with the result that it is no longer we who live, but Christ lives in us Gal 2:20 .
[151]  Jehovah's hand is not so short that it cannot save, and His ear is not so heavy that it cannot hear 59:1 .
[152]  But Jacob's iniquities have become a separation between them and their God, and their sins have hidden His face from them so that He does not hear v. 2 .
[153]  God has put both His Spirit and His word into our mouth.
[154]  His Spirit is for us to breathe, and His word is for our nourishment and also for our speaking.
[155]  For this reason, we emphasize, encourage, promote, and advocate the matter of prophesying, that is, speaking for God, speaking God forth, and speaking God in His word into others for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[156]  The Triune God is embodied in Christ, Christ is embodied in the word, the word is realized as the Spirit, and the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.
[157]  In the New Jerusalem Rev 21:23 Israel will enjoy Jehovah in Christ, the Servant of Jehovah, as the eternal light Isa 60:19-22 .
[158]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE THIRTY-ONE CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH 10 THE MINISTRY OF THE ANOINTED OF JEHOVAH,
[159]  Isaiah 61 through 63 reveals that the ministry of the Anointed of Jehovah, Christ as the Servant of Jehovah, issues in the restoration of Israel.
[160]  Verse 1 says, "The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah is upon Me, / Because Jehovah has anointed Me / To bring good news to the afflicted; / He has sent Me to bind up the wounds of the brokenhearted, / To proclaim liberty to the captives, / And the opening of the eyes to those who are bound."
[161]  As Luke 4:16-21 indicates, this refers to Christ in His first coming.
[162]  When the Lord came the first time, He was conceived of the Holy Spirit and constituted with the essence of the Holy Spirit added to His humanity to be a God-man.
[163]  Prior to that time, He was already constituted with the Spirit essentially, but in order to carry out God's economy, He needed the Spirit economically to empower Him and authorize Him to be the Servant of God to minister God into His chosen people.
[164]  and the Gentiles to Be the Laborers to Israel
[165]  In the restoration Israel will be priests of Jehovah, the ministers of their God, and the Gentiles will be the laborers to serve Israel Isa 61:4-9 .
[166]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO CHRIST AS THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH 11 THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST
[167]  He has stretched out His hands all day long to a rebellious people, who walk in a way that is not good, after their own thoughts, who provoke Him to anger, and who are smoke in His nose, a fire that burns all day 65:1-7, 11-12; 66:1-6, 17 .
[168]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE THIRTY-THREE CHRIST BEING THE SHOOT OF JEHOVAH
[169]  Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah is for the branching out of Jehovah God, in His divinity, into humanity John 1:14 .
[170]  Christ is also the Fruit of the earth Isa 4:2b .
[171]  God Himself as the glory expressed in Christ will remain as a canopy over Mount Zion to cover His interests, which include His holy temple, His holy people, and all His holy convocations.
[172]  The second requirement is to live and remain in a holy life in God's chosen place Zion and Jerusalem v. 3a . Today the local church is Zion, and the Body of Christ is Jerusalem.
[173]  Third, we must be chosen by God according to His record of life v. 3b . Our being chosen by God qualifies us to partake of Christ.
[174]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR CHRIST SEEN IN HIS DIVINE GLORY
[175]  WITH HIS HUMAN VIRTUES HELD IN HIS HOLINESS Scripture Reading: Isa 6:1-10; 5:16b; John 12:39-41
[176]  Isaiah, a book which was quoted greatly by the Lord Jesus and the apostles in the New Testament, reveals many wonderful aspects concerning Christ.
[177]  In message one we saw Christ as the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth Isa 4:2 .
[178]  I. A VISION SEEN BY ISAIAH IN HIS DEPRESSION
[179]  The vision of Christ in glory was seen by Isaiah in his depression Isa 6:1, 5 .
[180]  Christ is seen in Isaiah 6 as God in His divinity, signified by the smoke, and as a man in His humanity, signified by the train of His robe.
[181]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE A CHILD OF BOTH
[182]  The word child in these verses implies God, implies man, implies God becoming a man, and implies God and man mingled together as one.
[183]  The second revelation Isaiah saw concerning Christ was that of Christ in His divine glory with His human virtues held in His holiness 6:1-10 .
[184]  The child born of a human virgin is Immanuel, God with man Isa 7:14; 9:6a .
[185]  He was a human child born of a human virgin, yet He was also the very God.
[186]  The child born of the virgin is Jesus and Immanuel, and this child is the gift given as the Son.
[187]  This Son, this gift, is the Wonderful Counselor, the Mighty God, the Eternal Father, and the Prince of Peace.
[188]  When we received Christ, we received Him as so many marvelous items.
[189]  He is Jehovah our Savior, to save us from sin into Himself, and He is Immanuel, God with us.
[190]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE THIRTY-SIX A SANCTUARY TO THE POSITIVE ONES AND
[191]  A STONE TO STRIKE AGAINST, A ROCK OF STUMBLING,
[192]  We have to see the central thought of God toward the positive ones, His chosen people.
[193]  The positive ones are the ones who were chosen, called, redeemed, and saved by God, the ones who have been regenerated and are being transformed into the divine image.
[194]  E. Christ with All the Members of His Body
[195]  Christ as the Head and we as the members of His Body are the temple of God.
[196]  Christ with all the members of His Body will be consummated as the enlarged tabernacle and temple of God the New Jerusalem Rev 21:2-3, 22 .
[197]  The holy city as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in, and God and the Lamb as the temple are for us to dwell in. God dwells in us, and we dwell in Him.
[198]  Christ is also revealed in Isaiah 8:14 as a trap and a snare.
[199]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN THE GREAT LIGHT FOR THE SHINING IN DARKNESS
[200]  AND FOR THE RELEASE FROM BONDAGE Scripture Reading: Isa 9:1-5; Matt 4:12-16; John 1:9, 4-5; Acts 26:18; 1 Pet 2:9b; Col 1:13; Luke 1:78-79; Isa 10:26-27; Judg.
[201]  Christ is the great light the true light, the light of life Matt 4:12-16; John 1:9, 4 .
[202]  Christ is unveiled as the great light for the shining in darkness.
[203]  Isaiah also speaks of Christ as the great light for the release from bondage.
[204]  By the Lord's shining, He releases the imprisoned ones from bondage.
[205]  This release from bondage is actually the multiplication of God's people.
[206]  When we go out to preach the gospel, we bring the shining of Christ to those who are in darkness Acts 26:18a .
[207]  Christ's coming in incarnation as the twig was the revival of David's deprived royal family.
[208]  David's royal family was deprived to such an extent that there was hardly anything left of it.
[209]  The completion of His being sent by God is accomplished in three ways: by His building up of the church, by His preparing of Israel, and by His adjustment, His judging, of the nations.
[210]  As the twig from the stem of Jesse and the branch from the roots of Jesse, Christ carries out the administration of Jehovah Isa 11:3-5 .
[211]  When Christ returns, He will strike the land with the rod of His mouth, and with the breath of His lips, He will slay the wicked v. 4b . The breath of His lips is His word out of His mouth.
[212]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE THIRTY-NINE A TWIG FROM THE STEM OF JESSE
[213]  Through the restoration of Israel, Christ will become a banner to the peoples and a standard to the nations.
[214]  Christ is also a standard to the nations v. 12a . A standard, probably being the enlargement of the branch in verse 1, indicates the influence of the calling and gathering power.
[215]  We also have to overcome frustrations for our preaching of the gospel in the Lord's move.
[216]  I was recently fellowshipping with some brothers about my feeling that the Lord's recovery should reconsider its direction.
[217]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE FORTY THE SPRINGS OF SALVATION Scripture Reading: Isa 12; John 1:14a; Col 2:9; Matt 1:21; Heb 5:9; 9:12; John 4:14; Rev 21:6 THE FOUNTAIN OF SALVATION,
[218]  Out of the fountain of salvation come the springs.
[219]  Along with drinking the Lord, we also need to breathe Him in. According to the spiritual reality, breathing is drinking.
[220]  Christ is the springs of salvation for our enjoyment.
[221]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE FORTY-ONE THE KING REIGNING IN THE TENT OF DAVID,
[222]  We may wonder what this aspect of Christ has to do with us since Christ will reign as a king in the tent of David in the coming age during the restoration of the nation of Israel.
[223]  Thus, today we have to realize that Christ is our King.
[224]  He reigns not only in our hearts but also in the tent of David.
[225]  In the coming age, when Christ reigns in the tent of David, that will be a greater consolation to Israel.
[226]  THE ETERNAL ROCK FOR HIS PEOPLE TO TRUST IN
[227]  Every human being apart from Christ has nothing to trust in, but we have the Lord as the eternal Rock to trust in. Isaiah 17:10 says, "For you have forgotten the God of your salvation, / And the Rock of your stronghold you have not remembered.
[228]  In this message we want to see what Christ is as the Steward in the house of God, typified by Eliakim.
[229]  I. THE STEWARD IN GOD'S HOUSE INTO WHOSE HAND
[230]  Eliakim typifies Christ as the Steward in God's house Isa 22:15, 21a .
[231]  The all-inclusive Christ, as typified by Eliakim, is also the One upon whose shoulder the key of the treasury of the house of God typified by the house of David for the building up of the kingdom of God is set Isa 22:22; Rev 3:7 .
[232]  Hymn #541 in Hymns is concerning the experience of Christ versus all things.
[233]  It speaks of the things that replace Christ, such as the law of letters, philosophy, and religion.
[234]  All these things are really "Shebnas" which replace Christ.
[235]  We should not allow anything or anyone, including ourselves, to replace Christ.
[236]  Christ has a big key to open the treasury of all His riches.
[237]  Christ is the One who can open up to us all the riches of God embodied in Him.
[238]  Christ as a peg will become a throne of glory for His Father's house Isa 22:23b .
[239]  Christ being a throne of glory for His Father's house is the issue of His people, who are vessels, hanging upon Him as the peg in order to contain Him and minister Him to others.
[240]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE FORTY-THREE A CROWN OF GLORY AND A DIADEM OF BEAUTY; A STONE AS A FOUNDATION, A TESTED STONE,
[241]  I. A CROWN OF GLORY AND A DIADEM OF BEAUTY
[242]  Isaiah 28:5 says, "In that day Jehovah of hosts / Will become a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty to the remnant of His people."
[243]  In this verse Christ is revealed as a crown of glory and a diadem of beauty.
[244]  The book of Habakkuk is one of the twelve minor books in the Old Testament.
[245]  It is very difficult to remember the order of these books in the Bible.
[246]  He is also the shadow of a massive rock in a wasted land v.
[247]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE FORTY-FOUR JEHOVAH THE SAVIOR Scripture Reading: Isa 40:3-31; John 3:34a; 7:17; 1 John 2:17a; 1 Pet 1:23-25; Matt 9:36; John 10:2-4, 11, 14; Eph 6:10; Phil 4:13, 12; 2 Tim 4:7
[248]  In the previous message we pointed out that the book of Isaiah may be divided into two sections.
[249]  John told people that he was not the Christ but the one coming before Christ to prepare His way Mark 1:1-8 .
[250]  After this kind of shepherding, the flock, the sheep, will know Jesus as the Holy One, the eternal God, Jehovah, the Creator of the ends of the earth, sitting above the circle of the earth Isa 40:22, 25-26, 28a .
[251]  The Lord gives power to the faint, and to those who have no vigor He multiplies strength v. 29 . In Ephesians 6:10 Paul said, "Be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength." He also declared, "I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me" Phil 4:13 . Christ is the empowering One, so we who wait on Him will not faint or become weary.
[252]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE FORTY-FIVE THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH As Typified by Cyrus the King of Persia,
[253]  by Israel, and by Isaiah the Prophet Scripture Reading: Isa 41:2, 25; 45:13, 1; 48:14b; 46:11b; 44:28; 41:8-16; 42:1a; 43:10; 44:1-5, 21; 49:3; 46:13b; 48:16b; 49:1-4; 50:4-9
[254]  In this message we want to see Christ as the Servant of Jehovah typified by three persons first, by a Gentile king, Cyrus the king of Persia; second, by God's selected corporate people, Israel; and third, by a typical, bonafide, top prophet of Jehovah, Isaiah.
[255]  In this chapter Isaiah declares, "Here is your God!" v. 9 . The revealing of the Lord Jehovah is the appearing of the very God, and this Lord Jehovah, the very God, is the Lord Jesus Christ.
[256]  From chapters forty-one through sixty-six, Christ is revealed as the Servant of Jehovah.
[257]  In this message we want to cover the revelation of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah in chapters forty-one through fifty.
[258]  In these ten chapters there are four servants of God Cyrus, the Gentile king; Israel, God's chosen corporate people; Isaiah, God's wonderful prophet; and Christ.
[259]  Now we need to consider what these servants as types of Christ did and what Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is doing today.
[260]  Cyrus was raised up by Jehovah Isa 41:2a, 25a; 45:13a; Acts 3:26a , anointed by Jehovah Isa 45:1a; Luke 4:18a , and loved by Jehovah 48:14b; Matt 3:17 .
[261]  He was also Jehovah's shepherd for the fulfilling of His desire in building up the city symbolizing the kingdom and the temple of God and in releasing God's captives Isa 44:28; 45:13b; Ezra 1:2-3; John 10:11; 5:30b; 2:19; Luke 4:18b .
[262]  We need to be those who are going out to get sinners.
[263]  Israel as a type of Christ is more subjective.
[264]  Israel as a type of Christ, the Servant of Jehovah, was chosen by Jehovah and upheld with the right hand of His righteousness.
[265]  Isaiah as a type of Christ considered himself as Jehovah's servant, a part of Israel, for His glory Isa 49:3; Hosea 11:1; Matt 2:15 .
[266]  Galatians 6:16 says that the church is the real Israel of God.
[267]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE FORTY-SIX THE SERVANT OF JEHOVAH As a Covenant to the People and a Light to the Nations Scripture Reading: Isa 42:1-7; 49:5-9; Matt 3:17; Luke 4:18a; Heb 7:22; Matt 26:28; Heb 9:15-17; Col 2:9; 1:19; John 1:4, 9; 8:12; 9:5; 1 Pet 1:23; 2:9b; Acts 26:18a; Zech 12:1; Rom 1:16-17; 5:18b; Titus 3:7; Luke 4:18b; Col 1:13
[268]  In this message we want to see more concerning Christ as the Servant of Jehovah.
[269]  This is because in the gospel the righteousness of God is revealed v. 17 . God has saved us not only by His love and not only by His grace but also by His righteousness.
[270]  The justification, the forgiveness, and the salvation God renders to us have all been "covenanted."
[271]  In Matthew 26 the Lord Jesus enacted a new covenant, saying, "For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" v. 28 . The new covenant is the Lord's blood, and His blood signifies His death.
[272]  Christ, the Servant of Jehovah as a covenant to the people of Israel and a light to the nations has a source, an origin.
[273]  This source is in His divinity, in His deity, in His being God.
[274]  Christ was not only called but also held by the hand of Jehovah Isa 42:6b .
[275]  There may be a distance between a called one and the calling one, but God held Christ by Christ's hand.
[276]  Now we need to see His qualification in His humanity.
[277]  Because the plants in the Old Testament are types of Christ in His humanity, Christ is also typified by a reed and flax.
[278]  C. To Be a Covenant of the People of Israel
[279]  As a covenant, He is a surety of God being the inheritance to His people Heb 7:22 .
[280]  Israel lost the land, and Christ came, in His commission, to restore it.
[281]  Christ as the covenant is for God's people to gain God with His riches as their inheritance; whereas Christ as the light is for God's people to receive God as life for their new germination.
[282]  For His chosen people to receive Christ as such a covenant and as such a light, God as the Creator of the heavens and the earth and as the One who gives breath to men, gives also spirit to them, that they may be able to enjoy Him, the Triune God, as their inheritance and life Isa 42:5; Zech 12:1 .
[283]  The commission of Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is also to bring forth justice the judgment of righteousness for salvation in truth to the nations Isa 42:1, 3b; 49:6d .
[284]  TO BE GOD'S FULL SALVATION Scripture Reading: Isa 42:5-7; 49:6, 8b-9a; Rom 10:3; 3:21-22; Gal 2:16, 21; Rom 5:16b, 18a, 12, 21a; John 5:24; Rom 5:18b; 8:17a; Gal 3:29b; Acts 26:18; Eph 2:5; John 1:12-13; Rom 8:15; Titus 3:5; 2 Cor 3:18; Rom 8:29, 30b; Matt 26:28; Heb 7:22; 9:15-17; John 9:5; 1:4, 9; 8:12; Heb 7:16b; 2 Tim 1:10b; 1 Tim 6:19, 12; Rev 21:2-3, 9b-11, 18-23; 22:1-5; Zech 12:1; Rom 8:4b; Rev 1:10a; 2 Tim 4:22; Isa 12:3-4
[285]  In this message I would like to say more concerning Christ as the covenant and the light to God's chosen people.
[286]  Why did Christ need to be given to us by God as a covenant?
[287]  The Bible shows us that God has an economy, an eternal plan, to dispense Himself into us as our life, our person, and our everything.
[288]  Now we need to consider how this Christ could be our righteousness given to us by God.
[289]  First, as the righteousness of God and as our Substitute, Christ had to die.
[290]  God's righteousness required Christ to die a vicarious death for us, and Christ did this.
[291]  In the evening before His death, He established a table for His disciples that they might remember Him and enjoy Him.
[292]  Then Christ became a life-giving Spirit in resurrection to impart, to dispense, the very life which was in God into us, to enliven us, to regenerate us, to make us children of God, to make us those who are born of God and are no longer merely a justified corpse.
[293]  The sixty-six books of the entire Bible reveal many things to us.
[294]  When all these things are embodied together as one entity, that is the New Jerusalem.
[295]  God's righteousness justifies us through the death of Christ Rom 10:3; 3:21-22; Gal 2:16, 21 .
[296]  The condemnation of God is dissolved by Christ as the covenant, and the death that comes from Satan is annulled by Christ as the light that issues in life John 8:12 .
[297]  This is to bring us, the believers, into the divine life that we may become God's heirs to inherit God with all His riches as our divine inheritance Rom 5:18b; 8:17a; Gal 3:29b; Acts 26:18b .
[298]  B. Christ as the Light to Be the Salvation of God
[299]  Thus, God gave Christ as a light to the nations that He might be God's salvation to all the world.
[300]  The way to receive and enjoy such a full salvation of God, constituted of Christ, the Servant of Jehovah, as the covenant and the light to us, God's elect, is to exercise our spirit, to live according to our spirit, and to remain in our spirit, with which is the very Christ, by calling on Christ our Lord's name Isa 42:5; Zech 12:1; Rom 8:4b; Rev 1:10a; 2 Tim 4:22; Isa 12:3-4 .
[301]  Before God spoke in verse 6 of giving Christ as a covenant for the people and as a light for the nations, He declared that He gave us a spirit v. 5 . First, He told us that He had prepared a "stomach" a spirit within us; then He told us what the "foodstuffs" Christ as the covenant and the light are.
[302]  Whatever is covered in chapters forty-one through sixty-six of Isaiah concerns Christ as the Servant of Jehovah in relation to Israel's return and restoration.
[303]  In Israel's return and restoration, the all-inclusive Christ is, first, the arm of Jehovah, second, the reigning God, and, third, the exalted Christ.
[304]  All the firstborn in Egypt, whether Egyptians or Israelites, were sinners.
[305]  Everyone should have been judged and put to death.
[306]  Isaiah 52:10 says, "Jehovah has bared His holy arm / In the sight of all the nations, / And all the ends of the earth will see / The salvation of our Israel's God."
[307]  After Israel returns from their captivity, they need to be restored.
[308]  Thus far the redeemed, returned, and restored people of God know Christ only as the arm of Jehovah and as the reigning God.
[309]  It tells us how God put all our sins upon Him v. 6 , how He was brought like a lamb to the slaughter v. 7 , and how after His death He was buried v. 9 and then resurrected v. 10b . All these things are in the New Testament, but the Old Testament elect did not know these things, and even the Jewish people today do not know these things.
[310]  REVEALED IN THE NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Isa 52:13 53:12; Acts 2:33a; 5:31a; Matt 13:54-57; 8:17; 1 Pet 2:24; Acts 8:32; Matt 26:63-64; 27:12, 14; Acts 8:33; Matt 27:26b; John 19:38-42; Acts 13:39; Eph 4:8-12; Luke 23:32, 34a
[311]  The first deeper item of Christ is Christ's crucifixion, Christ's cross, mentioned in 1 Corinthians 1:23.
[312]  No one can understand why Christ, who was God incarnated as a man and who could have called more than twelve legions of angels to protect Him Matt 26:53 , was willing to be nailed to the cross and to hang there for six hours.
[313]  This is one item of the depths of God concerning Christ.
[314]  The understanding that, because we were sinners, God sent His Son to die for us so that He could save us according to His love is correct, but it is too superficial.
[315]  Isaiah 52:13 53:12 reveals Christ as the Servant of Jehovah not in the Old Testament economy but in the New Testament economy.
[316]  The second part of Isaiah 52:13 says that Christ as the Servant of Jehovah will be exalted and lifted up and very high.
[317]  The Bible tells us that Christ has been exalted to the third heavens, to the right hand of God Phil 2:9; Heb 4:14; 7:26; 8:1 .
[318]  a. Growing Up like a Tender Plant before Jehovah
[319]  However, the first part of verse 2 says, "For He grew up like a tender plant before Him, / And like a root out of dry ground."
[320]  In the New Testament economy, it was unveiled and reported concerning Christ that He was like a tender plant, like a root out of dry ground.
[321]  Verse 4 says, "Surely He has borne our sicknesses, / And carried our sorrows; / Yet we ourselves esteemed Him stricken, / Smitten of God and afflicted."
[322]  People thought that Christ must have been wrong in something; otherwise, why would He be stricken, smitten of God and afflicted?
[323]  and Being Cut Off out of the Land of the Living
[324]  Isaiah 53:8 says, "By oppression and by judgment He was taken away; / And as for His generation, who among them had the thought / That He was cut off out of the land of the living / For the transgression of my the prophet's people to whom the stroke was due?"
[325]  According to verse 10b, Christ made His soul an offering for sin.
[326]  The seed produced by Christ in His resurrection is His believers for the building up of His Body as His continuation, with which He will extend His days.
[327]  Christ extended His days by producing a seed the believers to build up the Body of Christ, and this Body of Christ is still extending.
[328]  The pleasure of Jehovah is to reveal Himself into us, to make us the seed of Christ, to make us a part of Christ, to make us the sons of God.
[329]  LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH MESSAGE FIFTY THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST
[330]  The first stage of Christ, the stage of incarnation, was not a part of His redemption.
[331]  Christ is our Savior, and He did redeem us, but His incarnation by itself was not His redemption.
[332]  A. As the Complete God to Become a Perfect Man
[333]  As the complete God, signified by the arm of Jehovah, the power of God v. 1b; 1 Cor 1:24 , Christ became a perfect man, signified by a man of sorrows v. 3a; John 1:1, 14; 1 Tim 2:5b . The Old Testament term is the arm of Jehovah, whereas the New Testament term is the power of God.
[334]  First Corinthians 1:22-24 says, "For indeed Jews require signs and Greeks seek wisdom, but we preach Christ crucified, to Jews a stumbling block, and to Greeks foolishness, but to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God and the wisdom of God."
[335]  In these verses Christ crucified corresponds to the man of sorrows in Isaiah 53:3, and the power of God equals the arm of Jehovah in Isaiah 53:1.
[336]  IN THE STAGE OF HIS CRUCIFIXION A. As a God-man Savior
[337]  As a God-man Savior, Christ died a vicarious death for sinners Isa 53:4-5, 8, 11c, 12c; 1 Pet 2:24; 3:18a .
[338]  Actually, Christ bore our sicknesses at the moment He was judged by God on the cross, in the hour when God put all our iniquities upon Him.
[339]  According to Isaiah 53:9, Christ was assigned a grave with the wicked, but with a rich man in His death, although He had done no violence, nor was there any deceit in His mouth.
[340]  Those who crucified Him planned to bury Him with the two transgressors, the wicked ones; but eventually God in His sovereignty caused Christ to be buried in a rich man's tomb.
[341]  If a man dies while attempting to rescue someone who is drowning, that death can be considered a bold death but not a vicarious death.
[342]  Something that is vicarious must be related to the law.
[343]  But Christ died a vicarious death that was legal according to God's law and was recognized by God.
[344]  That death of Christ was recognized by God legally, according to His law, as the vicarious death of the One who was the Substitute for us, the sinners.
[345]  This is the talk of the so-called modernists, who do not believe that the Bible is wholly inspired, that Christ died on the cross for our sins and shed His blood for our redemption, and that Christ was resurrected both spiritually and physically.
[346]  In one sense, in the eyes of God, Christ was not murdered; but in another sense, in Acts 7 when God came to condemn the Jews, He accused them of murdering the Lord Jesus.
[347]  We have seen that during the last three hours that Christ was on the cross, Jehovah considered Him as the Substitute for sinners 1 Pet 3:18 and forsook Him as the unique sinner at that moment Matt 27:45-46 .
[348]  Isaiah 53:12b says that Christ poured out His life unto death.
[349]  During those three hours from twelve o'clock until three o'clock in the afternoon, the universe became dark, and the veil in the temple was split in two from the top to the bottom Matt 27:45, 51a .
[350]  This means that Christ tore the separation between God and man through His death.
[351]  However, at that time the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified v. 39 . The Holy Spirit of God was there, but He was not there as the Spirit, because before Christ's resurrection the Holy Spirit of God had not been consummated.
[352]  This life-giving Spirit is the reality of the pneumatic Christ.
[353]  In His resurrection Christ as the God-man, in His humanity, was begotten of God Acts 13:33 .
[354]  Before His resurrection Christ was the Son of God already.
[355]  In His resurrection Christ, as the one grain of wheat, bore many grains John 12:24 .
[356]  Through His life-releasing death and with His life-imparting resurrection, Christ produced a corporate seed as the issue of the travail of His soul, whom He saw in His resurrection and was satisfied Isa 53:10c-11b .
[357]  Isaiah 53:11b says that Christ will make the many righteous, who will know Him as the righteous One.
[358]  As we have seen in this message, Christ's resurrection issued in the following items:
[359]  The incarnated Christ becoming the compound, consummated, and all-inclusive life-giving Spirit.
[360]  Many sons of God to be the household of God as the kingdom of God: As the many brothers of Christ, forming the church.
[361]  IN THE STAGE OF HIS ASCENSION A. Leading Captive Those Who Were Captured
[362]  After receiving all the captives as a gift from the Father, the Son transformed all these captives in His resurrection life, making every one of them a gift Eph 4:8b .
[363]  In His ascension Christ was made both Lord Lord of lords and Christ Acts 2:36; Rev 17:14a; 19:16b .
[364]  All men in every nation belong to Christ as His possession and are under the lordship of Christ.
[365]  In His ascension Christ was made Leader the Ruler of the kings of the earth, King of kings and Savior Acts 5:31; Rev 1:5a; 17:14a; 19:16a .
[366]  Many Christians hold the understanding that the ministry of Christ includes only His incarnation, that is, His becoming a man, His death on the cross for our sins, and His resurrection that we may be resurrected with Him.
[367]  The ascension of Christ consummates in the following three main things:
[368]  In such a ministry, Christ ministers as the anointed One of God to carry out God's eternal economy for the propagating of the gospel, the raising up of the church as the kingdom of God, and the building up of the Body of Christ.
[369]  When Isaiah came to chapter fifty-five, after having written so many chapters concerning Christ, he spoke of an aspect of Christ which we would never dream of or imagine.
[370]  This aspect of Christ is that He is "the sure mercies shown to David" v. 3b . The word shown is not in the Hebrew text of Isaiah 55:3.
[371]  A number of Christians may speak about the great love of God in Christ, but I am concerned that what they speak is not so thorough.
[372]  If they were thorough in knowing God in His attributes in different levels, they would speak much about God's mercy.
[373]  In the Gospels the house of Israel offended the Son.
[374]  God's sure mercies are the resurrected Christ who did not see the corruption of death and became the base of God's justification to His believers.
[375]  Thus, Christ is not only the sure mercies of God but also God's Redeemer coming to redeem Zion at His return.
[376]  Christ as Jehovah will rise upon Israel, and His glory will be seen upon her v. 2b . Today the nation of Israel is suffering under the pressure of the nations, but when Christ comes back, Israel will rise up.
[377]  The Angel of Jehovah, from Exodus 3 through Isaiah to Zechariah, was always with Israel.
[378]  Isaiah 61:1-3 is a prophecy concerning Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah.
[379]  The prophecy concerning Christ as the Anointed of Jehovah in Isaiah 61:1-3 will have a full taste fulfillment at Christ's second coming, for the restoration of Israel unto the new heavens and new earth.
[380]  The Spirit of the Lord Jehovah was upon Christ in His first coming and will be upon Him in His second coming.
[381]  Today Israel is being pressed to release the land which they have regained.
