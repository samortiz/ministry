<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE ENLARGEMENT<br />
OF GOD MINGLED WITH MAN</h2>
<p>Next, we must see what the church is. The church is the enlargement of this hybrid, the enlargement of God mingled with man; this is the simplest description of the church. The church has been produced through the mingling of God and man. Christ is the hybrid of God mingled with man, and the church is the enlargement of this hybrid of God mingled with man.</p>
<p>The mingling of God and man occurred in the person of Jesus the Nazarene. He is the mingling of God and man. We need to ask how many such hybrids of God mingled with man are there in the universe today? Is there only one, or are there many? Is God mingling Himself with men, one by one, beginning with the Lord Jesus? Did God mingle Himself with Jesus the Nazarene and then with Peter, John, James, and Paul? Is He is still being mingled with believers one after another? In other words, how many hybrids of God mingled with man are there in the universe? Is there only one, or are there many?</p>
<p>God has mingled Himself with man only once, not twice or even many times. In the universe there has been only one mingling of God and man. This principle can be seen in the redemption of Christ, which was accomplished once for all (Heb. 7:27). Christ&rsquo;s one redemption means that there is no need for a second redemptive act. The Lord Jesus died for sinners once, and He accomplished redemption for our sins once for all. He did not accomplish redemption for Peter and then another redemption for Paul. Neither did He accomplish redemption once for you and then once again for me. In the entire universe there has been only one redemption for sins. Although sinners&rsquo; experiences of the Lord&rsquo;s redemption take place at different times, the Lord&rsquo;s accomplishment of redemption on the cross occurred once for all. Hebrews 9:12 clearly says that Christ &ldquo;through His own blood, entered once for all into the Holy of Holies, obtaining an eternal redemption.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s redemption for our sins is once for all.</p>
<p>Even the pouring out of the Holy Spirit was accomplished only once. Although believers may experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit at different times, the pouring out of the Holy Spirit occurred only once. In the same principle, the mingling of God and man occurred only once. God was mingled with only one man; God did not mingle Himself with one man and then another man. Since this is the case, when was God mingled with us?</p>
<p>According to our experience, we realized this mingling at the time of our salvation. According to the divine fact, however, our mingling with God occurred at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s incarnation. The Bible says that the Lord was born as a man and that the people would call His name Emmanuel (Isa. 7:14; Matt. 1:23). This means that God entered into man to be with man. The man whom God entered was an inclusive man. This inclusive man includes Jesus, Peter, Paul, you, and me. Thus, the term <em>man</em> does not refer to many separate individuals but to one great corporate man. You are a part of this man and so am I; all the descendants of Adam are a part of this man.</p>
<p>When the Lord was incarnated, He was God entering into man, an inclusive, corporate man. From the time of the incarnation, God has been mingled with man. However, the incarnation was only the beginning; the enlargement and development of the incarnation in redeemed humanity is a further step. This can be likened to a doctor injecting a shot of medicine into the arm of a patient. In the beginning the medicine is present only in the arm, but after a period of time, the medicine will spread throughout the patient&rsquo;s body. Hence, a doctor does not need to give a patient additional injections in other parts of his body. It is sufficient to give one injection in the arm. The incarnation was an &ldquo;injection&rdquo; of God, given by God, into man. God gave one injection of Himself into man, and now this &ldquo;injected&rdquo; God is spreading into many believers and being enlarged gradually.</p>
<p>God did not mingle Himself with two men; He mingled Himself with only one man. The mingling of God with man occurred only once, not many times. In other words, there is only one hybrid of God mingled with man in the universe; there are no other hybrids. Christ is the Head of this hybrid, and the church is the Body, the enlargement, of this hybrid. In the universe, this man is a great corporate man, whose Head is Christ and whose Body is the church.</p>
<p>I hope that the Lord will deeply impress us with this point. In order to be those who have a part in the service of the church, we must see this point. If we do not know Christ so accurately and do not know the church so thoroughly, sooner or later there will be a problem in our service for the building up of the church. How we build up the church depends entirely upon our knowledge of Christ and the church. Hence, we must see that God has mingled Himself with only one man, not two, and this mingling produced only one hybrid, not many hybrids. Christ is the Head of this hybrid, and the church is its Body.</p>
