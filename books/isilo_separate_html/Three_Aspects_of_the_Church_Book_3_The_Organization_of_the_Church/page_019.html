<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE OF<br />
THE ORGANIZATION OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A SUPPLEMENTARY WORD</h2>
<p>In the organization of the church there is the need for both gifts and offices. Gifts are related to the Spirit, and offices are related to authority. Both are indispensable to the organization of the church. Most of the problems that have arisen throughout the ages in regard to the organization of the church are related to offices, not gifts. It is difficult to pretend to have a gift. If a person has a gift, he has a gift. If he does not have a gift, he does not have a gift. It is very clear. However, because man is involved in the appointing of some offices, it is not difficult to falsely claim to have an office. Since gifts do not involve the element of human appointment, there is not the problem of human mixture. With offices, however, there is the element of human appointment; hence, there is often human mixture.</p>
<p>The appointment of apostles is directly from God. No human hand is involved. The appointment of elders and deacons, however, involves the apostles&rsquo; participation. The apostles who appoint elders and deacons must be fully subject to the authority of Christ the Head, and they must be governed by the Holy Spirit and led by the Holy Spirit. Whenever they appoint men to be elders and deacons, they fully represent the authority of the Head and should be under the authority of the Head. God carries out the appointment of elders and deacons in this way so that His authority in the church will not suffer loss, and there will be no confusion in the church. Consequently, no one can simply declare, &ldquo;I am an elder&rdquo; or &ldquo;I am a deacon.&rdquo; If the brothers were free to do so, there would be much confusion in the church.</p>
<p>Suppose several thousand believers were meeting in several locations in Taipei. If some were not clearly appointed as elders and deacons, it would be hard to imagine their condition. However, in the appointment of elders and deacons, the apostles must let the Holy Spirit have the authority. Some like to say emphatically, &ldquo;The Holy Spirit is the authority.&rdquo; On the surface, those who say this seem to be correct, but in their practice they still must make arrangements. One time, some brothers came to me and said, &ldquo;In the church there should not be any arrangement; rather, we should give the Holy Spirit the absolute authority.&rdquo; This word is appealing to the ear, and I agree. Nevertheless, when I asked these brothers whether they arranged for someone to give messages and for others to lead the singing, they could not answer. If there are no arrangements, the chairs in the meeting hall will not be clean, and the bread and the cup will not be spread upon the table. Many times, those who use nice slogans do the very thing that they condemn.</p>
<p>Concerning honoring the authority of the Holy Spirit, no one can exceed Paul. Paul absolutely believed in the authority of the Holy Spirit, yet he still made certain arrangements. He said to the church in Corinth, &ldquo;Whomever you approve, I will send them...and if it is fitting for me also to go, they will go with me. Now I will come to you when I pass through Macedonia, for I will pass through Macedonia. And perhaps I will stay with you, or even spend the winter, that you may send me forward wherever I may go. For I do not wish to see you now just in passing, for I am hoping to remain with you for some time, if the Lord permits&rdquo; (1 Cor. 16:3-7). Moreover, he charged Timothy, &ldquo;Be diligent to come to me quickly...The cloak which I left in Troas with Carpus, bring when you come, and the scrolls, especially the parchments&rdquo; (2 Tim. 4:9, 13). Unlike some so-called spiritual people, Paul did not tell Timothy to first pray and see if he had the Lord&rsquo;s leading and to come only when he had the Lord&rsquo;s leading. According to these illustrations, it seems that we are more &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; than Paul.</p>
<p>Every matter has two sides; we should not acknowledge one side and neglect the other. Elders must be appointed by men; otherwise, anyone would be free to rise up and claim, &ldquo;I am an elder.&rdquo; When Samuel anointed David, Samuel&rsquo;s position was similar to that of an apostle, and David&rsquo;s position was similar to that of an elder. The authority to administrate was given to David by Samuel. However, it was really God who gave David authority through Samuel. Samuel performed the anointing, or appointment, yet he carried it out under God&rsquo;s authority. In regard to the organization in God&rsquo;s house, the church, we need to see that authority comes directly from the Head but that man also has a part. Authority comes directly from the Head. In this way the authority of the Head does not suffer loss. Man has a part in making the appointments in order to avoid confusion. Without human involvement in the appointment, there would be confusion. The story of the succession of David is the best illustration. If David had not appointed his son Solomon to succeed to his throne, the result would have been much confusion, because the other sons of David also desired to be king.</p>
<p>Even though David appointed Solomon, there was still a chaotic situation. This also happens in the church. Although an elder has been appointed, some may say, &ldquo;Why should we submit to him? Is he qualified to be an elder?&rdquo; This can be compared to the rising up of Solomon&rsquo;s brother Adonijah (1 Kings 1:5). The truth is of two sides, and we should never lean toward just one side. In order to avoid confusion, we must let the Head have the authority but also not neglect the human side.</p>
<p>Every genuine work is of the Lord, and behind every such work is His authority. We should not receive a work but deny the authority behind it. If we receive a work, we should recognize the authority behind it. To recognize this authority is to recognize the apostles. As those serving the Lord, we should all be able to say, &ldquo;The Lord called me. He gave me a part in the work, and He has sent me to carry it out.&rdquo; Since the Lord has sent us to do the work, He surely has given us some authority. Even in a matter as small as sending someone to shop for groceries, the one sent must receive the authority to offer suggestions and make decisions.</p>
<p>Since the Lord has given us a part in the work, He must also have given us some authority. We should have the assurance that the Lord has sent us to do the work and that we have the authority to carry it out. We must bear in mind, however, that no serving one should do the work for himself. If a serving one works for himself, there will be problems. If he does not work for the Lord, the Lord will not acknowledge that his work is of the Lord or that he has been sent by the Lord. There will be no authority behind the work, and such a one will not be an apostle. Therefore, we need to ask ourselves, &ldquo;Am I sent by the Lord? Am I working for the Lord? Is this the Lord&rsquo;s work?&rdquo; If we can answer these questions in the affirmative, we should not only believe that we have the authority, but we should apply this authority in faith.</p>
<p>As far as an apostle is concerned, he has been given authority, and as far as the saints are concerned, those who receive help and supply from his work should also receive the authority behind the work. This is an unchanging principle. It would have been permissible for a saint in Jerusalem to not receive Paul as an apostle, if the saint had not received benefit from Paul&rsquo;s work. However, a saint from Corinth or Ephesus who heard Paul speak and received a supply from his work should not reject the authority related to Paul&rsquo;s work. Please remember, if we reject the authority of an apostle from whom we have received help, we are violating a great principle and will suffer a great loss. This is certain. May we be clear concerning this matter.</p>
<p>In the church no one can control others, and there is no ground to centralize authority in one place. Authority is with the Head. If someone is subject to the authority of the Head and has been commissioned by the Head for a part in the work, he will also receive authority from the Head. This authority is not given through any human hand. Upon receiving the work, he will sense that he has authority. When he carries out the work, he will be able to freely apply this authority. This cannot be controlled by anyone. This is the fellowship of the Body, the confirmation of the church, and it is under the authority of the Head. No one can control this. This is under the authority of the Head. Whoever is called by the Head to be an apostle, must be an apostle.</p>
<p>In Acts 13 when the five prophets and teachers in Antioch were, from a pure heart, seeking the Lord&rsquo;s will and desiring to give the Lord the opportunity to work freely, the Holy Spirit said to them that He would send two of them to carry out the work that He desired them to do. &ldquo;As they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them&rdquo; (vv. 1-2). As a result of the Spirit&rsquo;s sending, Barnabas and Saul went out with authority. They had the inward assurance that they were sent and commissioned by the Lord to carry out God&rsquo;s work. Hence, they had the confidence that in them there was authority. This is one side. On the other side, those who received their work knew and recognized them as apostles, knowing their work had ministered to them by either begetting or edifying them. All who acknowledge the work that they have received must bear in mind that all genuine work comes from the Lord and thus must have the Lord&rsquo;s authority behind it. If a work does not have the Lord&rsquo;s authority, it must not be of the Lord. If we receive a work, we also are receiving the Lord&rsquo;s authority behind it. If we receive the work but not the authority, we are violating a basic principle and will lose the blessing.</p>
<p>Some oppose and criticize other Christian groups yet are still able to pray and fellowship with God. However, those who receive an apostle&rsquo;s work will lose their sense of peace if they have problems with the apostle and doubt his authority. This is not something that we need to be told. We should all be clear regarding this point. For example, if a person on the street does something wrong and we speak ill of him, we may still have peace within, but if our parents do something wrong and we speak ill of them, we will become like Ham, who exposed his father&rsquo;s mistake. This led to a tragic end (Gen. 9:20-22, 25).</p>
<p>If we receive supply from an apostle, we need to receive his authority. No human being can appoint an apostle. The Lord has not handed over this matter to men. The apostles themselves must be assured of their own apostleship, and those who are edified by an apostle must acknowledge that he is an apostle. When an apostle&rsquo;s condition before the Lord becomes abnormal, he will lose his apostleship. Likewise, if those who receive supply from an apostle do not recognize his apostleship, he is no longer an apostle to them. Who is an apostle? On the side of an apostle, he is one who submits to God&rsquo;s authority, who is sent by the Head, and who is joined to the will of the Head to do the work that the Head desires him to do. Only the apostle can determine this. On the side of the saints, an apostle is one from whom they receive genuine edification and help; in other words, who they are as Christians is a result of his labor. Likewise, who we are as human beings is in large part due to our parents. Hence, when a saint recognizes the work, he should also recognize the apostle. This matter is not under anyone&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p>If we do not adequately fear the Lord or have much learning before the Lord, we may receive help from an apostle but not keep our position. Consequently, we may speak casually in judgment of his apostleship and may not consider him to be an apostle. On the other hand, if those who are apostles do not submit to the authority of God but do their own work, having their own future and ambition, they will lose their office as apostles. Hence, being an apostle depends on the apostle himself, whereas recognizing an apostle depends upon the recognizing one. Whether a person is an apostle is dependent upon his condition before the Lord, and whether a person receives another as an apostle is also dependent upon his condition before the Lord. This matter is not under any human control. We have to bow our heads and worship the Lord, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, the authority is entirely in Your hands.&rdquo;</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
