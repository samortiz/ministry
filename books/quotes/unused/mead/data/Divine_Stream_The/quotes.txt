[1]  THE DIVINE STREAM Reading American Standard Version : Gen 2:8-12; Psa 36:8-9; John 4:10, 14; 7:38, 39; I Cor.
[2]  From this picture of the stream in the Scriptures, we may realize that it is also a stream of fellowship.
[3]  This stream is also the stream of God's work.
[4]  Where the stream flows, there is the work of God.
[5]  Here is a picture of the flowing of the stream of divine life, and with the flowing of this stream is the work of God.
[6]  By flowing God works; by flowing God preaches His Gospel; by flowing God brings people to be saved.
[7]  If you are in this stream, then you are in God, you are in the Lamb with the throne, you are in the life, you are in the fellowship, you are in the testimony, and you are in the work of God.
[8]  We must be faithful to the flowing of this stream of the divine life, of the fellowship of the Body, of the testimony of the Lord Jesus, and of the work of God.
[9]  He comes into us to be our life just as a stream of water flowing out and flowing in, flowing out from heaven and flowing into us.
[10]  On the day of Pentecost the Lord poured Himself out in the Holy Spirit.
[11]  He poured out the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit became the flowing stream of the divine water.
[12]  The flowing of the divine life, which started on the day of Pentecost and has been flowing throughout all generations to this very day, is just one stream.
[13]  Then one day the Lord wanted the stream to strike forth into Europe, to Macedonia, but the Apostle who was working in the flowing of the stream was not clear about it.
[14]  The flowing of this stream of the Holy Spirit is the fellowship of the Body of Christ.
[15]  This is the stream of the fellowship of the Body, the stream of the testimony of the exalted Lord Jesus Christ, and the stream of the work of the Holy Spirit.
[16]  What we must do today is just go along with the stream, just subject ourselves to the current of the work of the Holy Spirit.
