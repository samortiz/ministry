   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is an amazing thing that in our experience the Holy Spirit can empty us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many genuine Christians have passed through such an experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we first became a Christian, we considered ourselves to be rather good and capable in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But after some time we noticed that the life we were living was short of the Christian standard; we realized that we had failed and could not go on anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Consequently, we felt dissatisfied, and we prayed for God to fill us up and make us obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God then ordered some unbearable and distasteful circumstances to come upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet by the grace of God, we eventually overcame them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we had something to testify about, and we were be able to say that we overcame.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We were able to say that we overcame a certain particular matter and that, at a certain point in time, God filled us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We may have even thought that we would be an overcomer from that point on.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But surprisingly, after some time, the victory was lost, and failure came back again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We thought that it was very easy to overcome, but it seemed as if all strength was gone, and new obstacles were before us again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There seemed to be a wall in front of us; we could not find any way out, and there did not seem to be any way to bypass it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Consequently, we said that our previous victory was lost, and we were no longer filled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Brothers and sisters, have you ever had such an experience?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is the significance of this kind of experience?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You should bear in mind that in God's eyes the Christian life should be an ever-deepening life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A Christian should become emptier and emptier, and the Lord's riches to him should become fuller and fuller.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After passing the first hurdle, you may think that there can be no higher life than what you have experienced; you may think that you can advance no further and that you have reached the summit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord knows your condition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He does not want you to think that you have abundant life already.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, He allows new difficulties to come upon you, and He places impossible things before you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Based on your past experiences, you may think that you will overcome again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But you fail at your first attempt.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may attribute your failure to the lack of vigilance and effort, and you may take greater care and exert more energy in tackling the situation the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Yet you fail again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You may think that your vigilance and effort is still too short and that you ought to exercise greater care and exert more energy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yet the result again falls short of your expectation, and you fail once more.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eventually, you will find that you cannot overcome this hurdle; there is no way to handle the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You will be at a loss as to why you cannot overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You will wonder why you still fail and why the initial power of obedience is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the same time, you will realize that it is not right that you repeatedly fail, and you will agonize over these failures.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But God has only one reason for doing this to lead you on further and to dig more deeply into you so that you may receive more filling.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is why new difficulties are in front of you all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Unless you have fresh filling, you will not be able to overcome these fresh difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You should bear in mind that the further you go forward, the more difficulties there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All your difficulties are ordered by the Holy Spirit for the purpose of creating a stronger craving and hunger in you for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The victory at Jericho can never be applied to Ai.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although Ai is very small and Jericho, which is huge, has been taken, if we attack Ai by applying our past experience, we will fail.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This means we cannot apply our past victory to tackle our spiritual difficulties today.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The past has become history, and new power is needed to deal with new spiritual difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God puts new difficulties before us in order to make us sense new needs.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must never expect to have a once-for-all victory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our eyes must be opened before God, and we must realize that the only way to have a continual filling is to have the continual working of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Unless the Holy Spirit continues His work in us, we cannot continue to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When any trial confronts us or any difficulty is placed before us, no past history or experience will do any good; we need new strength to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let us bear in mind that everything ordered by the Lord in our circumstances is intended to create a need in us and make us realize that we cannot overcome by past experience.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Past victories remain unchanged, but trying to overcome new difficulties by means of past victories never works.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Many people look at their past victories and wonder why they cannot overcome now.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brothers and sisters, we have to realize that God does not want us to have yesterday's manna.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>With each new difficulty there comes a new need which we have never realized before.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Brothers and sisters, we cannot go on without new knowledge of the Lord and a new vision of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever He brings us to our end and whenever we find ourselves crying, "I cannot make it!", our progress has begun.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then God is able to easily create a desire for Him in us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Is it not clear to us that our hunger begins from this kind of experience?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Thank God that everything we have is the result of His work; even the heart that seeks after Him comes from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If it were up to us, I wonder how long we would have to wait before we would seek after Him?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Of course, there is a condition: we must be conscious of our weakness and inability as well as the hindrance and pride of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we persist in our self-reliance, presume that we are already rich, and do not forget our Jericho victory, it will be impossible for God to give us a seeking heart even if He wants to.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we cannot forget our past victory, we will never make any progress.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we think that we can overcome with our first experience, we have been defeated already.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Past victory can never be our present strength.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should remember that God gives difficulties to us in order to dig more deeply in us so that He can fill us more with Himself.</S>
