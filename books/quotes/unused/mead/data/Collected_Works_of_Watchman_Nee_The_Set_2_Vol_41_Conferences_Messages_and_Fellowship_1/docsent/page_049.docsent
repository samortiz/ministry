   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR Date: November 18, 1935, evening</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place: Chuenchow THE CONDITIONS FOR RECEIVING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In order to receive the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, we have to fulfill certain conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First, we must not have any known or unsettled sins in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second, we have to be hungry in our spirit Isa 44:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Third, we have to pray earnestly Acts 1:14; 2:4; 4:31; 8:14-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THINGS TO WATCH OUT FOR</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>BY THOSE WHO HAVE RECEIVED</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE OUTPOURING OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who have received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit have come into contact with the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When a man who has never received the outpouring of the Spirit opens a door to the spiritual world, which had previously been unfamiliar to him, he will touch something beyond the physical realm.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some people have faith, but they are not willing to open their doors.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When a man rejects and refuses to open his door, he will not receive anything from the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The pursuit of the outpouring of the Spirit is like opening the doors and breaking down the walls.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the positive side, once the doors are open, there will be spiritual fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the negative side, there are dangers to opening to the spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is like opening up a door to friends.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the one hand, a man's friends can come and go at will, but on the other hand, robbers can also come and go at will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not say that since the robbers can come and go, it would be better not to open the door at all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No, on the one hand, we have to open the door, but on the other hand, we have to be watchful all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Testing the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How can we be watchful and prevent the evil one from coming into us?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>First, after we receive the outpouring of the Spirit, we have to put the experience to a test.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We cannot be careless in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First Corinthians 12:3 and 1 John 4:3 tell us the way to apply the test.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These verses are safeguards.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to ask those who have received the outpouring of the "Spirit" whether Christ has come in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can also ask them if Jesus is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should watch to see if the spirit that is upon them responds by retreating.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If it retreats, it means that it is an evil spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But if the person can say, "Jesus is Lord," he has the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not be satisfied with nine times out of ten.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to apply this test every single time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>My responsibility concerning this matter is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now it is up to us to walk properly before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the Principle of 1 Corinthians 14</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The initial manifestation of the outpouring of the Spirit is often extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It will appear as if God is removing all restraints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He does this so that we can receive more from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The initial experience of outpouring is like passing through a gate.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After we have passed the gate, we will have to calm down and live a normal life at home.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no need to jump up and down or shout, and there is no need to seek for supernatural feelings or experience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From that point on, we do not need to apply the principle of Acts 2, but the principle of 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The principle of 1 Corinthians 14 tells us that the outpouring of the Spirit in the meetings is for the edification of others instead of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This principle also tells us that the spirits of the prophets are subject to prophets v. 32 . We have to keep this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We have to learn to be in control of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First Corinthians 14 says that if there are tongues, only two or at most three should speak it, and they should take turns speaking it v. 27 . In Acts 2 all one hundred twenty people spoke because that was the first time the Spirit came down.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then the principle changed to that in 1 Corinthians 14.</S>
