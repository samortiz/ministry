[3]  of the Lord Being Saved and Renewed by Christ as Life Growing Up into Christ in All Things The Growth in Life for God's Building The Development of Life for the Expression
[4]  TO TAKE HIM AS LIFE Scripture Reading: Gen 2:9m; Eph 4:18; John 1:4; 11:25a; 10:10b; Col 3:4a; Rom 8:2a; 2 Cor 3:6; Acts 5:20; John 6:63, 35, 57; 7:37-38; 20:22; 1 Cor 3:6-7; 10:3-4; 12:13, 3; 1:2; Rev 2:7b; 21:6; 22:1-2 GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE
[5]  God's eternal purpose in the whole universe is of two aspects: 1 God desires to express Himself through a body of human beings; and 2 He desires to subdue and to conquer His enemy.
[6]  God created man in His own image with the purpose that man may express Him, and God gave man His dominion over all things that man may conquer the earth and subdue His enemy.
[7]  When God created Adam, He did not tell him that he had to do certain things to please God or to glorify Him.
[8]  Instead, God put man in front of the tree of life and told him to be careful to eat the right thing Gen 2:8-9, 16-17 .
[9]  THE LIFE OF GOD BEING THE CENTER OF THE BIBLE
[10]  In the first two chapters of the Bible, life is the center.
[11]  We cannot fulfill God's purpose, because His purpose is so divine and we are so human.
[12]  My burden is to point out to you the prevailing way that you can enjoy God, that you can take God into you, not only as life but also as the life supply.
[13]  The more you pray-read, the more you breathe God in. The more you pray-read, the more you drink of Him John 7:37 . The more you pray-read, the more you eat of Him Jer 15:16 . In other words, the more you pray-read, the more you take Him in. When God gets into you, He will do a lot of things.
[14]  CHAPTER TWO HOW TO TAKE CHRIST AS OUR LIFE
[15]  We have seen that only God Himself as life within us can fulfill His divine purpose.
[16]  God has no intention to ask us to do something for Him.
[17]  God's intention is that He could be life to us, but we need to see how we can take Him as life.
[18]  Christ is many things to us in the book of John, such as the light 8:12 , the life, the way 14:6a , the door 10:9 , the bread of life 6:35 , the living water 4:10, 14 , etc. But these are just the items of what Christ is, not the substance, the essence.
[19]  Christ is the Word v. 14 . John also says that this very Christ who is the Word and who is God is Spirit.
[20]  The Gospel of John tells us the way to take this very Christ, who is God as the Spirit and as the Word.
[21]  I say again, in this book we are told what Christ is, and we are also told how we can take this Christ in. He is the very God, He is the Spirit, and He is the Word.
[22]  B. Simpson is a hymn on breathing in the Lord.
[23]  The secret, the key, is the calling, because calling on the name of the Lord is the breathing Lam 3:55-56 .
[24]  We all need to call on the name of the Lord.
[25]  Whenever you read any verse, any chapter, or any portion of the Bible, you have to call on the name of the Lord.
[26]  We have seen that God, Christ, the Spirit, and the Word are all life to us.
[27]  Furthermore, we have seen that the way to take in God is by contacting the Spirit and the Word through calling on the Lord in prayer.
[28]  In Mark 4 the Lord Jesus Himself illustrated very clearly that there are four kinds of people related to the growth in life.
[29]  The third category is the thorny ground v. 7 . The thorns choke the growth of life.
[30]  The Lord Jesus told us that the thorns signify three things: the anxieties of the age, the deceitfulness of riches, and the lusts for other things v. 19 . People today are caught up with this age.
[31]  By His mercy we would not be the wayside, the stony ground, or the thorny ground.
[32]  We should have Christ as the very God filling up our entire being, so we all need to grow with the growth of God, the increase of God.
[33]  ON THE NAME OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: Acts 2:17a, 21; Rom 10:6b-9, 12-13; Acts 9:14; 2 Tim 2:22; 1 Cor 1:2, 9, 24; 12:3, 13 EXPRESSING GOD AND CONQUERING
[34]  As we call on the Lord, pray to Him, and pray-read His word, we enjoy Christ as life, and this life transforms us.
[35]  Now we have to ask again, "How can Christ get into us?"
[36]  We have the Holy Spirit within us and the Holy Bible in our hand.
[37]  The Holy Spirit within us is actually the wonderful Christ, the all-inclusive Christ, the compounded Christ.
[38]  When I say the compounded Christ, I mean that now this Christ is no more simply God.
[39]  Now we need to consider Acts 2:17-21, which is a quotation from the book of Joel This portion of the Word begins by saying that God will pour out of His Spirit upon all flesh v. 17 . Then it ends by saying, "And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved" v. 21 . If you put the beginning and the end of this quotation together, you see something marvelous.
[40]  This means that God pours out of His Spirit and that we have to call upon the Lord to get this Spirit.
[41]  When Saul was saved by the Lord on the way to Damascus, the Lord told him to go into the city and then he would be told what he must do Acts 9:6 .
[42]  Romans 10 also says that the Lord is "rich to all who call upon Him" v. 12 . It does not say that the Lord is rich to all who believe on Him, but to all who call on Him.
[43]  God called us into the fellowship of Christ v. 9 . To us, the called ones, Christ is power and wisdom v. 24 , but how can we enjoy Christ as power and wisdom? It is by calling on His name.
[44]  Thus far, we have seen the way to take life in and how life grows and transforms us.
[45]  Another manifestation of our fallen situation is our politeness, in the sense of being a kind of politics.
[46]  If you never like to talk, the Lord will say, "Talk."
[47]  He will urge you to call more on His name, to praise Him more, and to speak for Him more.
[48]  The divine life, the highest life, the eternal life, the everlasting life, never gets old.
[49]  CHAPTER SIX GROWING UP INTO CHRIST IN ALL THINGS
[50]  Ephesians 4:15 says that we have to grow up into Christ in all things.
[51]  Write down all the items of what you are, of what you do, of what you think, of what you have, and of what you use.
[52]  But as you are seeking the Lord so much, you need to grow up into Christ when you go to the department store to buy a tie.
[53]  The Bible tells us that the sisters should dress in a modest way 1 Tim 2:9; 1 Pet 3:3 , but only the Lord knows how modest is modest.
[54]  This thought is not only in 1 Corinthians but also in Genesis 2.
[55]  Ephesians 2 says that we are no longer strangers and sojourners, but members of the household of God v. 19 . The members of the household need to be built together upon the foundation, Christ.
[56]  Verse 21 says that in Christ "all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord."
[57]  The more we call on the Lord by saying, "O Lord," the more we take Him in as our life, and this life works within us to build up.
[58]  FOR THE EXPRESSION OF LIFE Scripture Reading: 1 Thes 2:14; 1 Cor 4:17; 7:17; 11:16; 14:33; Rev 2:7a, 11a, 17a; 2 Pet 1:1, 3-5; Eph 5:18-22; Col 3:16-18 THE CORPORATE BUILDING
[59]  GOD HAVING GIVEN US FAITH, THE DIVINE SEED, AND THE PRECIOUS AND EXCEEDINGLY GREAT PROMISES
[60]  Second Peter 1 tells us that God has given us three categories of things.
[61]  God has done everything on His part, so what shall we do?
[62]  Verse 18 tells the wives to be subject to their husbands, as is fitting in the Lord.
[63]  Verse 16 says, "Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God."
[64]  FOR THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: John 4:24; 20:22; Acts 16:6-7; Rom 8:9-10; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:16-18; Phil 1:19; 1 Cor 12:13, 3; John 3:6b; Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Tim 4:22; Heb 4:12; Gal 5:16, 25; Rom 8:4-6; Eph 2:22
[65]  Thus far, we have seen what life is, how life works within us, and how we need to cooperate with this life.
[66]  Thus, if we are going to know life, to experience life, and to taste all the riches of life, we have to know this basic matter of the Spirit.
[67]  After the eternal God accomplished creation, incarnation, crucifixion for redemption, resurrection, and ascension, He came down as the wind to blow through the whole earth.
[68]  This wind includes everything that the Triune God has accomplished and attained.
[69]  AND HAVING OUR BEING IN AND ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT EXPERIENCING LIFE IN THE SPIRIT
[70]  Now we need to spend some time to see how to experience life in the spirit.
[71]  The Spirit is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and the life-giving Spirit.
[72]  We have to learn to discern our spirit from our soul.
[73]  Hebrews 4:12 says that the word of God is living and operative as a sharp two-edged sword piercing to the dividing of soul and spirit.
[74]  Just as we illustrated before, our mind as a part of our soul may doubt that we are a child of God, but our spirit still has the assurance that we are a child of God.
[75]  When we consider a certain brother in our mind, we may be unhappy with him, but deep within us, in the spirit, we would say that he is a good brother.
[76]  Galatians 5 tells us that we have to walk in the Spirit vv.
