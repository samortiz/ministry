   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-SIX THE SIGNS IN JOHN EIGHTEEN 2 Scripture Reading: John 18:1-40; 12:23-24</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall consider the content of chapter eighteen of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to understand this chapter, it would be helpful to compare it with the chapters in the synoptic Gospels Matthew, Mark, and Luke that speak of the Lord in Gethsemane and of His arrest, trial, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you make such a comparison you will see that the synoptic Gospels emphasize aspects that are different from those emphasized in John 18.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Only in John are we told that Judas, the one who betrayed Him, knew the place where the Lord Jesus would be 18:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In John 18 we also see that Judas brought a band of soldiers and deputies with weapons to seize the Lord and arrest Him v. 3 . THE I AM</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In chapter eighteen we see that the Lord Jesus was bold.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>With boldness He went to the garden, and with boldness He met those who came to arrest Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 4 says, "Jesus therefore, knowing all the things that were coming upon Him, went forth and said to them, Whom are you seeking?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When they answered that they were seeking Jesus the Nazarene, He said to them, "I am" v. 5 . Verse 6 says, "When therefore He said to them, I am, they drew back and fell to the ground."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"I am" is the name of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In verses 5, 6, and 8 this name is used three times.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One reason this name is used here is that John's record is to show us how Jehovah, the Triune God, works Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The One who was arrested was not merely a Nazarene; this One was the great I Am, the unlimited, infinite God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the One who was arrested was Jehovah God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With one who is merely a Nazarene there is not the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the great I Am has the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, Jesus is not merely a man; He is also I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to 1:1, He was the Word, and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What is the name of this One?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His name is I Am; His name is Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we read John 18, we see that the emphasis of the record here is certainly different from that in the other Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The synoptic Gospels reveal that Jesus was arrested as a man and then put on the cross to die for our sins in order to accomplish redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Gospel of John reveals that the Lord Jesus is the great I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE LORD'S WILLINGNESS TO BE PUT TO DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, according to John's Gospel, the One who was arrested in the garden was the Lamb of God, but even more He was a grain of wheat 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a grain of wheat, a container of the divine life, the Lord was arrested and then sown into the earth through death in order that He might be multiplied and thereby be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus was willing to be put to death in order that He might be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He knew that under God's hand His being arrested and being put to death were the answer to His prayer in 17:1.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In that verse He prayed, "Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It was by His being put to death that the Lord would be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In order for this glorification to take place, the Lord went to the very spot where He would be arrested.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Actually, the Lord was not arrested by the soldiers; He presented Himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to avoid being arrested, it would not have been necessary for the Lord to call the angels to fight for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He simply had to say the words, "I Am."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have seen that when He said these words, the soldiers drew back and fell to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here the Lord was not threatening them; instead, He was comforting them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord seemed to be saying, "Are you seeking Jesus the Nazarene?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Have you come to arrest Jehovah?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There is no need for you to arrest Me. I present Myself to you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Take Me to the place where I shall be put to death."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This understanding of the Lord's action matches His word in 10:17 and 18 concerning Himself as the good Shepherd laying down His life for the sheep: "I lay down My life that I may take it again.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I have authority to lay it down, and I have authority to take it again."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here we see that no one took the Lord's life away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Rather, He laid it down of His own accord and then, after a short period of time three days according to the Jewish calendar , He took up His life again.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, in this sense the Lord actually was not arrested and taken away; on the contrary, He gave Himself away and then, three days later, He took Himself back.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For what purpose did the Lord give Himself to those who betrayed Him, arrested Him, judged Him, and sent Him to be put to death?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord's purpose in giving Himself up was that He would be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord willingly went through the process of death so that He could be multiplied.</S>
