   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BACKGROUND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE SECOND EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A little more than a year after Paul was released from prison, Nero, the Roman Caesar, began to persecute the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He put leaders such as Peter and Paul into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After Paul went into prison again, he wrote the second Epistle to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before his second imprisonment, there were many Jews among the churches in the Gentile lands who were beginning to teach Old Testament things different from the New Testament teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>By the time Paul went into prison, the Judaizing Christians had become even more aggressive.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps they told others, See?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Paul is in prison.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If his teachings were right, why would God have allowed him to end up in prison?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul s imprisonment gave the Judaizing Christians and those who taught differently a strong ground to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is the reason Paul wrote the second Epistle to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The two Epistles to Timothy were written approximately two years apart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, Timothy did not remain in Ephesus for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In 2 Timothy 1:13 Paul said, Hold a pattern of the healthy words that you have heard from me, in the faith and love which are in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Paul reminded Timothy to hold the healthy words.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He had already spoken concerning this in 1 Timothy 6.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we have already seen, these healthy words are the words of the Lord Jesus in the New Testament and the preaching of the Lord s apostles concerning such things as God becoming flesh and the mystery of godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul charged Timothy to hold these words.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This proves that at that time some believers were already not holding these words.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Second Timothy 1:14 says, Guard the good deposit through the Holy Spirit who dwells in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the Lord s commission to the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is also the apostles charge to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to deposit the Lord s healthy words, including the riches of life in the Lord s words, into our being, like we deposit money in the bank.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 15 says, This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul was sitting in his prison in Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How could believers far away in the province of Asia have turned away from him?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This proves that what the Asian believers were turning away from was not Paul s person but his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The me here does not refer to Paul s person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It refers to his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we come to Revelation 2 and 3, we find the Lord writing to the seven churches in Asia, and the first letter was to the church in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This proves that it was the church in Ephesus that took the lead to forsake Paul s ministry and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the background of the writing of the second Epistle to Timothy.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE PRESENT VISION AND PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The burden in this chapter is not to expound the Epistles to Timothy but to continue from the previous chapter to speak on our present vision and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Problem Created</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>by the Ministry of Spirituality in the West</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First, let us fellowship a little concerning our history.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In 1955 Brother T. Austin-Sparks was invited for the first time to come to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In 1957 he came for the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During the second time, he raised a crucial issue.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He thought that the way we were taking was good in every matter except one.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The one thing he considered to be seriously wrong and absolutely intolerable was the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, it was the practice of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>While he was alive, he was the only one on the whole earth who could echo what we saw concerning spiritual life principles.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He echoed what we saw, and we responded to what he saw.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At that time the rejection he faced in the West was more severe than the rejection we faced in the East.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the entire Western world he was the only one who saw the principles of life, and he was the only one who spoke on the deeper truths of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Almost no one accepted his teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the East we also spoke on these deep matters.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, on the side of life principles, we held the same view, but on the side of church practice and church ground, we could not fellowship with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At that time we saw that the church ground cannot be separated from church practice.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Without the ground there can be no practice.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order to have the practice, there must be the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, he did not agree with the matter of the church ground, and he did not agree with that kind of church practice.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From 1937 to 1938 Brother Watchman Nee visited a number of countries in Europe and stayed there for more than a year and a half.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Most of the time he stayed in London with Brother T. Austin-Sparks.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After he returned to China, he cabled me immediately to join him in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>At that time he called together a special fellowship meeting and reported to us in detail his fellowship with Brother Austin-Sparks in London.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At the end he said that in almost every aspect they were in harmony with each other and echoed each other.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The only exception was the practice of the church, which they could not get through in their fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Brother Nee was somewhat sympathetic regarding the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He felt that in England the Brethren had spoiled the matter of church practice for more than a hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because of this, most seekers of the Lord were unwilling to speak concerning the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Brother Nee sympathized with their frustrations and spoke to us in this way, but he also pointed out that this was exactly where the problem between Brother T. Austin-Sparks and us lay.</S>
