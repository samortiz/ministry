   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Being Separate but Administrating Together</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If the twenty-one meeting halls in the church in Taipei were separate from one another, it would not be difficult to administrate and promote the work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, according to the Bible, even though there are six to seven thousand saints meeting and serving in Taipei, there is only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hence, it is not easy to administrate the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To administrate each hall separately suggests separation, but to administrate the church centrally without separating the halls makes it difficult to thoroughly care for every area.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, after spending much time before the Lord in consideration, we feel that the Lord has given us a way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Apparently the twenty-one meeting halls are separate in their service and leading, but in principle they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can use the United States of America as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are fifty states in America.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These states are united to establish a federal government.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Under the federal government there are state governments.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Each state has power to legislate according to the situation and circumstance of that state.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, all legislations need to be under the restriction of the American Constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>No legislation can override the constitution; otherwise, it contradicts and violates the constitution of the country.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A state s violating the constitution is equivalent to the state declaring independence and creating not only two jurisdictions but also two countries.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, every state in America has the right to legislate, but their legislation is restricted by the federal constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we began the work in Taipei in 1949, we were blessed in our preaching of the gospel and many were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Since there was only one meeting hall, which is presently hall one, the problem of being separate but one, or of being one but separate, did not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our preaching of the gospel and our baptizing of people were all conducted in the same place.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, the church has since increased from several hundred to ten thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At one time there were even twenty-four thousand in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We therefore formed district halls.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In every meeting hall there was a service of baptism, but the time of baptism was determined in the elders meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was not very expedient because the elders had to consider the situation of all the meeting halls before a time for baptism could be set.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result, some saints waited for a long time before being baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This shows that it was not very practical to centrally administrate the matter of baptism for all the halls.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As a result, we have made some changes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>From now on when a meeting hall preaches the gospel and leads people to salvation, it can baptize them without asking for a decision from the elders meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, after the baptism the meeting hall must give the baptismal information to the business office for their records.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This kind of administration is not a separation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For two thousand years, Christians have debated whether baptism should be by sprinkling or by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the beginning of the Lord s recovery we accepted the truth of baptism by immersion; this is the light we saw from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Consequently, it would be wrong for a meeting hall to say, It is not convenient for us to baptize people by immersion, because we do not have a baptismal tub.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We will now baptize people by sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such a decision would violate the constitution and would result in a division in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There would be a baptism-by-immersion church and a baptism-by-sprinkling church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Each meeting hall can decide when and where to baptize people, but it has no ground to change the truth concerning baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This example shows that in some matters we can separate administrative practices for the sake of convenience and effectiveness, but we cannot separate ourselves in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This keeps the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not necessary to require that all twenty-one districts be uniform in every administrative detail, because of differences due to geography, environment, and time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we demand uniformity in all things, we will take care of one aspect and miss the other.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This will frustrate the administration and promotion of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, for the sake of administrating and promoting the work, we can be separate while administrating as one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every Meeting Hall Having Elders</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the way of our practice, every district will have two or three elders.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After careful consideration and thorough fellowship and prayer, we decided to select forty-six elders from among the leading brothers and place them in the twenty-one meeting halls.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Most of the current elders are older; the youngest one is fifty-five years old.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When a person becomes sixty-five years of age, he feels a lack in his physical abilities.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It may be possible for older brothers to take the lead in a smaller church with seventy to eighty saints, but in a church as large as Taipei, which has twenty-one meeting halls and many saints in each meeting hall, the older brothers are bound to feel a lack in their physical ability even though they have insight and experience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The elders appointed to be responsible for administration and promoting the work in the twenty-one meeting halls must be between the ages of thirty and fifty.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They will promote and carry out the work and bring others with them into the work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They must be able to consider things and to come up with ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even if a big mountain is blocking the way, they must be able to cut a hole through the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These new elders must have such a spirit in order for the church to have a breakthrough and to propagate.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is good for a church to have a large number of saints.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, in terms of promoting the work, it is very difficult to mobilize a large group of saints.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sometimes a large number of saints can be a hindrance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is no need to administrate a locality with only seven or eight saints.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The churches in various places can confirm this fact: when the number in a church reaches one hundred saints, the increase slows down.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Much effort is required to increase from one hundred saints to one hundred twenty, and it is even more difficult to reach two hundred saints.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This can be compared to the difference between pushing a bicycle uphill and pushing a car uphill.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is much easier to push a bicycle.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today the church in Taipei is a large church, and it is not easy to move the church.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The number of saints in the meetings has not changed much.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>For the past twenty-eight years, there has not been a significant change in the number of saints in the meetings because this car is too big to be pushed.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, we are determined to have a breakthrough.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We would like to include some younger saints to promote the work in every meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We are determined to push this car.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we are able to push this car, we will say Hallelujah!</S>
