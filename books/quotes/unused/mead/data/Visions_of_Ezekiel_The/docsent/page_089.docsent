   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Both Ezekiel and Revelation end with a city, Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Only one city in the whole Bible has twelve gates with twelve names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and that is the city of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must apply the things mentioned in Ezekiel to ourselves because eventually we will be that city.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not regard all the words of Ezekiel as merely a prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It does contain prophecies, but primarily we must apply the record to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not apply the points in Ezekiel merely to the future, but also to the present.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>With this city there is the number twelve which is composed, not of six times two, but of three times four.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is three times four because there are three gates on four sides making a total of twelve gates.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Please remember that four is the number of the creature and three is the number of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Twelve signifies the mingling of the Triune God with the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This city eventually is not only a mingling, but also a perfect government with a complete administration.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Twelve in the Bible also indicates a perfect government and administration in completion.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not just a mingling of divinity with humanity, but also a perfect government which comes out of this mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, it is a city.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As a city it is a government which exercises full authority for God's complete administration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's government and God's administration come from the mingling of God with His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This mingling is for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The church must be like this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The church must be just the mingling of God with man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Out of such a mingling there will be the church government for God's administration on the earth and for the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All this is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>CAUSING ALL WHO ENTER TO BE ONE</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The city has four sides with three gates on each side.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that no matter from which side we enter the city, we will be in the same city.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No matter which gate we enter, we all will be one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In that city we can never be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are one because we are in one city.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The New Jerusalem has only one street.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regardless of which direction you come from, and regardless of which gate you enter through, you will be on the same street.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On that same street there is the one flow, the one river, with the one drink and the one tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All are the same, all are one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is one city, one street, one river, one flow, one drink, one tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We all have to be impressed one! one! one! we all are one!</S>
