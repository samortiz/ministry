The essence is finer and more intrinsic than the element. In the substance there is the element, and in the element there is the essence. Now the Triune God as the substance, as the element, and as the essence are altogether imparted into us, and this imparting is still going on. This imparting is the dispensing.</P><P>Many in Christianity think that the Bible merely teaches people what to do and what not to do. This, however, is similar to the teachings of Confucius. Christ's salvation is not mainly to teach us but mainly to dispense Himself into us. This is why we need to call on the name of the Lord early in the morning, saying "O Lord Jesus." If some of you have never done this, I would encourage you to try it from today. In the morning the first thing you should do is to call on the name of the Lord three to eight times. In order not to bother others early in the morning, you can call "O Lord Jesus" softly. By practicing this, you will be a different person. By calling on the Lord, you receive the fresh dispensing.</P><P>We can also receive the divine dispensing by praying over two or three verses from the holy Word each morning. Perhaps we would open to John 1:1 and pray, "In the beginning was the Word. Lord Jesus You are in the beginning. You are the Word." We can pray-read this verse and another verse for about ten minutes. Then we will be refreshed because we have received the fresh dispensing.</P><P>During the day whenever we become tired, we should call, "O Lord Jesus." Much of the time my work is mainly to write and compose at my desk. Quite often I become tired out. Then when I say "O Lord Jesus" for a few minutes, I am refreshed. This is the way to receive the Triune God, to receive His dispensing, to receive His divine impartation and transmission.</P><P>The church is the issue of the divine impartation and the divine transmission of God the Father's nature and life, of God the Son's element, and of God the Spirit's essence. Nothing can exceed this threefold impartation. This impartation is more than mere teaching. Some people may say that I am a Bible teacher. That is not bad, but I am not satisfied with this. I want to be a person who always gives others a divine "shot," a divine injection. When I minister the word, I want to give people an injection of the Triune God, which is His impartation and transmission.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Intrinsic View of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
