   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>If we are truly willing to die, and if we truly die, we will lose many praises of man.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Our natural beauty will be destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Formerly, we might have had the intelligence to come up with many new reasonings and theories.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the self dies, we will have to wait for the Lord's direction and leading and will not dare to depend upon our own intelligence anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Formerly, we might have had love and could have loved many.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We could have motivated ourselves to love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the self dies, we will have to let the Lord's love love through us, and we will have to allow the Holy Spirit to permeate our heart with the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We will not dare to be motivated by our natural love.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Formerly, we might have had emotions and could be joyful, angry, sad, and happy at will; we could fellowship with the Lord through our feelings and could sense His joy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>With the death of the self, we will have to let the Lord control our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We will be sorrowful when the Lord is sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We will be happy when the Lord is happy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We will have to let the Lord have the freedom in us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even though at times we will lack the sense of the Lord, yet we will have to remain faithful, and we will not change our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We will not dare to change because of the emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What seemed profitable to us before will be counted loss for Christ's sake Phil 3:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we die with the Lord to sin, we let go of the unlawful things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we are crucified with the Lord to self, we let go of the lawful things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This step is indeed hard to take.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Narrow is the gate and constricted is the way that leads to life, and few are those who find it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What kind of death is this?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is like the death of the cross that the Lord knew about John 12:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we do not have any other choice except to fall into the ground willingly and die.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should die joyfully with the Lord and participate in the fellowship of His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every day we should maintain the attitude of hating the self-life so that we can keep it unto life eternal, that is, bearing fruit unto life eternal and bringing forth many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is not an overnight matter.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If this were so, it would have been easy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But our Lord's word is, "He who hates his soul-life in this world..."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>John 12:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should hate our self-life as long as we live in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we practice this unceasingly, our craving self will be stripped of its power.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must not consider the word "death" lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is not enough to be a grain of wheat alone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As a born-again son of God Matt 13:38 , one is merely a babe and cannot do much for God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not enough just to fall into the ground, for even if one is willing to suffer and to be hidden, he is still not dead and is still one grain; there is still no increase.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Death is the ultimate and most important step.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Death unlocks the gate of life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Death is the only requirement for fruit bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Death is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And yet how many are there who truly experience this death?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Death terminates all activity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Death is the end to our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After death, there remains no room for the activity of the self-life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This death is not a reluctant death, because the Lord said we should "hate" this self-life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To hate is a kind of attitude; it is a lasting attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, we should willingly put this life to death; we should have a full understanding of the poverty of this life and should hate it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is the result of the death of this life?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The result is many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The reason, the very reason, the Lord cannot use us is that we work by our intellect, love, etc. This soul- life is a low-level life; it is not a high-level life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As such it can hardly bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Although it contains some merits, only "that which is born of the Spirit is spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The self-life, and everything that comes with it, is completely useless.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we really put ourselves, our self-life, that is, all that we can do and all that we are, completely on the Lord's cross, we will see how the Lord will use us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we are empty within, there will not be any blockage to the gushing out of God's living water from us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This kind of fruit bearing is different from ordinary fruit bearing because the fruit that we bear will be plentiful.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our fruit bearing depends totally on our death.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, believers, just as our self once filled us, even so now must Christ fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Otherwise, we have not yet received full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The key for us to receive our salvation and the key for us to be saved is to be delivered from the self.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is easy for a believer who is in the self to fall into sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is why in order to die completely to sin, one must die completely to self.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Christ is not only our Savior who frees us from sin; He is also our Savior who saves us from the self.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To die to self is the only pathway for our spiritual living.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Yet, besides God, no one can put our self-life to death.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, if we are not willing, God can do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The activity of the self is sometimes quite hidden under a spiritual veil.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A believer may not recognize it at first by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is why God has to remove the veil through all kinds of outward circumstances in order that the believer will come to know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The most difficult thing for a person to do is to know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We do not know ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is why we have to go through God's dealing hand before we realize the evil of the self.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If in our experience we have not died to self, we have not made any real progress in our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you and I are willing to let the Holy Spirit of the Lord apply the death of the self in us and to work it out of us today, we will see great progress in our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brothers!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>May we declare together in one accord, "Not as I will, but as You the Father will" Matt 26:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The above article deals with questions on the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>May the reader not consider this as a theory.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>One should compare his spiritual experience with the words here.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If he does this, he will understand these words.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We are all babes in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>May the Lord guide us step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we do not have the experience of the death of the self, it is better to say we do not have it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But we must never take the self-life as the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>May God bless us.</S>
