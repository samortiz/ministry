         <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE OVERCOMING AND THE PURSUING<br />
OF THE LORD&rsquo;S SERVING ONES</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will fellowship concerning several matters related to the co-workers. God&rsquo;s work in us cannot go beyond our limitations. Both the Old Testament and the New Testament show that God encounters limitations and difficulties in every person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO SITUATIONS<br />
HINDERING OUR SPIRITUAL PURSUIT</h2>
<p>There are two situations that cause us to limit God. In the first situation, the serving ones have the feeling that they cannot find the Lord and that they do not see results in their service. In other words, it seems that others are enlightened and know how to work, but they do not receive light, and their work does not have results. Thus, they become discouraged. Many years ago this situation was not common among us, but it has become rather obvious in recent years. In the second situation, the serving ones know how to read the Bible. The Bible is open to them, and they always receive light. However, they often become puffed up and proud when they receive revelation and light from God.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to other spiritual matters. When some saints seek a spiritual experience, they gain it and immediately testify concerning the revelation they received or their experience. Other saints, however, do not have such experiences, no matter how much they pursue. It seems as though these saints do not know how to pursue or how to work. Hence, there are two groups of serving ones. This can be compared to people who study or play sports. Some people seem to have no problem understanding a subject or playing well, while others struggle.</p>
<p>Some co-workers do not have a sense of accomplishment in the gospel, in ministering the word, or in visiting the saints. The more they look at themselves, the more it seems as if they have no progress in their spiritual pursuit or in the work. Hence, they are utterly discouraged. They want to continue serving, but they feel incompetent. It is not easy for them to withdraw, because they have paid a price to serve the Lord. Consequently, these ones feel miserable. This is one situation.</p>
<p>In another situation the co-workers gain what they seek in the Lord and in the work. The way is open to them, and it is easy for them to get results. The former group of co-workers tends to be discouraged, but the latter group tends to be arrogant. Both conditions are inevitable. We cannot say that one group is deep and that the other group is shallow. In truth, both kinds of co-workers are in the self.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SELF-ABASEMENT AND PRIDE</h2>
<p>Some co-workers are disheartened and discouraged because they think that they do not know how to pursue the Lord, they do not know how to work, their gifts are not manifested, and they do not see results. These co-workers are ashamed, embarrassed, and discouraged when they see other co-workers who flourish in the work. Such feelings of embarrassment show that they are in themselves. As a result, they have an inferiority complex and think that they are hopeless. It is right not to regard oneself as being capable, but it is not right to be self-abasing. A person who is self-abasing loses his courage, is not able to contact others, and cannot pray. A person who has an inferiority complex is buried in himself.</p>
<p>In the other situation a co-worker can be haughty. This is an expression of pride. When a serving one becomes filled with pride, he becomes shallow. Those with an inferiority complex seemingly sink to the bottom of the sea, but those who are proud seemingly float like a thin sheet of paper in the air.</p>
<p>A serving one who is overcome with a sense of inferiority harms only himself, not others. When he realizes that he is incapable in the work and that he cannot pray, read the Bible, or give messages, he is unwilling to preach the gospel, to visit the saints, or to speak for the Lord. Such a person is buried in his self-abasement. But this problem is limited to himself. However, a serving one who is proud does not receive the restriction of the Lord. This is a greater problem. Such a serving one can affect others because he thinks that he has something. This is the other side of the self.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BOTH SELF-ABASEMENT AND PRIDE<br />
STOPPING SPIRITUAL PURSUIT</h2>
<p>Since not many serving ones are growing in life, can render a supply, or are effective in the work, our work and service have become stagnant. Some of our co-workers are trapped in self-abasement. Other co-workers, who are blinded by a shallow view of themselves, think that they are capable, but they have very little result due to their shallowness.</p>
<p>A person who is narrow and shallow is proud. It is easy for a narrow person to be proud, and it is easy for a shallow person to be proud. Actually, being narrow is the same as being shallow. A brother who is broad is like a large cup with a great capacity. Regardless of how many things he does, he does not feel full or proud. However, a narrow brother is like a small cup that is filled with water. If one drop of water is added to the cup, it will overflow. A person who is a large vessel with a large capacity receives more grace, but he never feels that he is someone special. In contrast, a person who is a small vessel with a small capacity is easily filled with a little grace, and he feels that he is something special. This is an indication of his smallness, and this smallness is related to his shallowness. A deep person has a large capacity, but a shallow person has a small capacity.</p>
<p>A proud person feels self-contented and satisfied and is shallow and small. Being shallow is the same as being small. Some who are shallow become proud very easily. Others may not become proud, but it is easy for them to feel self-contented. A person who becomes proud or self-contented is not effective in the work, and because he is shallow and superficial, he is unable to do a weighty and deep work. Only a person who has passed through frustrations, sufferings, and termination and who is broken can do a weighty and deep work. Such a person does not have much feeling of self-satisfaction or self-sufficiency. He continually presses forward and works steadfastly. Such a person is not a problem to the work and is effective.</p>
<p>Both self-abasement and pride stop our spiritual pursuit. Those who have an inferiority complex will not pursue the Lord, nor will those who are shallow and self-contented. It is difficult for those with an inferiority complex and for those who are shallow and self-contented to learn anything. Our spiritual pursuit is affected by self-abasement. Furthermore, we should not be proud, because pride prevents us from pursuing. Those who are proud are full. Since it is easy for them to obtain spiritual matters, they do not pursue aggressively. Both self-abasement and pride distract us and stop our genuine spiritual pursuit.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
