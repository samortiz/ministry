   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MATTHEW CHAPTER NINETEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verses 1-2:"And when Jesus finished these words, He departed from Galilee and came into the borders of Judea beyond the Jordan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And great crowds followed Him, and He healed them there."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every time, after the Lord finished teaching people, He always did some works such as healing the sick, casting out demons, etc. Here again the Lord healed the sick.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 3:"And some Pharisees came to Him, testing Him and saying, Is it lawful for a man to divorce his wife for any cause?"</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From verse 3 on, there is another problem: the kingdom of the heavens and the natural relationship of man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Jews proposed that a divorce could be made for whatever reason a person provided.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Among the Chinese there are seven conditions for divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Jews probably have seventy-seven times seven conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a meal was not prepared satisfactorily, that could be an excuse for a divorce.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Pharisees liked to have divorces, yet they still felt constrained.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Therefore, they asked the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 4:"And He answered and said, Have you not read that He who created them from the beginning made them male and female."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This verse gives us two principles: 1 marriage is ordained by God, and 2 monogamy, the institution of one husband and one wife.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There were only one Adam and one Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord's answer implied that this is not a question of the law but a matter of looking into the origin of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 5:"And said, For this cause shall a man leave his father and his mother and shall be joined to his wife; and the two shall be one flesh'?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The relationship between father and son or mother and son is intimate enough.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, there is still another relationship, that between husband and wife, which is even more intimate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If one cannot separate fathers from sons or mothers from sons, how much more should husbands not be separated from their wives.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Verse 6:"So then they are no longer two, but one flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore what God has yoked together, let man not separate."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the record of the Bible, the number of the women was not reported; hence, the two had become "one flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before God, husband and wife count as only one unit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"So then they are no longer two, but one flesh....let man not separate."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the verdict.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Verse 7:"They said to Him, Why then did Moses command us to give her a certificate of divorce and divorce her?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Pharisees naturally quoted the law of Moses, assuming that by quoting Moses the Lord could most easily be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They assumed that the Lord's word contradicted that of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Why then did Moses command?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moses did not command this, he only allowed it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only the Lord could discern their fallacy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 8:"He said to them, Moses, because of your hardness of heart, allowed you to divorce your wives, but from the beginning it has not been so."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 8 the Lord did not deny the reason for the establishing of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, he pointed out that Moses allowed certain things because of the hardness of heart of the Israelites in not following God's original will from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This shows that the law cannot regenerate man or perfect man Heb 10:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the beginning God's will was not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 9:"But I say to you that whoever divorces his wife, except for fornication, and marries another, commits adultery; and he who marries her who has been divorced commits adultery."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although there are many kinds of legal divorces among different nations today, only one kind of divorce is proper: for reason of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Bible did not put stress on the wedding or the engagement.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Marriage originates out of a voluntary rather than involuntary relationship of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>According to 1 Corinthians 6:16, "the two shall be one flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This relationship of the flesh is most pure, because it is ordained by God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever there is a relationship of the flesh, regardless of the law and the customs of society, before God one becomes responsible and the two are one flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is why in the Old Testament, if a man ruined the virginity of a woman, he had to marry her.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is because the joining of the flesh is a critical element in marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Fornication is an act to ruin the fact of "the two shall be one flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Divorce is a breaking down of oneness before God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, these are the conclusions: 1 any fornication destroys the oneness before God; and 2 no divorce is permitted except because of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although we believers are in the world, we ought not to follow the current of the age or the human law.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We ought to obey God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To marry one who has been put away is to commit adultery because if the woman did not commit fornication and yet was put away, that oneness still exists before God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For someone to marry her would damage the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If the woman was put away because of fornication, then to marry her is to commit adultery with her.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What if, before a man believed in the Lord, he had married a woman who was put away?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then whatever was done has already been covered by the precious blood; he cannot put her away any more.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Paul talked only about separation if it is because of 1 need and 2 its being profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But the believer should not initiate it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Rather, he should choose to be at peace and be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Separation is for waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Perhaps God will use the separation period to cause the unbelieving one to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Suppose a believer has a wife who has committed fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>According to the law and the Lord's word, she can be put away.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, according to the Lord's grace, if the wife repents, he should still forgive her cf.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>John 8:3-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 10:"His disciples said to Him, If the case of the man with his wife is like this, it is not profitable to marry."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The disciples had their own inclinations; they agreed with having divorce at will.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When they saw that this could not be done, they said that it was not profitable to marry.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This also violates God's original plan.</S>
