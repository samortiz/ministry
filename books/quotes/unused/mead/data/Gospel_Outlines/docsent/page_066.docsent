   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Why?</S>

   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Man is precious because he has a soul, a human life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The difference between man and all other creatures is that man is the only one who has a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Show how real the soul is and speak of its nature.</S>

   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Prove the existence of the soul by using love as an example.</S>

   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lastly, show that the soul is intangible, spiritual, and inward.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The value of life The one thing that man neglects most in himself is his own life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some may think that they are taking good care of their life, but they are actually only taking care of their physical bodies, not their life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today people only care for their physical bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Their caring for life is only caring for bodily health.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Others care for the education of their mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This education is only for their mentality, their psychological faculty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although man cares for his body and his mind, he neglects his real life, which is his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the appraisal of the Lord Jesus, the life, or the soul, which man neglects is more valuable than the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The total wealth of the whole world cannot be compared with the value of one soul.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Quote Matthew 16:26: For what shall man be profited if he should gain the whole world, but forfeit his soul-life?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nothing in the whole universe can be compared with the life of man s soul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>How man can lose the life of his soul Man loses the life of his soul due to his negligence.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Man cares only for the body and his mentality, and he neglects life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This causes him to lose the life of his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Man loses his soul also because he cares too much for the material things.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Because he cares for the body and the mind, he gives his full attention to the material things which the body and the mind require.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because he cares for the material things, he neglects the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>So man forfeits his life simply because of material things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Man pays his soul for wealth, advancement, savings, knowledge, position, fame, and riches.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is what the Lord Jesus meant when he said a man gains the whole world, and forfeits his soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How man s soul can be saved Explain that he must despise the material things, that is, he must despise this age, and the needs of the body and the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He must then treasure his soul and the future.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Just as the body and the mind are related to this age, so the soul is related to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Receive the Lord Jesus as the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only He is the Savior of our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He can forgive our sins, and He can cause man s soul to be saved, because He can give eternal life to man.</S>
