<h1 class="title">LEARNING TO FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD<br />
AND BEING USED BY HIM</h1>
<h2 class="head1">BEING USEFUL DEPENDING ON<br />
RESPONDING TO GOD&rsquo;S DEMAND</h2>
<p>A person who desires to be used by the Lord needs the Lord&rsquo;s visitation, and he must be willing to pay the price. Furthermore, he must learn to fellowship with the Lord. Having the Lord&rsquo;s visitation and paying a price are primary matters in being used by the Lord. However, if a person lacks proper fellowship with the Lord, his paying of a price will only be according to knowledge. It will be an action that he takes after learning doctrine. It will not be the result of being touched by the Lord while fellowshipping with Him. We must admit that there are still many things in our heart and in our living that substitute God and usurp His place in us. These things prevent Him from working in us. Unless these things are exposed by God in our fellowship with Him, we will not have any feeling concerning them. When we fellowship with Him, He causes us to realize that certain persons, matters, or objects are occupying us and restricting His work. The experience of being touched by God in our fellowship with Him and surrendering to Him is very precious. This experience will not only enable us to be used by the Lord; it will also keep us fresh and living. When we sense that our experiences, testimonies, or messages are old, there must be a problem in our fellowship with the Lord. We have either lost this fellowship, or we do not fellowship as much. As a result, we do not have new experiences, and we are not useful.</p>
<p>There are two ways of paying the price. One way is to pay the price according to the demand in our feeling. The other way is to pay the price according to the revelation of the truth. We must keep in mind, however, that paying the price according to the revelation of the truth is not enough. We should also be willing to pay the price according to the demand in our feeling that comes through our fellowship with the Lord. Only then will our paying the price be fresh and living. When we lack fellowship and pay the price only according to the revelation of the truth, others will not sense God&rsquo;s presence or His expression. The revelation of the truth may require us to give up a certain matter, but we should pay the price by letting go of it when, in our fellowship with God, we sense that He wants us to let go of it. This way of paying the price is fresh, and it will cause others to sense God.</p>
<p>To be used by God is to let Him flow out of us in order to supply others. However, if we do not let Him flow into us, He cannot flow out of us. The best way to let God flow into us is to fellowship with Him. Every time we fellowship with God, we should sense that He is demanding something of us. If we do not sense that He is demanding something of us, we have not yet entered into His presence. God is always demanding something of us. Fellowship with God is the way to gain Him. It is also the way to pay the price. Those who desire to be used by God must fellowship with Him regularly.</p>
<p>The kind of fellowship we are speaking of does not refer to merely shutting ourselves in a room in order to read the Bible or pray. Fellowship refers to our having contact with God in spirit at any time and in any place. This inward contact with God should continue even while we are busy at work and while we interact with others. When we have such fellowship with God, we can experience and gain Him continually, and He will flow out of us so that we can impart Him into others. When we are such persons, we can be used by God all the time. Those who have a heart to be used by God must learn this lesson.</p>
<p>God always requires something of us when we fellowship with Him. Hence, in every experience of genuine fellowship we do not feel as though we have gained much from God; instead, we feel as though God has asked many things of us. If we always feel that we have gained God but not that He has required anything of us, we cannot be used by Him. Those who are used by the Lord often feel that He is constantly requiring something of them, and they are willing to respond by His grace. As a result, living water is constantly flowing from them, just like a renowned spring in Shantung Province, China, that flows and gushes forth water even when there is a long drought. This is according to the Lord&rsquo;s words, &ldquo;He who believes into Me...out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water&rdquo; (John 7:38).</p>
<p>The Lord always demands something of us in our fellowship with Him because there are too many matters and things in us that replace Him. There are many things that replace Him within us and in our living and in our environment; hence, we do not express much of His element. For this reason, the Lord continually makes demands on us. The more ground we give to the Lord, the more He will require of us. When we answer His demands, He will require more of us. However, if He does not ask anything of us, our fellowship with Him has been interrupted, and although we may still work, we cannot be used by Him. We may labor, but we will not have the flow of life. We may still give messages, but we will not impart God into others. Hence, as those who desire to be used by God, we must not neglect the lesson of fellowshipping with God. We must enter into His presence continually and respond to His demands.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Fellowshipping with the Lord for the Mingling of God with Man &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
