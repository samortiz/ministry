   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the previous message, we saw the Spirit's work in sanctifying the God-chosen people before they repent and believe.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we want to see the Spirit's work in regenerating the convicted and believing believers John 3:5-6, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I hope that we would all learn to know the thought of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When a person writes something, his thought is in his writing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to know the Lord's thought in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In reading 1 Peter 1:2 and 3, we can see not only the thought of Peter but also the thought of the inspiring Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These verses say, "Chosen according to the foreknowledge of God the Father in the sanctification of the Spirit unto obedience and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The main thought in these two verses is embodied in three crucial words: chosen, sanctification, and regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God chose us in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then in time the Spirit came to sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's choosing is in the Spirit's sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now we need to consider the purpose of God's choosing and of the Spirit's sanctifying.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's choosing and the Spirit's sanctifying do not have two goals.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They have only one goal.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are on the same line, the same road.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is not that God takes one way, and the Spirit takes another way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They are taking one way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God started the way to choose us, and the Spirit follows in the same way, in the same line, to sanctify us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's choosing and sanctifying are for the purpose of producing sons.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God's intention is to have many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God can have many sons not by adoption but by begetting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John 3:3 says that we must be "born anew."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not just generating but regenerating.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In God's economy, God must first have man in His creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His creation of man was a kind of bringing forth, a kind of begetting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How can we prove that God's creation was God's begetting?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Luke 3:38 says, "Adam, the son of God."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a strong verse to prove that God's creation was a kind of begetting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Adam was created by God Gen 5:1-2 , and God was his origin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God did not breathe His breath of life into the plants, the fish, the birds, or the cattle.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In God's creation, God breathed the breath of life only into Adam Gen 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Luke considered that this was God's begetting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>That was humankind's first birth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Charles Wesley's hymn "Hark!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Herald Angels Sing" Hymns, #84 is of a very high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I would like to point out stanza 3 of this hymn, which says, "Born to raise the sons of earth;/Born to give them second birth."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God's economy needs man to go through two births.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He receives a human life in his first birth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then he has to go through another birth, the second birth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This birth is for him to receive the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God intended that man would have two lives the human life and the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In order to do this, God must have a prototype, a model.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>So He Himself became incarnated to be the prototype.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At one time God merely had the divine life, not the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But He had the intention that mankind would have two lives, the human and the divine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, He Himself had to be a prototype.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He set up a model by becoming incarnated.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God with the divine life came into humanity that He might have the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, on this earth there was a unique model, the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today this prototype has been duplicated in mass production because in resurrection He has become the Firstborn among many brothers Rom 8:29 .</S>
