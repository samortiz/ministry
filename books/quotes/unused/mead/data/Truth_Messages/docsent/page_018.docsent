   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KEEPING A WATCHFUL EYE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ON THOSE WHO CAUSE DIVISIONS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 16:17 says, Now I beg you, brothers, keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Recently there have been some among us who have made divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which we have learned.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to keep a watchful eye on such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whenever we see them causing division, we must turn away from them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although this is not pleasant, it is necessary to preserve the health of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order for the Body to be healthy, it must be kept from all of the factors of division.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Some divisive ones have said that if we turn away from them, we are not the church and do not have the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They have been undermining the Lord s recovery and causing divisions; nevertheless, they expect the church to include them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But we must be bold to declare that we cannot tolerate division.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot permit divisive ones to remain in the fellowship of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not think that the church should include those who cause division.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yes, the church includes all the believers, but not those who cause division.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After speaking about those who make divisions and causes of falling, Paul says, For such men do not serve as slaves our Lord Christ, but their own appetites; and by smooth and flattering speech deceive the hearts of the simple Rom 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Greek word translated appetites means belly or the entire physical cavity; it is a derivative of the word meaning hollow.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who cause divisions have a gap, a hollow space, within them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In their greed and ambition, they desire to fill this empty spot.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They do not serve the Lord nor care for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead, they care only to fill the hollowness within them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They do not care for the saints, for the churches, for the recovery, or for the Lord s testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We, however, are slaves of the Lord and are here only for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, there have recently been some among us who did not care for the recovery or for the churches, but only for filling the gap in their own inward being.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Romans 16:18 says that those who serve their own appetites, not the Lord Jesus Christ, deceive the hearts of the simple by smooth and flattering speech.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In these days many simple ones have been deceived by flattering words and promises.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>REJECTING THE SECTARIAN ONE</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Titus 3:10 and 11 is another portion of the Word dealing with divisive ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to the Greek, verse 10 says, A sectarian man, after the first and second admonition, reject.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A sectarian man is one who causes divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such a person is to be rejected after the first and second admonition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To reject here means to avoid, to refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 11 says, Knowing that he that is such is perverted, and sinneth, being self-condemned Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>. This indicates that the conscience of the sectarian ones is not completely dead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Rather, their conscience convicts them that they are wrong, that they are acting against God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Deep within, they know they are divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, they are self-condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Romans 16 and Titus 3 exactly fit today s situation.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because we cannot tolerate division, we need to keep a watchful eye on those who are divisive and reject those who are sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1 Corinthians 5 we see the casting out of a sinful one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church simply cannot tolerate such a sinful one as described in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These four portions of the Word confirm the fact that the church must keep its sanctified position.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The church cannot tolerate anything divisive or defiling.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How we thank the Lord for the sanctifying word, the sanctifying Spirit, the sanctifying God, and the sanctifying truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The word of truth is continually dealing with the factors of division within us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Worldliness, ambition, self-exaltation, and opinions and concepts are being put to death so that we can maintain the genuine oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May we all see this, exercise ourselves in prayer concerning it, experience it, and practice it!</S>
