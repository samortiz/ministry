[2]  This book is comprised of messages given in the summers of 1963, 1965, and 1969 in Los Angeles, California.
[3]  They contain a clear presentation of the basic truth concerning our human spirit.
[4]  It is in our spirit that we were born again John 3:6 ; it is in our spirit that we were made alive Eph 2:5; Rom 8:10 ; it is in our spirit that God dwells Eph 2:22; 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 8:16 ; it is in our spirit that we are joined to the Lord 1 Cor 6:17 ; and it is in our spirit that we contact and worship God John 4:24 .
[5]  Now we must walk and have our whole being according to our spirit serving in our spirit Rom 1:9 , praying in spirit Eph 6:18 , being filled in spirit Eph 5:18 , seeing God's revelation in spirit Eph 1:17; 3:5; Rev 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10 , having fellowship with the brothers and sisters in spirit Phil 2:1 ; and being built together with others into a dwelling place of God in spirit Eph 2:22 .
[6]  In this book we will cover one very important thing our human spirit.
[7]  First, we need to see that the spiritual life, the divine life, the eternal life, the uncreated life, is just God Himself in Christ as the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .
[8]  THE HEAVENS, THE EARTH, AND THE SPIRIT OF MAN
[9]  Zechariah 12:1 tells us that in God's creation there are three main items.
[10]  With man the most important part is the spirit because the spirit of man is the center of his being, and this center is the very spot where God comes into man John 3:6; 2 Tim 4:22; Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17 .
[11]  Revelation 22:6 tells us that the Lord is the Lord God of the spirits of the prophets.
[12]  In Luke 1:46-47 Mary said, "My soul doth magnify the Lord" present tense , and "my spirit hath rejoiced" perfect tense , "in God my Saviour."
[13]  The Scriptures clearly reveal that we have a human spirit and that God created our human spirit for us to contact Him.
[14]  In John 3:6 the Lord Jesus said, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
[15]  Before we were saved we didn't have life in our spirit.
[16]  CHAPTER THREE OUR HUMAN SPIRIT IN THE OLD TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: Gen 2:7; Prov 20:27; Job 32:8; Exo 35:21; Num 14:24; Deut 2:30; Ezra 1:1, 5; Hag 1:14; Jer 51:11; Job 6:4; 10:12; 15:13; Psa 31:5; 32:2; 34:18; 51:10, 12, 17; 77:3, 6; 78:8; Prov 16:2; Isa 26:9a; 57:15-16; Psa 106:33; Prov 16:32, 18, 19; 17:27; 25:28; 18:14; Isa 29:24; Eccl.
[17]  It is interesting to see that the first verse refers to the creation of the human spirit, while the last verse in the Old Testament regarding the human spirit exhorts us to take heed to our spirit.
[18]  We shouldn't just take heed to our outward behavior, but we have to take heed to our inward spirit, because our human spirit is the very source of all our behavior.
[19]  At the time of Numbers 14:24 most of the Israelites were quite rebellious toward God, but Caleb was different.
[20]  In Psalms 34:18 you have a "contrite spirit," and in Psalms 51:10, a "right spirit."
[21]  Psalms 51 shows us a contrite spirit, a right spirit, a willing spirit, and a broken spirit.
[22]  Proverbs 16:32 says, "He that is slow to anger is better than the mighty; and he that ruleth his spirit than he that taketh a city."
[23]  CHAPTER FOUR OUR HUMAN SPIRIT BORN OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 3:6b; 4:24; Eph 2:1; Ezek.
[24]  John 3:6 says, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit."
[25]  When we believed in the Lord Jesus, we received another life.
[26]  CHAPTER FIVE OUR HUMAN SPIRIT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT 1 Scripture Reading: Rom 1:9a; 2:29; 7:6; 8:4; Gal 5:16; Rom 8:10, 16; Acts 18:25; 17:16; 19:21; 20:22; 1 Cor 2:4, 11, 13-15; 3:1-3; 5:3-4; Col 2:5; 1 Cor 4:21; Gal 6:1; 1 Pet 3:4; 1 Cor 7:34; 2 Cor 7:1; 1 Cor 14:2, 14-16, 32; 16:18; 2 Cor 2:13; 7:13; 12:18; Gal 6:18; Philem.
[27]  The book of John reveals that the Holy Spirit begets the human spirit 3:6 and the human spirit worships the divine Spirit 4:24 .
[28]  The children of Israel ate manna everyday, but there was no oldness.
[29]  Galatians 5:16 says, "Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh."
[30]  The cross has to deal with our flesh, with our mentality, with our thinking, and with our likes and dislikes, that we may be fully walking by the Spirit who dwells in and mingles with our regenerated spirit.
[31]  THE SPIRIT OF MAN AND THE SPIRIT OF GOD
[32]  First Corinthians 2:11 says that only the spirit of man knows the things of a man.
[33]  CHAPTER SIX OUR HUMAN SPIRIT IN THE NEW TESTAMENT 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 1:17; 2:22; 3:5; 5:18; 6:18; 4:23; Col 1:9-10; Phil 2:1; 2 Tim 1:7; 4:22; Heb 12:9; Rev 22:6; 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10; 1 Thes 5:23; Heb 4:12; Luke 1:46-47; Phil 1:27; 1 Cor 6:17 A SPIRIT OF WISDOM AND REVELATION
[34]  Ephesians 1:17 says, "That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him."
[35]  To know God, to know Christ, and to know the church needs a spirit of wisdom and revelation.
[36]  When our spirit is one with our mind, when our mind is subject to our spirit, our spirit becomes a renewing spirit.
[37]  Colossians 1:9-10 reveals that when you have such a renewing spirit in your mind, you do have the spiritual understanding.
[38]  Revelation 1:10; 4:2; 17:3; and 21:10 use the term "in spirit."
[39]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 2:14-15; 1 Thes 5:23; Heb 4:12; Luke 1:46-47; Matt 10:38-39; 16:24-26; Mark 8:35-36; Luke 9:23-25; John 12:25
[40]  If we are going to know our human spirit we must see the difference between the spirit and the soul.
[41]  The most important passage showing us the difference between the spirit and the soul is 1 Corinthians 2:14-15: "But a soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God, for they are foolishness to him; and he is not able to know them, because they are spiritually discerned.
[42]  Hebrews 4:12 says, "For the word of God is living and operative and sharper than any two-edged sword, piercing even to the dividing of soul and spirit, both of joints and marrow, and able to discern the thoughts and intents of the heart."
[43]  The word divides the spirit from the soul just as the sword divides the marrow from the joints which are the bones.
[44]  In the teachings of the Gospels we are told to deny the soul, to lose the soul, but in the teachings of all the Epistles we have to take care of the spirit, walk in the spirit, and we have to do things, to pray in the spirit.
[45]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE SPIRIT WITH THE FACULTIES OF THE SOUL Scripture Reading: Matt 16:24-26; Luke 9:23-25; Lev 11:43-44; 1 Cor 2:14; Rom 8:6; 1 Cor 2:11; 2 Cor 7:13b; Acts 19:21 THE SPIRIT AND THE SOUL
[46]  Thus far, we have seen that the spirit and the soul are two distinct parts of man's being 1 Thes 5:23; Heb 4:12; Luke 1:46-47 .
[47]  The body is man's outermost part and his spirit is his innermost part John 7:38 .
[48]  If you denied your natural thought, the spirit within you would rise up.
[49]  Because we are so much in the soul, in the mind, emotion, and will, our human spirit does not have the chance, the ground, to do anything.
[50]  We have to deny our soul, to lose our soul, because we regenerated persons have another part, an inmost part, which is the quickened, regenerated spirit with the Holy Spirit of God indwelling it.
[51]  The more you are one with the Lord in the spirit, the more you are spiritual, the more keen you will be in your mind.
[52]  Before you take the Lord as life, you are quite dull in your thinking, but if you deny yourself and take the Lord as your life, you will be very keen in your thinking.
[53]  Romans 8:6 says, "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace."
[54]  This means that your mind will be used by the spirit, under the control of the spirit, and directed by the spirit.
[55]  We deny the life of the soul and take the Lord as our life in the spirit to control and direct all the parts of the soul in order that they might be used to express the Lord Himself.
[56]  CHAPTER NINE KNOWING THE HUMAN SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:6, 4-5 THE SENSE OF THE SPIRIT
[57]  To know the spirit is to know it by the sense of the spirit.
[58]  The first item of the sense of life is satisfaction.
[59]  CHAPTER TEN EXERCISING THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 4:7; 2 Tim 1:7; 4:22
[60]  First Timothy 4:7 says to "exercise yourself unto godliness."
[61]  Second Timothy 1:7 tells us, "God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind."
[62]  If you are going to exercise yourself unto godliness, you have to know how to exercise your spirit because the very God is in your spirit.
[63]  We have to start to exercise our spirit by praying, because to pray, in principle, is something in the spirit Eph 6:18 .
