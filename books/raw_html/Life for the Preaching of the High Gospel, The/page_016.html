<P>I believe the Lord is going to move in a fast way. When the day of Pentecost came, three thousand were saved on that one day (Acts 2:41). On another day five thousand were saved (4:4). If one day in Southern California, ten thousand people, especially the young people, would turn to the Lord's dominion, it would not be a surprise to me. In this country today a great number of young people are rebellious toward the old way of life. Of course, this is not good for the families, the society, and the country. But the Lord is sovereign. All the nations are under Him. The United States was and still is a Christian country. But look at the situation today. If the young people of this generation were still stuck to the old way of living, it would be rather hard for them to be saved.</P><P>But today thousands of young people, many of whom are hippies, have been saved. They forget about the world and give up the old way of living. We do believe that the Lord will turn a great number of hippies unto Him. How can you bring them in? Do you bring them into the cathedrals, into the so-called church buildings? No! Go to meet with them on the beaches. If two or three hundred of the young saints have the feeling and the burden to go to the beach to meet, they should do it. You can bring with you the public-address system and broadcast the good news to everyone, asking them to come and join you in the church in Los Angeles.</P><P>We can never confine the Lord Jesus. Today the situation of Christianity is exactly the same as that in the ancient days of Judaism. My burden is to share with you that today the Lord Jesus is going to do a new thing with a new generation. Apparently, Anna and Simeon were not in that move, but they were absolutely for that move and they prayed very much for it. I believe many elderly ones who are for the Lord are in the same position as Anna and Simeon. You have to pray night and day for the Lord's new move. Yet for the move itself, the Lord will use mostly the young people.</P><P>When the Lord was on earth, He used the fishermen and the menders, the Galileans. He used those who were not in the temple, but in the boats on the sea, and He used those who were willing to jump into the water. The Lord Jesus came to the disciples, walking on the sea, and said to Peter, "Come." That means Peter had to jump into the water, and he did it. Suppose Peter would have said, "No, Lord, I won't jump into the water. Why can't I stay in the boat? To be in the boat is safe. It is the logical thing to do. Sooner or later I will come to You. You just wait awhile." Then he would have become a materialistic person, who was so rational, logical, and sound that he would not jump into the water but would stay in the boat and come to the Lord gradually. The Lord Jesus exercised much training with Peter to bring him out of the religious and materialistic concept and into the dominion of God.</P><P>You should learn a lesson from Peter's experience. Whatever the Lord says, do it. Whatever the Lord says, take it. Whatever the Lord says, stand on it. You do not need to exercise any reasoning. You do not need to be religious or spiritual. You need to be under God's dominion.</P>
