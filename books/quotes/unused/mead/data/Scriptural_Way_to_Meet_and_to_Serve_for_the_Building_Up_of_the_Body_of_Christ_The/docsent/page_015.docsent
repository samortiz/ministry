   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TRADITIONAL WAY BEING NATURAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND ADOPTING THE WAY OF HUMAN SOCIETY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FOR RELIGION IN THE CUSTOMS OF THE NATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The traditional way of Christianity is the opposite of this scriptural way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I attended my mother s church service in her denomination, I never prepared myself because I realized that I did not need to do anything and that nearly everything would be done by our pastor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Fifty years ago in 1937, Brother Watchman Nee began to see that the traditional Sunday morning meeting is absolutely of the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He pointed us to 2 Kings 17:8 and said that the traditional way of meeting was according to the customs of the nations, the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Gentile way of worship is to be silent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But the Psalms tell us to make a joyful noise unto God, Jehovah 66:1; 81:1; 95:1-2; 98:4, 6; 100:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In mainland China we had a time with Brother Nee to study the book The Song of Songs in the vicinity of a certain lake where there were many idol temples.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I went for a walk at this lake and observed the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Each one of these worshippers was dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The dumb idols are worthy of dumb worship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These idol worshippers may have been very talkative in their homes, but when they came to the idol temple everyone had to be dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul s thought in 1 Corinthians 12 is that the dumb, voiceless idols make their worshippers dumb and voiceless v. 2; Psa 115:4-8 , but the living God causes His worshippers to speak in His Spirit v. 3 . Paul said in 12:2 that when we were of the nations, we were led away to dumb idols.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When we worshipped the idols, we were dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But now we are not worshipping a dumb God but a speaking God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All of His speaking is compiled together in the Holy Bible, a great volume of sixty-six books.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is strange that when the Christians come together in Christianity, they are all made to be silent, dumb.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Mainly, only one professional in the meetings of Christianity is talkative, speaking and speaking throughout the year, year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is the feeling that the Christians who are laymen do not know what to speak and they may speak wrongly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thus, it is better for them not to speak and to let one professional speak.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This practice started shortly after the early apostles departed to be with the Lord at the end of the first century.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This traditional way began to exist and it gradually became very prevailing because this way to worship God without speaking is very natural.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It fits our natural habit and taste.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When you bring an unbelieving Gentile to the Lord and ask him to speak immediately after his salvation, he may be frightened.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He may especially be frightened to speak to a big audience.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He may say, In my entire life, I never spoke to more than fifteen persons at one time, and now you are asking me to speak in a meeting of one hundred and fifty persons.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This will compel me to withdraw from Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I don t want such a speaking religion that forces me to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you set up a nice hall with good seats, some singers to either sing solos or to sing in groups, and an eloquent, learned, and polished speaker, everyone will like it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to their natural thought, people feel that this is the proper way to worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They enter quietly into the cathedral or place of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then the choir may sing a song or someone may sing a solo that is pleasant, relaxing, and comforting.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A busy banker who has been working hard all week may feel that this place of worship is the best place for him to be relaxed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even a mother with many children may feel that the cathedral is a calm, silent place where she can escape from the noise and crying at home.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After the singing, a certain pastor or reverend would offer a prayer and take care of the Scripture reading in a professional manner.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The pastors are the experts, the professionals.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then another pastor may stand up to give a message with much eloquence and much knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This kind of speaking pleases and comforts everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The content of our meetings in the Lord s recovery is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But regardless of how wonderful the content is, our way to practice the meetings is somewhat similar to the practice of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Not many among us pray to prepare ourselves for the Lord s Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The saints may only ask, Who is going to speak?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When they hear that a certain brother will speak who is a good speaker, they are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They do not get themselves prepared because they do not need to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They just come to the meeting to enjoy the speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Sometimes the brothers and sisters may criticize the brother who is speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They may say, Who put this man on the podium?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His illustrations are not very good, his voice is too low, he is not so eloquent, and he does not know the Bible very well.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If another brother speaks the following week, some may say, This brother is better than the one last week.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Surely we received some feeding from this kind of meeting because the word of God was always spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We did get some feeding from the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this kind of meeting, however, there was hardly any exercise on the part of the saints for them to have the development in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In order to maintain our physical life, we need to eat, but in order to develop properly, we must also exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Basically speaking, the children in the United States have grown so big and have been so healthy because of good eating and good exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In the traditional way of meeting, there may be some eating, but there is hardly any exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>About thirty years ago in Manila, a group of brothers among us went to visit a person who was sick in the hospital.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These brothers all prayed for him in the presence of some of his relatives, who were also Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After listening to the brothers prayers, they were shocked.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They asked them if they were a group of pastors, and the brothers told them they were not.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Then they asked the brothers how they could pray so well.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They told the brothers that they had been Christians for years, but they did not know how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They did not know how to pray after having been Christians for years because they did not have any practice.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the traditional way of Christianity there is no need for the laymen to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The professionals take care of the major parts of the service.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They read the holy Word, pray, and speak on the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This traditional way annuls the organic function of the living members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I was born into Christianity, and I was compelled to go to Sunday school every Sunday morning, but no one there taught us the practice of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I never prayed until I was born again at the age of nineteen.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Before that time I had been in Christianity for years, but there was no one to help or instruct me to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Generally speaking, hardly anyone learns how to pray when they are in the traditional way of meeting and serving.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This traditional way which has been existing for over nineteen hundred years still, at least in part, remains among us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Brother Nee saw this matter fifty years ago, and he spoke concerning this see chapter four of Church Affairs and chapter nine of The Normal Christian Church Life by Watchman Nee, published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He asked me to share one of his messages on this subject when he was ill.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Brother Nee talked with me at length concerning the traditional way of meeting versus the scriptural way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He pointed out that the scriptural way to meet was in 1 Corinthians 14:26, but we did not find a way to carry out what he saw.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Brother Nee also pointed out that this traditional way had become a strong habit, a strong custom, deeply rooted in the believers hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Whenever a human being would turn to God, they naturally would like to worship God not by speaking but by coming together to hear something about God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is according to their natural thought, fits their habit and taste, and does not cost them anything but rather renders them some relaxation, comfort, and enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the New Testament, however, especially in 1 Corinthians 14:26, we are charged to worship God by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>A psalm is not only for singing but also for speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>A teaching, a revelation, a tongue, and an interpretation are also by speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>For 1 Corinthians 14:26 to be realized everyone needs to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is very hard for anyone to speak in a public place.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>People s disposition by nature is not to speak anything publicly.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>People would rather listen and look than speak publicly.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This traditional way of not speaking is deeply rooted in man s disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It has become a strong habit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The Hebrew word for customs in 2 Kings 17:8 is also used in other places in the Old Testament, particularly in Leviticus where it is translated as statutes 18:5, 26; 19:19, 37; 20:8, 22; 25:18; 26:3, 15, 43, 46 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Brother Nee pointed to 2 Kings 17:8 to say that having a meeting like the Sunday morning service in Christianity was according to the customs of the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>A custom is a kind of habit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When a habit exists for a long time, it becomes a custom that is popular in society.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When this custom is practiced for a long period of time, it becomes a written regulation, even a statute.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In other words, after a period of time a habit becomes a custom, and after another period of time a custom becomes a statute.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We like to quote the New American Standard Bible which uses the word customs.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The traditional way of worship is not only a habit but also a custom.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Most of the unbelievers know how the Christians in Christianity worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>They know what the edifices of worship look like.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>They also know that a pastor will be speaking with the audience sitting in pews to listen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>The people in China say to listen to the preaching is to worship because this traditional way of meeting is not only the Christians habit but also their custom.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>To have a pastor speak while the rest sit and listen is a very strong custom throughout the world.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This kind of realization and understanding of the way to meet has been sown into our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>It is in the cells of anyone who has been a Christian for a number of years.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Brother Nee firstly said that this traditional way to meet was a habit, a custom, and he secondly said that we do not have anything to replace it.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If we took away the Lord s Day message meeting, with what could we replace it?</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Even though he saw this matter as early as 1937, there was no attempt to practice the scriptural way of meeting for eleven years.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>The last chapter of The Normal Christian Church Life, entitled The Organization of Local Churches, talks about the church meeting according to the principle of 1 Corinthians 14:26.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The English edition of this book was published in 1939.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In 1948, Brother Nee had a training for four months at Mount Kuling, China, and during this time he came back again to this matter of the traditional way of meeting versus the scriptural way.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The messages on this subject are printed in the book Church Affairs.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>In this book he strongly pointed out that the Sunday morning meeting according to the practice of the denominations, the Lord s Day message meeting, is a waste and is not worthy of maintaining pp.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>67-70, 81-82 .</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>In 1949, the year after Brother Nee released this word, mainland China was lost into the hands of the Communists.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Then Brother Nee was put into prison for twenty years until he died.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Thus, there was no time for Brother Nee to do something to bring us into the practice of this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>By 1984, I realized that the situation and the condition of the churches in the Lord s recovery both in the West and the Far East was nearly at a standstill.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>There was very little increase and very little spread.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The saints migrated to Orange County, California in 1974 and within ten years up to 1984 the churches there had very little increase.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>This situation bothered me and burdened me.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>After much consideration, I felt that we needed to have a proper start to establish the scriptural way of meeting and serving in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>I realized that the right place and even the best place for me to help the saints to have such a new start was in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>However, a few still prefer to have the kind of meeting in which one speaks and the rest listen.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Most agree with the scriptural way, but deep within them they still have a preference for the traditional way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Despite this, we can declare that the Lord has gained a victory in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>On the Lord s Day there are over four thousand three hundred saints meeting together in eighty-six places.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>These meetings are called district meetings see chapter seven entitled District Meetings in Church Affairs .</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>These saints are taking the scriptural way and making good progress.</S>
