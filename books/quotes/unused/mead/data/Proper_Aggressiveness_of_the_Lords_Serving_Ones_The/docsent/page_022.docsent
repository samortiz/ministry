   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EVERYONE WHO ATTENDS THE PRAYER MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NEEDING A SPIRIT OF PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For sixty years, from the time I was saved up to the present, I have been attending prayer meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First I attended prayer meetings in a denomination, then in a Brethren Assembly, and later in the prayer meetings of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>According to my experience, everyone who comes to the prayer meeting must have a spirit of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As soon as we step into the meeting, we should not care for anything but to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If someone is praying, we should wait until he finishes and then continue the prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not rely too much on the responsible brothers to lead the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not expect them to call a hymn, open the prayer, or announce the items for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a prayer meeting will not be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the prayer meetings of the churches in America, whoever arrives first begins to pray, and those who come later join in the prayer; everyone prays.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No one waits until seven-thirty to begin praying, they do not sing first and then have an opening prayer, and there is neither a message nor an announcement concerning items for prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They just pray.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This kind of prayer meeting is powerful and very living; oftentimes the prayer lasts for one and a half hours.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Generally speaking, if someone stands up to announce some items for prayer or to call a hymn in the middle of the prayer meeting, it is an interruption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The spirit of prayer should not be interrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once it is interrupted, it is not easy to raise the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, when we come together to pray, we must take this as the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not rely on a program, nor should we depend on a few designated people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As soon as we come together, we should begin to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not Regarding the Prayer Meeting as a Routine</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Someone may ask what we should pray for if the items for prayer are not announced.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since we are all in the church life, we should know the needs of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we come to the prayer meeting, we should not pray for trivial matters but for important matters, such as God s will, God s kingdom, and the propagation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For instance, the church in Taipei is now at a turning point, a new beginning; we should pray earnestly for this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This does not mean, however, that no one should make a prayer request.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a family member is very sick, a saint can look for an opportunity to fellowship this matter by following the leading of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then he can make a request for prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The prayer meeting will be dead if we pray according to a list that is distributed to every hall or district.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am not saying that we should not have such a list but that it should not become a routine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the brothers and sisters come together to pray, they should pray mainly for God s kingdom, the propagation of the gospel, and the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Furthermore, they should also pray for the saints growth in life and for the move of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These matters are our major concerns, and we should remember them in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the elders, co-workers, and deacons realize that there is a crucial matter in the church that needs to be made known in the prayer meetings of the church, then it is proper to make an announcement.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In addition, it is also good to allow the saints to fellowship some personal burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They may have a relative or a friend who needs to be saved and needs the intercession of the saints in the prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In any case, the prayer meeting should be living and not regarded as a routine.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Prayers Needing to Be Short yet Strong</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, there should not be long prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I was young, I attended the prayer meeting of a Brethren assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every time there were dozens of saints who would come to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whenever one prayed, their prayer was very long; hence, many people dozed off on their knees.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should avoid this.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Strong prayer is not usually long.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I pray two sentences, another prays two sentences, and yet another follows by praying two sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After praying in this way for one item, we can move on to another item.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the end all the saints will pray as one man.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the best prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The more we pray, the more living the prayer becomes, and the more we pray, the higher and stronger the prayer becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to learn and exercise to have simple but strong and uplifting prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should not worry about what to pray for next.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Holy Spirit will lead us to pray for different burdens one by one.</S>
