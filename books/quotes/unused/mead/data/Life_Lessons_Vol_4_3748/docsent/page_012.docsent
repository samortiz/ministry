   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Regeneration to Be Born from Above</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1 Unless a man is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God John 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the original language the word anew here is the same word as from above in John 3:31.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, to be regenerated also means to be born from above.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we were born the first time, of our parents, we were born from the earth, from below, and the human life of the flesh which we obtained is from the earth and of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we are born the second time, of God, that is, when we are regenerated, we are born from above, from heaven, and the spiritual life of God which we receive is from heaven and of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, to be regenerated is to be born from above that man may have this heavenly life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>C. Regeneration to Be Born</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>of Water and the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1 Unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God John 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The matter of being born of water and the Spirit spoken of by the Lord Jesus refers to regeneration through the water of the baptism preached by John the Baptist and through the Holy Spirit given by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The water of baptism indicates death and burial, symbolizing Christ s death and burial for the termination of the repenting and believing ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit, who is the Holy Spirit, the Spirit of life and resurrection, causes the believing ones to participate in Christ s resurrection in order that the terminated ones may experience the germination of a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By being baptized into this water and into this Spirit, those who believe into Christ are regenerated and are delivered from all the old things of men to enter into the kingdom of God, which is the realm of the divine life and the divine ruling.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This enables them to live by God s eternal life in God s eternal kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>D. Spirit Begetting Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>1 That which is born of the Spirit is spirit John 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Regeneration is also God s Spirit begetting our spirit, that is, the Spirit of God regenerating our human spirit with God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When we believe into Christ and are regenerated, the Spirit of God dispenses God s life, God s element, into our spirit, enlivening our spirit and making it a new spirit Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>36:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE MEANS OF REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1 Through the resurrection of Christ God the Father has regenerated us...through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first means by which God regenerates us is the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When Christ was resurrected, we who believe into Him were all included in Him and were raised up together with Him Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>His resurrection dispenses God s life into us and enlivens us with God s life, that we may have the life of God and be joined to God organically.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, God regenerates us through Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>2 Through the work of the Holy Spirit And having come, He the Holy Spirit will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment John 16:8 ; ...born of the Spirit John 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The second means by which God regenerates us is the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Holy Spirit first convicts us concerning sin, concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment, causing us to repent and to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After we repent and believe, He brings God s life into our spirit that we may obtain God s life and may be regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>3 Through the word of God Having been regenerated, not of corruptible seed, but of incorruptible, through the living and abiding word of God 1 Pet 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The third means by which God regenerates us is His living word, which is the word of God in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God s word in the Bible contains His life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we believe the gospel, we believe God s word of life John 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once we receive through faith God s word of the gospel, this word sows the life of God as the seed of life into us 1 John 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, God regenerates us through His word of truth James 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>4 By man s faith Those who believe into His name...were born...of God John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The last means by which God regenerates us is our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The resurrection of Christ accomplished for us the fact of regeneration, the work of the Holy Spirit applies this fact to us, and the word of God coordinates with the Holy Spirit to put this fact before us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, there is still the need for us to receive this fact by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, in order to be regenerated, we must believe into Christ according to God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE ISSUES OF REGENERATION</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>1 Obtaining the eternal life of God Everyone who believes in Him Christ should...have eternal life John 3:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Eternal life is God s own life, that is, God Himself as life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Both God s nature and the functions within Him are in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we are regenerated, we obtain God s eternal life with all the elements and functions in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>2 Becoming the children of God To them He Christ gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name: who were born...of God John 1:12, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since regeneration causes us to obtain God s life, it also makes us the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God s life is the authority for us to become God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>3 Becoming the firstfruit of God s new creation He God brought us forth...that we should be a certain firstfruit of His creatures James 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Regeneration also makes us the firstfruit of God s new creation among God s creatures, possessing His life that matures first for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>4 Having a living hope ...regenerated us unto a living hope 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Since regeneration causes us to have God s life, it gives us a living hope, including such things as the growth in life, the manifestation of gifts, the ability to function, transformation, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is like the life of a newborn babe, which brings with it the hope that belongs to that life, including such matters as growth, maturity, a career, and marriage.</S>
