   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Psalm 107:17-22 we see God's care and deliverance of the ones sick because of their way of transgression.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Verse 17 says, "Some were fools, because of their way of transgression; /And because of their iniquities, they were afflicted."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But Jehovah "sent forth His word and healed them" v. 20a . This reminds us of the case of the centurion who said to the Lord Jesus, "Only speak a word, and my servant will be healed" Matt 8:8 . His servant was healed at the word of the Lord.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all are seafarers traveling on a human sea that is full of waves and storms, but here also we experience God's care and deliverance.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>and to Take Care of the Needy Ones</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The last section of this psalm, verses 33 through 43, is concerned with God's adjusting of the environment to deal with the wicked and haughty ones and to take care of the needy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Verses 33 and 34 tell us that God turns rivers into a wilderness, springs of water into thirsty ground, and fruitful land into a salt flat.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is God's dealing with the wicked.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, verses 35 and 36 say, "He turns a wilderness into a pool of water,/And a dry land into springs of water.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>/And He makes the hungry dwell there,/That they may prepare a city of habitation."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is God's taking care of the needy ones.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today we can enjoy God's care, and we can be delivered by Him from so many things because Christ is sitting there at God's right hand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, because Christ is our High Priest in the heavens praying for us, this care is His care for us and this deliverance is His deliverance of us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His praying for us means that He is taking care of us, delivering us, and rescuing us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we did not have Psalm 110, Psalm 107 would be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do you want the care and deliverance described in Psalm 107?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You can have this only in Christ, by Christ, and with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Where is Christ today?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is no longer in the manger or on the cross He is at the right hand of God in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As the High Priest according to the order of Melchizedec, He is praying for us there.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have a word regarding this in Hebrews 5 through 7.</S>
