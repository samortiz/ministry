   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>H. The Triune God in Us</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>for Our Experience and Enjoyment</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to see that the God who is dispensing Himself into us is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>According to the New Testament, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us Eph 4:6; Col 1:27; John 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all in us, in our experience we sense that there is just One in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This One who dwells in us is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord charged us to baptize the nations "into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is one name for the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The name is the sum total of the Divine Being, equivalent to His person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To baptize people into the name of the Triune God is to immerse them into all that the Triune God is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once we believe into Christ and are baptized into the person of the Divine Trinity, we should daily enjoy the Triune God by participating in the love of God the Father, in the grace of Christ the Son, and in the fellowship of the Holy Spirit 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, we will enjoy the Divine Trinity in His divine dispensing to the fullest in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Revelation 22:1 says that the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This depicts how the Triune God God, the Lamb, and the Spirit symbolized by the water of life dispenses Himself into His redeemed people under His headship implied in the authority of the throne for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Martin Luther warned us not to approach the matter of the Divine Trinity by our natural reasoning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He said that those who approach this matter with confidence in their own mental power are "the teachers of God, not His pupils."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No human being can explain the Divine Trinity adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should simply accept and say Amen to whatever is recorded in the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can only present the divine facts from the New Testament concerning this great truth so that we may be impressed that the Triune God is dispensing Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Instead of exercising our mentality too much to try to figure out the Triune God, we should exercise our spirit to experience and enjoy the marvelous dispensing of the Triune God as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Note What is the heresy of modalism?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Modalism in the second and third centuries passed through several changes and then reached its clearest expression with Sabellius.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Modalism teaches that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not all eternal and do not all exist at the same time, but are merely three temporary manifestations of the one God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Modalism claims that the Father ended with the Son's coming and that the Son ceased with the Spirit's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The modalists say that the three of the Godhead exist respectively in three consecutive stages.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They do not believe in the coexistence and coinherence of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This, of course, is a great heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Unlike the modalists, we believe in the eternal coexistence and coinherence of the three of the Godhead; that is, we believe that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit all exist essentially at the same time and under the same conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, in the divine economy, the three work and are manifested respectively in three consecutive stages.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Yet even in Their economical works and manifestations, the three still remain essentially in Their coexistence and coinherence.</S>
