<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By the Sense of the Law of Life</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Law of Life Being the Natural Function<br>of the Divine Life</H2><P>We can also know the spirit by the sense of the law of life. The law of life is the natural function of the divine life according to its divine nature. This means the law of life functions according to the divine nature of the divine life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Functioning of the Law of Life</H2><P>The law of life functions to approve and accept things corresponding with the divine nature, and it opposes and rejects things not corresponding with God's nature.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Law of Life Giving Us<br>the Natural Sense on the Positive Side and<br>the Unnatural Sense on the Negative Side</H2><P>The law of life always gives us some sense. Sometimes the sense is natural, on the positive side. This means we are in the spirit. Sometimes the sense is unnatural, on the negative side. This means we are not in the spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Natural Sense versus<br>the Unnatural Sense of the Law of Life</H2><P>By the natural sense of the law of life we know that we are living in our spirit; by the unnatural sense of the law of life, we know that we are out of the spirit. These two senses are versus each other.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. By the Sense of Peace</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Life of the Holy Spirit in Our Spirit<br>Being God Himself</H2><P>The life of the Holy Spirit is the life of God, and this life in our spirit is God Himself. The phrase "the life of God" (Eph. 4:18) means that the life is God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Our Spirit with the Divine Life<br>Contained in the Holy Spirit Being the New Man</H2><P>The life in our spirit is God Himself, and our spirit with the divine life contained in the Holy Spirit is the new man.</P>
