<h2 class=head1>QUALIFICATIONS FOR THE LORD’S WORK</h2><p>Now we come to the Lord’s final appraisal of the seeking one. Since she has reached the consummate attainment, she is now ready to work for the Lord. It is not a work for the Lord, but a work with the Lord. She is now fully equipped and fully qualified to care for the Lord’s work. This brings the Lord’s last appraisal concerning her. All the aspects of this appraisal are related to her qualifications for the Lord’s work.<h2 class=head1>HER FOOTSTEPS</h2><p>The Lord first of all mentions something about her footsteps: “How beautiful are thy footsteps with shoes, O prince’s daughter” (7:1). “Footsteps” indicate action which has already taken place. It is not a matter of the beauty of her feet, but of her footsteps. This is the beauty of her action and her move. Her move is not with bare feet, but with shoes! From Ephesians chapter 6 we see that the shoes signify the preaching of the full gospel, including the preaching of the church life. The shoes not only give beauty to the feet, but also keep the feet from the defilement of the earth. If we put our bare feet on the earth, they will become dirty. But if we have shoes on our feet, our feet are covered, protected, and separated from the earth, though they are so near to the earth. Hence, wherever we go—to the office, the factory, the school, or the store—we must wear our gospel shoes. The preaching of the gospel will protect us, and keep us from becoming defiled through contact with the earth. When we arrive at a new job, go to a new school, or move to a new location, we must immediately let the people around us know that we wear the shoes of the gospel. If from the first day we tell them they need Jesus, not one of them will ask us to go to the movies the next day. The shoes of the gospel will separate us from this world. The preaching of the full gospel always leaves a footstep that is beautiful in the eyes of the Lord.<h2 class=head1>THIGHS LIKE JEWELS</h2><p>The second thing that the Lord mentions are the jewels: “Thy rounded thighs are like jewels, the work of the hands of a skillful workman” (7:1). Jewels are precious gems which have been transformed. They were not originally in that state. This shows that she has been transformed by the skillful workman who is God Himself. Her thighs like jewels represent her standing power and stability. Without stability, we are not qualified to touch the work of the Lord. If we are going to work with the Lord, we need the stability of transformation.<h2 class=head1>NECK AS A TOWER OF IVORY</h2><p>Then the Lord mentions her neck again: “Thy neck is as a tower of ivory” (7:4). In chapter four her neck was depicted as the tower of David, but here it is described as a tower of ivory. The tower of David was for fighting, but the tower of ivory means that her neck is full of resurrection life. Ivory in typology signifies the Lord’s resurrection life. Now her neck is not only full of submission for fighting the spiritual warfare, but it is also full of the resurrection life. Her neck is a tower ministering life in resurrection.<h2 class=head1>EYES LIKE POOLS</h2><p>Next, the Lord speaks of her eyes: “Thine eyes like pools in Heshbon, by the gate of Bath-rabbim” (7:4). In chapter one her eyes were likened to doves’ eyes, but now her eyes are likened to pools. We know that doves’ eyes are very small, but pools are much larger and have a much broader scope. How much can the doves’ eyes cover compared with pools? Now she has two large eyes, as big as pools. Such an enlarged vision is really wonderful! The doves’ eyes are spiritual, but the eyes like pools are enlarged and broadened to cover the whole universe.<p>Some seemingly spiritual people have the eyes of an ant. Their eyes are even smaller than the eyes of a dove. They cannot see anything except their work, their mission field, their little group, their “church.” But this seeking one can now see the whole universe. There is no limitation to her sight. We all need such a broadened vision. Her sight has been enlarged to the size of pools. This is really meaningful. Furthermore, these two pools are located by the gate. A gate is for coming in and going out. This is the communication of fellowship. If our eyes are as small as the ant’s, it is really difficult for us to have fellowship with anyone. Our fellowship depends upon our broadened sight.<p>Another matter concerning the pools is that they always give some reflection. There is light in her sight. To care for the Lord’s work we need such a broadened sight full of light. Otherwise, we are either short-sighted, narrow-sighted, or even blind. We must become so enlarged in our vision that we can see the whole universe. We not only care for the Lord’s work where we are, but we also care for the Lord’s interests in the whole universe.
