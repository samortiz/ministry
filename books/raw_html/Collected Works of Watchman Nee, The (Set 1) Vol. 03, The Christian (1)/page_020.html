<P>VI."And God said, Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear: and it was so" (Gen. 1:9). This was God's work on the third day. God's work here coincides with "the third day" (1 Cor. 15:4), a number which indicates resurrection. The dry land appeared from under the waters. It was buried under the dismal sea of darkness, but it came out from its grave. The clean earth, able to cultivate and bring forth fruit, came out from the sea of death. Although God did not eliminate the sea, He restricted it so that it could not go beyond its boundary. Presently, the sea has its boundary and cannot flood the earth. God gave a name to it (Gen. 1:10) and recognized its existence. Not until the new heaven and the new earth will it be eliminated. The dry land also received a new name (v. 10) to distinguish it from the sea. The appearance of dry land was the work of the first half of the third day. The work of the third day was divided into two halves. On that day God spoke twice; He twice said that His work was good. During the first half, the dry land appeared; during the second half, the earth brought forth grass, herbs, and fruit trees.</P><P>We saw the work of the cross in relation to God's work on the previous day. The third day signifies resurrection. Both the death and the resurrection of Christ are the means of our new life. Just as He died for us, He was also raised for us (Rom. 4:25). We need His resurrection as much as we need His death (Rom. 5:10). If we forego either of the two, we make the gospel vain. Through the death of Christ we are freed from everything that belongs to Adam and the natural man; through His resurrection we enter into everything that belongs to Christ and that is beyond the natural realm. His death frees us from the position of a sinner and can free us from the experience of sins. His resurrection grants us the position of a righteous man and can grant us the experience of righteousness. "So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new" (2 Cor. 5:17).</P><P>According to His plan of salvation, God has no intention to restore or mend our old nature, but rather to make us "a new creation." He does not want any of our old nature. The death of the Lord Jesus has freed us from the old, and the resurrection of the Lord Jesus causes us to enter into the new. If we are raised together with the Lord, we shall have the experience of being joined to Him. If we have the experience of being "in Christ," then we shall have the experience of the new creation, of old things passing away and all things becoming new. In order for us to practically live the life of the new creation, we must die with the Lord and be raised together with the Lord.</P><P>Nothing included in our "old creation," whether our life and the deeds that issue forth from this life, or our nature and the intents that issue forth from this nature, can satisfy God's heart. "For just as in Adam all die" (1 Cor. 15:22). In the eyes of God, everything of our old creation has the mark of "death." These dead things cannot be repaired or corrected. God wants something entirely new; He wants a new creation in which the old things have passed away and all things have become new. Therefore, His first work is to regenerate man and to give him a "new spirit" and a "new heart." This was the work of the first day. Our new spirit works together with God's Holy Spirit to put the old life and nature on the cross, crucifying them there. This was the work of the second day. Since God terminated all the "old things," He can now begin to develop the "new creation," so that all things can "become new." In this way, step by step He moves forward until eventually our body is transfigured on the sixth day, a complete new man. We will see this more clearly later.</P><P>The experience of resurrection comes after regeneration, on the first day, and after our co-crucifixion with the Lord, on the second day. Regeneration is the beginning of life. After receiving the regenerated life, we have a part within us that is willing to cooperate with the Holy Spirit; this part is willing to be crucified together with the Lord. This co-crucifixion naturally leads us into co-resurrection. "For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection" (Rom. 6:5). Regeneration is to receive life; resurrection is to receive more abundant life. If a believer remains merely regenerated, he will not be able to overcome sins. If he remains merely in co-crucifixion, he will not be able to advance to righteousness, God's holiness. We should always advance in our experience. Although in experience regeneration comes first, followed by co-crucifixion and co-resurrection, in reality the moment we believe in the Lord Jesus and are regenerated, God reckons us as being resurrected. At that time, however, we do not yet have the experience of resurrection in our own life.</P><P>Many believers, through introspection, cannot see that the old things have passed away and that all things have become new. This is a great danger. They either consider themselves to be unregenerated or else consider that this word is too hard to experience. Some will endeavor to correct and mend their own lives in the hope of matching God's Word, yet in their experience, they end up with failure and the loss of peace, joy, freedom, and power. If by faith they would reject the self and with their whole heart look to Christ, they would have the potential of being victorious. Our failures come when we try to reject the root of co-crucifixion while pursuing the fruit of resurrection. We do not allow the cross to do a deeper work in us; yet at the same time we desire to go on with haste to receive the resurrection life. We try to create the new life with the old life. This is altogether impossible. Resurrection is grounded in the cross; without the cross, there is no resurrection. Whoever desires the experience of resurrection must first experience the cross.</P><P>Being accepted by God does not depend on our experience. When we believed in the Lord Jesus, faith brought us into union with Him. Our position "in Christ" makes us well-acceptable to God, and He reckons us a completely new man. To be accepted in Christ is to be accepted just as Christ is accepted. God does not care for what we have inside. He looks upon us as completely new simply because of our new position. This concerns our salvation.</P><P>On the other hand, God wants us, the Body of His Son, to experience all that our Head has accomplished for us. It is by this that we are delivered from the old creation and become the new creation. We were raised together with Christ; we do not raise ourselves. Christ's resurrection has put us in a new realm; we were raised together with Him. If by faith we acknowledge this fact to be true and receive it, the Lord's resurrection will put us on the dry land where the seawater cannot reach.</P>
