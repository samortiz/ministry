Calgary Songbook :16


1
Our Father, as the evergreen,
Thou art forever new;
Thou art the ever living Lord,
Thy freshness as the dew.
O Father, Thou art unchanging,
Thou never hast grown old;
Thru countless ages, ever fresh,
Thy newness doth unfold.

2
O Thou art God, and Thou art “new”;
Without Thee all is worn,
But all with Thee is ever fresh,
Though many years have gone.

3
Each blessing Thou hast given us
Thy newness doth contain;
Thy covenant, Thy ways are new,
And ever thus remain.

4
Now we Thy new creation are
New spirit and new heart;
We’re daily from the old renewed,
New life Thou dost impart.

5
The earth and heavens will be new
And Thy new city share;
New fruits each month will be supplied,
For all is newness there.

6
O Father, Thou art ever new,
And all is new in Thee;
We sing the new eternal song,
New praise we give to Thee.

Hymns 28

1
The love of God is greater far
Than tongue or pen can ever tell.
It goes beyond the highest star
And reaches to the lowest hell.                     
The guilty pair, bowed down with care,
God gave His Son to win;                     
His erring child He reconciled
And pardoned from his sin.                     
O love of God, how rich and pure!
How measureless and strong!                     
It shall forevermore endure
The saints’ and angels’ song.

2
When hoary time shall pass away,
And earthly kingdoms fall;
When men who here refuse to pray,
On rocks and hills and mountains call;
God’s love, so sure, shall still endure,
All measureless and strong;
Redeeming grace to Adam’s race—
The saints’ and angels’ song.

3
Could we with ink the ocean fill,
And were the skies of parchment made;
Were every stalk on earth a quill,
And every man a scribe by trade;
To write the love of God above
Would drain the ocean dry;
Nor could the scroll contain the whole,
Though stretched from sky to sky
Hymns 39


Calgary Songbook :39


1
To God be the glory, great things He hath done,
So loved He the world that He gave us His Son,
Who yielded His life our redemption to win,
And opened the life-gate that all may go in.
Praise the Lord, praise the Lord,
Let the earth hear His voice;
Let the people rejoice;
Oh, come to the Father, through Jesus the Son,
And give Him the glory; great things He hath done.

2
Oh, perfect redemption, the purchase of blood,
To every believer the promise of God;
The vilest offender who truly believes,
That moment from Jesus a pardon receives.

3
Great things He hath taught us, great things He hath done,
And great our rejoicing through Jesus the Son;
But purer, and higher, and greater will be
Our wonder, our transport when Jesus we see.

Hymns 41

1
We are never weary singing our eternal song:
Glory to God, hallelujah!
We would sing His praise forever with our spirit strong:
O the children of the Lord
have a wondrous song to sing,
For the Lord will by His grace
many sons to glory bring.
We are going in that day
to the presence of the King:
Glory to God, hallelujah!

2
We are lost amid the rapture of redeeming love:
We are seeking every moment all its grace to prove:

3
We are going on to glory as the Lord has told:
Glory to God, hallelujah!
Where the King in all His beauty we shall soon behold:

4
There we’ll sing His grace and mercy in a glad new song:
There we’ll praise our glorious Savior
with the blessed throng:
Glory to God, hallelujah!
Hymns 65


Calgary Songbook :65


1
Jesus! that name we love,
Jesus, our Lord!
Jesus, all names above,
Jesus, the Lord!
Thou, Lord, our all must be;
Nothing that’s good have we,
Nothing apart from Thee,
Jesus, our Lord!                     

2
As Son of Man it was,
Jesus, the Lord!
Thou gav’st Thy life for us,
Jesus, our Lord!
Great was indeed Thy love,
All other loves above,
Love Thou didst dearly prove,
Jesus, our Lord!

3
Righteous alone in Thee,
Jesus, the Lord!
Thou wilt a refuge be,
Jesus, our Lord!
Whom, then, have we to fear,
What trouble, grief, or care,
Since Thou art ever near,
Jesus, our Lord!

4
Soon Thou wilt come again,
Jesus, the Lord!
We shall be happy then,
Jesus, our Lord!
When Thine own face we see,
Then shall we like Thee be,
Then evermore with Thee,
Jesus, our Lord!


Calgary Songbook :66

Hymns 66

1
How sweet the Name of Jesus sounds
In a believer’s ear!
It soothes his sorrow, heals his wounds,
And drives away his fear.
And drives away his fear *
And drives away his fear                     
It soothes his sorrow, heals his wounds,
And drives away his fear.

2
It makes the wounded spirit whole,
And calms the troubled breast;
’Tis manna to the hungry soul,
And to the weary rest.

3
Dear Name! the Rock on which we build;
Our shield and hiding-place;
Our never-failing treasury, filled
With boundless stores of grace.

4
Jesus, our Savior, Shepherd, Friend,
Our Prophet, Priest, and King;
Our Lord, our Life, our Way, our End,
Accept the praise we bring.

5
Weak is the effort of our heart,
And cold our warmest thought;
But when we see Thee as Thou art,
We’ll praise Thee as we ought.

6
Till then we would Thy love proclaim
With every fleeting breath;
And triumph in that blessed Name
Which quells the pow’r of death.
(* Substitute lines 3 and 4 of each verse for chorus)     
Hymns 70


Calgary Songbook :70


1
There is a name I love to hear,
I love to sing its worth:
It sounds like music in my ear,
The sweetest name on earth.
Oh, how I love Jesus,
Because He first loved me!

2
It tells me of a Savior’s love,
Who died to set me free;
It tells me of His precious blood,
The sinner’s perfect plea.

3
It tells me what my Father hath
In store for every day,
And though I tread a darksome path,
Yields sunshine all the way.

4
It tells of One whose loving heart
Can feel my deepest woe,
Who in each sorrow bears a part
That none can bear below.


Calgary Songbook :82

Hymns 82

1
Down from His glory,
Ever living story,
My God and Savior came,
And Jesus was His name.
Born in a manger,
To His own a stranger,
A Man of sorrows, tears and agony.
O how I love Him! How I adore Him!                     
My breath, my sunshine, my all in all!                     
The great Creator became my Savior,
And all God’s fullness dwelleth in Him.

2
What condescension,
Bringing us redemption;
That in the dead of night,
Not one faint hope in sight,
God, gracious, tender,
Laid aside His splendor,
Stooping to woo, to win, to save my soul.

3
Without reluctance,
Flesh and blood His substance
He took the form of man,
Revealed the hidden plan.
O glorious myst’ry,
Sacrifice of Calv’ry,
And now I know Thou art the great “I AM.”
Hymns 116


Calgary Songbook :116


1
How wonderful redemption is,
My gracious Lord, in Thee!
Not seen, nor heard, nor e’er conceived
What Thou hast done for me!
Thou art divine, mysterious,
Beyond my grandest phrase!                     
Redemption is so marvelous,
Beyond all pow’r to praise!

2
For us Thou on the Cross wast pierced,
And blood and water streamed;
That life divine be giv’n to us,
That we may be redeemed.
Thy precious blood has made us clean,
That we accepted be;
Regenerated by Thy life,
We now are one with Thee.

3
Thou art the grain divine that died
The many grains to bear,
Which, blent and formed, Thy Body are,
And all Thy nature share.
We are the increase of Thyself,
And Thou our content art;
Through us Thou livest and dost move
And manifested art.

4
Since we’re Thy Body, Thou may come
And settle down in us;
In us Thou may obtain Thy home
And we become Thy trust.
Thy heart to satisfy and please,
We are Thy counterpart,
Now in one Body with Thyself,
Enjoying all Thou art.

5
While in remembrance now we meet
And here the symbols see,
For Thy redemption great and full
We’re filled with praise to Thee.
Since we are made Thy Body, Lord,
Thy dwelling place and bride,
We would give thanks and worship Thee
And in Thy praise abide.


Calgary Songbook :124

Hymns 124

1
Praise Him! praise Him! Christ is Victor!
He has won the victory!
Sin is judged, old Adam finished,
Full redemption now we see!
Vanquished all the evil powers
Through the Cross triumphantly!

2
Praise Him! Christ is resurrected!
God hath raised Him from the dead!
All the power of death is swallowed,
Man from death to life is led!
Broken through are hell and darkness
And His pow’r exhibited!

3
Praise Him! Christ hath now ascended!
God hath raised Him to the throne!
Far above all rule and power,
He the highest Name doth own!
All authority receiving
Till His foe is overthrown!

4
Hallelujah, Christ the Victor
Triumphed on Mt. Calvary!
Hallelujah, resurrected,
He displays His victory!
Hallelujah, now ascended,
He shall reign eternally!
Hymns 152


Calgary Songbook :152


1
O how deep and how far-reaching
Is Thy love, dear Lord, to me!
Far beyond my pow’r to fathom,
Deeper than the deepest sea!
It has caused Thee death to suffer
And to me Thyself impart,
That in Thee I might be grafted
And become of Thee a part.

2
Who can tell of all the wonders
Which Thy love for me has wrought,
Yet the greatest of these wonders
Is that Thou to me art brought.
Oh! to me Thy love has given
All Thou art as my supply;
As true life I now may share Thee
And Thy riches e’er enjoy.

3
Lord, Thy love is the expression
Of Thy loving self divine,
Making life so full of meaning,
Harmonized with God’s design.
Grace of life, how all-sufficient,
Is my portion day by day;
I’m the object of Thy favor
And Thy sweetness taste alway.

4
What from Thee can separate me?
Thou wilt love me to the end!
Oh! Thy love is so prevailing,
E’en Thyself with me to blend!
We two one will be for ever;
I am Thine and Thou art mine!
This will be my testimony:
In Thy love we’ll ever twine!


Calgary Songbook :156

Hymns 156

1
I have a Friend, whose faithful love
Is more than all the world to me;
’Tis higher than the heights above,
And deeper than the soundless sea;
So old, so new,
So strong, so true;
Before the earth received its frame,
He loved me—Blessed be His name!

2
He held the highest place above,
Adored by all the sons of flame,
Yet such His self-denying love,
He laid aside His crown and came
To seek the lost,
And at the cost
Of heavenly rank and earthly fame
He sought me—Blessed be His name!

3
It was a lonely path He trod,
From every human soul apart;
Known only to Himself and God
Was all the grief that filled His heart,
Yet from the track
He turned not back,
Till where I lay in want and shame,
He found me—Blessed be His name!

4
Then dawned at last that day of dread,
When desolate, yet undismayed,
With wearied frame and thorn-crowned head,
He, God-forsaken, man-betrayed,
Was then made sin
On Calvary,
And, dying there in grief and shame,
He saved me—Blessed be His name!

5
Long as I live my song shall tell
The wonders of His dying love;
And when at last I go to dwell
With Him His sovereign grace to prove,
My joy shall be
His face to see,
And bowing there with loud acclaim
I’ll praise Him—Blessed be His name!
Hymns 162


Calgary Songbook :162


1
With praise and thanksgiving
there stands a great throng
In the presence of Jesus
and sing this new song.
Unto Him Who hath loved us and
Washed us from sin,
Unto Him be the glory forever! Amen!

2
All these once were sinners,
defiled in His sight,
Now arrayed in pure garments,
in praise they unite.

3
He maketh the rebel
a priest and a king,
He hath bought us, and taught us
this new song to sing.

4
How helpless and hopeless
we sinners had been,
If He never had loved us
till cleansed from our sin.

5
Aloud in His praises
our voices shall ring,
So that others, believing,
this new song shall sing.


Calgary Songbook :166

Hymns 166

1
Praise to the Lord, the Almighty, the
King of creation!
O my soul, praise Him, for He is thy
health and salvation!
All ye who hear,
Now to His temple draw near;
Sing now in glad adoration!

2
Praise to the Lord, who o’er all
things so wondrously reigneth,
Who, as on wings of an eagle,
uplifteth, sustaineth.
Hast thou not seen
How thy desires all have been
Granted in what He ordaineth?

3
Praise to the Lord, who hath fearfully,
wondrously, made thee!
Health hath vouchsafed and, when
heedlessly falling, hath stayed thee.
What need or grief
Ever hath failed of relief?
Wings of His mercy did shade thee.

4
Praise to the Lord, who doth prosper
thy work and defend thee,
Who from the heavens the streams of
His mercy doth send thee.
Ponder anew
What the Almighty can do,
Who with His love doth befriend thee.

5
Praise to the Lord! Oh, let all that
is in me adore Him!
All that hath life and breath, come
now with praises before Him!
Let the Amen
Sound from His people again;
Gladly for aye we adore Him.
Hymns 172


Calgary Songbook :172


1
I cannot breathe enough of Thee,
O gentle breeze of love;
More fragrant than the myrtle tree
The Henna-flower is to me,
The Balm of Heaven above.

2
I cannot gaze enough on Thee,
Thou fairest of the Fair;
My heart is filled with ecstasy,
As in Thy face of radiancy
I see such beauty there.

3
I cannot yield enough to Thee,
My Savior, Master, Friend;
I do not wish to go out free,
But ever, always, willingly,
To serve Thee to the end.

4
I cannot sing enough of Thee,
The sweetest name on earth;
A note so full of melody
Comes from my heart so joyously,
And fills my soul with mirth.

5
I cannot speak enough of Thee,
I have so much to tell;
Thy heart it beats so tenderly
As Thou dost draw me close to Thee,
And whisper, "All is well."

Hymns 204 (new tune)

1
Gathered in Thy name, Lord Jesus,
Losing sight of all but Thee,
O what joy Thy presence gives us,
Calling up our hearts to Thee!                     

2
Loved with love which knows no measure,
Save the Father’s love to Thee,
Blessed Lord, our hearts would treasure
All the Father’s thoughts of Thee.

3
All His joy, His rest, His pleasure—
All His deep delight in Thee—
Lord, Thy heart alone can measure
What Thy Father found in Thee.

4
How He set His love upon Thee—
Called Thee His beloved Son;
Yet for us He did not spare Thee,
By Thy death our life was won.

5
O the joy, the wondrous singing,
When we see Thee as Thou art!
Thy blest name, Lord Jesus, bringing
Sweetest music to God’s heart.

6
Notes of gladness, songs unceasing,
Hymns of everlasting praise,
Psalms of glory, joy increasing,
Through God’s endless day of days.
Hymns 205


Calgary Songbook :205


1
Jesus, Thou Joy of loving hearts,
Thou Fount of life, Thou Light of men,
From the best bliss that earth imparts,
We turn unfilled to Thee again.

2
Thy truth unchanged hath ever stood;
Thou savest those that on Thee call;
To them that seek Thee, Thou art good,
To them that find Thee, all in all!

3
We taste Thee, O Thou living Bread,
And long to feast upon Thee still;
We drink of Thee, the Fountain-head,
And thirst our souls from Thee to fill!

4
Our restless spirits yearn for Thee,
Where’er our changeful lot is cast;
Glad when Thy gracious smile we see,
Blest, when our faith can hold Thee fast.

5
O Lord, be Thou our strength and stay!
Make all our moments calm and bright,
Chase all dark thoughts of sin away,
Shed o’er us here Thy holy light.


Calgary Songbook :206

Hymns 206

1
O Christ, He is the fountain,
The deep, sweet well of life:
Its living streams I’ve tasted
Which save from grief and strife.
And to an ocean fulness,
His mercy doth expand;
His grace is all-sufficient
As by His wisdom planned.

2
O I am my Beloved’s,
And my Beloved’s mine;
He brings a poor vile sinner
Into His house of wine!
I stand upon His merit;
I know no other stand.
I’m hidden in His presence
And held by His own hand.

3
The Bride eyes not her garment,
But her dear Bridegroom’s face;
I will not gaze at glory,
But on my King of grace:
Not at the crown He giveth,
But on His pierced hand;
The Lamb is all the glory,
And my eternal stand!
Hymns 208


Calgary Songbook :208


1
O Jesus, Jesus, dearest Lord!
Forgive me if I say,
For very love, Thy sacred name
A thousand times a day.                     
O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;
I rest in Thee, whate’er betide;
Thy gracious smile is my reward;
I love, I love Thee, Lord!

2
I love Thee so I know not how
My transports to control;
Thy love is like a burning fire
Within my very soul.
O Jesus, Lord, with me abide;
I rest in Thee, whate’er betide;
Thy gracious smile is my reward;
I love, I love Thee, Lord!

3
For Thou to me art all in all;
My honor and my wealth;
My heart’s desire, my body’s strength,
My soul’s eternal health.

4
Burn, burn, O love, within my heart,
Burn fiercely night and day,
Till all the dross of earthly loves
Is burned, and burned away.

5
O light in darkness, joy in grief,
O heaven’s life on earth;
Jesus, my love, my treasure, who
Can tell what Thou art worth?

6
What limit is there to this love?
Thy flight, where wilt Thou stay?
On, on! our Lord is sweeter far
Today than yesterday.


Calgary Songbook :250

Hymns 250

1
Spring up, well, with water;
Dig Thou, Lord, completely;
Dig away all barriers
That Thy stream flow through me.

2
Christ, the Rock, is riven;
Living water’s flowing;
But within my heart now
It is blocked from going.

3
I will dig by praying,
Dig the dirt entirely,
Thus release the Spirit,
Let the stream flow freely.

4
There’s no need again that
Christ, the Rock, be riven,
But unto the digging
That I should be given.

5
What I need most deeply
Is the Spirit’s filling,
That the living water
From my heart be welling.

6
Dig till there is nothing
Left to block the passage;
Dig until the stream flows
With the living message.

7
Spring up, well, with water;
Dig Thou, Lord, completely;
Dig away all barriers
That Thy stream flow through me.
Hymns 251


Calgary Songbook :251


1
Rivers of living water,
Rivers that flow from the throne,
Rivers o’erflowing with blessing,
Coming from Jesus alone.
Rivers of living water,
Rivers of life so free,
Flowing from Thee, my Savior,
Send now the rivers through me.

2
Whoso is thirsty come hither,
Here is abundant supply;
Water transparent as crystal,
Come without money and buy.

3
Cleanse me, oh, cleanse me, my Savior,
Make me a channel today;
Empty me, fill me and use me,
Teach me to trust and obey.

4
Then, and then only, Lord Jesus,
Through me the rivers can flow;
Thus and thus only will others
Learn Thy great fulness to know.

5
Now I surrender to Jesus,
Here I lay all at His feet:
Anything, anywhere only,
Just for His service made meet!


Calgary Songbook :255

Hymns 255

1
O Lord, breathe Thy Spirit on me,
Teach me how to breathe Thee in;
Help me pour into Thy bosom
All my life of self and sin.
I am breathing out my sorrow,
Breathing out my sin;
I am breathing, breathing, breathing,
All Thy fulness in.

2
I am breathing out my own life,
That I may be filled with Thine;
Letting go my strength and weakness,
Breathing in Thy life divine.

3
Breathing out my sinful nature,
Thou hast borne in all for me;
Breathing in Thy cleansing fulness,
Finding all my life in Thee.

4
I am breathing out my sorrow,
On Thy kind and gentle breast;
Breathing in Thy joy and comfort,
Breathing in Thy peace and rest.

5
I am breathing out my sickness,
Thou hast borne its burden too;
I am breathing in Thy healing,
Ever promised, ever new.

6
I am breathing out my longings
In Thy listening, loving ear;
I am breathing in Thy answers,
Stilling every doubt and fear.

7
I am breathing every moment,
Drawing all my life from Thee;
Breath by breath I live upon Thee,
Lord, Thy Spirit breathe in me.
Hymns 264


Calgary Songbook :264


1
Jesus, Thine all-victorious love
Shed in my soul abroad;
Then shall my heart no longer rove,
Rooted and fixed in God,
Rooted and fixed in God.

2
Oh, that in me the sacred fire
Might now begin to glow;
Burn up the dross of base desire,
And make the mountains flow,
And make the mountains flow.

3
He, who at Pentecost didst fall,
May He my sins consume;
Thy Holy Ghost, for Him I call;
Thy burning Spirit, come,
Thy burning Spirit, come.

4
Refining fire, go through my heart,
Illuminate my soul;
Scatter Thy life through every part,
And sanctify the whole,
And sanctify the whole.

5
My steadfast soul, from falling free,
Shall then no longer move,
While Christ is all the world to me,
And all my heart is love,
And all my heart is love.


Calgary Songbook :267

Hymns 267

1
Fill me with Thy gracious Spirit,
Fill my longing spirit now;
Fill me with Thy hallowed presence,
Come, dear Lord, and fill me now!
Fill me now! Fill me now!
Fill me with Thy Spirit now!
Strip me wholly, empty throughly,

2
Thou can’st fill me with Thy Spirit,
Though I cannot tell Thee how;
But I need Thee, greatly need Thee;
Come, dear Lord, and fill me now!

3
I am weakness, full of weakness;
At Thy sacred feet I bow;
By Thy blest, eternal Spirit,
Fill with strength, and fill me now!

4
Cleanse and comfort, bless and save me;
Fill my broken spirit now!
Thou art comforting and saving,
Thou art sweetly filling now.
Hymns 268


Calgary Songbook :268


1
How I praise Thee, precious Savior,
That Thy love laid hold of me;
Thou hast saved and cleansed and filled me,
That I might Thy channel be.
Channels only, blessed Master,
But with all Thy wondrous grace,
Flowing through us, Thou canst use us
Every hour in every place.                     

2
Just a channel, full of blessing,
To the thirsty hearts around;
To tell out Thy full salvation,
All Thy loving message sound.

3
Emptied that Thou shouldest fill me,
A clean vessel in Thine hand;
With no strength but as Thou givest
Graciously with each command.

4
Witnessing Thy grace to save me,
Setting free from self and sin;
Thou hast bought me to possess me,
In Thy fulness, Lord, come in.

5
O Lord, fill now with Thy Spirit
Hearts that full surrender know;
That the streams of living water
From our inner man may flow.
Hymns 284


Calgary Songbook :284


1
Loved with everlasting love,
Led by grace that love to know;
Spirit, breathing from above,
Thou hast taught me it is so.
Oh, this full and perfect peace!                     
Oh, this transport all divine!
In a love which cannot cease,
I am His, and He is mine.

2
Heaven above is softer blue,
Earth around is sweeter green;
Something lives in every hue
Christless eyes have never seen:
Birds with gladder songs o’erflow,
Flow’rs with deeper beauties shine,
Since I know, as now I know,
I am His, and He is mine.

3
Things that once were wild alarms                     
Cannot now disturb my rest;
Closed in everlasting arms,                     
Pillowed on the loving breast.
Oh, to lie forever here,
Doubt and care and self resign,
While He whispers in my ear,
I am His, and He is mine.

4
His forever, only His:
Who the Lord and me shall part?
Ah, with what a rest of bliss
Christ can fill the loving heart.
Heaven and earth may fade and flee
Firstborn light in gloom decline;
But, while God and I shall be,
I am His, and He is mine.


Calgary Songbook :298

Hymns 298

1
My hope is built on nothing less
Than Jesus Christ, my righteousness;
I dare not trust the sweetest frame,
But wholly lean on Jesus’ name.
On Christ, the solid Rock, I stand;
All other ground is sinking sand,
All other ground is sinking sand.

2
When darkness veils His lovely face,
I rest on His unchanging grace;
In every high and stormy gale,
My anchor holds within the veil.

3
His oath, His covenant, His blood,
Support me in the whelming flood;
When all around my soul gives way,
He then is all my hope and stay.

4
When He shall come with trumpet sound,
Oh, may I then in Him be found;
In Him, my righteousness, alone,
Faultless to stand before the throne.
Hymns 299


Calgary Songbook :299


1
A mind at perfect peace with God;
O what a word is this!
A sinner reconciled through blood;
This, this indeed is peace.

2
By nature and by practice far,
How very far from God;
Yet now by grace brought nigh to Him,
Through faith in Jesus’ blood.

3
So nigh, so very nigh to God,
I cannot nearer be;
For in the person of His Son
I am as near as He.

4
So dear, so very dear to God,
More dear I cannot be;
The love wherewith He loves the Son,
Such is His love to me.

5
Why should I ever anxious be,
Since such a God is mine?
He watches o’er me night and day,
And tells me “Mine is thine.”

1
Redeemed—how I love to proclaim it!
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
Redeemed through His infinite mercy,
His child, and forever, I am.                     
Redeemed, redeemed,
Redeemed by the blood of the Lamb;
His child, and forever, I am.

2
Redeemed and so happy in Jesus,
No language my rapture can tell;
I know that the light of His presence
With me doth continually dwell.

3
I think of my blessed Redeemer,
I think of Him all the day long;
I sing, for I cannot be silent;
His love is the theme of my song.

4
I know I shall see in His beauty
The King in whose way I delight;
Who lovingly guardeth my footsteps
And giveth me songs in the night.

1
Blessed assurance, Jesus is mine;
Oh, what a foretaste of glory divine!
Heir of salvation, purchase of God,
Born of His Spirit, washed in His blood.
This is my story, this is my song,
Praising my Savior all the day long.

2
Perfect submission, perfect delight,
Visions of rapture now burst on my sight;
Angels descending, bring from above
Echoes of mercy, whispers of love.

3
Perfect submission, all is at rest,
I in my Savior am happy and blessed;
Watching and waiting, looking above,
Filled with His goodness, lost in His love.

Hymns 309

1
What a wonderful change in my life has been wrought
Since Jesus came into my heart!
I have light in my soul for which long I had sought,
Since Jesus came into my heart!                     
Floods of joy o’er my soul like the sea billows roll,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

2
I have ceased from my wand’ring and going astray,
And my sins which were many are all washed away,

3
I’m possessed of a hope that is steadfast and sure,
Since Jesus came into my heart!
And no dark clouds of doubt now my pathway obscure,

4
There’s a light in the valley of death now for me,
And the gates of the City beyond I can see,
Since Jesus came into my heart!

5
I shall go there to dwell in that City I know,
And I’m happy, so happy as onward I go,
Hymns 310


Calgary Songbook :310


1
Once I was bound by sin’s galling fetters,
Chained like a slave I struggled in vain;
But I received a glorious freedom,
When Jesus broke my fetters in twain.
Glorious freedom, wonderful freedom,
No more in chains of sin I repine!
Jesus the glorious Emancipator,
Now and forever He shall be mine.

2
Freedom from all the carnal affections,
Freedom from envy, hatred and strife;
Freedom from vain and worldly ambitions,
Freedom from all that saddened my life.

3
Freedom from pride and all sinful follies,
Freedom from love and glitter of gold;
Freedom from evil temper and anger,
Glorious freedom, rapture untold.

4
Freedom from fear with all of its torments,
Freedom from care with all of its pain;
Freedom in Christ my blessed Redeemer,
He who has rent my fetters in twain.
Hymns 313


Calgary Songbook :313


1
Amazing grace! how sweet the sound,
That saved a wretch like me!                     
I once was lost, but now am found,
Was blind, but now I see.

2
’Twas grace that taught my heart to fear,
And grace my fears relieved;
How precious did that grace appear
The hour I first believed!

3
The Lord hath promised good to me,
His word my hope secures;
He will my shield and portion be
As long as life endures.

4
When we’ve been there ten thousand years,
Bright shining as the sun,
We’ve no less days to sing God’s praise
Than when we first begun.


Calgary Songbook :317

Hymns 317

1
Dear Savior, Thou art mine,
How sweet the thought to me;
Let me repeat Thy name,
And lift my heart to Thee.
Mine! Mine! Mine!
I know Thou art mine;
Savior, dear Savior,
I know Thou art mine.

2
Thou art the sinner’s friend,
So I Thy friendship claim,
A sinner saved by grace,
When Thy sweet message came.

3
My hardened heart was touched;
Thy pard’ning voice I heard;
And joy and peace came in
While list’ning to Thy word.

4
So let me sing Thy praise,
So let me call Thee mine.
I cannot doubt Thy word,
I know that I am Thine.
Hymns 322


Calgary Songbook :322


1
Many weary years I vainly sought a spring,
One that never would run dry;
Unavailing all that earth to me could bring,
Nothing seemed to satisfy.
Drinking at the Fountain that never runs dry,
Drinking at the Fountain of life am I;
Finding joy and pleasure
In abounding measure,
I am drinking at the Fountain of life.

2
Through the desert land of sin I roam no more,
For I find a living Spring,
And my cup of gladness now is running o’er,
Jesus is my Lord and King.

3
Here is sweet contentment as the days go by.
Here is holy peace and rest;
Here is consolation as the moments fly,
Here my heart is always blest.

4
Here I find a never ending, sure supply.
While the endless ages roll;
To this healing Fountain I would ever fly,
There to bathe my weary soul.
Hymns 323 (new tune)


Calgary Songbook :323


1
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
“Come unto Me, and rest;
Lay down, thou weary one, lay down
Thy head upon My breast.”
I came to Jesus as I was,
Weary, and worn, and sad;
I found in Him a resting-place,
And He has made me glad.

2
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
“Behold, I freely give
The living water: thirsty one,
Stoop down, and drink, and live.”
I came to Jesus, and I drank
Of that life-giving stream;
My thirst was quenched, my soul revived,
And now I live in Him.

3
I heard the voice of Jesus say,
“I am this dark world’s Light;
Look unto Me, thy morn shall rise,
And all thy day be bright.”
I looked to Jesus, and I found
In Him my Star, my Sun;
And in that Light of life I’ll walk
Till trav’lling days are done.


Calgary Songbook :325

Hymns 325

1
All my life long I had panted
For a draught from some cool spring,
That I hoped would quench the burning
Of the thirst I felt within.
Hallelujah! I have found Him
Whom my soul so long has craved!
Jesus satisfies my longings;
Through His life I now am saved.

2
Feeding on the husks around me,
Till my strength was almost gone,
Longed my soul for something better,
Only still to hunger on.

3
Poor I was, and sought for riches,
Something that would satisfy,
But the dust I gathered round me
Only mocked my soul’s sad cry.

4
Well of water, ever springing,
Bread of life, so rich and free,
Untold wealth that never faileth,
My Redeemer is to me.
Hymns 348


Calgary Songbook :348


1
Since Christ my soul from sin set free,
This life has been a joy to me;                     
And ’mid earth’s sorrows and its woe,
’Tis joy my Jesus here to know.
O hallelujah, yes, ’tis joy!
For it is Christ that I enjoy!
On land or sea, what matters where?
Where Jesus is, my joy is there.

2
The earth was once a bitter place
Till Jesus showed His smiling face;
Now joy’s begun within my soul,
’Twill last while endless ages roll.

3
What matters where on earth we dwell?
On mountain top, or in the dell,
In cottage, or a mansion fair,
Where Jesus is, my joy is there.
Hymns 350


Calgary Songbook :350


1
My goal is God Himself, not joy, nor peace,
Nor even blessing, but Himself, my God;
’Tis His to lead me there—not mine, but His—
At any cost, dear Lord, by any road.

2
So faith bounds forward to its goal in God,
And love can trust her Lord to lead her there;
Upheld by Him, my soul is following hard
Till God hath full fulfilled my deepest prayer.

3
No matter if the way be sometimes dark,
No matter though the cost be oft-times great,
He knoweth how I best shall reach the mark,
The way that leads to Him must needs be strait.

4
One thing I know, I cannot say Him nay;
One thing I do, I press towards my Lord;
My God my glory here, from day to day,
And in the glory there my great Reward.


Calgary Songbook :371

Hymns 371

1
I need Thee every hour,
Most gracious Lord;
No tender voice like Thine
Can peace afford.
I need Thee, oh, I need Thee;
Every hour I need Thee;
Oh, bless me now, my Savior!
I come to Thee.

2
I need Thee every hour,
Stay Thou near by;
Temptations lose their power
When Thou art nigh.

3
I need Thee every hour,
In joy or pain;
Come quickly and abide,
Or life is vain.

4
I need Thee every hour,
Teach me Thy will;
And Thy rich promises
In me fulfill.

5
I need Thee every hour,
Most Holy One;
Oh, make me Thine indeed,
Thou blessed Son.
Hymns 373


Calgary Songbook :373


1
Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Let me Thy glory see,
Draw my soul close to Thee,
Then speak in love to me—
Nothing between. Nothing between.

2
Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Let not earth’s din and noise
Stifle Thy still small voice;
In it let me rejoice—
Nothing between. Nothing between.

3
Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Nothing of earthly care,
Nothing of tear or prayer,
No robe that self may wear—
Nothing between. Nothing between.

4
Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Unbelief disappear,
Vanish each doubt and fear,
Fading when Thou art near—
Nothing between. Nothing between.

5
Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Shine with unclouded ray,
Chasing each mist away,
O’er my whole heart bear sway—
Nothing between. Nothing between.

6
Nothing between, Lord, nothing between;
Thus may I walk with Thee,
Thee only may I see,
Thine only let me be—
Nothing between. Nothing between.

Hymns 378

1
Savior, lead me up the mountain,
Where the Lord alone is seen,
Where we hear the voice from heaven,
Where the air is pure and clean.
Lead me higher up the mountain,
Give me fellowship with Thee:
In Thy light I see the fountain,
And the blood it cleanses me.

2
Higher up where light increases,
Far above all earthly strife,
Where the strain of effort ceases,
Where in Christ we reign in Life.

3
Savior, keep me up the mountain
Pressing on toward the goal,
Till, as one, we share Thine image,
And Thy love and grace extol.
Hymns 383


Calgary Songbook :383


1
My stubborn will at last hath yielded;
I would be Thine, and Thine alone,
And this the prayer my lips are bringing,
“Lord, let in me Thy will be done.”
Sweet will of God, still fold me closer,
Till I am wholly lost in Thee;
Till I am wholly lost in Thee.                     

2
I’m tired of sin, footsore and weary,
The darksome path hath dreary grown,
But now a light has ris’n to cheer me;
I find in Thee my Star, my Sun.

3
Thy precious will, O conqu’ring Savior,
Doth now embrace and compass me;
All discords hushed, my peace a river,
My soul a prisoned bird set free.

4
Shut in with Thee, O Lord, forever,
My wayward feet no more to roam;
What pow’r from Thee my soul can sever?
The center of God’s will my home.


Calgary Songbook :389

Hymns 389

1
Lord Jesus, I long in Thy presence to live,
From morning to evening my one world Thou art;
O let not my heart be contented or rest
When loving or seeking what with Thee doth part.
Each moment, each day, throughout suff’ring and pain,
When nought in the world can give comfort or cheer,
When sighing and weeping encompasses me,
Lord, still all my sighing and wipe every tear.

2
Each time when I dream of the goodness of life,
I pray Thee, dear Lord, that Thou in it may be;
O do not allow me to choose by myself,
Nor seek any pleasure that’s other than Thee.
Each night when alone in the stillness I lie,
I pray Thee, Lord Jesus, that Thou wilt be near;
Each morning ere dawn comes, while still in my sleep,
Then whispering call me and open my ear.

3
Each time, Lord when reading in Thy holy Word,
I pray that Thy glory may shine on each line,
That clearly I’ll see what a Savior I have
And how great salvation that Thou hast made mine.
When helpless I come, Lord, to kneel at Thy throne,
I pray Thee to hear me and grant me Thy grace;
If thru my shortcomings Thou hear not my prayer,
Withdraw not Thy presence, O hide not Thy face.

4
Each time when of heavenly blessings I think,
O let my heart long to be raptured to Thee;
My only hope here is Thy coming again,
My only joy there, Lord, Thy presence will be.
Lord, teach me each day in Thy presence to live,
From morning to evening my one world Thou art;
O let not my heart be contented or rest
When loving or seeking what with Thee doth part.

Calgary Songbook :394


1
Unto him that hath Thou givest
Ever more abundantly;
Lord, I live because Thou livest,
Therefore give more life to me,
Therefore speed me in the race,
Therefore let me grow in grace.

2
Deepen all Thy work, O Master,
Strengthen every downward root;
Only do Thou ripen faster,
More and more Thy pleasant fruit;
Purge me, prune me, self abase;
Only let me grow in grace.

3
Let me grow by sun and shower,
Every moment water me;
Make me really, hour by hour,
More and more conformed to Thee,
That Thy loving eye may trace
Day by day my growth in grace.

4
From Thy fulness grace outpouring,
Show me ever greater things;
Raise me higher, sunward soaring,
Mounting as on eagle-wings.
By the brightness of Thy face,
Ever let me grow in grace.

5
Let me, then, be always growing,
Never, never standing still,
Listening, learning, better knowing
Thee and Thy most blessed will.
Till I win the glorious race,
Daily let me grow in grace.


Calgary Songbook :395

Hymns 395

1
O Jesus Christ, grow Thou in me,
And all things else recede;
My heart be daily nearer Thee
From sin be daily freed.
Each day let Thy supporting might
My weakness still embrace;
My darkness vanish in Thy light,
Thy life my death efface.

2
In Thy bright beams which on me fall,
Fade every evil thought;
That I am nothing, Thou art all,
I would be daily taught.

3
More of Thy glory let me see
Thou Holy, Wise, and True;
I would Thy living image be,
In joy and sorrow too.

4
Fill me with gladness from above,
Hold me by strength divine;
Lord, let the glow of Thy great love
Through all my being shine.

5
Make this poor self grow less and less,
Be Thou my life and aim;
Oh, make me daily through Thy grace
More meet to bear Thy name.
Hymns 396


Calgary Songbook :396


1
I’m pressing on the upward way,
New heights I’m gaining every day;
Still praying as I onward bound,
“Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.”
Lord, lift me up, and let me stand
By faith on Canaan’s tableland;
A higher plane than I have found,
Lord, plant my feet on higher ground.

2
My heart has no desire to stay
Where doubts arise and fears dismay;
Though some may dwell where these abound,
My prayer, my aim, is higher ground.

3
I want to live above the world,
Though Satan’s darts at me are hurled;
For faith has caught the joyful sound,
The song of saints on higher ground.

4
I want to scale the utmost height
And catch a gleam of glory bright;
But still I’ll pray till rest I’ve found,
“Lord, lead me on to higher ground.”


Calgary Songbook :403

Hymns 403

1
Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,
For my very life art Thou;
Thee I take to all my problems
As the full solution now.
Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,
In all things Thy will be done;
I but a transparent vessel
To make visible the Son.

2
Consecrated is Thy temple,
Purged from every stain and sin;
May Thy flame of glory now be
Manifested from within.
Let the earth in solemn wonder
See my body willingly
Offered as Thy slave obedient,
Energized alone by Thee.

3
Every moment, every member,
Girded, waiting Thy command;
Underneath the yoke to labor
Or be laid aside as planned.
When restricted in pursuing,
No disquiet will beset;
Underneath Thy faithful dealing
Not a murmur or regret.

4
Ever tender, quiet, restful,
Inclinations put away,
That Thou may for me choose freely
As Thy finger points the way.
Live Thyself, Lord Jesus, through me,
For my very life art Thou;
Thee I take to all my problems
As the full solution now.
Hymns 426


Calgary Songbook :426


1
Remove my covering, Lord,
That I may see Thy light,
And be deceived no more,
But all things see aright,
Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,
Scatter all my night, Lord,
And everything make bright, Lord,
For this I pray to Thee.

2
I hardly know myself;
Deceived so much by pride,
I often think I’m right
And am self-satisfied.
Oh, may Thy living light, Lord,                     
Scatter all my night, Lord,
And everything make bright, Lord,
For this I pray to Thee.

3
I know Thee even less;
In doctrine, shallowly;
True revelation lack
Of Thy reality.

4
As for Thy life within,
In darkness I mistake—
If spirit or the flesh,
One for the other take.

5
As for Thy way, O Lord,
I often am not clear;
I toward seclusion tend
And from the pathway veer.

6
As for Thy will for me,
I do not know it well;
I substitute my own
And often would rebel.

7
As for the church,
I need Thy revelation more
The Body-life to know,
Thy wisdom to explore.

8
I long to be unveiled,
In everything made clear,
No more to be deceived
Or to my pride adhere.
Hymns 431 (new tune)


Calgary Songbook :431


1
Thy mighty love, O God, constraineth me,                     
As some strong tide it presseth on its way,                     
Seeking a channel in my self-bound soul,                     
Yearning to sweep all barriers away.                     

2
Shall I not yield to that constraining power?
Shall I not say, O tide of love, flow in?
My God, Thy gentleness hath conquered me,
Life cannot be as it hath hither been.

3
Break through my nature, mighty, heavenly love,
Clear every avenue of thought and brain,
Flood my affections, purify my will,
Let nothing but Thine own pure life remain.

4
Thus wholly mastered and possessed by God,
Forth from my life, spontaneous and free,
Shall flow a stream of tenderness and grace,
Loving, because God loved, eternally.
Hymns 432


Calgary Songbook :432


1
O Love, that wilt not let me go,
I rest my weary soul in Thee;
I give Thee back the life I owe,
That in Thine ocean depths its flow
May richer, fuller be.

2
O Light, that followest all my way,
I yield my flickering torch to Thee;
My heart restores its borrowed ray,
That in Thy sunshine’s blaze its day
May brighter, fairer be.                     

3
O Joy, that seekest me through pain,
I cannot close my heart to Thee;
I trace the rainbow through the rain,
And feel the promise is not vain
That morn shall tearless be.

4
O Cross, that liftest up my head,
I dare not ask to fly from Thee;
I lay in dust life’s glory dead,
And from the ground there blossoms red
Life that shall endless be.


Calgary Songbook :433

Hymns 433

1
I am the Lord’s! O joy beyond expression,
O sweet response to voice of love Divine;
Faith’s joyous “Yes” to the assuring whisper,
“Fear not! I have redeemed thee; thou art Mine.”

2
I am the Lord’s! It is the glad confession
Wherewith the Bride recalls the happy day,
When love’s “I will” accepted Him forever,
“The Lord’s,” to love, to honor and obey.

3
I am the Lord’s! Yet teach me all it meaneth,
All it involves of love and loyalty,
Of holy service, absolute surrender,
And unreserved obedience unto Thee.

4
I am the Lord’s! Yes; body, soul, and spirit,
O seal them irrecoverably Thine;
As Thou, Beloved, in Thy grace and fulness
Forever and forevermore art mine.
Hymns 434


Calgary Songbook :434


1
Lord, Thou hast won, at length I yield;
My heart by mighty grace compelled
Surrenders all to Thee;
Against Thy terrors long I strove,
But who can stand against Thy love?                     
Love conquers even me.                     

2
If Thou hadst bid Thy thunders roll,
And light’nings flash, to blast my soul,
I still had stubborn been;
But mercy has my heart subdued,
A bleeding Savior I have viewed,
And now I hate my sin.

3
Now, Lord, I would be Thine alone,
Come, take possession of Thine own,
For Thou hast set me free;
Released from Satan’s hard command,
See all my powers waiting stand,
To be employed by Thee.
Thou hast won, at length I yield.
Hymns 435


Calgary Songbook :435


1
Oh, the bitter shame and sorrow,
That a time could ever be,
When I let the Savior’s pity
Plead in vain, and proudly answered,
All of self, and none of Thee,
All of self, and none of Thee.

2
Yet He found me; I beheld Him
Bleeding on the cursed tree;
Heard Him pray, Forgive them, Father.
And my wistful heart said faintly,
Some of self, and some of Thee,
Some of self, and some of Thee.

3
Day by day His tender mercy,
Healing, helping, full and free,
Sweet and strong, and ah! so patient,
Brought me lower while I whispered,
Less of self, and more of Thee,
Less of self, and more of Thee.

4
Higher than the highest heavens,
Deeper than the deepest sea,
Lord, Thy love at last hath conquered;
Grant me now my heart’s petition,
None of self, and all of Thee,
None of self, and all of Thee.


Calgary Songbook :437

Hymns 437

1
Hast thou heard Him, seen Him, known Him?                     
Is not thine a captured heart?                     
Chief among ten thousand own Him;
Joyful choose the better part.
Captivated by His beauty,                     
Worthy tribute haste to bring;                     
Let His peerless worth constrain thee,
Crown Him now unrivaled King.                     

2
Idols once they won thee, charmed thee,
Lovely things of time and sense;
Gilded thus does sin disarm thee,
Honeyed lest thou turn thee thence.

3
What has stripped the seeming beauty
From the idols of the earth?
Not a sense of right or duty,
But the sight of peerless worth.

4
Not the crushing of those idols,
With its bitter void and smart;
But the beaming of His beauty,
The unveiling of His heart.

5
Who extinguishes their taper
Till they hail the rising sun?
Who discards the garb of winter
Till the summer has begun?

6
’Tis that look that melted Peter,
’ Tis that face that Stephen saw,
’Tis that heart that wept with Mary,
Can alone from idols draw:

7
Draw and win and fill completely,
Till the cup o’erflow the brim;
What have we to do with idols
Who have companied with Him?
Hymns 438


Calgary Songbook :438


1
I’ve turned my back upon the world
With all its idle pleasures,
And set my heart on better things,
On higher, holier treasures;
No more its glitter and its glare,
And vanity shall blind me;
I’ve crossed the separating line,
And left the world behind me.
Far, far behind me!

2
I’ve left the old sad life of sin,
Its follies all forsaken;
My standing place is now in Christ,
His holy vows I’ve taken;
Beneath the standard of the cross
The world henceforth shall find me;
I’ve passed in Christ from death to life,
And left the world behind me.
Far, far behind me!

3
My soul shall ne’er return again
Back to its former station.
For here alone is perfect peace.
And rest from condemnation;
I’ve made exchange of masters now,
The vows of glory bind me,
And once for all I’ve left the world.
Yes, left the world behind me.
Far, far behind me!
And once for all I’ve left the world,

4
My choice is made forevermore,
I want no other Savior;
I ask no purer happiness
Than His sweet love and favor;
My heart is fixed on Jesus Christ,
No more the world shall blind me;
I’ve crossed the Red Sea of His death,
And left the world behind me.
Far, far behind me!
Hymns 441


Calgary Songbook :441


1
All to Jesus I surrender,
All to Him I freely give;
I will ever love and trust Him,
In His presence daily live.
I surrender all,
I surrender all.
All to Thee, my blessed Savior,

2
All to Jesus I surrender,
Humbly at His feet I bow,
Worldly pleasures all forsaken;
Take me, Jesus, take me now.

3
All to Jesus I surrender,
Make me, Savior, wholly Thine;
Let me feel Thy Holy Spirit,
Truly know that Thou art mine.

4
All to Jesus I surrender,
Lord, I give myself to Thee;
Fill me with Thy love and power,
Let Thy blessing fall on me.

5
All to Jesus I surrender,
Now I feel the sacred flame.
Oh, the joy of full salvation!
Glory, glory to His name!

1
Take my life and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
Take my moments and my days,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.

2
Take my hands, and let them move
At the impulse of Thy love;
Take my feet and let them be
Swift and beautiful for Thee,
Swift and beautiful for Thee.

Take my voice, and let me sing
Always, only, for my King;
Take my lips, and let them be
Filled with messages from Thee,
Filled with messages from Thee.

4
Take my silver and my gold;
Not a mite would I withhold;
Take my intellect, and use
Every power as Thou shalt choose,
Every power as Thou shalt choose.

5
Take my will, and make it Thine;
It shall be no longer mine.
Take my heart; it is Thine own;
It shall be Thy royal throne,
It shall be Thy royal throne.

6
Take my love; my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure-store.
Take myself, and I will be
Ever, only, all for Thee,
Ever, only, all for Thee.

Hymns 456

1
Living for Jesus a life that is true,
Striving to please Him in all that I do;
Yielding allegiance, glad-hearted and free,
This is the pathway of blessing for me.
O Jesus Lord and Savior,
I give myself to Thee,
For Thou in Thy redemption,
Didst give Thyself for me;
I own no other Master,
My heart shall be Thy throne,
My life I give, henceforth to live,
O Christ, for Thee alone.

2
Living for Jesus who died in my place,
Bearing on Calv’ry my sin and disgrace;
Such love constrains me to answer His call,
Follow His leading and give Him my all.

3
Living for Jesus wherever I am,
Doing each duty in His holy name;
Willing to suffer affliction and loss,
Deeming each trial a part of my cross.

4
Living for Jesus through earth’s little while,
My dearest treasure, the light of His smile;
Seeking the lost ones He died to redeem,
Bringing the weary to find rest in Him.
Hymns 471


Calgary Songbook :471


1
How can I ever stay away
And grieve Thy Spirit all the day
While Thou dost wait for me?
I now am willing to return,
And wait no longer, for I yearn
Henceforth to follow Thee.

2
I offer now without reserve
All that I am and all I have
Thy purpose to fulfill.
Oh, may the Lord accept and keep,
That henceforth I may only seek
To do the Father’s will.

3
When I look back, what grief and shame
That I’ve brought none to trust Thy name,
Thy word I’ve locked within.
Oh, may the Lord anointing give
And richly through my being live,
That I may speak of Him.

4
My gracious Lord has giv’n much grace,
Exceeding e’en a friend my place;
I fain would be His bride.
I’d share His life and suffer loss,
Accepting willingly the cross,
With Him identified.


Calgary Songbook :473

Hymns 473

1
No mortal tongue can e’er describe
The freedom of the soul,
When passed beyond all earthly bribe
To God’s complete control.
All things are his, yes, life, and death,
Things present or to come;
In Christ he draws in peace each breath,
In Christ he finds his home.

2
When such as we the King can choose,
To share with Him His throne,
’Tis passing strange that we refuse
To be our Lord’s alone.
O never speak of sacrifice!
A privilege untold
Is to be His at any price,
In Calv’ry’s hosts enrolled.

3
Arise! the holy bargain strike—
The fragment for the whole—
All men and all events alike
Must serve the ransomed soul.
All things are yours when you are His,
And He and you are one;
A boundless life in Him there is,
Whence doubt and fear are gone.
Hymns 481


Calgary Songbook :481


1
Crucified with Christ my Savior,
To the world and self and sin;
To the death-born life of Jesus
I am sweetly ent’ring in:
In His fellowship of suff’ring,
To His death conformed to be,
I am going with my Savior
All the way to Calvary.
All the way to Calvary,
Where my Savior went for me,
Help me, Lord, to go with Thee,
All the way to Calvary.

2
’Tis not hard to die with Christ
When His risen life we know;
’Tis not hard to share His suff’rings
When our hearts with joy o’erflow.
In His resurrection power
He has come to dwell in me,
And my heart is gladly going
All the way to Calvary.

3
If we die we’ll live with Christ,
If we suffer we shall reign;
Only thus the prize of glory
Can the conqueror attain.
Oh, how sweet, on that glad morning
Should the Master say to thee,
“Yes, my child, thou didst go with me
All the way to Calvary.”

Hymns 493

1
O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now
That gives us life and quickens us,
With all Thy riches strengthening,
O how divine and glorious!

2
Lord, Thou art the Spirit now
That with Thy power liberates;
And by Thy liberation true
The law of life now regulates.

3
O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now
That transforms us and saturates,
And to Thine image true conforms
And with Thy light illuminates.

4
O Lord, Thou art the Spirit now
Who in my spirit makes His home;
He mingles with my spirit too,
And both one spirit thus become.

5
Lord, teach me how to exercise
My spirit now to contact Thee,
That in Thy Spirit I may walk
And live by Thy reality.
Hymns 497


Calgary Songbook :497


1
Grace in its highest definition is
God in the Son to be enjoyed by us;
It is not only something done or giv’n,
But God Himself, our portion glorious.

2
God is incarnate in the flesh that we
Him may receive, experience ourself;
This is the grace which we receive of God,
Which comes thru Christ and which is Christ Himself.

3
Paul the Apostle counted all as dung,
’Twas only God in Christ he counted grace;
’Tis by this grace—the Lord experienced—
That he surpassed the others in the race.

4
It is this grace—Christ as our inward strength—
Which with His all-sufficiency doth fill;
It is this grace which in our spirit is,
There energizing, working out God’s will.

5
This grace, which is the living Christ Himself,
Is what we need and must experience;
Lord, may we know this grace and by it live,
Thyself increasingly as grace to sense.

1
This is my wonderful story,
Christ to my heart has come;
Jesus, the King of Glory,
Finds in my heart a home.
Christ in me, Christ in you, Christ in us!
O wonderful story,
The hope of glory.

2
Was there e’er story so moving,
Story of love and pain;
Was there e’er Bridegroom so loving,
Seeking our hearts to gain.

3
I am so glad I received Him,
Jesus my heart’s dear King;
I who so often have grieved Him,
All to His feet would bring.

4
How can I ever be lonely,
How can I ever fall;
What can I want, if only
Christ is my all in all?

5
Now in His bosom confiding,
This my glad song shall be;
I am in Christ abiding,
And Christ abides in me.

Hymns 499

1
Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!
The Christ who’s all within me lives.
With Him I have been crucified;
This glorious fact to me He gives.
Now it’s no longer I that live,
But Christ the Lord within me lives.

2
Oh, what a joy! Oh, what a rest!
Christ now is being formed in me.
His very nature and life divine
In my whole being inwrought shall be.
All that I am came to an end,
And all of Christ is all to me.
(Repeat the last two lines of each stanza)    

3
Oh, what a thought! Oh, what a boast!
Christ shall in me be magnified.
In nothing shall I be ashamed,
For He in all shall be applied.
In woe or blessing, death or life,
Through me shall Christ be testified.

4
Oh, what a prize! Oh, what a gain!
Christ is the goal toward which I press.
Nothing I treasure, nor aught desire,
But Christ of all-inclusiveness.
My hope, my glory, and my crown
Is Christ, the one of peerlessness.
Hymns 501


Calgary Songbook :501


1
O glorious Christ, Savior mine,
Thou art truly radiance divine;
God infinite, in eternity,
Yet man in time, finite to be.
Oh! Christ, expression of God, the Great,
Inexhaustible, rich, and sweet!
God mingled with humanity
Lives in me my all to be.

2
The fulness of God dwells in Thee;
Thou dost manifest God’s glory;
In flesh Thou hast redemption wrought;
As Spirit, oneness with me sought.

3
All things of the Father are Thine;
All Thou art in Spirit is mine;
The Spirit makes Thee real to me,
That Thou experienced might be.

4
The Spirit of life causes Thee
By Thy Word to transfer to me.
Thy Spirit touched, Thy word received,
Thy life in me is thus conceived.

5
In spirit while gazing on Thee,
As a glass reflecting Thy glory,
Like to Thyself transformed I’ll be,
That Thou might be expressed through me.

6
In no other way could we be
Sanctified and share Thy vict’ry;
Thus only spiritual we’ll be
And touch the life of glory.

7
Thy Spirit will me saturate,
Every part will God permeate,
Deliv’ring me from the old man,
With all saints building for His plan.

There’s a Man in the glory
Whose Life is for me.
He’s pure and He’s holy,
Triumphant and free.
He’s wise and He’s loving,
How tender is He!

Whose Life is for me.
In Him is no sickness;

How buoyant is He!
His Life in the glory,
My life may be;
My life may be.

4
There’s a Man in the glory
Whose Life is for me.
His peace is abiding;
How patient is He!
He’s joyful and radiant,
Expecting to see
His Life in the glory,
Lived out in me;
Lived out in me.

1
Once far from God and dead in sin,
No light my heart could see;
But in God’s Word the light I found,
Now Christ liveth in me.
Christ liveth in me,
Christ liveth in me;
Oh! What a salvation this,
That Christ liveth in me.

2
As rays of light from yonder sun,
The flow’rs of earth set free,
So life and light and love come forth
From Christ living in me.

3
As lives the flow’r within the seed,
As in the cone the tree,
So, praise the Christ of truth and grace,
His Spirit dwelleth in me.

4
With longing all my heart is filled,
That like Him I may be,
As on the wondrous thought I dwell
That Christ liveth in me.

1
A flowing river and a tree,
Eden’s outstanding features are,
Man to supply with food and drink
That he may live fore’er.                     
God is in Christ to be my supply,
God as the Spirit nourisheth me;
If upon Christ in spirit I feed,
Filled with His life I’ll be.

2
The tree the glorious Christ does show,
As living food to man supplied,
That he God’s riches may enjoy,
Thus to be satisfied.

3
The river does the Spirit show,
Coming man’s spirit to supply,
That with God’s riches he be filled,
Holy to be thereby.

4
The Christ of glory is my life,
He as the Spirit lives in mine,
That I with God be fully blent
And in His image shine.

5
I would exalt this glorious Christ,
Ever the Spirit I’d obey,
Making His glory fully known,
Filled with His grace for aye.

Hymns 513

1
Once it was the blessing,
Now it is the Lord;
Once it was the feeling,
Now it is His Word;
Once His gift I wanted,
Now, the Giver own;
Once I sought for healing,
Now Himself alone.
All in all forever,
Only Christ I’ll sing;
Everything is in Christ,
And Christ is everything.

2
Once ’twas busy planning,
Now ’tis trustful prayer;
Once ’twas anxious caring,
Now He has the care;
Once ’twas what I wanted,
Now what Jesus says;
Once ’twas constant asking,
Now ’tis ceaseless praise.

3
Once it was my working,
His it hence shall be;
Once I tried to use Him,
Now He uses me;
Once the pow’r I wanted,
Now the Mighty One;
Once for self I labored,
Now for Him alone.

4
Once I hoped in Jesus,
Now I know He’s mine;
Once my lamps were dying,
Now they brightly shine;
Once for death I waited,
Now His coming hail;
And my hopes are anchored
Safe within the veil.

There is One amid all changes
Who standeth ever fast,
One who covers all the future,
The present and the past;
It is Christ the Rock of Ages,
The first and the last,
The first and the last.
Jesus is the first,
Jesus is the last,
Trust Him for thy future,
Leave with Him the past;
Jesus is the first,
Jesus is the last,
Christ the Rock of Ages,
The first and the last.

2
There is One whose arms upholdeth
This whole creation vast,
Yet He bids us on His bosom
Our cares and sorrows cast;
Let us bring them all to Jesus,
The first and the last,
The first and the last.

3
There is One whose love has kept us
Through every stormy blast,
And His hand will guard and guide us
Till all the storms are past;
Jesus, we will trust Thee ever,
The first and the last,
The first and the last.

4
First and last, O Christ, we crown Thee,
Our fondest love Thou hast;
Lord of lords, before Thy footstool
Let every crown be cast;
Haste the day when all shall crown Thee,
The first and the last,
The first and the last.

1
I thank Thee, Lord, that Thou hast shown,
And I begin to see,
What Thou canst be to all Thine own,
What they may be to Thee;
If only they will yield Thee all,                     
And trustingly obey Thy call.                     

2
How wonderful! I never knew
That I might trust Thee so;
That Thou wouldst be so much to me,
In all the way I go,
That every need Thou wouldst supply,
And all my longings satisfy.

3
I take Thee as my keeper now,
And I commit to Thee
My soul, my way, my works, my cause,
In Thy sole charge to be;
And my deposit, Thou, I know
Wilt guard secure from every foe.

4
I take Thee for my peace, O Lord,
My heart to keep and fill,
Thine own great calm, amid earth’s storms
Shall keep me always still;
And as Thy kingdom doth increase,
So shall Thine ever-deep’ning peace.

5
I take Thee as my wisdom too,
For wisdom’s sum Thou art;
Thou, who dost choose the foolish things,
Set me henceforth apart,
That I may speak and work for Thee
As Thou shalt work and speak in me.

6
I take Thee, Lord, to be my all,
Since all Thou art is mine;
I nothing have, and nothing am;
That nothing, Lord, is Thine.
Thou shalt be everything to me,
In all things my sufficiency.

1
I have come to the Fountain of Life,
A fountain that flows from above;
I have passed from the waters of strife
And come to the Elim of love;
I have drunk of the heavenly well,
In the depths of my being it springs.
No mortal can measure or tell
The gladness the Comforter brings.
Oh, come to the Fountain of Life,
The fountain that never runs dry;
Oh, drink of the boundless supply,
For Christ is the Fountain of Life.

2
I have come to the Fountain of Blood
That for guilt and uncleanness doth flow;
I have washed in its sin-cleansing flood
And my garments are whiter than snow.
I count not my righteousness mine—
’Tis Jesus that lives in my soul.
I partake of His nature divine,
And in Him I am perfectly whole.

3
I have come to the Fountain of Health,
A boundless and endless supply;
’Tis a secret man’s wisdom or wealth
Can never discover or buy.
But the secret my Lord hath revealed
In the fountain that flows from His side,
In the stripes by whose pain we are healed,
In Himself as He comes to abide.

4
I have come to the Fountain of Joy;
His joy is the strength of my heart.
My delight is unmixed with alloy,
My sunshine can never depart.
The fig tree may wither and die,
Earth’s pleasures and prospects decline;
But my fountains can never be dry—
My portion, my joy is divine.

O Lord, Thou art in me as life
And everything to me!
Subjective and available,
Thus I experience Thee.                     
O Lord, Thou art the Spirit!
How dear and near to me!                     
How I admire Thy marvelous
Availability!

2
To all my needs both great and small
Thou art the rich supply;
So ready and sufficient too
For me now to apply.

3
Thy sweet anointing with Thy might
In weakness doth sustain;
By Thy supply of energy
My strength Thou dost maintain.

4
Thy law of life in heart and mind
My conduct regulates;
The wealth of Thy reality
My being saturates.

5
O Thou art ever one with me.
Unrivaled unity!
One spirit with me all the time
For all eternity!

O the riches of my Savior,
So unsearchable, immense;
All the fulness of the Godhead

O the riches, O the riches,
Christ my Savior has for me!
How unsearchable their measure,
Yet my full reality!

2
O the riches of my Savior,
All-embracing: life and light,
Wisdom, power, healing, comfort,
Treasures rich of God’s delight;

3
God’s redemption, full salvation,
And His resurrection pow’r,
Sanctifying, glorifying,
All transcending every hour!

4
O the riches of my Savior—
Nothing less than God as all!
All His person and possessions,
Now my spirit doth enthrall.

5
O the riches of my Savior!
Who can know their breadth and length.
Or their depth and height unmeasured,
Yet they are my joy and strength.

6
May I know these boundless riches,
Christ experience in full;
And with others may I share them
In their content bountiful.

Lord Jesus, I love Thee, I know Thou art mine;
For Thee all the pleasures of sin I resign;
My gracious Redeemer, my Savior art Thou,
If ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, ’tis now.

2
I love Thee, because Thou hast first loved me,
And purchased my pardon on Calvary’s tree;
I love Thee for wearing the thorns on Thy brow;
If ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, ’tis now.

3
I’ll love Thee in life, I will love Thee in death,
And praise Thee as long as Thou lendest me breath;
And say when the death-dew lies cold on my brow,
If ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, ’tis now.

4
In ages eternal of endless delight
I’ll ever adore Thee in glory so bright;
I’ll sing with the glittering crown on my brow,
If ever I loved Thee, Lord Jesus, ’tis now.

1
When this passing world is done,
When has sunk yon glaring sun,
When we stand with Christ on high,
Looking o’er life’s history;                     
Then, Lord, shall I fully know,                     
Not till then, how much I owe.

2
When I stand before the throne
Dressed in beauty not my own,
When I see Thee as Thou art,
Love Thee with unsinning heart;
Then, Lord, shall I fully know,
Not till then, how much I owe.

3
E’en on earth, as through a glass
Darkly, let Thy glory pass;
Draw me, Lord, into Thyself—
A well-pleasing sacrifice;
E’en on earth, Lord, make me know
Something of how much I owe.

1
I love my Lord, but with no love of mine,
For I have none to give;
I love Thee, Lord, but all the love is Thine,
For by Thy love I live.
I am as nothing, and rejoice to be
Emptied, and lost, and swallowed up in Thee.

2
Thou, Lord, alone, art all Thy children need,
And there is none beside;
From Thee the streams of blessedness proceed,
In Thee the bless’d abide.
Fountain of life, and all-abounding grace,
Our source, our center, and our dwelling-place.

1
Earthen vessel I was made,
Christ in me the treasure laid;
His container I must be,
As the content He in me.

2
In His image I was made,
Fit that Christ should all pervade;
Thus the vessel God did form
With the content uniform.

3
In my spirit He remains,
With His power He sustains;
As the Spirit one with me,
He is my reality.

4
Moving in me day by day,
Mingling with me all the way,
All my steps He regulates,
Every part He saturates

5
Him expressing from within,
Making Him to others seen,
I transparent have to be
That He may be shown through me.

6
Transformation is my need,
To be broken more indeed,
That the clay may change in form,
To the treasure to conform.

1
I come to His presence afresh
Ere the night has passed into morning;
And His face I see as it shines on me—
The Lord within is dawning.
And He speaks to me and reveals to me
All His riches for me today;
And with sweet delight I partake of Him,
My hunger has passed away.

2
In Spirit He speaks thru the Word
Till my heart in echo is singing,
And the fount of life with His grace and pow’r
Within my soul is springing.
And He speaks to me and reveals to me
All His riches for me today;
And I drink of Him for my every need,
My thirsting has passed away.

3
In tenderness He deals with me,
While I stay with joy in His presence;
And He saturates and supplies my soul
With all His precious essence.
And He speaks to me and reveals to me
All His riches for me today;
And in every way I partake of Him,
My problems all passed away.

Savior, I by faith am touching
Thee, the source of every good;
Virtue now, by faith am claiming,
Through the cleansing of Thy blood.
Touching Thee, new life is glowing
By Thy Spirit’s burning flame;
Cleansing, purging, Spirit filling,
Glory to Thy Holy Name!

2
Touching Thee in faith, I take Thee
In Thy riches full and free;
All I am I open to Thee,
All Thou art Thou giv’st to me.

Touching now Thine outstretched scepter,
O most mighty King of kings;
Of Thy fulness now receiving,

All my need, by Thee supplied;
Keep me touching, keep me claiming,
Keep me ever at Thy side.

1
I have learned the wondrous secret
Of abiding in the Lord;
I have tasted life’s pure fountain,
I am drinking of His word;
I have found the strength and sweetness
Of abiding ’neath the blood;
I have lost myself in Jesus,
I am sinking into God.
I’m abiding in the Lord
And confiding in His word;
I am hiding in the bosom of His love.
Yes, abiding in the Lord
And confiding in His word,
I am hiding in the bosom of His love.                     

2
I am crucified with Jesus,
And He lives and dwells with me;
I have ceased from all my struggling,
’Tis no longer I, but He.
All my will is yielding to Him,
And His Spirit reigns within;
And His precious blood each moment
Keeps me cleansed and free from sin.

3
All my sicknesses I bring Him,
And He bears them all away;
All my fears and griefs I tell Him,
All my cares from day to day,
All my strength I draw from Jesus,
By His breath I live and move;
E’en His very mind He gives me,
And His faith, and life, and love.

4
For my words I take His wisdom,
For my works His Spirit’s power;
For my ways His ceaseless presence
Guards and guides me every hour.
Of my heart, He is the portion,
Of my joy the boundless spring;
Savior, Sanctifier, Healer,
Glorious Lord, and coming King.

1
Simply trusting every day;                     
Trusting through a stormy way;
Even when my faith is small,                     
Trusting Jesus, that is all.
Trusting as the moments fly,                     
Trusting as the days go by,
Trusting Him, whate’er befall,                     
Trusting Jesus, that is all.

2
Brightly doth His Spirit shine
Into this poor heart of mine;
While He leads I cannot fall,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.

3
Singing if my way be clear,
Praying if the path be drear;
If in danger, for Him call,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.

4
Trusting Him while life shall last,
Trusting Him till earth is past,
Till His gracious advent call,
Trusting Jesus, that is all.

I take Thy promise, Lord, in all its length,                     
And breadth and fulness, as my daily strength;
Into life’s future fearless I may gaze,                     
For, Savior, Thou art with me all the days.                     

2
Days may be coming fraught with loss and change,
New scenes surround my life and fancies strange:
I thank Thee that no day can ever break,
Savior, when Thou wilt leave me or forsake.

3
There may be days of darkness and distress,
When sin has power to tempt, and care to press,
Yet in the darkest day I will not fear,
For, ’mid the shadows, Thou will still be near.

4
Days there may be of joy and deep delight,
When earth seems fairest, and her skies most bright,
Then draw me closer to Thee, lest I rest
Elsewhere, my Savior, than upon Thy breast.

5
And all the other days that make my life,
Marked by no special joy or grief or strife,
Days filled with quiet duties, trivial care,
Burdens too small for other hearts to share:

6
Spend Thou these days with me, all shall be Thine,
So shall the darkest hour with glory shine.
Then when these earthly years have passed away,
Let me be with Thee in the perfect day.

Hymns 578

1
My will is weak, my strength is frail,
And all my hope is nearly gone;
I can but trust Thy working true
To gently hold and lead me on.                     
To gently hold and lead me on.

2
I’ve tried my best, but still have failed,
E’en as before I’ve failed and erred;
Thy patience is my only trust
To hold and keep me to Thy word.

3
Whene’er my heart is lifted up,
How very near I am to fall;
I dare not do, I dare not think,
I need Thyself in great or small.

4
Thou art my Savior, strength and stay,
O Lord, I come to seek Thy face;
Though I’m the weakest of the weak,
My strength is nothing but Thy grace.
Hymns 579


Calgary Songbook :579


1
Jesus! I am resting, resting
In the joy of what Thou art;
I am finding out the greatness
Of Thy loving heart.
Thou hast bid me gaze upon Thee,
And Thy beauty fills my soul,
For, by Thy transforming power,
Thou hast made me whole.
Jesus! I am resting, resting
In the joy of what Thou art;
I am finding out the greatness
Of Thy loving heart.

2
Oh, how great Thy loving kindness,
Vaster, broader than the sea:
Oh, how marvelous Thy goodness,
Lavished all on me!
Yes, I rest in Thee, Beloved,
Know what wealth of grace is Thine,
Know Thy certainty of promise,
And have made it mine.

3
Simply trusting Thee, Lord Jesus,
I behold Thee as Thou art,
And Thy love, so pure, so changeless,
Satisfies my heart,
Satisfies its deepest longings,
Meets, supplies its every need,
Compasseth me round with blessings,
Thine is love indeed.

4
Ever lift Thy face upon me,
As I work and wait for Thee;
Resting ’neath Thy smile, Lord Jesus,
Earth’s dark shadows flee.
Brightness of my Father’s glory,
Sunshine of my Father’s face,
Keep me ever trusting, resting,
Fill me with Thy grace.

Hymns 582


Calgary Songbook :1

When we walk with the Lord
In the light of His Word,
What a glory He sheds on our way;                     
While we do His good will,
He abides with us still,
And with all who will trust and obey.
Trust and obey,
For there’s no other way
To be happy in Jesus,
But to trust and obey.


Calgary Songbook :2

Not a shadow can rise,
Not a cloud in the skies,
But His smile quickly drives it away;
Not a doubt or a fear,
Not a sigh or a tear,
Can abide while we trust and obey.


Calgary Songbook :3

Not a burden we bear,
Not a sorrow we share,
But our toil He doth richly repay;
Not a grief or a loss,
Not a frown or a cross,
But is blest if we trust and obey.


Calgary Songbook :4

But we never can prove
The delights of His love,
Until all on the altar we lay;
For the favor He shows,
And the joy He bestows,
Are for them who will trust and obey.


Calgary Songbook :5

Then in fellowship sweet
We will sit at His feet,
Or we’ll walk by His side in the way;
What He says we will do;
Where He sends, we will go,
Never fear, only trust and obey.
Hymns 599


Calgary Songbook :599


1
Lord, I was blind; I could not see
In Thy marred visage any grace,
But now the beauty of Thy face
In radiant vision dawns on me.

2
Lord, I was deaf; I could not hear
The thrilling music of Thy voice;
But now I hear Thee and rejoice,
And all Thine uttered words are dear!

3
Lord, I was dumb; I could not speak
The grace and glory of Thy name;
But now, as touched with living flame,
My lips Thine eager praises wake.

4
Lord, I was dead; I could not stir
My lifeless soul to come to Thee;
But now, since Thou hast quickened me,
I rise from sin’s dark sepulcher.

5
For Thou hast made the blind to see,
The deaf to hear, the dumb to speak,
The dead to live; and, lo, I break
The chains of my captivity.

Hymns 600 (new tune)

1
My God, my Portion, and my Love,
My everlasting All,                     
I’ve none but Thee in heav’n above,
Or on this earthly ball,
Or on this earthly ball.

2
What empty things are all the skies,
And this inferior clod!
There’s nothing here deserves my joys,
There’s nothing like my God,
There’s nothing like my God.

3
To Thee I owe my wealth, and friends,
And health, and safe abode;
Thanks to Thy name for meaner things,
But they are not my God,
But they are not my God.

4
How vain a toy is glittering wealth,
If once compared to Thee!
Or what’s my safety, or my health,
Or all my friends to me,
Or all my friends to me.

5
Were I possessor of the earth,
And called the stars my own,
Without Thy graces and Thyself,
I were a wretch undone,
I were a wretch undone.

6
Let others stretch their arms like seas,
And grasp in all the shore;
Grant me the visits of Thy grace,
And I desire no more,
And I desire no more.
Hymns 602


Calgary Songbook :602


1
O how glorious! O how holy!
God is the eternal life!
Full, unlimited, and pow’rful,
Pure, and merciful, and bright!
In this life are all His riches,
All His nature, love and light.

2
O how loving! O how gracious!
God Himself is life to man!
He in man hath made a spirit
That He might fulfill His plan.
’Tis His heart’s delight and longing
E’er to be received by man.

3
O what love and grace unbounded!
God as life to man doth flow!
He no more is hid in secret
But Himself to man doth show,
First in flesh and then as Spirit
That His life all men may know.

4
How approachable! How near us!
God in Christ our life to be!
Christ is God in flesh incarnate,
Manifest for man to see.
Died and risen, now He enters
Into man, his life to be.

5
O what wonder! As the Spirit
God as life to man is shown!
’Tis His other transformation,
He as Spirit thus is known;
Men convicting and inspiring,
He within them makes His home.

6
O how glorious! O how precious!
Thus the triune God to know!
First the Father in the Son came,
Now the Son as Spirit flows.
When in man the Spirit enters
God as life He doth bestow.

7
How mysterious, yet how real!
God Himself now flows in me!
In my heart, with me in oneness,
He has come my life to be.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
I will praise unceasingly!
Hymns 639


Calgary Songbook :639


1
Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
The life of God eternal manifest;
’Tis uncreated, indestructible,
’Tis Christ Himself, unconqu’rable, expressed.

2
Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
Though all its force against it may combine;
Death only gives it opportunity
To show the boundless pow’r of life divine.

3
Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
The more interred, the more it multiplies;
All kinds of suff’ring only help it grow
And fruits of life abundant realize.

4
Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
Thru every block and barrier it breaks;
Conqu’ring the pow’r of darkness and of hell,
It swallows death and victory partakes.

5
Death cannot hold the resurrection life,
All of God’s fulness it will manifest;
God’s righteousness and holiness it yields,
His glorious image by it is expressed.

6
Oh, may I know this resurrection life,
In every kind of death its pow’r outpoured,
In my experience ever realize
This life is nought but Christ my living Lord.

1
“Within the Veil”: be this, belov’d thy portion,
Within the secret of thy Lord to dwell;
Beholding Him, until thy face His glory,                     
Thy life His love, thy lips His praise shall tell.
Sisters:
Lord I come, seeking You,                     
Bring me in, to Your light                     
You’re so rich, You’re so full,                     
Wonderful, my delight
Brothers:
Open me, turn my heart,
Speak to me, in Your Word
Lord You are all I need,
I love You, precious Lord.

2
“Within the Veil,” for only as thou gazest
Upon the matchless beauty of His face,
Canst thou become a living revelation
Of His great heart of love, His untold grace.

3
“Within the Veil,” His fragrance poured upon thee,
Without the Veil, that fragrance shed abroad;
“Within the Veil,” His hand shall tune the music
Which sounds on earth the praises of Thy Lord.

4
“Within the Veil,” thy spirit deeply anchored,
Thou walkest calm above a world of strife;
“Within the Veil,” thy soul with Him united,
Shall live on earth His resurrection life.

Hymns 643

1
Take time to behold Him,
Speak oft with Thy Lord,
Abide in Him always,
And feed on His Word.
Wait thou in His presence,
Submissive and meek,
Forgetting in nothing
His blessing to seek.

2
Take time to behold Him,
The world rushes on;
Spend much time in secret
With Jesus alone.
By looking to Jesus
Like Him thou shalt be;
Thy friends, in thy conduct,
His likeness shall see.

3
Take time to behold Him,
Let Him be thy guide;
And run not before Him
Whatever betide;
In joy or in sorrow
Still follow thy Lord,
And, looking to Jesus,
Still trust in His Word.

4
Take time to behold Him,
Be calm in thy soul,
Each thought and each temper
Beneath His control.
Thus led by His Spirit
To fountains of love,
Thou then shalt be fitted
His mercy to prove.
Hymns 645


Calgary Songbook :645


1
O soul, are you weary and troubled?
No light in the darkness you see?
There’s light for a look at the Savior,
And life more abundant and free.                     
Turn your eyes upon Jesus,
Look full in His wonderful face,                     
And the things of earth will grow strangely dim,
In the light of His glory and grace.                     

2
Through death into life everlasting
He passed, and we follow Him there;
O’er us sin no more hath dominion
For more than conqu’rors we are!

3
His Word shall not fail you, He promised;
Believe Him and all will be well;
Then go to a world that is dying,
His perfect salvation to tell!


Calgary Songbook :669

Hymns 669

1
In the heart of Jesus
There is love for you,
Love most pure and tender,
Love most deep and true;
Why should you be lonely,
Why for friendship sigh,
When the heart of Jesus
Has a full supply?

2
In the mind of Jesus
There is thought of you,
Warm as summer sunshine,
Sweet as morning dew;
Why should you be fearful,
Why take anxious thought,
Since the mind of Jesus
Cares for those He brought?

3
In the field of Jesus
There is work for you;
Such as even angels
Might rejoice to do;
Why stand idly sighing
For some life-work grand,
While the field of Jesus
Seeks your reaping hand?

4
In the Church of Jesus
There’s a place for you;
Glorious, bright, and joyous,
Right and peaceful too;
Why then, like a wand’rer,
Roam with weary pace,
If the Church of Jesus
Hold for you a place?
Hymns 711 (modified)


Calgary Songbook :711


1
I know not what awaits me,
God kindly veils my eyes,
And o’er each step of my onward way
He makes new scenes to rise;
And ev’ry joy He sends me comes
A sweet and glad surprise.
Where He may lead me I’ll follow,                     
My trust in Him repose;                     
And every hour in perfect peace,
I’ll sing, “He knows, He knows”;
I’ll sing, “He knows, He knows.”

2
One step I see before me,
’Tis all I need to see,
The light of heaven more brightly shines
When earth’s illusions flee;
And sweetly through the silence comes,
His loving, “Trust in Me!”
Where He may lead me I’ll follow,
My trust in Him repose;
And every hour in perfect peace,
I’ll sing, “He knows, He knows”;
I’ll sing, “He knows, He knows.”

3
Oh, blissful lack of wisdom,
’Tis blessed not to know;
He holds me with His own right hand,
And will not let me go,
And lulls my troubled soul to rest
In Him who loves me so.

4
So on I go not knowing;
I would not if I might;
I’d rather walk in the dark with God
Then go alone in the light;
I’d rather walk by faith with Him
Than go alone by sight.
Hymns 713


Calgary Songbook :713


1
Day by day, and with each passing moment,
Strength I find to meet my trials here:
Trusting in my Father’s wise bestowment,
I’ve no cause for worry or for fear.
He, whose heart is kind beyond all measure,
Gives unto each day what He deems best,
Lovingly its part of pain and pleasure,
Mingling toil with peace and rest.

2
Every day the Lord Himself is near me,
With a special mercy for each hour;
All my cares He fain would bear and cheer me,
He whose name is Counsellor and Pow’r.
The protection of His child and treasure
Is a charge that on Himself He laid;
“As thy days, thy strength shall be in measure,”
This the pledge to me He made.

3
Help me then, in every tribulation,
So to trust Thy promises, O Lord,
That I lose not faith’s sweet consolation,
Offered me within Thy holy Word.
Help me, Lord, when toil and trouble meeting,
E’er to take, as from a father’s hand,
One by one, the days, the moments fleeting,
Till with Christ the Lord I stand.
Hymns 717


Calgary Songbook :717


1
O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,
Though all things around us be trying,
Though floods of affliction like sea billows roar,
It’s better to sing than be sighing.
Then rejoice evermore, rejoice evermore,
It is better to sing than be sighing:
It is better to live than be dying;
So let us rejoice evermore.

2
O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,
When the darts of the tempter are flying,
For Satan still dreads, as he oft did of yore,
Our singing much more than our sighing.

3
O let us rejoice in the Lord evermore,
When sickness upon us is stealing,
No cordial like gladness our strength can restore,
For joy is the fountain of healing.

Hymns 720

1
God hath not promised skies always blue,                     
Flower-strewn pathways all our lives through;
God hath not promised sun without rain,                     
Joy without sorrow, peace without pain.                     
But God hath promised strength for the day,
Rest for the labor, light for the way,
Grace for the trials, help from above                     
Unfailing sympathy, undying love.                     

2
God hath not promised we shall not know
Toil and temptation, trouble and woe;
He hath not told us we shall not bear
Many a burden, many a care.

3
God hath not promised smooth roads and wide,
Swift, easy travel, needing no guide;
Never a mountain, rocky and steep,
Never a river, turbid and deep.
Hymns 723 (new tune)


Calgary Songbook :723


1
He giveth more grace when the burdens grow greater,
He sendeth more strength when the labors increase,
To added affliction He addeth His mercy,
To multiplied trials, His multiplied peace.

2
When we have exhausted our store of endurance,
When our strength has failed ere the day is half-done,
When we reach the end of our hoarded resources,
Our Father’s full giving is only begun.

3
His love has no limit, His grace has no measure,
His power no boundary known unto men,
For out of His infinite riches in Jesus,
He giveth and giveth and giveth again.
Hymns 770


Calgary Songbook :770


1
In the holiest place,
Touch the throne of grace,
Grace as a river shall flow;                     
In the holiest place,
Grace as a river shall flow.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Grace as a river shall flow;                     
Grace as river shall flow.                     

2
In the holiest place,
Live before His face,
Light of glory thru me will shine;
In the holiest place.
Light of glory thru me will shine.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Light of glory thru me will shine;

3
To the spirit turn,
And the incense burn,
Touch the living fountain of life;
To the spirit turn,
Touch the living fountain of life.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Touch the living fountain of life;

In the mighty Name of Jesus,
When we bow before the throne,
Many deadly foes are vanquished,
Many victories are won.
Mighty Name! Mighty Name!
In that Name alone we win.
Conquering Satan, death and sin.

2
When we plead the Name of Jesus,
Satan and his hosts must flee.
Jesus! Jesus! Precious Jesus!
In Thy Name is victory.

3
Soon shall come the blessed moment
When the battle shall be won,
When the Mighty Name of Jesus
Shall exalt us to the throne.

Pray to fellowship with Jesus,
In the spirit seek His face;                     
Ask and listen in His presence,
Waiting in the secret place.
Pray to fellowship with Jesus,                     
In the spirit seek His face;
Ask and listen in His presence,
Waiting in the secret place.

Fully opened from within,
With thy face unveiled, beholding,
Single, pure, and genuine.

Learn to touch Him as the Spirit,
Looking up in reverence.

Speaking nothing in pretense;
Ask according to the spirit,
Praying by the inner sense.

Bathing in His countenance;
Saturated with His beauty,
Radiate His excellence.

Hymns 789

1
What a Friend we have in Jesus,                     
All our sins and griefs to bear!
What a privilege to carry                     
Everything to God in prayer!
O what peace we often forfeit,
O what needless pain we bear,
All because we do not carry
Everything to God in prayer!

2
Have we trials and temptations?
Is there trouble anywhere?
We should never be discouraged,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.
Can we find a friend so faithful
Who will all our sorrows share?
Jesus knows our every weakness,
Take it to the Lord in prayer.

3
Are we weak and heavy-laden,
Cumbered with a load of care?
Precious Savior, still our refuge—
Take it to the Lord in prayer;
Do thy friends despise, forsake thee?
In His arms He’ll take and shield thee,
Thou wilt find a solace there.
Hymns 811

1
My heart is hungry, my spirit doth thirst;
I come to Thee, Lord, to seek Thy supply;
All that I need is none other but Thee,
Thou canst my hunger and thirst satisfy.
Feed me, Lord Jesus, give me to drink,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst;
Flood me with joy, be the strength of my life,
Fill all my hunger, quench all my thirst.

2
Thou art the food and the water of life,
Thou canst revive me, my spirit upbear;
I long to eat and to drink here of Thee,
Thyself enjoy through my reading and prayer.

3
Thou art the Word with God’s fulness in Thee,
Thou too the Spirit that God my life be;
Thee in the Word I enjoy as my food,
Thou as the Spirit art water to me.

4
Thou from the heavens as food camest down,
Thou to be drink hast been smitten for me;
Thou as the food, my exhaustless supply,
Thou as the water, a stream unto me.

5
Thou in the Word art the Spirit and life,
Thus by the Word I may feed upon Thee;
Thou dost as Spirit in my spirit live,
Thus I may drink in the spirit of Thee.

6
Now to enjoy Thee I come to Thy Word,
On Thee to feed till my hunger is o’er.
Now in my spirit I turn unto Thee,
Of Thee to drink till I’m thirsty no more.

7
Feeding and drinking, Lord Jesus, of Thee,
Feeding by reading, and drinking by prayer;
Reading and praying, I eat and I drink,
Praying and reading—Lord, Thou art my fare.

8
Here, O my Lord, may I feast upon Thee;
Flood with Thy Spirit and fill by Thy Word;
May, Lord, Thou be such a feast unto me
As man hath never enjoyed nor e’er heard.
Hymns 812


Calgary Songbook :812


1
I come to Thee, dear Lord,
My heart doth thirst for Thee;
Of Thee I’d eat, of Thee I’d drink,
Enjoy Thee thoroughly.

2
Just to behold Thy face,
For this my heart doth cry;
I deeply long to drink of Thee
My thirst to satisfy.

3
Thy glorious, radiant face
My heart delights to see;
Here I’d abide and ne’er depart,
Beholding constantly.

4
In such a fellowship
Thou, Lord, art grace to me;
My heart and spirit gladdened, filled,
I enter rest in Thee.

5
Lord, I would linger here,
Still seeking after Thee,
Continue in the Word and prayer
Till Thou dost flow thru me.
Hymns 824


Calgary Songbook :824


1
The Church is Christ’s own Body,
The Father’s dwelling-place,
The gathering of the called ones,
God blended with man’s race;
Elect before creation,
Redeemed by Calv’ry’s death,
Her character and standing
Of heaven, not of earth.

2
New man of new creation,
Born through her risen Lord,
Baptized in God the Spirit,
Made holy by His Word;
Christ is her life and content,
Himself her glorious Head;
She has ascended with Him
O’er all her foes to tread.

3
Christ is her one foundation,
None other man may lay;
All that she has, as Christ, is
Divine in every way;
Her members through the Spirit
Their death on Calv’ry own;
They’re built in resurrection—
Gold, silver, precious stone.

4
One God, one Lord, one Spirit—
Her elements all one—
One faith, one hope, one baptism,
One Body in the Son;
The triune God is in her,
One Body members own,
By faith they are united,
In hope of glory shown.

5
From every tribe and nation
Do all the members come,
Regardless of their classes
United to be one.
No high there is, nor lowly,
No Jew, nor Gentile clan,
No free, nor slave, nor master,
But Christ, the “one new man.”

6
One Body universal,
One in each place expressed;
Locality of dwelling
Her only ground possessed;
Administration local,
Each answ’ring to the Lord;
Communion universal,
Upheld in one accord.

7
Her local gatherings model
The New Jerusalem;
Its aspects and its details
Must show in all of them.
Christ is the Lamp that shineth,
With God within, the Light;
They are the lampstands bearing
His glorious Image bright.
Hymns 841


Calgary Songbook :841


1
Thou art all my life, Lord,
In me Thou dost live;
With Thee all God’s fulness
Thou to me dost give.
By Thy holy nature
I am sanctified,
By Thy resurrection,
Vict’ry is supplied.

2
Now Thy flowing life, Lord,
Doth enlighten me,
Bringing in the spirit
Fellowship with Thee;
All my need supplying,
Making Thy demand,
Leading me to cleansing
And in Thee to stand.

3
Thy anointing Spirit
Me shall permeate,
All my soul and spirit
Thou wouldst saturate;
Every part transforming
Till conformed to Thee,
Till Thy life shall bring me
To maturity.

4
Lord, Thy life abundant,
Flowing, rich and free,
Constantly refreshes
And empowers me.
Death by life is swallowed,
Weakness is made strong,
All my bonds are broken,
Gloom is turned to song.

5
I would give myself, Lord,
Fully unto Thee,
That Thy heart’s desire
Be fulfilled in me.
I no more would struggle
To myself reform,
Thus in me to hinder
What Thou wouldst perform.

6
I would cease completely
From my efforts vain,
Let Thy life transform me,
Full release to gain;
Build me up with others
Till in us Thou see
Thy complete expression
Glorifying Thee.
Hymns 846

1
Oh, may my spirit flow,
Oh, may it flow!
Now I beseech Thee, Lord,
My past I would forsake,
The iron walls would break,
My spirit free would make;
Oh, may it flow!

2
Oh, may my spirit flow,
Now I implore Thee, Lord,
No more self-satisfied,
No more in self-bound pride,
No more my spirit tied;
Oh, may it flow!

3
Oh, may my spirit flow,
For this I plead with Thee,
High-minded not to be,
Pride shall not prison me,
I’d flow unceasingly,
In spirit flow.

4
Oh, may my spirit flow,
Oh, may it flow!
For this I seek Thee, Lord,
No more to isolate,
Nor self to perfect make,
My spirit nought abate,
Deeply to flow.

5
Oh, may my spirit flow,
Oh, may it flow!
I ask Thee, gracious Lord,
My trust in self o’erthrow,
Down from self’s throne I’ll go,
That living water flow
In spirit, Lord.

6
Oh, may my spirit flow,
Oh, may it flow!
Answer my prayer, dear Lord,
Not just commune with Thee,
I long to builded be,
Mingle with others free
In spirit, Lord.
Hymns 852


Calgary Songbook :852


1
Thy dwelling-place, O Lord, I love;
It is Thy Church so blessed,
It is Thy joy and heart’s delight
And where Thy heart finds rest.

2
For her, Thyself Thou gavest, Lord,
That she be Thine, complete;
For her, I too my body give,
Thy heart’s desire to meet.

3
For her, Thou hast become my life,
That she my living be;
For her, I would forsake myself,
That she be filled with Thee.

4
The Church is Thy beloved Bride,
Thou in Thy Body seen;
She is my joy and heart’s desire,
The one on whom I lean.

5
In her, Thy full supply, O Lord,
Thou dost to me impart;
In her am I possessed by Thee
To satisfy Thy heart.

6
Thy dwelling-place, O Lord, I love;
It is Thy Church, Thy home;
In it I would forever live
And never longer roam.
Hymns 871


Calgary Songbook :871


1
Onward Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus
Going on before.
Christ the royal Master,
Leads against the foe;
Forward into battle,
See, His banners go!                     
Onward, Christian soldiers!
Marching as to war,
With the cross of Jesus,
Going on before.

2
At the name of Jesus
Satan’s host doth flee;
On then, Christian soldiers,
On to victory!
Hell’s foundations quiver
At the shout of praise:
Brothers, lift your voices,
Loud your anthems raise!

3
Like a mighty army
Moves the Church of God:
Brothers, we are treading
Where the saints have trod;
We are not divided,
All one Body we—
One in faith and Spirit,
One eternally.

4
Crowns and thrones may perish,
Kingdoms rise and wane;
But the Church of Jesus
Constant will remain.
Gates of hell can never
’Gainst the Church prevail;
We have Christ’s own promise,
Which can never fail.

5
Onward, then, ye people!
Join our happy throng;
Blend with ours your voices
In the triumph song.
Glory, laud and honor
Unto Christ, the King;
This through countless ages
Men and angels sing.
Hymns 880


Calgary Songbook :880


1
To the foe my word is always, “No,”
To the Father it is “Yes,”
That His plan and all His counsel
Be accomplished with success;
When Thine orders I’m obeying,
Grant me, Lord, authority
To fulfill Thy plan eternal
Thru the Spirit’s power in me.

2
To the foe my word is always, “No,”
To the Father it is, “Yes”;
’Tis my attitude eternal;
May the Lord protect and bless,
Lest while walking in obedience
Satan undermine the way;
When I’m list’ning to Thine orders,
Grant me mercy, Lord, I pray.

3
To the foe my word is always, “No,”
To the Father it is, “Yes”;
I completely would obey Him,
Though deep suff’ring may oppress.
If the Lord will save and keep me,
As I forward press with Him,
Then no trials shall prevent me,
Nor will opposition grim.
Hymns 881 (modified)


Calgary Songbook :881


1
We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender;
We go not forth alone against the foe;
Strong in Thy strength, safe in Thy keeping tender,
We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.

2
Yea, in Thy Name, O Captain of salvation!
In Thy dear Name, all other names above,
Jesus our Righteousness, our sure Foundation,
Our Prince of glory and our King of love.

3
We go in faith, our own great weakness feeling,
And needing more each day Thy grace to know:
Yet from our hearts a song of triumph pealing;
We rest on Thee, and in Thy Name we go.

4
We rest on Thee, our Shield and our Defender:
Thine is the battle, Thine shall be the praise
When reigning in the Kingdom of Thy splendor,
Victors, we rest with Thee, through endless days.

Hymns 885

1
Fight the battle in the Body,
Never fight it on your own;
With the Body to the Head joined,
Fight the battle on the throne.
Fight the battle in the Body!
By the virtue of the Head;
Standing firmly with the Body,
Into vict’ry you’ll be led.

2
For the Body is God’s armor,
Not for anyone alone;
When you wrestle in the Body,
All its benefits you own.

3
’Tis the Church on Christ established
Satan shall not overpow’r;
’Tis the Body built together
Which resists the evil pow’r.

4
In the Body, by the Headship,
Sitting in the heavenlies,
Struggle with the wicked spirits
And the principalities.

5
As a member of the Body,
With the brethren stand for God;
Praying always in the Spirit,
Claim the vict’ry through the Blood.

6
In the heav’nlies more than conqu’ror,
In the power of His might,
As a soldier in the army,
In the Lord the battle fight.

7
Keep on wrestling in the Body,
Mighty vict’ry you will see,
Bind and loose, God’s will fulfilling,
And the foes your food will be.
Hymns 886


Calgary Songbook :886


1
A mighty Fortress is our God,
A Bulwark never failing;
Our Helper He amid the flood
Of mortal ills prevailing:
For still our ancient foe
Doth seek to work us woe;
His craft and power are great,
And, armed with cruel hate,
On earth is not his equal.

2
Did we in our own strength confide,
Our striving would be losing;
Were not the right Man on our side,
The Man of God’s own choosing:
Dost ask who that may be?
Christ Jesus, it is He;
Lord Sabaoth His Name,
From age to age the same,
And He must win the battle.

3
And though this world, with devils filled,
Should threaten to undo us,
We will not fear, for God hath willed
His truth to triumph through us:
The Prince of Darkness grim,
We tremble not for him;
His rage we can endure,
For lo! his doom is sure,
One little word shall fell him.

4
That word above all earthly powers,
No thanks to them, abideth;
The Spirit and the gifts are ours
Through Him who with us sideth:
Let goods and kindred go,
This mortal life also;
The body they may kill:
God’s truth abideth still,
His Kingdom is forever.


Calgary Songbook :887

Hymns 887

1
The name of Jesus is our stand,
It is our victory;
Not on ourselves do we rely,
But, mighty Lord, on Thee.
Our weapons are not arms of flesh,
But ours the Spirit’s sword,
And God’s whole armor putting on,
We battle in the Lord.

2
Behold, the foe doth meet and plot,
Stand firm in one accord!
Though war be fierce and darkness thick,
Resist him in the Lord!
If one thru fear should backward turn,
He undermines the rest.
Oh, do not let your brothers down,
Nor by you be distressed.

3
The devil knows his time is short,
He is the more enraged,
And by his wiles would weaken us
Before the battle’s waged.
The trials now more numerous are,
The suff’ring e’en more sore,
The force of hell opposing us
More dreadful than before.

4
What should our posture be today
In such a desperate hour?
Should we our ease and pleasure seek
And let the foe devour?
Or with increasing conflict strong,
Courageous to endure?
’Tis here that life or death is won!
Who will God’s praise secure?

5
For Christ the Lord we then would stand,
He is the Conqueror!
For Him we would endure the pain
Until the fight is o’er.
The hour of triumph soon we’ll see—
The Lord will come again;
If now we suffer for His sake,
Then we with Him shall reign.
Hymns 889

1
By the blood of Christ the Victor
Overcome the enemy;
By its virtue and its power
You will win the victory.
By the blood of Christ the Victor
Overcome the enemy;
By its virtue and its power
You will win the victory.

2
By the blood of Christ the Victor
Counter him who doth accuse;
By the blood for you defending
All the sland’rer’s blame refuse.

3
By the blood of Christ the Victor
God’s sure faithfulness believe;
Thru the blood of your Redeemer
God’s forgiveness now receive.

4
By the blood of Christ the Victor
Your position now declare;
Thru the blood, prevailing ever,
All His vict’ry fully share.

5
By the blood of Christ the Victor
Claim His full authority;
Just apply the blood of Jesus
And defeat the enemy.

6
By the blood of Christ the Victor
Standing in the heavenlies;
In the pow’r of Christ ascended,
Tread the principalities.

Hymns 890

1
Hallelujah! Christ is Victor,
Tell with every breath,
That the Savior still is conqu’ror
Over sin and death.
Hallelujah! Christ is Victor,
Tell where’er you go,
That the Lord is still the conqu’ror,
Over every foe.                     

2
Hallelujah! Christ is Victor,
Pain and sickness flee,
When we plead the mighty victory
Won on Calvary.

3
Hallelujah! Christ is Victor,
Therefore do and dare;
Go wherever Jesus sends you
In prevailing prayer.

4
Hallelujah! Christ is Victor,
No defeat nor fear
Evermore must dim thy vision!
Christ the way will clear.

5
Hallelujah! Christ is Victor,
Soon His voice shall ring,
“Come ye conquerors, come up hither,
Join thy conquering King.”
Hymns 893


Calgary Songbook :893


1
Conflict today is fierce,
The strength of Satan more;
The cry of battle calling now
Is louder than before.
The rebel voice of hell
E’en stronger now becomes;
But list, the midnight cry resounds,
Behold, I quickly come!

2
Trials more bitter grow,
The fighting doth enlarge;
Hell’s forces rally all their pow’rs
And gather for the charge.
Yet while we wait and watch
And feel the war severe,
We hear the joyful song ring out,
Jesus, the Lord, is near!

3
’Tis harder at the end
The word to testify,
For Satan fights with all his pow’r
Our witness to defy.
Much greater strength we need
The foe to overcome;
How happy when the Lord we see
And all our sighing’s done!

4
Who then will forward go
Strong in His mighty power?
Who then will firmly trust the Lord
Until the vict’ry hour;
Till with the conquerors blest,
The triumph song’s begun?
That man will then rejoice to hear,
Behold, I quickly come!

5
Who then will choose God’s best,
And take the narrow track,
Though passing thru the wildest storms,
Yet never turning back?
Who now will dare press on,
Enduring pain and fear?
All such will then rejoice to see
Jesus, the Lord, is near!

6
Though deep the darkness be
We still would onward go,
Till we the day of rapture greet
And glory ’round shall glow.
’Tis there we’ll see the Lord,
And Satan overcome:
The overcomers will rejoice,
Jesus, the Lord, has come!
Hymns 894


Calgary Songbook :894


1
Will you be an overcomer?
Christ is calling now!
Will you then be such a follower,
Though you know not how?
Will you be an overcomer?
Will you make this choice?
Christ is calling, Christ is calling,
Listen to His voice!

2
Will you be an overcomer?
To the Lord be drawn!
Keep the “first love”, never leave it,
Till the break of dawn.

3
Will you be an overcomer?
On His life depend!
Dare to suffer persecution,
Faithful to the end.

4
Will you be an overcomer?
Testimony bear!
Keep away from false religion,
“Hidden manna” share.

5
Will you be an overcomer,
Simple, real, and pure?
Overcome all evil mixture,
Ruling pow’r secure.

6
Will you be an overcomer?
Trust the living Lord!
Keep your “garments” from the deadness,
Win the life-reward.

7
Will you be an overcomer?
Never lukewarm be,
Ne’er content with what you’ve gotten,
More you need to see.

8
Will you be an overcomer?
Christ is calling still!
Will you now be loyal to Him,
His demand fulfill.

Hymns 904

1
We have a most glorious King;
The heavens, He says, are His throne;
All worlds are His mighty domain,
All kingdoms His scepter shall own.
He dwells with His people below,
He loves in their trials to share;
We dwell with the King for His work,
His burdens we willingly bear.

2
I’m dwelling with Jesus my King;
I’ve found where He dwells with His own;
I’ve opened the door of my heart;
He’s made it His temple and throne.
Like Mary I sit at His feet,
Like John I recline on His breast;
His presence is fulness of joy,
His bosom is infinite rest.

3
I dwell with the King for His work,
I’ve part in His glorious plan
To bring in His kingdom to earth
And tell His salvation to man.
The world has its work and rewards,
I count them but folly and loss;
My business is only His work,
My message is only His cross.

4
I dwell with the King for His work,
The work, it is His and not mine;
He plans and prepares it for me
And fills me with power divine.
So duty is changed to delight,
And prayer into praise as I sing;
I dwell with my King for His work
And work in the strength of my King.

5
We’ll dwell with the King for His work
And work thru each day of the year.
Perhaps ere it passes, the King
In glory Himself shall appear.
Oh, then in some closer embrace,
Oh, then in some nobler employ
We’ll dwell with the King for His work
In endless, ineffable joy!
Hymns 921


Calgary Songbook :921


1
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying,
Snatch them in pity from sin and the grave;
Weep o’er the erring one,
Lift up the fallen,
Tell them of Jesus the mighty to save.
Rescue the perishing,
Care for the dying;
Jesus is merciful,
Jesus will save.

2
Though they are slighting Him,
Still He is waiting,
Waiting the penitent child to receive;
Plead with them earnestly,
Plead with them gently;
He will forgive if they only believe.

3
Down in the human heart,
Crushed by the tempter,
Feelings lie buried that grace can restore;
Touched by a loving heart,
Wakened by kindness,
Chords that are broken will vibrate once more.

4
Rescue the perishing,
Duty demands it;
Strength for thy labor the Lord will provide;
Back to the narrow way
Patiently win them;
Tell the poor wand’rer a Savior has died.

Hymns 938

1
Already dead! And buried too!
With the old man I am through!
Already dead! And buried too!

No longer I! No longer I!
Christ in me I’ll testify!
No longer I! No longer I!
Hymns 948


Calgary Songbook :948


1
Myst’ry hid from ages now revealed to me,
Tis the Christ of God’s reality.                     
He embodies God, and He is life to me,
And the glory of my hope He’ll be.                     
Glory, glory, Christ is life in me!
Glory, glory, what a hope is He!
Now within my spirit He’s the mystery!
Then the glory He will be to me.                     

2
In my spirit He regenerated me,
In my soul He’s now transforming me.
He will change my body like unto His own,
Wholly making me the same as He.

3
Now in life and nature He is one with me;
Then in Him, the glory, I will be;
I’ll enjoy His presence for eternity
With Him in complete conformity.
Hymns 960


Calgary Songbook :960


1
My King will soon come back again,
The sky be filled with Him;
The universe to be redeemed
Will see His light therein.
The Lord will soon fulfill His plan,
His footsteps now I hear;
His glorious frame I faintly see
Beginning to appear.

2
I’m longing for His presence blest
And dare not slothful be
While waiting for my Lord’s return,
His own dear self to see.
My only hope—that He may come
And change my faith to sight;
There is no other joy on earth
Which gives my heart delight.

3
My heart is always with Himself,
My eyes are heavenward,
My lips would utter nothing else
Than meeting with my Lord.
The coming of the Lord draws nigh,
His coming is for me;
His promise ever standeth firm
And soon fulfilled I’ll see.

4
My Savior, all Thy holy words
Can never doubted be;
With them encouraged day by day,
I’m faithful unto Thee.
Oh, may Thy glory soon appear,
The foe be overthrown;
Thy promises be realized,
And we brought to Thy throne.

5
Thy saving arm a refuge is,
My Savior God, to me;
Thou as the Father keepeth them
Who put their trust in Thee.
The sheep and shepherd are of one,
The head and body same;
None e’er can pluck from out Thy hand
The child who trusts Thy Name.

6
A thousand hands won’t hinder me,
Nor will ten thousand eyes;
The thorns upon the road but help
Me onward to the prize.
Arise, my spirit and my heart,
And let the world go by;
The Lord of life will take me soon
To be with Him on high.

7
Thou healing sun! Thou hope of man!
I really love Thy ray.
Oh, righteous Lord! oh, glorious King!
I bow to Thee and pray:
Oh, may Thou soon ascend Thy throne
And quickly show Thy face;
Thy heav’nly kingdom may Thou found
And grant all men Thy grace.

8
The truth should triumph and be king,
And freedom should be queen;
But falsehood, which has rampant run,
Head of the world is seen.
We ask Thee, Truth, to quickly come
And bring Thy light from heav’n;
The foe be crushed and all Thy sons
Into Thy bosom giv’n.
Hymns 971


Calgary Songbook :971


1
God’s eternal purpose
Is to join with man,
Causing man, His vessel,
To be born again,
His own life imparting,
Filling to the brim;
Man may thus express Him,
And be one with Him.

2
God in His own image
Hath created man,
That he may be able
To fulfill His plan;
That he may receive Him
As the tree of life
To become His fulness
As to man the wife.

3
In His life’s rich flowing
Man will be transformed
Into precious substance
And to Him conformed.
Thus will man be builded
As His counterpart,
Thus to be His dwelling,
Satisfy His heart.

4
’Tis the holy city,
New Jerusalem;
With His saints God mingles,
Makes His home with them.
He becomes their content,
His expression they;
They shall share His glory,
One with Him for aye.

5
He’s the very center,
Ruling on the throne;
By His life the power,
Saints are kept in one.
By His light of glory,
They are kept in light,
Harmony enjoying
In divine delight.

6
He’s their living water,
And their food supply;
All their thirst and hunger
He doth satisfy.
He’s for them the temple,
In Himself they live,
In His constant presence
Worship ever give.
Hymns 993 (modified)


Calgary Songbook :993


1
O how sweet the glorious message,
Simple faith my claim;
Yesterday, today, forever,
Jesus is the same!
Still He loves to save the sinful,
Heal the sick and lame;
Cheer the mourner, calm the tempest;
Glory to His name!
Yesterday, today forever,
Jesus is the same,
All may change, but Jesus never!
Glory to His name,
Glory to His name;
Glory to His name.

2
He who pardoned erring Peter,
Never need’st thou fear.
He who came to faithless Thomas,
All thy doubt will clear.
He who let the loved disciple
On His bosom rest,
Bids thee still, with love as tender,
Lean upon His breast.

3
He who ’mid the raging billows
Walked upon the sea,
Still can hush our wildest tempest,
As on Galilee.
He who wept and prayed in anguish
In Gethsemane,
Drinks with us each cup of trembling
In our agony.

4
As of old He walked to Emmaus,
With them to abide;
So through all life’s way He walketh,
Ever near our side.
Soon again shall we behold Him,
Hasten, Lord, the day!
But ’twill still be “this same Jesus,”
As He went away.
Hymns 1006


Calgary Songbook :1006


1
There is a fountain filled with blood
Drawn from Immanuel’s veins;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains:
Lose all their guilty stains,
Lose all their guilty stains;
And sinners, plunged beneath that flood,
Lose all their guilty stains.

2
The dying thief rejoiced to see
That fountain in his day;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away:
Wash all my sins away,
Wash all my sins away;
And there may I, though vile as he,
Wash all my sins away.

3
Dear dying Lamb, Thy precious blood
Shall never lose its power,
Till all the ransomed ones of God
Be saved, to sin no more:
Be saved, to sin no more,
Be saved, to sin no more;
Till all the ransomed ones of God
Be saved, to sin no more.

4
E’er since by faith I saw the stream
Thy flowing wounds supply,
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die:
And shall be till I die,
And shall be till I die;
Redeeming love has been my theme,
And shall be till I die.

5
When this poor lisping, stammering tongue
Lies silent in the grave,
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I’ll sing Thy power to save:
I’ll sing Thy power to save,
I’ll sing Thy power to save;
Then in a nobler, sweeter song,
I’ll sing Thy power to save.

Hymns 1007

1
Have you been to Jesus for the cleansing pow’r?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Are you fully trusting in His grace this hour?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?                     
Are you washed in the blood,
In the soul-cleansing blood of the Lamb?
Are your garments spotless? Are they white as snow?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?                     

2
Are you walking daily by the Savior’s side?
Are you washed in the blood of the Lamb?
Do you rest each moment in the Crucified?

3
When the Bridegroom cometh will your robes be white?
Will your soul be ready for His presence bright,
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb?

4
Lay aside the garments that are stained with sin,
And be washed in the blood of the Lamb;
There’s a fountain flowing for the soul unclean,
O be washed in the blood of the Lamb.
Hymns 1008


Calgary Songbook :1008


1
What can wash away my sin?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus;
What can make me whole again?
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.
Oh! precious is the flow
That makes me white as snow;
No other fount I know,
Nothing but the blood of Jesus.

2
For my cleansing this I see—
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!
For my pardon this my plea—

3
Nothing can my sin erase—
Naught of works, ’tis all of grace
Nothing but the blood of Jesus!

4
This is all my hope and peace—
This is all my righteousness—

Hymns 1009

1
Would you be free from your burden of sin?
There’s power in the blood, power in the blood;
Would you o’er evil a victory win?
There’s wonderful power in the blood.
There is power, power, wonder-working power,
In the blood of the Lamb;
In the precious blood of the Lamb.                     

2
Would you be free from your passion and pride?
There’s power in the blood, power in the blood;
Come for a cleansing to Calvary’s tide,
There’s wonderful power in the blood.

3
Would you be whiter, much whiter than snow?
There’s power in the blood, power in the blood;
Sin-stains are lost in its life-giving flow,
There’s wonderful power in the blood.

4
Would you do service for Jesus your King?
There’s power in the blood, power in the blood;
Would you live daily His praises to sing?
There’s wonderful power in the blood.

1
O now I see the cleansing wave!
The fountain deep and wide;
Jesus, my Lord, mighty to save,
Points to His wounded side.
The cleansing stream I see, I see;
I plunge, and O it cleanseth me!
O praise the Lord it cleanseth me!
It cleanseth me, yes, cleanseth me.

2
I see the dear Redeemer raised,
I hear the speaking blood;
It speaks! My spirit is amazed!
And quickened by its flood.

3
I rise to walk in God’s own light
Above the world and sin,
With heart renewed and garments white
And Christ enthroned within.

1
Christ has put on human nature
and become a man like me,                     
He has died upon the cross
that I from Adam might be free,
He has risen and as Spirit
He has come to live in me                     
That He might be my life.
First Chorus: 
Glory! glory! Hallelujah!
For Christ is now my life!
Second Chorus:

For Christ is now my all!

Hymns 1023

1
I need Thee, precious Jesus!
For I am full of sin;
My soul is dark and guilty,
My spirit dead within:
I need the cleansing fountain,
Where I can always flee:
The blood of Christ most precious,
The sinner’s perfect plea.

2
I need Thee, precious Jesus!
For I am very poor;
A stranger and a pilgrim,
I have no earthly store:
I need the love of Jesus,
To cheer me on my way,
To guide my doubting footsteps,
To be my strength and stay.

3
I need Thee, precious Jesus!
I need a friend like Thee;
A friend to soothe and comfort,
A friend to care for me:
I need the heart of Jesus,
To feel each anxious care,
To hear my every burden,
And all my sorrow share.

4
I need Thee, precious Jesus!
I need Thee day by day,
To fill me with Thy fulness,
To lead me on my way;
I need Thy Holy Spirit,
To teach me what I am;
To show me more of Jesus,
To point me to the Lamb.

5
I need Thee, precious Jesus!
And hope to see Thee soon,
Encircled with Thy glory,
And seated on Thy throne;
There with Thy blood-bought people,
My joy shall ever be
To praise Thee, precious Jesus,
To gaze, my Lord, on Thee.

Christ the Savior is just the One you need,
He’s God incarnate, as a man indeed;
In His body He suffered every pain
And died to cleanse your every stain,
So you need Jesus!
You need Jesus! You need Jesus!
Men and women all need Him!                     
For redemption you need Him,
For salvation you need Him!
And for everlasting life,
Yes, you need Jesus!

He has risen and gone up into heav’n,
That life eternal might be fully giv’n;
Just receive Him, believing in your heart,
Then all you need He will impart,
So you need Jesus!

3
He’ll enlighten your darkened heart with light,
Forgive your sins and rescue you with might;
He will cleanse you from all stains with His blood,
And give to you the life of God,
So you need Jesus!

4
In your living there is a lack you sense,
And thru the years it grows the more intense;
Only Jesus this need can satisfy;
All vanity He will defy,
So you need Jesus!
You need Jesus! You need Jesus!
Men and women all need Him!
To escape from vanity,
To obtain reality,
To make life significant,
Yes, you need Jesus!

5
All this world now is rife with toil and pain,
In troubled times there’s nothing to sustain;
All is empty, on what can you rely?
All things reveal and testify
That you need Jesus!


Calgary Songbook :1025

Hymns 1025

1
Give up the world, Christ to obtain,
He is your heart’s very need;
What else can you desire or seek?
All things are empty indeed!
He is so rich, He is so full,
He can fulfill all your needs!
He is so good, He is so sweet,
All your desire He exceeds!

2
Give up the world, Christ to obtain,
He is the One you require;
Once you receive this glorious Christ,
Never the rest you’ll desire.

3
Though very great is all the world,
And very small is your heart,
Yet the great world with all it’s wealth
Never can fill your small heart.

4
If you have Christ, you have all joys;
Without this Christ, only pains;
Where there is Christ there morning is;
Where He is not, night remains.
Hymns 1043


Calgary Songbook :1043


1
Life at best is very brief,
Like the falling of a leaf,
Like the binding of a sheaf,
Be in time!
Fleeting days are telling fast
That the die will soon be cast,
And the fatal line be passed,
Be in time!
Be in time! Be in time!
While the voice of Jesus calls you,
If in sin you longer wait,
You may find no open gate,
And your cry be just too late:
Be in time!                     

2
Fairest flowers soon decay,
Youth and beauty pass away;
O you have not long to stay,
Be in time!
While God’s Spirit bids you come,
Sinner, do not longer roam,
Lest you seal your hopeless doom,
Be in time!

3
Time is gliding swiftly by,
Death and judgment draweth nigh,
To the arms of Jesus fly,
Be in time!
O I pray you count the cost!
Ere the fatal line be crossed,
And your soul in hell be lost,
Be in time!

4
Sinner, heed the warning voice,
Make the Lord your final choice,
Then all heaven will rejoice,
Be in time!
Come from darkness into light;
Come, let Jesus make you right;
Come, receive His life tonight,
Be in time!
Hymns 1048

1
Just as I am, without one plea,
But that Thy blood was shed for me,                     
And that Thou bid’st me come to Thee,
O Lamb of God, I come! I come!

2
Just as I am, and waiting not
To rid my soul of one dark blot;
To Thee whose blood can cleanse each spot,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

3
Just as I am, though tossed about
With many a conflict, many a doubt;
Fightings within, and fears without,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

4
Just as I am, poor, wretched, blind;
Sight, riches, healing of the mind;
Yes, all I need, in Thee to find,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

5
Just as I am, Thou wilt receive,
Wilt welcome, pardon, cleanse, relieve;
Because Thy promise I believe,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

6
Just as I am, Thy love unknown
Has broken every barrier down;
Now, to be Thine, yea, Thine alone,
O Lamb of God, I come, I come!

Out of my bondage, sorrow, and night,
Jesus, I come!  Jesus, I come!

Out of despair into raptures above,
Upward for aye on wings like a dove,

Out of the fear and dread of the tomb,
Jesus, I come!  Jesus, I come!
Into the joy and pleasure, Thine own,
Jesus, I come to Thee!
Out of the depths of ruin untold,
Into the flock Thy love doth enfold,
Ever Thy glorious face to behold,
Jesus, I come to Thee!

Calgary Songbook :1

I hear Thy welcome voice,
That calls me, Lord, to Thee,
For cleansing in Thy precious blood
That flowed on Calvary.
I am coming, Lord,
Coming now to Thee:
Wash me, cleanse me in the blood
That flowed on Calvary.


Calgary Songbook :2

Though coming weak and vile,
Thou dost my strength assure;
Thou dost my vileness fully cleanse,
Till spotless all, and pure.


Calgary Songbook :3

’Tis Jesus who confirms
The blessed work within,
By adding grace to welcomed grace,
Where reigned the power of sin.

And He the witness gives
To loyal hearts and free,
That every promise is fulfilled,
If faith but brings the plea.

Calgary Songbook :1057


1
Jesus, lover of my soul,
Let me to Thy bosom fly,
While the nearer waters roll,
While the tempest still is high.
Hide me, O my Savior, hide,
Till the storm of life is past;
Safe into the haven guide;
O receive my soul at last.

2
Other refuge have I none,
Hangs my helpless soul on Thee;
Leave, oh, leave me not alone,
Still support and comfort me.
All my trust on Thee is stayed,
All my help from Thee I bring;
Cover my defenseless head
With the shadow of Thy wing.

3
Thou, O Christ, art all I want,
More than all in Thee I find;
Raise the fallen, cheer the faint,
Heal the sick and lead the blind.
Just and holy is Thy Name,
I am all unrighteousness;
Vile and full of sin I am;
Thou art full of truth and grace.

4
Plenteous grace with Thee is found,
Grace to cover all my sin;
Let the healing streams abound;
Make and keep me pure within.
Thou of life the fountain art,
Freely let me take of Thee;
Spring Thou up within my heart;
Rise to all eternity.


Calgary Songbook :1066

Hymns 1066

1
Down at the cross where my Savior died,
God’s righteous nature was satisfied;
There to my sin was the blood applied;
Glory to His name!                     
Glory to His name,
Glory to His name;
There to my sin was the blood applied;*
Glory to His name!

2
I am so wondrously saved from sin,
Jesus so sweetly abides within;
There at the cross where He took me in;
Glory to His name!

3
Oh, precious fountain that saves from sin,
I am so glad I have entered in;
There Jesus saves me and keeps me clean;
Glory to His name!

4
Come to this fountain so rich and sweet;
Cast thy poor soul at the Savior’s feet;
Plunge in today and be made complete;
Glory to His name!

Hymns 1068


Calgary Songbook :1068


1
In tenderness He sought me,
Weary and sick with sin,
And on His shoulders brought me
Into His flock again.
While angels in His presence sang
Until the courts of heaven rang.
Oh, the love that sought me!
Oh, the blood that bought me!
Oh, the grace that brought me to the flock,
Wondrous grace that brought me to the flock!

2
He washed the bleeding sin-wounds,
And poured in oil and wine;
He whispered to assure me,
“I’ve found thee, thou are Mine:”
I never heard a sweeter voice,
It made my aching heart rejoice.

3
He pointed to the nail-prints,
For me His blood was shed;
A mocking crown so thorny,
Was placed upon His head:
I wondered what He saw in me,
To suffer such deep agony.

4
I’m sitting in His presence,
The sunshine of His face,
While with adoring wonder
His blessings I retrace.
It seems as if eternal days
Are far too short to sound His praise.

5
So while the hours are passing,
All now is perfect rest;
I’m waiting for the morning,
The brightest and the best,
When He will call us to His side,
To be with Him, His spotless Bride.


Calgary Songbook :1070

Hymns 1070

1
I was sinking deep in sin,
Far from the peaceful shore,
Very deeply stained within,
Sinking to rise no more;
But the Master of the sea
Heard my despairing cry,
From the waters lifted me,
Now safe am I.
Love lifted me!
When nothing else could help,
Love lifted me.
(Repeat)    

2
All my heart to Him I give,
Ever to Him I’ll cling,
In His blessed presence live,
Ever His praises sing.
Love so mighty and so true
Merits my soul’s best songs;
Faithful, loving service, too,
To Him belongs.

3
Souls in danger, look above,
Jesus completely saves;
He will lift you by His love
Out of the angry waves.
He’s the Master of the sea,
Billows His will obey;
He your Savior wants to be—
Be saved today.
Hymns 1079


Calgary Songbook :1079


1
If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,
Were my life worth living for a day?
Could my yearning heart find rest and comfort
In the things that soon must pass away?
If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,                     
Would my gain be worth the lifelong strife?
Are all earthly pleasures worth comparing
For a moment with a Christ-filled life?

2
Had I wealth and love in fullest measure,
And a name revered both far and near,
Yet no hope beyond, no harbor waiting,
Where my storm-tossed vessel I could steer;
If I gained the world, but lost the Savior,
Who endured the cross and died for me,
Could then all the world afford a refuge,
Whither, in my anguish, I might flee?

3
O what emptiness!—without the Savior
’Mid the sins and sorrows here below!
And eternity, how dark without Him!
Only night and tears and endless woe!
What, though I might live without the Savior,
When I come to die, how would it be?
O to face the valley’s gloom without Him!
And without Him all eternity!

4
O the joy of having all in Jesus!
What a balm the broken heart to heal!
Ne’er a sin so great, but He’ll forgive it,
Nor a sorrow that He does not feel!
If I have but Jesus, only Jesus,
Nothing else in all the world beside—
O then everything is mine in Jesus;
For my needs and more He will provide.


Calgary Songbook :1080

Hymns 1080

1
What profit all the labor here?
There’s nothing new for you and me!
Remember not the former things,
They’re all vanity!                     
Vanity! Vanity!
’Tis chasing the wind,
It’s all vanity!

2
Man’s life is full of grief and pain:
Much wisdom bringeth misery!
Increasing knowledge addeth woe!
It’s all vanity!

3
What good our pleasure and our wealth?
Though joys we have and family,
We’ll have our worries just the same!
It’s all vanity!

4
Days of toil to gain and restless nights:
Though gained without calamity,
When death comes it is gone for aye!
It’s all vanity!

5
Remember God in days of youth!
Fear Him, and such will be your gain!
With Him you will be satisfied,
For He is not vain!
Christ without, all is vain!
Christ within, all is gain!
All things are vain,
Christ only is gain!
Hymns 1083

1
O how nigh the Lord is unto
all who call on Him!
When we call, His very presence
strengthens us within.
Seeking Jesus, He is found,
and calling, He is near—
O what a comfort to our hearts
to call His name so dear!
Jesus! O what a name!
O Lord Jesus! Life-giving name!
Name victorious, name all-glorious,                     
Name exalted—O what a name!
Jesus! Strengthening name!
O Lord Jesus! Comforting name!
Name to breathe in prayer, calling everywhere,
“O Lord Jesus!” O what a name!

2
Call upon the name of Jesus,
and you will be saved,
O Lord Jesus, hallelujah,
nevermore enslaved!
We may take salvation’s cup
by calling on the Lord;
Salvation from a host of things does
His dear name afford.

3
To the Lord, the Jew, the Greek
and everyone’s the same;
He is rich unto all men
that call upon His name.
O Lord Jesus, what a joy
to call and really live;
When breathing in Thy name, what pleasure
Thou to us dost give.

4
In the God of our salvation
we may take delight,
Calling on His name at all times,
though in bliss or blight.
I will call upon His name
as long as I shall live,
Because He has inclined His ear, and
grace so full does give.

5
We will call upon the Lord,
who’s worthy of our praise;
Thus our grateful hearts in worship
we to Him may raise.
We are those who call upon His
name in every place
With all the saints who from a pure heart
call and taste His grace.
Hymns 1084

Thy name is as ointment poured forth:
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus!
Thy name is as ointment poured forth,
Thy name is as ointment poured forth.

2
Therefore do the virgins love Thee...

3
Thy love is much better than wine...

4
Draw me, we will run after Thee...

5
Behold, Thou art fair, my Beloved...

6
I found Him whom my soul doth love...

I held Him and would not let go...

Make haste, my Beloved, to come...

We love Thee with all of our heart...

1
How we love the glorious name,
The name of Jesus!
’Tis the name above all names—
On earth or in heav’n.                     
As we breathe this precious name,
Darkness and death cannot remain;
For we call and get the Person of that name!                     
Touching Jesus
is all that really matters,
And your life
will never be the same.                     
But there is only
one way to really touch Him,                     
Just believe
when you call on His name.

2
Dear Lord Jesus, with our tongues—
We gladly confess Thy name,
To the glory of the Father God above.
For to us to speak Thy praise,
Is the enjoyment of our days;
Calling JESUS is to call the One we love!
Hymns 1096

’Tis the local church proclaiming,
Jesus is Lord!
All the saints with joy are naming
Jesus as Lord.
All His work He has completed,
Satan and his hosts defeated;
On the throne of glory seated,

Jesus is the living Spirit,
He is here, all people, hear it:
Be no more a poor lamenter;
Call on Him, and He will enter
And become your glorious center —
Jesus is Lord!

He will transform all your living,
Jesus, the Lord!
All His riches to you giving,
He’ll forever satisfy you,
Everyday real life supply you,
And with God will unify you,
Jesus, the Lord!

In His mercy He received us,
He will never, never leave us,
All the fullness of His being
In His Body we are seeing,
And the enemy is fleeing —
Jesus is Lord!

Now the Triune God has come to dwell within
As the wonderful Spirit in us.
We are mingled with the Lord, we’re one with Him
As the life-giving Spirit in us.                     
Oh, He’s the wonderful Spirit in us,

As the wonderful Spirit within.
He has been transfigured, we enjoy Him thus,
As the life-giving Spirit within.

Now the Spirit of reality is here
As the wonderful Spirit within.
Now the things of Christ are all so real and clear
By the life-giving Spirit within.

1
In the Word of God I found it,
Wonderful this Word to me;
I need not man’s natural teaching,
The anointing lives in me!
Yes, in my spirit now He is moving!
Yes, I have the anointing!
God in me is flowing!
Thank God, I see it!
His Word revealed it!
I will apply it ever!
The anointing lives in me!

2
Making Christ experiential,
God at His pure Word I take;
As the Spirit joined unto me,
He cannot His promise break.

3
Based upon the blood that cleanses
So that nothing stands between,
Christ, the ointment, moves within me!
For His move I’m made so clean.

4
God in Christ as life in Spirit
Into my own spirit came!
He the Holy One anoints me
Till in spirit we’re the same.

5
God in Spirit; I can touch Him;
In my spirit He’s the flow.
Deeper, wider, richer, fuller—
Oh, the very God I know!

6
As I heed “that same anointing”
Ever to “abide in Him,”
He is teaching, He is reaching,
Even all my heart to win.


Calgary Songbook :1123

Hymns 1123

1
Of the Spirit, born of Spirit—
This the source of Jesus is;
Filled with Spirit, all of Spirit—
This the essence truly His.
In the Spirit, with the Spirit,
As the Spirit Jesus came;
Now the Lord is just that Spirit
And in spirit we’re the same.

2
Baptized in the Holy Spirit,
In the Spirit we’re immersed;
All the church is born of Spirit,
All religion is dispersed.
In the Spirit, in the Spirit—
Brothers, this is all we need.
Now the church must be in Spirit,
Not in teaching, form, or creed.

3
The communion of the Spirit
Is the fellowship we share;
All the brothers, all the sisters
Only for the Spirit care.
Now the Spirit in the churches
Speaks to those who have an ear.
Seven Spirits for the churches
Are our blessed portion here.

4
“Come and drink the living water,”
Say the Spirit and the Bride—
Church and Spirit speak together,
Utterly identified.
Just according to the Spirit
Must be our reality;
Just the Spirit in the churches
Is the Lord’s recovery.
Hymns 1127

God has saved me from the world;
I’ll never go back anymore.
God has saved me from the world;
No, no, no, no, no,
I’ll never go back anymore;
I’ll never go back anymore.

2
I’ve come out from Babylon;
I’ve come out from Babylon;

3
Since I found the local church,
I’ll never go back anymore.
Since I found the local church,

4
Since I’ve touched the Lord within,
Since I’ve touched the Lord within,
I’ll never go back anymore.

5
Christ is everything to me;
Christ is everything to me;

6
Praise the Lord, I’m home at last;
I’ll never go back anymore.
Praise the Lord, I’m home at last;

7
I’m for God’s recovery;
I’m for God’s recovery;
I’ll never go back anymore.

Hymns 1129

1
“So great a salvation,” ye saints of the Lord,
To us is revealed in His marvelous Word!
Since all that He is and has done is for us,
We’ll give earnest heed to this word glorious.

2
What He is of God and of Man as the Son,
We now may enjoy since with Him we are one;
Our High Priest and Captain—salvation is He!
He’ll cause us to grow in His glory to be.

3
He’s washed all our sins, purified them fore’er;
Tasted death on the cross, ended slavery there.
He took on our nature, the devil has slain,
And put you and I in His glorious train.

4
So great the extent of salvation to us—
We’re partners of Christ in His plan glorious.
He’ll bring us to glory and we’ll rule with Him,
To the uttermost saved by His working within.

5
To such a salvation our heed we must give,
Lest drifting away or neglecting we live.
Christ now as our life, future ruling with Him,
We’ll miss if we miss this salvation within.

6
“So great a salvation” is given to us
That we may be made like our Lord glorious!
By all that He is and by all He has done
We’re brought into glory with God’s firstborn Son.
Hymns 1131


Calgary Songbook :1131


1
In a low dungeon, hope we had none;
Tried to believe, but faith didn’t come;
God, our sky clearing, Jesus appearing,                     
We by God were transfused!                     
We by God were transfused!
Propitiation made by the blood,
Jesus’ redemption bought us for God!
No condemnation, justification!                     
We have peace toward God!                     
We have peace toward God!

2
Born into Adam, dying we were;
We had a sickness no one could cure.
God, His Son sending, old Adam ending;
He is dead, we are free!

3
Now we’re rejoicing, standing in grace,
Oh hallelujah! Sin is erased!
God, in us flowing, in our hearts growing,
We are saved in His life!

We will sing to the Lord with our spirit,                     
We will sing to the Lord from within,                     
We will sing hallelujah to Jesus;                     
And be blent into oneness with Him.                     

2
We have been many years in religion,
We have been many years in our mind,
We have been many years in emotions,
Always seeking, but never to find.

3
Now we’re learning to turn to our spirit,
Now we’re learning to take Christ as life;
Now we’re learning to feed upon Jesus
And be freed from all struggling and strife.

4
Hallelujah for life in the Spirit,
Hallelujah for newness within.
When we turn from our mind to our spirit,
We enjoy all the riches of Him.
Hymns 1142

Jesus is the living Spirit,
Our reality;
We enjoy Him just by calling
In simplicity.

That call upon His name.

He is living now within us,
Giving liberty;
He is good and He is gracious
As we taste and see.

3
Jesus is the living Spirit
And the living Word;
When we touch Him by pray-reading
We receive this Lord.

4
Jesus is the living Spirit
Who among us flows;
Fellowship of life in spirit
Unity bestows.

5
Jesus is the living Spirit,
He is our rich feast;
As the Body now enjoys Him,
Praises are released.
Hymns 1143


Calgary Songbook :1143


1
The tree of life, how sweet the fruit,
With God as life complete.
I once was dead, but now I live,
Was starved, but now I eat.

2
’Twas God that brought me to the tree,
With Christ Himself as meat;
How precious did that tree become
When I began to eat.

3
The Lord Himself is food to me,
He is my life supply;
He will my pure enjoyment be,
None else can satisfy.

4
I freely eat this living tree,
For eating is the way
To put God’s life inside of me,
To live by Him today.


Calgary Songbook :1145

Hymns 1145

1
God gave His Son to man to be
The tree of life so rich and free,
That every man may taste and see
That God is good for food.
Yes, God is good for food!
We’ve tasted and we testify
That God is good for food!

2
We eat this feast and take God in,
And as we eat we live by Him,
For all the elements within
This feast are God Himself.
Yes, Jesus is our feast!
We eat this feast and live by Him,
For Jesus is our feast!

3
Christ Jesus is the food we eat;
He is our bread, He is our meat;
He is our life-supply complete;
We daily eat of Him.
We daily eat of Him,

4
This feast is so enjoyable;
To men it’s so available,
For God said whosoever will
May come and freely eat.
Yes, come and freely eat;
Yes, come and freely eat.
For God said whosoever will
May come and freely eat.
Hymns 1148

1
Come and dine, the Lord is calling,
“Come and dine”
We can eat and drink of Jesus all the time!
He’s our daily food supply,
Only He can satisfy.
“Come and dine,” the Lord is calling,
“Come and dine.”

2
“Come and dine,” the Lord is calling,
When we eat and drink of Jesus all the time,
He becomes our life within,
And He fills us to the brim.
“Come and dine,” the Lord is calling,
“Come and dine.”

1
Of Him whence grace and truth did spring,
We’re at the fountain drinking;
This Christ we’ll ever praise and sing,
Here in the church, His home!
Glory to God! We’re at the fountain drinking!
Glory to God! We’re in the church, our home!

2
Ask but His grace, and lo, ’tis giv’n,
We’re at the fountain drinking;
Seek but Himself, the heaven of heaven,
And find Him here at home!

3
Though Satan fights with all his power,
We’re at the fountain drinking;
He’ll not prevail, not one short hour,
Against the church, our home!

Athirst we to this spring do fly,
We’re at the fountain drinking;
Drink deep, this well will not run dry!
It’s in the church, our home!

Hymns 1150

1
We are feeding on the living bread,
We are drinking at the fountainhead;
And whoso drinketh, Jesus said,
Shall never, never thirst again.
What, never thirst again? No, never thirst again!
Shall never, never thirst again!                     

2
We are feeding on the living bread,
Eating of the feast our Lord has spread,
And whoso eateth, Jesus said,
Shall hunger nevermore.
What, hunger nevermore? Yes, hunger nevermore!

3
We are breathing in the living air,
Breathing in the One whose life we share,
And whoso breatheth—now, fore’er—
Shall have the life of God.
What, have the life of God? Yes, have the life of God!

4
We are tasting of the living wine,
In spirit tasting life divine,
And whoso tasteth, ev’rytime
Shall have the joy of God.
What, have the joy of God? Yes, have the joy of God!

5
Christ is the resurrected king,
Who died and rose, our life to bring,
If you receive Him you will sing,
And live forevermore.
What, live forevermore? Yes, live forevermore!

Calgary Songbook :1151


1
Drink! A river pure and clear
that’s flowing from the throne;
Eat! The tree of life
with fruits abundant, richly grown;
Look! No need of lamp nor sun nor moon
to keep it bright, for
Here there is no night!                     
Do come, oh, do come,
Says Spirit and the Bride:
Let him that heareth, cry.
Let him who thirsts and will
Take freely the water of life!                     

2
Christ, our river, Christ, our water,
springing from within;
Christ, our tree, and Christ, the fruits,
to be enjoyed therein,
Christ, our day, and Christ, our light,
and Christ, our morning star:
Christ, our everything!

3
We are washing all our robes the tree of life to eat;
“O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!”—Jesus is so sweet!
We our spirits exercise, and thus experience Christ.
What a Christ have we!

4
Now we have a home so bright that outshines the sun,
Where the brothers all unite and truly are one.
Jesus gets us all together, Him we now display
In the local church.

Hymns 1152

1
To Jesus every day we find
our hearts are closer drawn;
He’s fairer than the sons of men
and fresher than the morn;
He’s all that we can say of Him
in fairest words and more,
And every day He’s dearer than
He was the day before.
The half cannot be fancied
of such a treasure-store,
And every day He’s dearer than
He ever was before!

2
His glory broke upon us
when we saw Him in the church,
For here are all His riches,
here we’ve given up our search;
’Tis here He satisfies
our longing spirits o’er and o’er,
And every day He’s dearer than
He was the day before.

3
Now He’s the living Spirit
who within our spirit dwells,
And by His sweet anointing,
how His life within us swells!
As withthe saints we’re meeting,
full released our spirits soar,
For now our Lord is dearer than
He ever was before.

4
The Lord has made us one with Him
for His recovery:
The riches of this Christ, the church
His fulness, men must see.
Yes, all we have and all we are,
we every day outpour
For His tremendous purpose,
ever dearer than before.
Hymns 1153


Calgary Songbook :1153


1
We have found the Christ who’s all in all;
He is everything to us;
O how blest upon His Name to call,
How divine, how glorious!
It is joy unspeakable and full of glory,
Full of glory, full of glory;
And the half has never yet been told!

2
We have found that Christ the Spirit is
Who within our spirit dwells;
How available, how near He is,
And His sweetness all excels.

3
We have found the way to live by Christ—
Pray His Word and call His Name!
This—the eating, drinking—has sufficed
And its worth we now proclaim.

4
We have found the local church, our home;
We are home and home indeed!
Nevermore in Babylon we roam;
In the church is all we need.

5
We have found that meeting with the saints
Is the greatest joy on earth;
’Tis by this our spirit never faints
And our lives are filled with worth.

Hymns 1154

1
I love Thee, Jesus,
And Thy love to me
Draws me, ever to seek Thee
And run after Thee,
And run after Thee.
Thou art beloved,
Yea! Altogether lovely,
The One in whom my heart delighteth.
(Repeat last 3 lines of each verse)    

2
Thy love, Lord Jesus,
Is sweeter than wine,
And Thy fragrance of ointments
My heart doth entwine,
My heart doth entwine.
A fount in gardens,
A well of living waters,
Which streams and flows from Lebanon’s
mountains.

3
O come Beloved,
On my garden blow,
That the odor of spices
May break forth and flow,
May break forth and flow.
My spouse, My sister,
I’m come into My garden
To feast upon wine, milk and honey.

4
Set me, Lord Jesus,
A seal on Thine heart;
Jealousy’s cruel as Sheol,
And love’s strong as death,
And love’s strong as death.
Much water cannot
Quench love, nor do floods drown it.
All man could give for love is contemned.
Hymns 1158


Calgary Songbook :1158


1
Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
Thou hast won each love from me;
Who like Thee — so fair and comely?
Who like Thee — so sweet and lovely?
Matchless One, unrivalled beauty,
None can e’er compete with Thee!

2
Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
Gladly will I hear Thy call;
Since Thy voice my heart hath entered,
I from all things could but sever;
Void are all my other seekings,
Every pride hath disappeared.

3
Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
How can I still stubborn be?
At Thy feet cast all my hard’nings,
And return with songs and singings;
’Tis my love to be Thy bondslave,
’Tis my joy to Thee obey.

4
Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
Thy way only will I choose;
Though in tears while I’m obeying,
Yet I would not change my standing;
All I long for is Thy pleasure,
And the peace Thy love would bring.

5
Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
When Thy presence does depart,
Seems the dawn has lost its traces,
Hidden are my smiling faces;
All I yearn for is Thy coming
All Thy presence’ sweet embrace.

6
Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
Can I tell it all to Thee?
Thou my love and satisfaction,
Thou my everlasting portion;
Thou art all that I desire,
Nothing else I would pursue.

7
Dear Lord Jesus, precious Jesus,
All I have I give to Thee;
Who like Thee — so fair and comely?
Who like Thee — so sweet and lovely?
Matchless One, unrivaled beauty,
None can e’er compete with Thee!
Hymns 1159


Calgary Songbook :1159


1
Jesus Lord, I’m captured by Thy beauty,                     
All my heart to Thee I open wide;
Now set free from all religious duty,                     
Only let me in Thyself abide.
As I’m gazing here upon Thy glory,
Fill my heart with radiancy divine;
Saturate me, Lord, I now implore Thee,
Mingle now Thy Spirit, Lord, with mine.

2
Shining One—how clear the sky above me!
Son of Man, I see Thee on the throne!
Holy One, the flames of God consume me,
Till my being glows with Thee alone.
Lord, when first I saw Thee in Thy splendor,
All self-love and glory sank in shame;
Now my heart its love and praises render,
Tasting all the sweetness of Thy name.

3
Precious Lord, my flask of alabaster
Gladly now I break in love for Thee;
I anoint Thy head, Beloved Master;
Lord, behold, I’ve saved the best for Thee.
Dearest Lord, I waste myself upon Thee;
Loving Thee, I’m deeply satisfied.
Love outpoured from hidden depths within me,
Costly oil, dear Lord, I would provide.

4
My Beloved, come on spices’ mountain;
How I yearn to see Thee face to face.
Drink, dear Lord, from my heart’s flowing fountain,
Till I rest fore’er in Thine embrace.
Not alone, O Lord, do I adore Thee,
But with all the saints as Thy dear Bride;
Quickly come, our love is waiting for Thee;
Jesus Lord, Thou wilt be satisfied.
Hymns 1162

1
We’ve found the secret of living,
We’ve seen the vision divine:
We are of God in Christ Jesus,
We’re abiding, abiding in the Vine.
Abiding in the Vine,
Abiding in the Vine
All the riches of God’s life are mine!
Praise God, He put us here,
Never to leave; oh, we’re—
Abiding, abiding in the Vine.

2
No more in vain need we struggle,
Trying “the way in” to find.
Praise God we’re “in Him” already,
Hallelujah, abiding in the Vine.

3
In us, the ointment is moving,
’Tis the anointing divine;
God’s precious essence bestowing,
While abiding, abiding in the Vine.

4
Now in the life-flow we’re living,
O how the light in us shines!
Both God and man are at home now
By the mutual abiding in the Vine.

Hymns 1170

1
The Lord is my Shepherd forever,
He maketh me down to lie,
He leads me beside the still waters
O how He does satisfy!
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
All the days, all the days of my life;
All the days, all the days of my life.
And I shall dwell in the house of the Lord forever,
And I shall feast at the table spread for me;                     
Surely goodness and mercy shall follow me
All the days, all the days of my life.

2
My Shepherd Himself is my pasture,
My Shepherd, the waters of rest;
I eat of His riches in spirit,
I drink, and O how I am blest!

3
My Shepherd my soul is restoring,
My will, and emotion, and mind;
And though through the valley I’m walking,
O what a Companion I find!

4
A table prepared by my Shepherd
I feast on and Satan destroy;
My head is anointed with oil,
My cup runneth over with joy!

5
And now in His house I am dwelling
Enjoying the goodness of God;
My pleasure is far beyond telling,
My pleasure is Jesus my Lord!
Hymns 1178


Calgary Songbook :1178


1
We have seen Christ is reality:
But it’s not sufficient just to see:
He in our experience must be
Everything to us.
We in prayer behold him face to face,
In the Word and meetings know His grace;
But in daily life, in every place,
What is He to us?
Hallelujah! By His light we see                     
Oh, how real, how full our Lord will be                     
If we’ll only turn to Him at every time,
in every day,
Everything, in every way and-–
Be specific for reality!                     
And be done with generality!
If we’ll just apply Him, we will see
He’s everything to us.

2
Life is full of opportunities
Ordered by our Father’s hand: we see
Everything’s the best that it could be,
So let’s gain Christ!
Christ our content and reality
To shine out from us unceasingly:
He must have a way in you and me,
He must have a way.
Hallelujah! In the body we
Bear the death of Christ continually:
Thus His life comes forth for all to see as
The outer man is broken down,
The inner man is shining so that—
In these earthen vessels men can see
There’s the treasure of reality!
Thus the gospel’s glorious light will be
Shining out from us.
Not just doctrines and theology,
But the content of reality:
Christ as everything in you and me,
He’s everything to us!
Hymns 1179


Calgary Songbook :1179


1
My old man has been crucified with Him,
With all its foul corruption deep within;
And buried too its nature serpentine,
Completely finished—this great fact is mine,
I hold it fast.

2
But there’s a Person in my spirit now,
Born as a babe so small, so weak, so low;
Who by the Word’s pure milk will grow to be
The overcoming inner man in me
To gain my heart.

3
Christ as my Person must possess my heart
And be preeminent in every part.
The former owner died but haunts it still.
O Lord, move in; my mind, emotion, will
Now welcome Thee.

4
In spirit mingled, we are one, O Lord,
The human and divine in one accord;
Yet Thou must have a proper faculty
That all Thy glorious personality
May be expressed.

5
So, Lord, I give my heart to Thee today,
That it may be Thy home in every way,
A place for Thee to come and settle down,
And all Thy grand recovery work to crown
In one new man.


Calgary Songbook :1191

Hymns 1191

1
From my spirit within flows a fountain of life—
The Triune God flowing in me;
God the Father’s the source, Christ the Son is the course,
And the Spirit imparts life to me.
Lord, I treasure the sweet flow of life,
And my soul-life at last I lay down;
O Lord, deepen the pure flow of life;                     
At Your coming may life be my crown.

2
In the fresh, tender grass Jesus makes me lie down;
He leads me by waters of rest;
No more struggle and strain; all self-effort is vain;
In the flow I am perfectly blessed.

3
Jesus called me one day to the Holiest Place,
To live in His presence divine;
Hallelujah, I’ve heard an encouraging word:
“Abide—you’re a branch in the vine.”
Hymns 1193


Calgary Songbook :1193


1
Life is God the Father in Christ Jesus
As the Spirit flowing into us.
How enjoyable, this Person wonderful!
He’s our life so rich and bountiful.

2
We experienced regeneration
When we opened to this living One.
We were born again; another life came in.
Now it floods us till we’re full of Him.

3
He within us is the living Spirit
In our spirit, flowing out of it
Into all our heart, transforming every part
By the life which He Himself imparts.

4
Now He must have our cooperation.
We must set our mind upon the Son.
We must turn away from all that leads astray,
Till our mind is set on Him each day.

5
Lord, our human spirit now contains You.
Still Your purpose in us You would do;
If our wandering mind would leave old thoughts behind,
Then Your life and peace in it we’ll find.

6
Lord, we would our every thought be captured
By the rich enjoyment in Your Word.
In it we’re supplied, our mind there will abide,
Till our thinking is so sanctified.

7
Let’s keep practicing the application
Of this life by minding just the Son.
Praise Him for the way to live by Him today!
Lord, on You our minds will ever stay.


Calgary Songbook :1196

Hymns 1196

1
Our God is living—say, Hallelujah!
He’s living in us—say, Hallelujah!
We taste His riches,
He is our portion.
Just say “O Lord” to taste and see.

2
We come together—there’s nothing better—
For in the Spirit we are His family,
His living Body!
We just express Him.
Jesus is our reality.

3
In all the churches we’re being filled now
For the saturation throughout the nation,
To spread our Jesus
To every city—
This land will see the living Christ.
Hymns 1197

God is light, and in Him there is no darkness at all!
Oh, how we love within His presence to dwell!
In this light we enjoy a constant cleansing within—
From every sin!

Hymns 1198

1
A mighty flowing-out is God,
He flows throughout the ages.                     
And so to flow Himself to man
He is in many stages;
Yet still one God is He,
One flow eternally;
His stages pave the way
To flow through man today,
And now He flows within us!                     

2
In the beginning we can see,
God as a flowing river,
The river to convey the tree,
Himself as life deliver.
And at the end the same,
The river doth remain,
God in the Lamb doth flow,
The tree prevails to grow,
And God flows on forever.

3
God flowed Himself into a man,
The man we call Christ Jesus.
He gave up His own life for man
And God’s own life releases.
Though Satan did his best
To put God’s flow to rest—
He had Him crucified
And cruelly pierced His side—
But out came blood and water!

4
The blood and water flowed from Him,
In streams of pure salvation.
The blood brings cleansing from all sin;
Water, regeneration.
And now the Spirit flows,
Brings God where’er He goes.
All he could do, the foe,
Was just release the flow.
And God just keeps on flowing.
Hymns 1199

1
God’s intention in this universe is with humanity,
So the Lord became the Spirit just with man to mingled be.
We rejoice that we can all partake of His economy.
Yes, mingling is the way.
Mingle, mingle, hallelujah,
Yes, mingling is the way!

2
In the center of our being, past our mind, emotion, will,
Is a certain spot created to contain the Lord until
By His flowing and His flooding He will all our being fill;
Yes, mingling is the way.

3
Now within the Lord’s recov’ry,
we’re so glad to find the way
To experience the Triune God and live by Him today—
Get into the mingled spirit, and within the spirit stay;
Yes, mingling is the way.

4
In the midst of seven lampstands,
now the Son of Man we see;
Eyes ablaze and feet a’burning, He’s for God’s recovery.
God’s intention He’s accomplishing—a corporate entity;
Yes, mingling is the way.

5
In our daily life and all we are and do and think and say,
How we need a deeper mingling
just to gain the Lord each day;
Lord, we give ourselves completely
just to take the mingled way.
Yes, mingling is the way.

6
From the fruit of daily living, New Jerusalem we’ll see,
It’s the ultimate in mingling—it’s divine humanity.
And what joy that we can share it all,
and share it corporately.
Yes, mingling is the way.

There’s a race for us to run—Hallelujah,
And a way for us the race to win.                     
To all those who have begun—Hallelujah,
God has spoken, “Look away to Him!”
Look away!  O look away!
Look to Jesus now today!                     
Look away from everything unto Jesus,
Look away from everything to Him!

Look away toward the goal—Hallelujah,

To the Living One hold fast—Hallelujah,
Look away from everything to Him.

We obtain by looking off to Him!

Hymns 1208

1
Years I spent in sorrow ’round the cross,
Still repenting over sins and dross.
Then at last the river I did cross,
To touch the throne.
Mercy now is flowing, oh, the grace—
That I find of Him to run the race!
Boldly now I come again to taste
My glorious Lord.

2
In my Christian life I’d daily fall,
So I answered every altar-call,
Till I left the altar, left it all,
To touch the throne.

3
Brothers, to the Holiest forward come;
Leave your sins behind, the race now run.
Hallelujah! All the work is done—
The veil is gone!

4
Now within the veil, enjoying God,
Manna, law of life, and budding rod;
Christ Himself, the ark, is our abode—
Hallelujah!
Hymns 1216


Calgary Songbook :1216


1
We have an inner life;                     
that’s for our daily life;
That’s for the meeting life—just Christ!
We’ll live the inner life;
we’ll have the daily life;
We’ll see the meeting life—
that’s just the church.

2
Christ is our inner life;
He’s in our spirit now;
Not far away from us—He’s right inside!
And as we turn to Him
and take Him as our all
He will become in us
our inner life.

3
Out from our inner life
will come our daily life,
And all our living be filled up with Christ.
Then as we live by Him,
He lives His life in us,
And He becomes to us
our daily life.

4
The real experience
of Christ in daily life,
Will fill the meeting life with Christ Himself.
Not empty forms and such,
but Christ will be so much;
And we will see Him here
as the meeting life.

5
Without the inner life
there is no daily life,
There is no meeting life, there is no church!
Christ as our inner life,
Christ in our daily life
Will make the meeting life
new and glorious!

1
Jesus, our wonderful Shepherd
Brought us right out of the fold                     
Into His pasture so plenteous,
Into His riches untold.
Glorious church life,
Feasting from such a rich store!
Here where we’re dwelling in oneness
God commands life evermore.

2
In the divisions He sought us,
Weary and famished for food;
Into the good land He brought us,
Oh, to our spirit how good!

3
Jesus Himself is our pasture,
He is the food that we eat;
We as His sheep are fed richly
Each time, whenever we meet.

4
Dwell we here on a high mountain,
Wet with the morning-fresh dew,
Slaking our thirst at the fountain,
Water so living and new.

5
Christ is our rest and enjoyment,
Here we have nothing to fear;
Here all the sheep dwell securely,
Kept by His presence so dear.

1
Sing aloud your praises to the Lord of all,
Now He is dwelling in Jerusalem.
Tell among us all His doings great and small,
His throne, the heavens, yet He walks with men.
Oh, the salvation out of Zion comes;
He brought us back from our captivity.
Now we rejoice and are exceeding glad;
Now we rejoice and are exceeding glad!

2
In the Holy City with His own He dwells;
O Lord, our Lord, how excellent Thy name!
He’s enthroned upon the praises of His saints;
All His delight in Zion does remain.
The local churches are His move today—
He is our portion, we are satisfied.
Oh, what a goodly heritage have we;
Oh, what a goodly heritage have we!

3
Who shall in His holy tabernacle dwell,
Who shall ascend to His most holy hill?
Those who seek for Him and purify their heart;
This generation now that seeks His face.
Oh, seek His face, ye children of the earth,
Open your heart, and let the King come in.
He will come in, and He shall live and reign;
He will come in, and He shall live and reign!

4
Look! God’s tabernacle now is with the saints;
Emmanuel—God with us, we proclaim.
Everything is done, so let His children come;
Christ and the church—where God and man are one!
Lift up your heads, ye cities of the earth;
Open your gates, and let the King come in.
Shout to His praise—He’s coming in to reign!
Give yourself to love the Lord.
No other way is so prevailing,
and no other way is so safe,
so rich, and so full of enjoyment.
Just love Him.
Do not care for anything else.
Teachings, doctrines, gifts,
and power do not mean much.
We must continually tell the Lord,
“Lord, keep me in Your love!
Attract me with Yourself!
Keep me all the time
in Your loving presence!”
If we will pray in this way,
we will see what love
we will have toward the Lord and
what kind of life we will live.
We will simply live by the Lord Himself.
As long as we love Him
from the deepest part of our being,
everything will be all right.

Calgary Songbook :1226


1
Oh, the church of Christ is glorious,
and we are part of it—
We’re so happy that the Lord has made us one!                     
There’s a Body in the universe and we belong to it—
Hallelujah, for the Lord has made us one!
Hallelujah for the Body!
We are members of the Body!
We are wholly for the Body!
Hallelujah, for the Lord has made us one!                     

2
Not the individual Christians,
but a corporate entity—
God must have it for His full expression now;
Not just individual churches but the Body corporately—
Hallelujah, we are in the Body now!
Hallelujah for the Body!
Satan trembles at the Body!
We’re victorious in the Body!
Hallelujah, we are in the Body now!

3
There are seven golden lampstands
in the nature all divine—
Nothing natural does the Body life allow.
When we’re one and share God’s nature,
how the lampstand then does shine—
Hallelujah, it is brightly shining now!
Hallelujah for the Body!
For the lampstands of the Body!
For the golden, shining Body!
Hallelujah, it is brightly shining now!

4
How may we express such oneness,
be divine and shining too?
Hallelujah, eating Jesus is the way!
He’s the tree of life, the manna,
and the feast that’s ever new—
Hallelujah, we may eat Him every day!
We are one by eating Jesus!
We’re divine by eating Jesus!
How we shine by eating Jesus!
Hallelujah, eating Jesus is the way!
Hymns 1232


Calgary Songbook :1232


1
Once by nature we were dead in sin,
In a world of utter discord;
But together God has quickened us,
Raised us up to sit together with the Lord.
Jesus is getting us together,
Come and see the saints in one accord.
His love is knitting us together,
To the stature of the fulness of the Lord.

2
Thus with all saints we can apprehend,
All the vast dimensions of God.
Knowing Christ’s love passes all we know.
We’re together filled to fulness with our God.

3
Now we know the purpose of our God,
Visible the mystery became:
Christ, the church, together now we see,
And together put the enemy to shame.

4
For this cause we pray the Father God
Strengthen Thou with might our inner man;
Make Yourself at home in all our hearts,
Root us, ground us in Your love and for Your plan.

5
In the Body we’ll be fitly framed
As the many members Christ supply;
Working in the measure of each part,
All by growth in love the Body edify.

6
Now we’re one His purpose to fulfill,
As the one new man of His plan.
Unto Him be glory in the church,
And in Jesus Christ forevermore—amen!

Hymns 1233


Calgary Songbook :1

O home in the church,
Where we’ve ended our search
With the brothers rejoicing all day;
Where Christ is our life,
And we’re through with all strife,
Now we’re home, Hallelujah, to stay!
Home, home in the church;
Yes, it’s here that we’ve ended our search;
And through all our days
We will shout to His praise,
“Hallelujah for Christ and the church!”


Calgary Songbook :2

Here God is at rest, of His treasures the best—
How His heart is rejoicing all day!
His home is our heart,
Ne’er for Satan a part,
Here His glory He’ll fully display.
God’s home is the church;
Yes, it’s here that He ended His search;
And through all our days
We will shout to His praise,
“Hallelujah for Christ and the church!”

1
I thirsted in the barren land of Babylon
And nothing satisfying there I found;
But to the blessed local church one day I came,
Where springs of living water do abound.
Drinking at the springs of living water,
Happy now am I,
My heart they satisfy;
O wonderful and bountiful supply!

2
How sweet the living water from the hills of God,
It’s flowing in and flowing out of me;
O now I’ve found the place
for which I long had sought,
Where there is life and life abundantly.

3
O brother, won’t you gather in the local church?
A fountain here is flowing deep and wide.
The Shepherd now would bring you
to the local church,
Where thirsty spirits can be satisfied.


Calgary Songbook :1237

Hymns 1237

1
Splendid church life! His green garden!
He has brought us, praise the Lord,
To experience the Christ Who’s growing here!
He is full of rich enjoyment
To His saints in one accord;
He is new and fresh, available and dear!
I’m so happy in this lovely place,
In the garden growing in His grace!
There is no finer pleasure
Than to eat the living tree
And to get the living water into me.                     

2
It is not a school or fact’ry
Or a chapel in the air;
But a garden where our Lord can plant and sow.
So He’s placed us all here corporately
To be His garden fair,
Where He’s free to cultivate and make us grow.

3
Thus within the church-life garden
There’s a fruit-producing tree
Full of life and so available to eat.
So be simple, don’t be hardened,
Drop your concepts—eat that tree!
Take in Jesus every moment—He’s so sweet!

4
With the tree there is the water,
Flowing God in Christ to us,
Quenching all our dryness, ending all our strife.
Hallelujah! In His garden
Jesus flows Himself to us,
As the full supply for us to grow in life.

5
Aren’t you satisfied and thankful
That our Lord has brought you in
Where His pleasures and His riches flow so free?
So be happy and be joyful, in the spirit feast on Him,
So God’s garden can bear fruit abundantly.
Hymns 1238


Calgary Songbook :1238


1
Never did I dream before,                     
Such a place could e’er be found,
Where the tears of sorrow cease,                     
Songs of endless joy abound.
One who seldom ever sang,                     
Now delights his voice to raise;
Singing hymns with all the saints,                     
Echoing the ceaseless praise.

2
Day by day the world goes on,
Just as it has gone before.
Millions grasp and clutch at life,
Wond’ring if there could be more;
Such was I and would be, yet
Mercy found me out somehow;
With what gratefulness I say,
“I’m in God’s own family now.”

3
How delightful ’tis to know;
How subjective, real, and sweet
Is this inward joy of grace
We experience when we meet;
Life abundant Jesus gives
As my full reality;
Praise You, Lord, it’s really true,
I’m in Your own family.

4
At the closing of this age,
Just before Your kingdom’s dawn,
May You gain a people, Lord,
For Your dwelling place, Your home.
Since for me You gave Your all,
Everything I lay aside;
For Your church my all I’d give,
That You would be satisfied.
Throughout the past twenty centuries
thousands of precious lives, heart treasures,
high positions, and golden futures
have been wasted upon the Lord Jesus.
To those who love Him in such a way
He is altogether lovely and
worthy of their offering.
What they have poured upon Him
is not a waste but a fragrant
testimony of His sweetness.
Matthew 26:8 footnote 1
Hymns 1248


Calgary Songbook :1248


1
Recall how David swore,
“I’ll not come into my house,                     
Nor go up to my bed,
Give slumber to mine eyelids,                     
Until I find a place for Thee,
A place, O Lord, for Thee.”
Our mighty God desires a home
Where all His own may come.

2
How blinded we have been:
“We’ll build Your habitation”
When we are short of Christ—
We need Your saturation!
O Lord, You care for our house!
Oh, what a blessed word!
As You’re to God, You’d be to us—
A mutual abode.

3
There’s nothing that we are
Or have or do well-pleasing;
We need Thee, glorious Christ,
Inwrought into our being.
O Lord, our heart’s still vacant now!
Come in and settle down.
Come saturate and permeate
And fill us with Yourself.

4
Our spirit You have filled
At our regeneration,
But mind, emotion, will
Await Your saturation.
How much of You is built in us
To make our heart Your home?
O Triune God, we welcome You.
Come build, oh, build in us.

5
Into our innermost
Intrinsic constitution,
Come, Lord, Yourself dispense
By constant, fresh infusion;
Transform us, Lord, and work Yourself,
As God’s embodiment,
Into our heart, and life each part,
With Your reality.

6
To build Your house today,
Self-effort You’re refusing—
All stubble, wood, and hay;
Gold, silver, gems, You’re using.
The consummated Triune God
Transmitted into us
Now builds Himself into a home—
His dwelling, glorious.
(Repeat the last four lines)    
Ezra 1-3
Hymns 1251


Calgary Songbook :1251


1
To Jerusalem we’ve come,
We are through with Babylon,
We have gathered to be one,
O glory be to God!
Of the teachings we’re bereft,
All opinions we have left,
Spirit from the soul is cleft,
In the local churches now.
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
We are all in one accord
For the building of the Lord.
We are living in the
local churches now!

2
That recovery may proceed
Real priests are what we need—
Those who live in Christ indeed,
O glory be to God!
Saturated with the Lord,
They have Christ as their reward.
These the building work afford
In the local churches now.

3
And the kingship we must see
With divine authority—
To this rule we’ll all agree,
O glory be to God!
To the Spirit we’ll submit
For the church’s benefit—
This is His prerequisite
In the local churches now.

4
We the altar must obtain,
Have our all upon it lain.
The burnt-offering must be slain,
O glory be to God!
This we never should dispute,
For the church be absolute,
All that’s otherwise uproot
In the local churches now.

5
The foundation now is laid—
O what glory doth pervade!
We are all with joy arrayed,
O glory be to God!
Let us raise a mighty shout—
They will hear us far without,
And the enemy we’ll rout
In the local churches now.
Ezra 1
Hymns 1252


Calgary Songbook :1252


1
Down in Babylon, in captivity,
Oh, the Lord has stirred our spirit up!
Scattered everywhere, without unity,
Stirred up! Stirred up!

2
Up from Babylon, where the sects abound,
From division we must all rise up!
Brothers, Babylon’s not the proper ground;
Rise up! Rise up!

3
To Jerusalem, from captivity,
God is with us, let us all go up!
To the one unique ground of unity,
Go up! Go up!

4
Platters full of Christ, bowls with Spirit filled—
All the vessels of the Lord bring up!
Bring them to the church as the Lord has willed—
Bring up! Bring up!

5
In Jerusalem, chosen of the Lord,
Now the temple of the Lord build up!
Serve with all the saints, share in one accord,
Build up! Build up!


Calgary Songbook :1255

Hymns 1255

1
We are for the Lord’s recovery
Of the local church;
We are for the Lord’s recovery
Of the city and the earth.
Standing on the ground of oneness,
Oneness in the Lord,
We are building up the temple
Of our glorious Lord.
We are for the Lord’s,
We are for the Lord’s recovery!

2
We are for the Lord’s recovery,
To our hearts so dear;
When we exercise our spirit,
Our vision is so clear.
Babylon the Great is fallen,
Satan is cast down,
And the local church is builded
On the local ground.
Hymns 1256


Calgary Songbook :1256

Praise the Lord,
we’re in the Lord’s recovery—
Home at last,
here in the church.
Praise the Lord,
we’re in the new creation—
One new man,
the end of our search.
With the saints,
builded, coordinated;
No more I, forever “we”.
We are one in the Son,
standing here till He comes;
Yes, nothing can stop our God till He’s done!


Calgary Songbook :1260

Hymns 1260
We’re in the local church,
God’s chosen ground;                     
Here we have Christ as life
And blessings all abound.
“In spirit, on the ground”—
Our battle cry;                     
And we will overcome the enemy
To bring the kingdom nigh.


Calgary Songbook :1266

Hymns 1266

1
Burning, burning, we are burning,
Ever to our spirits turning,
One for Thine eternal purpose, in spirit one;
On the ground of locality,
We express our unity—
Many members, but one Body,
Christ as our Head.
Christ and the local church,
Christ and the church, our reality and life,
Hallelujah! Hallelujah!
Lord, we’ve given our lives to You,
For the building of Your Body,
For our building up in love.

2
Breathing, breathing, we are breathing,
With each breath new life receiving,
What a transformation from the old to the new;
Breathing out the old life from us,
Breathing in new life and oneness,
We are breathing in of Jesus, we are breathing
in of life.
Hymns 1273


Calgary Songbook :1273


1
Christ has called us once to Him,
But He calls us once again.
To His call we say Amen!
Overcome!
For the church has fallen low,
Thinking everything they know,
But the life is missing; so,
Overcome!
Overcome! Overcome!
Overcome degraded Christianity!
All your working lay aside,
All the teachings that divide;
Eat the Lord whate’er betide—
Overcome!

2
Eating is man’s destiny
And the Lord’s recovery;
This defeats the enemy—
Overcome!
Come enjoy the tree of life,
Leave the doctrines, leave the strife!
Overcome by eating Christ—
Overcome!

3
Teachings ne’er transform the soul,
Teachings never reach God’s goal,
Eating Christ will do it all—
Overcome!
We must overcome to eat,
By ourselves and when we meet,
Eat Him as the feast complete—
Overcome!

4
Eating gives the manchild birth,
Eating brings the Lord to earth;
Eat Him now midst all the dearth—
Overcome!
Be the manchild Christ requires,
Thus the church that He desires,
Then the Bride that He admires—
Overcome!


Calgary Songbook :1278

Hymns 1278

1
In the church of Jesus
There is love for you.
Love most pure and tender,
Love most deep and true;
Why should you be lonely,
Why for friendship sigh,
When the church of Jesus
has a full supply?                     

2
In the church of Jesus
There is life for you,
Warm as summer sunshine,
Sweet as morning dew;
Why should you be fearful,
Why take anxious thought,
Since the church of Jesus
cares for those He bought?

3
In the church of Jesus
There is work for you;
Such as even angels
Might rejoice to do;
Why stand idly sighing
For some life work grand,
While the church of Jesus
seeks your reaping hand?

4
In the church of Jesus
There’s a place for you;
Glorious, bright, and joyous,
Right and peaceful too;
Why then like a wand’rer,
Roam with weary pace,
If the church of Jesus
holds for you a place?
Hymns 1282


Calgary Songbook :1282

Marching on, marching on,
In the Spirit marching on;
Hallelujah! the churches march on.
In the church we see
The Lord’s recovery
And for it the Spirit seven-strong.
The world will know,
Wherever we shall go,
That in our age the Lord’s marching on!


Calgary Songbook :1283

Hymns 1283
Fight, saints, for Jesus our Lord!
Take in His life, stand in one accord!
Never fear God’s enemy;
Tread on his head triumphantly! (squish him!)
Pray that the daily church life be strong,
That all the saints in spirit press on,
Fighting as the one new man,
Fulfilling our Lord’s great plan!
(Glory! Hallelujah!)

Hymns 1287

1
Let’s take the land! The land that God has given us;
In all our living, Christ can be so much:
To take this land, we have th’ equipment that
we need —
The blood, the Word, the Spirit, and the church.                     
(Sisters sing)      
Let’s take the land! O Christian brothers,
The land that God has given us.
Be strong and take it, for we can make it
And gain this land so glorious!                     
(Brothers sing)    
Lets take the land! O Christian sisters,
And to these things give earnest heed.                     
The Lord implores us; He’s gone before us                     
And given everything we need!                     

2
We have the blood! Christ is our spotless offering,
Who gave Himself, our God to satisfy;
And so we come with boldness to the throne of grace,
And all day long, the precious blood apply.

3
We have the Word! The written Word’s our daily food;
We mix this Word with faith and say “Amen!”
Then thro’ the day, the spoken Word will speak to us
And regulate our living from within.

4
The Spirit’s ours! The Spirit of reality,
He’s independent of the way we feel;
He dwells in us, and teaches us to dwell in Him,
And guides us into everything that’s real.

5
We have the church! All saints are needed to possess
The fullness of this vast reality;
Together we will gain this all-inclusive Christ,
And He to us our everything will be.
Hymns 1293


Calgary Songbook :1293


1
O I’m a man—
I’m the meaning of the universe;
Yes, I’m a man—
I’m the meaning of the universe.
God made me such,                     
I am so much;                     
I’m the center and the meaning of the universe.

2
Christ lives in me—
He’s the meaning of my human life;
Christ lives in me—
He’s the meaning of my human life,
Yes, He’s in me
My all to be;
He’s the meaning and reality of my human life.

3
The church is Christ—
His expression on the earth today;
The church is Christ—
His expression on the earth today.
This corporate man
Fulfills God’s plan,
That this man may have dominion over all the earth.

4
The local church—
It’s the new and real family life;
The local church—
It’s the new and real family life.
We have the way
To live today—
Eating, drinking Christ we’re built up as the local church.

5
What shall we do?
We should go and tell the world of this,
What shall we do?
We should go and tell the world of this.
Disciple all—
This is our call.
Let us go and spread the news abroad to every land.

Come let us speak till the kingdom of the

Why hold your peace?
The Word release.
Let us speak until the kingdom of the Lord

2

Yes, loose the Word! It shall not return
Let’s sow the seed,
This is our need;
Loose the Word, and it shall not return

3
It’s gospel time! Let us spread the gospel

God’s done His work;
Let us not shirk;
We’re but pilgrims here, and we’ll not fear
the people’s frown!

4

hearts of men.
If we will speak, Christ will witness in the
Tell every man,

Hymns 1297


Calgary Songbook :1297

From the beachhead in our spirit
To our mind, emotion, will.
Christ will spread through all our being
And our vessel wholly fill.
He will cast out all rebellion,
Change our darkness into light.
Satan’s kingdom will be swallowed,
And Christ will reign with might.
This is the Lord’s recovery,
This is His very best!
Brothers, give the Lord the ground in you
Till His kingdom’s manifest.


Calgary Songbook :1299

Hymns 1299

1
Man’s Creator has a purpose
For our being here on earth.
In His image we’re created
To express His rule on earth.
But man fell to Satan’s tempting;
thus God’s goal was hid from view.
Still our God will have His kingdom,
for His Son will see it through.                     
Jesus Christ will get His kingdom
In spite of Satan and his plans.
He’s getting something real and solid                     
By growing in the hearts of man.
It’s nothing like religion teaches:
”You’ll have to wait until you die.”
For the kingdom Christ is building
Is here on earth before our eyes.

2
His Son, Jesus, is our Savior.
Once in human form He came.
Now as the Spirit he can enter
as the breath of life to man.
As a seed within our spirit
Christ takes root and starts to grow,
Spreading in our inmost being
till His life we come to know.

3
Time is short, oh, brothers, hear it!
Christ is longing for His bride.
We can hasten His returning
simply by the growth in life.
No more struggling, no more striving,
simply turn to Christ within.
See the seed begin to blossom,
growing fully into Him.
Jesus Christ will get His kingdom
By growing in a normal way.
It’s not an instant transformation.
This growth goes on from day to day.
The seed of life is all-inclusive.
It’s got everything we’ll ever need.
Yes, our God’s eternal purpose
Is all within this precious seed.
Hymns 1304

1
Christ comes quickly for His Bride,
Wedding feast He will provide,
Garments bright and pure supplied —
Dress in time!
Taking Christ as life she’s dressed,
By much suffering stitched and pressed;
Righteous acts are thus possessed —
Dress in time!                     
Be in time! Be in time!
For the marriage feast of Jesus
Be in time!                     
If your soul life you deny
And the Spirit you apply,
Then you’ll fully qualify —
Be in time!                     

2
Virgins Christ comes quickly for,
Those with oil an extra store,
Not the fools who oil ignore —
Buy in time!
For the oil a price we pay,
Deal with self without delay,
Fill your vessels every day —
Buy in time!

3
For His servants Christ will come
And reward each faithful one;
Slothful ones will be undone —
Serve in time!
Make your single talent count,
All self’s problems now surmount,
Serve with Christ, the living fount —
Serve in time!

4
Christ comes quickly for His grain,
Ripened firstfruits to obtain;
Unripe harvest will remain —
Ripen now!
From earth’s water grain must dry,
From the world your soul deny;
To mature the self must die —
Ripen now!

5
Overcomers Christ will take,
Those who all for Him forsake,
Those who of first love partake —
Win in time!
All the deadness overcome,
With the living Christ be one,
Toward the goal now swiftly run —
Win in time!

6
Christ comes for His kingdom too;
Heav’nly reign we must pursue,
Let His rule our self subdue —
Yield in time!
Rebel self must be dethroned,
Lessons must not be postponed,
Quickly yield to Christ enthroned —
Yield in time!

1
The day approaches; Jesus soon is coming.
Redeem the time; it must not slip away.                     
Lord, make us ready for the cry: “Behold Him!”
By using every moment of each day.                     
When Jesus comes, will we go in to meet Him?                     
When Jesus comes, will we from self have ceased?                     
He’s coming soon to take the wise ones with Him.
Oh, let us not be left outside the feast.                     

2
Lord, help us to redeem these golden moments;
Our vessels fill with ointment from above;
Help us amen each trial and tribulation;
Increase in us; make us abound in love.
He’s coming soon - these moments are so precious.
The oil is here - Oh, let us buy the more.
Amen the trials and welcome tribulations-
The kingdom’s ours through these afflictions sore.

3
Lord, ever turn us from our soulish pleasures
To gaze upon Thy tender, loving face.
Oh, keep us running forth to meet the Bridegroom
And patiently attending to the race.
When Jesus comes, will we be in His presence?
When Jesus comes, will we His face behold?
Oh, let us not return to sloth and folly,
But jealously His loving presence hold.

4
As His dear Bride, let us go forth to meet Him,
Our lamps well-trimmed, our fires burning bright,
Our vessels filled, our eyes set on His glory,
To be with Him completely satisfied.
Yes, satisfied—Christ and His Bride together.
Yes, satisfied—throughout eternity.
Oh, what a rest, what joy, what love, what favor
To be His Bride when He comes to His feast!

Hymns 1308

1
We have oil in our lamps—we are burning!
We have oil in our lamps today!
To the spirit, O Lord, keep us turning,
Keep us turning, turning all the way!
O Lord! Amen! Hallelujah!
We are burning, burning every day!
Turning, turning all the way!

2
But our vessels need oil for Thy coming;
We must gain a reserve supply.
So our vessels we give for the filling
That our lamps may never, never die.
Fill us, Jesus! Fill us, Jesus!
Every moment give us more of Thee!
Fill us with reality!

3
Then we’ll burn till the Lord comes to meet us,
Then we’ll burn till He comes that day.
Then we’ll go in with Him to the wedding
And be brightly burning all the way.
Come, Lord Jesus! Come, Lord Jesus!
Come and find us filled and burning bright!
Come and in Thy Bride delight.
Hymns 1315

1
Rejoice! Rejoice! Our Bridegroom’s coming,
And the time will not be long
Before we hail that wedding morning
And lift up the glad new song.
Oh, wondrous day! Oh, glorious morning,
When the Christ we love shall come;
With vessels filled and lamps all burning
Let us welcome His return.
Rejoice! Rejoice! Our Bridegroom’s coming
And the time will not be long
Before we hail that wedding morning
And lift up the glad new song.

2
Oh, let us now redeem each moment,
More the precious oil to buy,
And have our vessels filled with ointment
Ere we hear the midnight cry.

3
Oh, what a joy it is preparing
For our wedding with the Lord,
E’en in the tribulations sharing
For the bliss of such reward!

4
Oh, with what rapture and rejoicing
Shall the wedding day begin;
And then a thousand years of dining
At the marriage feast with Him!

Hymns 1325


Calgary Songbook :1325


1
God eternal has a purpose,
Formed in His eternal past,
Spreading to eternal future;
’Twixt these ends all time is cast.
For with time there is the process,
Time for His accomplishment;
And in time we’re merely travelers—
For eternity we’re meant.

2
God would have a group of people
Built together in His plan,
Blended, knit, coordinated
As His vessel—one new man.
God would come into this vessel
With His nature, life and ways,
Mingling Spirit with our spirits
For His joy and to His praise.

3
God has worked in three directions
For His plan so marvelous:
As the Father, Son, and Spirit
To dispense Himself to us!
All creation gives the setting—
Heav’n and earth are for this plan;
’Tis for this God made a body,
Soul and spirit—three-part man.

4
As the center, as the kernel,
Of God’s plan our spirit is;
Calling on the name of Jesus
Makes our spirit one with His.
From the center to circumference
God would saturate each part;
Feeling, mind and will renewing,
Making home in all our heart.

5
Thus in life we’re built together,
Then in love we’re knit as one;
God is now His plan fulfilling,
Finishing what He’s begun.
Lord, increase Thyself within us
That we might be built by Thee
Into that great corporate vessel
Filled with God exclusively.

6
As the product, the fulfillment,
Will the church in glory stand,
Consummation of the purpose
In eternal ages planned.
God will have His corporate vessel,
All His glory to contain;
Lord, we’re wholly for Thy purpose
All Thy goal in us attain.
Hymns 1326


Calgary Songbook :1326

What is living all about,
Where’s the answer? Let’s find out!
Call, “Lord Jesus!” Taste and see!
Christ becomes reality,
Life He gives abundantly
As a river flowing free.
With a new life we begin,
Joy is springing from within,
Love—He fills us to the brim!                     
And it’s all because of Him! (Hallelujah)

Hymns 1327


Calgary Songbook :1327


1
Once I thirsted for a fountain,
Something deep that would satisfy,
But the fountain that I’d drink from,
Left me searching and still so dry.                     
Then one day I found Him,
He satisfied my thirst,
Became in me a deeper source
Whence living waters burst.
Now I drink Him!
Jesus, Jesus is my life now,
Jesus, Jesus is my life;
I’m fully satisfied now,
Jesus, Jesus is my life.

2
After tasting such a fountain,
Longed my heart for a place of springs;
Caught a vision on a mountain,
In Jerusalem’s a gathering.
Then one day He found me,
He brought me to the church,
Pleasures here abound fore’er
I’ve given up my search.
Hallelujah!
Jesus, Jesus is my life now,
Jesus, Jesus is my life:
I’m fully satisfied now,
Jesus, Jesus is my life.

3
Empty wanderer drop the striving—
Isn’t worth all the troublin’;
Open up your heart believing,
Call “Lord Jesus” and He’ll come in!
Then today you’ll find Him,
And calling on His name,
You’re joined to Him, you’re one with Him—
You’ll never be the same.
You won’t want to!
Jesus, Jesus is my life now,
Jesus, Jesus is my life;
I’m fully satisfied now,
Jesus, Jesus is my life.
Hymns 1328


Calgary Songbook :1328

My wandering days
Grew increasingly empty
As I searched for the way,
Just to fill this gap inside me—
Found my seeking vain.
Though all this dark earth
Would convince me life’s worthwhile,
Inside all my mirth
Was a cry for something real.
Don’t you lie to me, world!
For my heart tells me different
When I hear of contentment
Deep within a lack knew better,
Why not be honest, world?
A flood of strong doubt as I heard the old story
Of a man they called Lord;
Yet my heart ne’er ceased to wonder,
Is He really Lord?
A search in His Word
Found my hardened heart softened,
And earth’s vanities faded.
In the brightness of His presence
Jesus came into me.
Now we’re always together
Growing into God’s fullness.
O Lord Jesus, how I love You!
You brought life into me.


Calgary Songbook :1331

Hymns 1331

1
Just taste and see that the Lord is good;
Just taste and see that the Lord is good.                     
He’s good for you, as He is for me;                     
So whatever you do, just taste and see.                     

2
Just call O Lord—He’ll change your life;
Just call O Lord—He’ll change your life.
Amazing grace He will afford;
If in every place you call O Lord.

3
You’ll feel real love coming into your heart;
You’ll feel real love coming into your heart.
You’ll sense a flow from God above;
And you will know you’ve found real love.

4
So praise the Lord for His life in you;
Yes, praise the Lord for His life in you.
Something of Christ He has outpoured
Into your life; so praise the Lord!
Hymns 1333


Calgary Songbook :1333


1
What a happy day
When I no more could turn away,
When Jesus took my heart
from the black of night
Into the kingdom of His light.

2
Now my life’s begun,
The “really life” that’s in the Son.
No more am I enthralled by
earth’s empty dreams;
Deep in me flows a living stream.

3
As I turn to Him
He fills me with His life within.
His life becomes my life in reality;
Oh, hallelujah, He’s in me!

4
I just love You, Lord.
With other loves, You break the cord.
You’ll be my life for all eternity;
You are the only One for me.

1
When the Lord turned again the captivity of Zion,
We were like them that dream,
We were like them that dream.

Then was our mouth filled with laughter,
And our tongue with singing:
Then said they among the nations,
The Lord hath done great things,
The Lord hath done great things for them.
The Lord hath done great things for us;
Whereof we are glad.

3
Turn again our captivity, O Lord, as the streams,
As the streams in the south,
As the streams in the south.

4
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy,
They that sow in tears shall reap in joy.

5

Bearing precious seed, shall doubtless,
Come again with rejoicing,
Bringing his sheaves with him.

Behold how good and how pleasant it is,

That ran down upon the beard,
Even Aaron’s beard:
That went down to the skirts of his garments.

Upon the mountains of Zion:
For there the Lord commanded the blessing,
Even life for evermore.

And they loved not their soul lives unto death.

Zion is God’s habitation.                     
Sing praises in Zion,                     
The city of our King.
Zion, the place of His choosing                     
Where saints are rejoicing.
Here God is their salvation.
Beautiful Zion, in elevation,
The joy of our King,
His satisfaction,
The joy of the whole earth

2
Zion: how good and how pleasant,
The greatest enjoyment!
It’s like the precious ointment.
Zion, how good and how pleasant,
In oneness we’re dwelling.
The dew, oh how refreshing!
Beautiful Zion, in elevation
How good and how pleasant,
The best enjoyment!
Our oneness is just Him.

3
Zion: our Oneness a Person,
As ointment, He’s moving,
As dew He is descending.
Zion: our God is our dwelling,
As ointment, He’s strengthening,
As dew, He’s so supplying.
Beautiful Zion, in elevation
How good and how pleasant,
Man’s satisfaction,
Our dwelling is this One.

4
Zion: in God we’re abiding,
Our oneness and living,
The processed God, our all.
Zion, the ultimate blessing,
Of God with man mingling,
The Triune God dispensing.
Beautiful churches, the golden lampstands
God mingling with man
His satisfaction,
The ultimate consummation!
Tune: "I'm gonna praise God unceasingly"

We see a picture of the Triune God                     
In Revelation one—
The lampstands golden
Shining so brightly;
God the Father’s seen in the gold,
The form shows us the Son,
Shining Spirit is seven yet one.                     
Now in our spirit we can see,
Triune God is all we need,
Mingling with us to produce His many sons.                     
Shining forth with God eternally,
In the New Jerusalem we
Will express the Triune God forevermore.                     

2
Another picture in John fifteen—
A long green vine we see,
With branches fruitfully
Flowing out the Spirit; we
Are all well-tended by the husbandman,
Grafted into Christ the Son,
Abiding in the Triune God.

3
The ultimate consummation—
The New Jerusalem,
A corporate entity,
Shining God in eternity.
City’s gold, pearl, and precious stone,
Work of Father, Spirit, Son;
With Him we’re forever one.

Let’s talk about Jesus—
The King of kings is He
The Lord of lords supreme                     
Through all eternity,
The great I Am, the Way,
The Truth, the Light, the Door—
Let’s talk about Jesus more and more!                     
Isn’t He wonderful, wonderful, wonderful!
Isn’t Jesus, our Lord, wonderful!
Eyes have seen, ears have heard—
It’s recorded in God’s Word—
Wonderful! Wonderful!  Jesus is to me!
Counselor, Prince of Peace, mighty God is He!
Saving us, keeping us from all sin and shame—
Wonderful is our Redeemer—Praise His name!
I’m gonna sing!  I’m gonna shout!
I’m gonna sing, I’m gonna shout—
Praise the Lord!
For when your heart is opened wide,
Christ will fill you deep inside—
I’m gonna sing, I’m gonna shout—
Praise the Lord!
And this is why I am so happy!
And this is why I am so free.
I’m drinking at the springs of living water—
Oh, won’t you come and have—
Oh... won’t you come and have a drink with me!                     


Calgary Songbook :1503

O we will praise,
O we will always praise the Lord!
John saw the number of the redeemed ones,
Of those who were praising the Lord.
Some were singing,
Some were praying,
But they all were praising the Lord.
O we will praise,
O we will always praise the Lord!

1
When I’ve run the race before me
And have fought to victory,
I’ll be raptured to the glory of the Lord;
When I’ve kept the faith at any cost,
The Holy City then
I’ll receive as my reward.                     
I’ll be raptured into glory,
In the Holy City dwell—
New Jerusalem, New Jerusalem;                     
With the overcomers shouting,
How our praises then will swell,
In the New Jerusalem.                     

2
As a pilgrim here I wander;
While afflicted, I rejoice,
For a better land I soon expect to see;
Though all others seek for earthly gain,
The Holy City e’er
Will my aspiration be.

3
Though my feet are often wearied
On the rough and rugged path,
Just by thinking of that city, I’m restored;
Though my eyes be filled with tears,
My heart will evermore be fixed
On that City, my reward.

4
With strong purpose I now wrestle,
And I run toward the goal;
I pursue the prize, God’s highest to obtain;
Pressing forward toward the mark,
I run forgetting all behind,
Thus the Holy City gain.
By His love and through His grace I’ll
In the Holy City live—
New Jerusalem, New Jerusalem;
All saints leaping, singing, shouting,
To the Lord their praises give,
In the New Jerusalem.

Peter and John went to pray.
They met a lame man on the way.
He asked them for silver and gold and alms
and this is what they had to say :

2
Silver and gold have I none,
But such as I have give I thee;
In the name of Jesus Christ
Of Nazareth, Rise up and walk.
He went walking, and leaping, and praising God,
Walking, and leaping, and praising God.
In the name of Jesus Christ
Of Nazareth, Rise up and walk.

3
Silver and gold have I none,
But the Seven-fold Spirit have I;
In the Name of Jesus Christ
I’ll stand up and testify.
I’ll praise Him and testify in the church,
Praise Him and testify in the church.
In the Name of Jesus Christ
I’ll stand up and testify.

And into His courts with praise;

The glory of the risen Lord
Who can compare

Forever He will be

I gladly bow my knee                     
And worship Him alone.

I will proclaim

Who once was slain
To reconcile man to God.

As the Spirit leading constantly!

not just as food, not just as light, 
not just as your dwelling place, 
but as the all-inclusive land.

Christ has come to be life—
the processed Divine Trinity                     
God the Father’s the source—
a Fountain emerging to be
God the Son as a gushing-up spring
In the Spirit, a river, for life-imparting.
Oh! How can this miracle be?
The Triune God flowing in me?
Oh!  I’ve got rivers of life
flowing out of my innermost being!
I’ve got rivers of life
As this life flows through me,
I’m supplied abundantly
His life nullifies sin;
Pow’r springs now from within
To be free—overcoming spontaneously!                     

2
Yet this life, though it frees,
is not meant for mere victory
God is full of intent,
and never could flow aimlessly.
So this life has a totality,
A consummate issue encompassing me,
Life moves and life grows, life shapes as it flows,
Now I share in this life’s destiny,
Oh! I’ve got rivers of life
flowing out of my innermost being!
I’ve got rivers of life
We’ll abide mutually
God and man revealed to be
Lamb, Wife, Spirit and Bride!
Come, drink! And riverside
Grows the tree, our enjoyment for eternity!

3
So I’ve no cause to frown,
As one who received this zoe.
I know life runs its course,
and triumphs inevitably.
I’m required just to stay in the flow.
If I do the drinking then God gives the growth!
So there’s joy in my heart, and a spring in my step,
And a smile on my face as I sing,
Oh! I’ve got rivers of life
flowing out of my innermost being!
I’ve got rivers of life

Breathing in the Lord
Is how we live today.
Not by thinking do we live,
But breathing is the way.
We just call “O Lord!”
From very deep within,
And with joy we testify
We’re breathing in of Him.
Breathe in Christ,
Breathe in Life,
Breathe Him in today!
He’s our very life supply,
So breathe Him right away! (Repeat)

2
He’s so wonderful,
The Breath of Life is He;
Once he simply was a man,
But now He’s breath to me.
He has changed His form;
The Spirit now is He.
He’s the Christ breathed out from God,
The Breath breathed in by me.
Everywhere, everywhere,
Christ is life to me;
I just call upon His name,
And breath comes into me! (Repeat)

There’s a life that’s deeper than our mind,
With experience of man, yet so divine.                     
It’s a life that knows no bounds;
And with glory is crowned;
It’s of depth and height and breadth unsearchable.
Now this life is just the Living One
Manifested in the Person of the Son.                     
As the Spirit, He flows;
In our spirit He grows,
Growing up to be the church that He desires.
O Lord, we’re just for Your flowing;
How we need a deeper knowing!
Life is why we’re here
And why You’ve come in us.                     
Turn us, Lord, turn us now;
Turn us deeply—Life is how
You will get the church,
The home You’re longing for.

2
In the church, we all can apprehend
All the riches of this life that is within.
Not just shallowness with strife,
But a deep and peaceful life
Is just waiting to flow out, a living spring.
With the saints it’s easy to be bold,
To pursue this life, to gain it, to lay hold.
All the other things we find,
Must be quickly left behind,
So that only life remains for us to see.

3
Deeper, Lord our turn must be to You;
We would move by life in everything we do;
All our concepts refute,
For Your life be absolute—
Grant us grace to turn much deeper day by day.
When we touch our spirit—such a thrill!
This is far beyond emotion, mind, and will—
It’s within our hidden part—
Come, make home in all our heart;
Let Your presence flow as rivers deep within.

Now the Lord is the Spirit—that’s how                     
He can get inside of you right now.
It’s so easy to be filled with Him.                     
He’s made it really simple.
One, two, three—                     
That’s how easy it can be.
O Lord! Amen!
That’s the way to let Him in.                     
Hallelujah! I love to hear it.
He who is joined to the Lord
Is one spirit.                     

2
Now the Lord is the living air;
You can breathe Him in anywhere—
Anytime of day, whenever you please.
He’s made it really easy.
O Lord! Amen!
Let’s sing it again.

3
Now the Lord lives inside of me.
And He’s filling me constantly.
Yes, He’s filling up every gap.
He makes me really happy.
I’m so happy!
Hallelujah! Taste and see!

From my spirit, when I’m sensing the supply
Of God’s speaking, from a fount that ne’er runs dry,
And within me comes a fresh and sweet supply,
Then I’ve got to open up and water you.                     
Water you, water you
From the flowing in my spirit water you;                     
When the saints need my supply,
Then I’ll surely testify,
I’ll stand up, release my Christ and water you!

2
In the meeting, when the spirit’s rising high,
And it seems like we will go beyond the sky—
I can’t help it, I must speak or else I’ll die,
For my Christ is rising up to water you.

3
Should a pause come, or the meeting ebb real low,
While within me there’s a rich and living flow,
Then I’ll stand up, so that all the saints will know,
That I’m here to share my Christ and water you.

4
In the church life, in our daily living too,
In the meeting, and in everything we do,
Christ is speaking and the Spirit’s breaking through,
That is why there’s the supply to water you.

Now Christ is the life-giving Spirit;
Now Christ is the Spirit today.                     
Now Christ is the life-giving Spirit;
So turn to your spirit and say—                     
O Lord, Amen
O Lord, Amen, Hallelu-jah!
O Lord, Amen,

2
Now Christ is the life-giving Spirit;
Now Christ is the living Word too.
The Spirit will flow in our spirit,
The Word will be life to us through—
Praying, reading,
Praising and calling upon His name;
Praising and calling upon Him.
Tune: "There are three kinds of life"

It’s a new, living meeting that we’re having today.
We are meeting in spirit and we worship this way.
We enjoy the reality of Christ as all,
And leave all of the shadows when on Jesus we call.
It’s a new, living meeting
In a new, living way.
At the beaches, the schools, the parks—
wherever we may.
We are slaying the ord’nances, religion too.
Hallelujah!  The Spirit of the Lord’s
breaking through.

2
We don’t care for religion, we don’t care for the forms,
We don’t care for opinions, regulations or norms.
We don’t care for the doctrines that will kill us dead—
Hallelujah! We’re free in our spirit instead.

3
It’s a new, living meeting, no more oldness we’ll bear.
In the singing, pray-reading it is Christ that we share.
No more old-fashioned meeting in the old, old way.
Hallelujah! The Lord is doing new things today!

Turn to your spirit, where the Spirit of Jesus is;
Turn to your spirit—Oh, how it makes you sing!
Turn to your spirit in the middle of everything.
Turn to the Lord. Oh, turn to the Lord!

2
Turn to your spirit, where the Spirit of Jesus is,
Turn to your spirit—where life is really found.
Turn to your spirit if you’re up or if you’re down,
Turn to the Lord. Oh, turn to the Lord!

Turn to your spirit, where the Spirit of Jesus is,
Turn to your spirit, calling upon His name—
Now and forever, Jesus is the very same.
Turn to the Lord. Oh, turn to the Lord!

Have you found your human spirit?
It’s connected to your mouth!
“Hallelujah—O Lord Jesus!”
That’s the way to let it out!                     
What is born of God is our human spirit—
Praise God, the job has been done!                     
What is born of Spirit is just our spirit,
And the two spirits are one.                     

2
Don’t wait for an inspiration—
That’s the subtle enemy.
Open up! Release your spirit,
Testifying you are free.


Calgary Songbook :1609

Drop by drop
The Lord will get inside of you.
In emotion, mind and will.
The vessel that the Lord has made
He will gladly fill.                     
There is oil in your lamp but there’s the vessel too;
Is it filled with Christ or just filled with you?
(Repeat first 7 lines)    


Calgary Songbook :1610

The spirit of the prophet
Is subject to the prophet;
The word declares it so.
I don’t have to wait for an inspiration,
My spirit is ready to go.
I don’t have to live according to my feelings,
Or wait for a better day.
I can turn, I can call, “Lord Jesus!”
Do not try to serve the Lord, 
work for Him, 
or do anything for Him.  
You have to look unto Him 
so that He would show you all His beauty, 
His sweetness, and His fairness.  
This will attract you to love Him.
from “The Living and Practical Way to Enjoy Christ” p. 22
Loving the Lord

1
How could a country girl like me
Become Your match—Your bride to be?
You’re holy and You are divine
But I’m fallen and human.

2
Without You Lord I have no chance
To be like You in this romance
But You chose me ere the world began
Nothing could change Your plan.
This divine romance
Is My heart’s deep plan
I became a lowly man
To court My country girl.
Nothing could deter.
Nothing can alter
My eternal love for her
I’ll gain My country girl.

3
No man or angel ever knew
This secret hidden deep in You
That You desired to be one with man
Before the world began.

4
Though sin came in to ruin me
Through Satan’s scheme and subtlety
Nothing could break Your love for me
To gain me totally.
(Chorus 1)    

5
As King of kings You became a man
You died for me—I’ve been redeemed
In resurrection made us queen
To marry You my King.

6
From death You ’rose and entered me
I now possess Your divinity
In life and nature we’re the same:
Both human and divine.
In Your love I’m drawn
To You I belong
I am not my own, Lord
I’m Yours alone.
By Your love I’m drawn
In Your name I’m charmed
And Your Person captured me
For I’ve been kissed by Thee.

7
Lord, in this close, sweet fellowship
Lord be with me so intimate
So personal and affectionate
A sweet relationship.

8
Lord, daily change my inward being
Lord, all my heart possessing
In all my being—transforming
To be Your bride and queen.
(Chorus 2)

I love the Lord with all my heart
And every part of my soul.

I love You Lord Jesus,
With all my heart and with all my soul;
You are the only One in the universe
For me, dear Lord.

Singing, praising, calling on the Lord.

I love God
I love God

Let me stand behind You, Lord.
Let me wash Your feet with my tears.
Let me wipe them with my hair.
Let me kiss them and anoint them with the ointment.
I love You!
Jesus, I love You!
May I waste my all and life on You.
Let me pour the ointment pure
On Your head and on Your feet,
On You, most precious One
Because I love You.

2
Let me take a pound of ointment pure
Of great value to anoint Your feet
And wipe them with my hair
That the house be filled with the fragrance
of the ointment.
(Chorus 1)    

3
Lord, they said if You were a prophet,
You should know who and what I am.
I’m a sinner that toucheth You.
A woman not worthy to anoint You.
But I love You!
Jesus, I love You!
You forgave me the most
now I love You, Lord, the most.
Let me pour the ointment pure
On Your head and on Your feet,
On You, most precious One,
Because You love me.

4
Let my love from my being wash Your feet
To my glory without wipe them too
Let me kiss them where the nails would pierce.
All my love, Lord, and glory I’ll waste on You.
I love You!
Jesus, I love You!
All my glory and love I pour
and waste on You.
Receive my ointment, Lord.
It’s all I have, dear Lord.
For You, most precious One,
Because I love You.

When I first fell in love with Jesus,
I gave Him all my heart.
And I thought I couldn’t love Him more,
Than I did right at the start.
Now I look back over the mountains,
And the valleys where we’ve been.
And it makes me know I love Him so,
Much more; than I did then.
I keep fallin’ in love with Him,
Over and over and over and over again.
He gets sweeter and sweeter as the days go by.
Oh, what a love between my Lord and I.
I keep fallin’ in love with Him,
Over and over and over and over again.

2
There’s a hand that I hold on to,
Thru each valley and each trial.
There’s a shoulder that I lean upon,
As I face another mile.
There’s a love I can depend on,
It’s fresh and new each day.
And with joy my heart is overflowing,
So this is why I say.


Calgary Songbook :1708


1
Morning dawn had arisen,
Abraham saddled his donkey,
Took his two young men with him
And Isaac, his beloved son.
Lord, You’re God’s only Son
And of God begotten
“This is My beloved Son, in whom
I am well-pleased.”

2
To his young men he said then,
“Stay and we’ll return to you.”
To Moriah he led him,
His son Isaac, just them two.
Just the son and the father,
Speaking with one another.
Isaac said, “My father!” Abraham
said, “Here I am.”

3
As You spoke with Your Father
You bore the wood God laid on You;
As a lamb to the slaughter
Obedient to the death were You.
Precious blood of a Lamb,
Slain before earth began,
Laid Your life down for Your sheep, in love,
That I might live.

4
Man of sorrows, I love You.
From You men did hide their face.
With no majesty to You,
Despised, forsaken, and disgraced.
For my sins You were crushed.
Lord, I love You so much.
Chastened, scourged and then pierced through, my griefs
and sorrows bore.

5
Dead in sins and offenses,
I’m a bruised reed—smoking flax.
Yet to death You were given,
For of Your sheep, You’d not lose one.
Like the woman, I’d weep,
Flow my tears at Your feet.
Jesus Lord, I just love You—dear Lord,
Jesus my Lord.


Calgary Songbook :1709


1
God is love, who sent His beloved Son.
Man is fallen with corruption,
But You sent Your dear Son.
God commends His kindness and love towards us,
In that while we were yet sinners
Christ died for us.
God, You did not spare Him,
Your beloved Son.
Father, how we praise You
For this precious One!

2
Who can know the love from our Father’s being?
Ears have never heard; eyes have never seen,
But Lord, I’ve been redeemed.
God is love. O God, a man You became;
A cursed man to be, God, You died for me.
Lord, You hung from a tree.
Father, You have sent Him,
Your beloved Son.
He shed His blood on Calvary.
Your love reached me.

3
God so loved the world that He gave us His Son.
Just believe in Him. Be not perishing,
But have eternal life.

I do not know where they have laid Him.
The stone is taken away from the tomb.
Oh! They have taken Him away!
Oh, where is He?

2
Disciples came and saw the empty tomb,
But went away so soon to their own homes.
They’re satisfied with just the facts,
But where’s my Lord?
Where is He, my Jesus?
Where is He, my Beloved?
Where is He whom my soul doth love?
Jesus, my love, I just want You.

3
My heart is broken from my deepest need.
Don’t ask me, angels, why I’m weeping.
Nothing but Jesus fills my inner being.
Oh, where’s my love?

4
Someone is standing right behind me—
It’s just the gardener; I can barely see.
Sir, if you carried Him away,
Oh! Where is He?
Where is He, my Jesus?
Where is He, my Beloved?
Tell me where you have laid Him
And I’ll carry Him away; I’ll carry Him away.

5
And then I heard a voice say, “Mary,”
That sweetest voice that penetrated me.
It is the voice of my Beloved,
Jesus, my love.
I have found my Jesus!
I have found my Beloved!
I have found whom my soul doth love,
Jesus, my love, I just love You!

6
But Jesus told me not to touch Him yet;
He must ascend first to the Father,
“And to My Father and your Father,
To My God and your God.
Go and tell My brothers,
I ascend to the Father,
To My Father and your Father,
And My God and your God; go tell My brothers.”

The love of Christ is now constraining me
That I would love and love Him utterly.
His mighty love has touched me deep within
To consecrate my life and all to Him.
This charming One so excelling,
To His touch I’m now responding,
To surrender, to surrender to Him.                     

2
This tide of love has flowed to me from Him;
Unchanging love that keeps on rushing in.
Now I’m for Him beyond my own control;
He is now my love and my only goal.
His dying love so compelling,
And this tide has made me willing
To love Him; I can’t help but love Him.

3
The love of Christ
Is now constraining me to love Him utterly.
His mighty love
Has touched me deep within to consecrate to Him.

Lord, I love You.
Lord, I need You.
Lord, without You
Nothing would be the same.
Without You knowing
Without You flowing
Without You growing
In me my life is vain.
Lord, I love You more and more;
I just want You.
Fill me with your life and Your virtues.
Fill me ’til I’m only living You.
Fill me every minute, every hour, every day
Until I am expressing you always.                     
Fill this earthen vessel, Lord, I pray.                     

2
Lord, You’re moving,
Operating.
In my being
Saturate every part.
You’re infusing,
Permeating.
You’re indwelling,
Making home in my heart.
(1st Chorus)    

3
Lord You’re building
Your expression;
Lord, by mingling
All that You are in me
I’m responding,
Cooperating,
Consecrating
Myself to You totally.
Lord, for Your expression
I would now outpour,
Partaking of Your Person more and more
I would now outpour.
This is what I was created for,
This is what I was created for.

Lord Jesus, You’re lovely.
You’re more to be desired,
Than any earthly pleasure.
You’re fine, beyond compare.
Lord Jesus, Your beauty
Does far exceed all others.
You’re comely and You’re tender.
You’re radiant and You’re fair.

2
When I behold You Jesus,
You draw my heart completely.
I cannot turn away Lord,
I rest in Your embrace;
And time is gone there’s only
Your holy, matchless presence
Abiding in You, gazing
Upon Your glorious face.

3
I give my life to You Lord,
For You alone are worthy.
There’s nothing and there’s no one
That I desire but You.
May all my days be Yours, Lord,
My heart be given to love You,
To treasure and to serve You
By Your sufficient grace.

There is a great mystery,
A wonderful story;
For ages ’twas hidden,
Now shown in His wisdom;
’Tis a divine romance
Of God and man in time;
Beyond understanding,
Yet seen in God’s speaking.                     
God fell in love with man;
For only God’s love can
Make man just the same as He
In life and in nature,                     
We are His expression,
His bride, His enlargement;
Forever, together,
As living, insep’rable as one couple
Eternally.

2
Though He was rejected
By men who were blinded;
His love is constraining,
His heart still unchanging;
Thus in incarnation
Came He as salvation;
His name is called Jesus,
And He came to seek us.

3
Though I’ve been a sinner,
I now have been redeemed
By Christ who died for me,
Who was raised in glory.
I am joined to Him now,
Together we’re living;
I love to enjoy Him,
For I’ve been forgiven.

4
His love is so tender,
To Him I’ll surrender;
His name is so precious,
I’ll gladly call, “Jesus!”
His Person’s so charming,
My heart ever winning;
I’ll hold back no longer,
I’ll love Him forever.


Calgary Songbook :1715


1
Your sweetness is just the taste of enjoyment
Your beauty is simply my heart’s attraction                     
Your radiance has captured me.
Your eyes draw things out of me.
I want to daily kiss You and hold on to You.
O Jesus, I’m crazy loving You.
O Jesus, I’m crazy loving You, ’til myself is no more.
O Jesus, I’m crazy loving You, ’til I’m lost in You.

2
Forgetting all that I’m outwardly doing.
Forgetting all of my thoughts of improving.
You only want to be loved. I give my love unto You.
A crazy lover of Christ, I’m jumping for joy.

3
Yes, my life’s just to love You with my whole being.
Yes, my work’s just to love You with my whole being.
Loving You is my pleasure.  Loving You is my service.
Loving You is my motive and also my will.

4
O, My Love, You’ve blinded me towards all things.
O, My Love, You make the world simply nothing.
Just let me see You alone.  Just make me need You alone.
None other is there for me, it’s Jesus alone.

Jesus, O living Word of God,
Wash me and cleanse me with Your blood
So You can speak to me.                     
Just let me hear Your words of grace,
Just let me see Your radiant face,
Beholding constantly.                     
Jesus, living Word,
My heart thirsts for Thee;                     
Of Thee I’d eat and drink,
Enjoy Thee thoroughly.                     

2
Jesus, most precious One to me,
I want to seek You constantly
So You can spread through me.
I would just call upon Your name,
Open to You; I have no shame
Loving You, Jesus Lord.
Jesus, precious One,
Be so real to me.
You are all I want;
I open wide to Thee.

3
Jesus, O living One in me,
Open my eyes that I might see
All that You are to me.
Just let me enter in Your heart,
Never from You would I depart,
Loving You constantly.
Jesus, living One,
Flood me thoroughly;
Take my willing heart
And overcome in me.

4
Lord, I want You to have Your way,
Save me from being Satan’s prey;
I am believing You.
All I can give to You, my Lord,
Is my whole being, love outpoured;
Lord, I belong to You.
Jesus, faithful God,
Gain us through and through;
Use us thoroughly
To see Your purpose through.

God wants someone to love Him,
Not just someone to serve Him;
He wants someone to love Him —
As His bride.
God wants someone to match Him,
Not just to imitate Him;
He wants a counterpart.
One from His side.
For this He came down to us;                     
He came to court, to woo us,                     
Away from everything, and —
Unto Him.
Now we’re espoused unto Him,                     
Pledged and betrothed unto Him;                     
Yes, we are bound unto Him
By His love.

2
God wants someone to love Him,
Not just someone to fear Him;
He wants a sweetheart who will —
Be His bride.
God wants someone to know Him,
Not just to know about Him;
He wants someone who’ll look Him
In the eye.

Lord Jesus, I love You.
You’re my all —
You’re my all in all.
You gave me life indeed;
You’re all I need,                     
You’re all I need.                     
Real peace and joy I never knew,
Until in spirit I touched You, so—
Lord, I just open up to You;
I let You do what You want to do.
Lord, I just give myself to You,
’Cause I love You—Lord, I do.

2
You save me all day long;
Though I’m weak,
You’re so strong.
The flow of life and peace
Within me shows the way,
Hour by hour, day by day;
And if through weakness I should fall,
You always save me when I call, so—
(Repeat Chorus)    

3
O Lord, one touch with Thee
Brought life into me.
And now I can’t live without You.
You’re my only delight—
You’ve made everything right
With a love that constrains me
Till I say that—
(Repeat Chorus)    
You’re my lover—You’re my all.

I am young and I’m in love
With the One who is from above.
All my days are just for Him.
All my being I open to Him.
Jesus You love me.
You took my place at Calvary.
You gave Your life to save me.

Others try the world and sin,
But for me—I only want Him.
Lord Your beauty has captured my heart.
Now I give You every part.
Jesus I love You.
No other one compares to You.
My all and life I give to You.

3
Jesus now is living in me.
We’ll be mingled as one entity.
God’s good pleasure His Bride we’ll be
As His wife for eternity.
Hallelujah!  We’re in love!
God loving us and we love Him.
His masterpiece the New Jerusalem.


Calgary Songbook :1720

Lord, take my life                     
I give it, Lord, to You.
You have opened my eyes, Lord,
And turned me to You.
You are my Creator, O Lord,
How I love You.
You are also my Savior
And everything that’s true.                     

1
Lord, so often I’m like Thomas
Who would not receive:
“Unless I see Your face, Lord, I would not believe...”
But then You would appear...
“My Lord and my God”
Saying, Blessed are they who see not, yet believe.

2
I have someone deep within me
Welling up in me each day.
Even though I have not seen Him in such an outward way—
“Whom having not seen, I love,
I love, oh so much.
And by having His life, yes, I believe.”
(Chorus)    

3
Day by day I look forward
to that time I spend with You.
Just as Mary poured her love out, O Lord, I would too.
Grant me, Lord, a heart
that’s single and true.
And a daily life that’s living just by You.

4
So when daily I see trials
and tribulations sore,
May I put my trust in You, Lord, “For Christ has gone before”
And open to Your living Word,
receiving faith—
Reach me, Lord, with Your mercy and Your grace.
(Chorus)

1
I have a friend so precious,
So very dear to me;
He loves me with such tender love,
His love’s so fair and sweet;
I could not live apart from Him,
I love to feel Him nigh;                     
And so we dwell together,
My Lord and I.

2
Sometimes I’m faint and weary,
He knows that I am weak;
And as He bids me lean on Him,
His help I gladly seek;
He leads me in the paths of light,
Beneath a sunny sky;
And so we walk together,
My Lord and I.

3
He knows how much I love Him,
And if I love Him well;
But with what love He loveth me,
My tongue can never tell;
It is an everlasting love,
Much more as days go by;
And so we love each other,
My Lord and I.

4
I tell Him all my sorrows,
I tell Him all my joys;
I tell Him all that pleases me,
I tell Him what annoys;
He tells me what I ought to do,
He tells me how to try;
And so we talk together,
My Lord and I.

5
He knows my heart’s such longing,
Some weary soul to win;
And so He bids me go and speak,
The loving word for Him;
He bids me tell His wondrous love,
And why He came to die;
And so we work together,
My Lord and I.

PART TWO  


Calgary Songbook :1

Is there someone who’s a friend
There is a someone—
That I can open to?
Someone you can open to.                     
A someone who understands
There is a someone—
All that I’m going through?    
Someone who will take you through.
A someone when there’s no one    
There is a someone—
I can always come to—
When there is no one.
There is no someone like this One. There is a someone, a wonderful One.


Calgary Songbook :2

Is there someone who can care
There is a someone—
Through all my hardest times?
Someone in my hardest times.
A someone always there
There is a someone—
Though it may rain or shine?
Always there though rain or shine.
A someone I can lean on
There is a someone—
When the stormy times come—
When there is no one.
There is no someone like this One. There is a someone, a special One.


Calgary Songbook :3

Is there someone who will take—
There is a someone—
Take me just as I am?
Who will take you as you are.
A someone who’ll not forsake,
There is a someone—
One I can trust to the end?
He will reach you near or far.
A someone who knows me
There is a someone—
Yet he still wants me—
He’s the most lovely One.
There is no someone like this One. Just take this someone, the loveliest One.


Calgary Songbook :4

Is there someone who can reach
There is a someone—
Down to the depths of my being?
Who can touch your inmost being.
A someone who can fix
There is a someone—
All of my broken heart strings?
He can make your heart to sing.
A someone who can love me
There is a someone—
When there’s no love in me—
Love is this precious One.
There is no someone 
Just love this someone,
Like this One.
The wonderful One.
Christ is this someone
Who can touch your inmost being.
Christ is this someone—
He can make your heart to sing.
Christ is this someone.
Christ is this precious One.
Just love this someone, the wonderful One.

1
Lord, You are Beloved, Fairest of the fair;
Altogether lovely, unrivaled beauty;
It’s You! Your presence, I long for and seek;
You’re the One in whom my heart delights,
So, I just love to tell You...
Jesus, I love You,
My treasure, You are;
How could I choose anything less than You?
Dear Lord, my inmost heart You’ve captured and won.

2
Dead I was in sin, Lord, so lost without You;
Helpless, wounded, weary, rebellious, too;
But Lord, You came! You would not let me go;
The blood and water flowed from Your side,
Constraining me to tell You...

3
Thank You Lord, You opened my blind eyes to see;
I was lame, but now I can walk; You healed me!
My leprosy, Lord, You cleansed all away;
My ears were opened to hear Your voice,
And now I follow You ’cause...

4
Sometimes Lord, I’m drawn off by my selfish cares;
And the world it draws me with glitter and glare.
O Lord, You’ve trapped me. Don’t let me go.
Kiss me and woo me, and win my heart,
So, I will always tell You...

5
Keep my heart so soft, Lord, so open to You;
It would be the good ground to bear fruit for You;
Capture my friends, Lord, and build us, I pray;
Your Bride, We’d match You in every way,
And, corporately we tell You:
Jesus, come quickly,
We’re waiting for You;
We’re the virgins to You,
So single and true;
Forever and ever Your counterpart true.


Calgary Songbook :1724


1
Mary poured out her love offering.
To many such love was a waste.
Throughout all of the centuries
Such lovers Your sweetness do taste.
Precious lives and heart treasures too,
Positions and golden futures
Have been “wasted” on You Lord,
Your sweetness—a fragrance so sure.
She took opportunity                     
To love You; Lord, with her best.
Like her, Lord, I too would pour
My love and all that I have.

2
As I love You I set my being,
My spirit, my soul and body,
With my heart, my mind and my strength
Absolutely on Thee.
Lord, I let my entire being
Be occupied by Thee.
As I enter in Your heart,
I sense the fellowship sweet.
Occupied and lost in You,
My Lord, You’re my everything.
Fellowship so intimate;
In spirit, Lord, I enjoy Thee.

3
Lord there’s none in heav’n nor on earth
That I desire but Thee.
Though my heart and flesh faileth Lord,
Thou ever my portion will be.
All is vanity, all is dung,
I count all other things loss.
Every thing else drains my love,
But You have captured my heart.
Lord, I’ve seen Thy preciousness,
Thy worth, Thy reality.
Now, my Lord, I must confess,
My heart is only for Thee.


Calgary Songbook :1725


1
What made You, Lord, to die for me?                     
Why would You die for me, Your enemy?
You took my place to hang on a tree,
To be a curse, a curse for me.
What made You die for me?
I was Your enemy.                     
Lord, You became a curse for me.
O what a mystery,
My God, You died for me!                     
You died for me, Your enemy.

2
I never thought that You would be
So full of love and tender mercy.
How could You love a person like me?
You loved me, dear Jesus, Your enemy.

3
You loved me, Lord, so very long;
And with a love enduring and strong.
Although I mocked and cursed You so long,
You waited and prayed for me all along.

4
I was a man who was just sin,
Which issued in a life full of sins.
My heart toward You was in rebellion,
But, Lord, You touched me with Your compassion.
Your love has conquered me,
Even Your enemy.
In love, dear Lord, You came to me.
Nothing could change me
But love and mercy.
Your love, dear Lord, has conquered me.

5
One little turn and You were there,
Waiting for me with Your loving care.
How could I still remain Your enemy?
Your love, dear Jesus, disarmed me.


Calgary Songbook :1726


1
Now from my heart comes,
A happy song,
It’s just for You, Lord.
There’s only One;
Jesus,
I love You.                     
How I love to sing
With my spirit and heart to You.
Jesus, You’re so rich
In who You are and what You do.
Ev’ry time I turn and open up
I drink of You
’Cause I love You.                     

2
I’ve seen how they
Pierced Your side;
You gave Your all
To win Your bride.
J - E - S - U - S,
I love You.

3
Without Your love, Lord,
I’m so empty.
Life has no meaning,
Just vanity.
Jesus,
Reality.

4
Jesus in me,
What a wonder;
Bubbling over,
Living Water.
Jesus,
What a joy!


Calgary Songbook :1727


1
Lord, there’s always been one person
Like Abraham who ran to meet You.
Samuel, he ministered,
And David had a heart full of praise,
But You want many more.

2
Lord, we want to be that people
That minister and refresh You,
Meet Your need, and wash Your feet,
That satisfy Your heart’s desire
And be a friend to You.                     
What can we do?
We can call O Lord,
We can praise Your name,
Turn our hearts to You,
Let You rule and reign.
Lord, a single heart that’s true,
That’s what we desire.

3
Lord, You’ve shown You’re rich in mercy
To those saints who stand together
In Your plan, one new Man.
So grant us all a single heart;
A heart that just loves You,
A heart that’s true.
We can call O Lord,
We can praise Your name,
Turn our hearts to You,
Let You rule and reign.
Lord, a single heart that’s true,
That’s what we desire—
A heart for You.

I love God because He loved me long
before the world began.
I love God because He knew my destiny.
I love God because He made me
part of His eternal plan.
I love God because He first loved me.
I love Him for all the things
He’s done for me.
I love Him for all that He is,
all that He is to me.
But, most of all,
I love Him as the Spirit who                     
deep within my spirit lives.

2
I love God because He came in time
to be the Son of Man.
I love God because He gave Himself for me.
I love God because He conquered death
that I might live again.
I love God because He first loved me.

3
I love God because He’s processed now
to be my life within.
I love God because He is transforming me.
I love God because He’s building up
the New Jerusalem.
I love God because He still loves me.

Shepherd, receive man,
Come near and eat with them,
Publicans and sinners.
Go out to carry them home
On Your shoulders, rejoicing.
Lord, carry them home.

2
Spirit, dear Spirit,
Where is the one lost coin?
Yes, You have the nine,
But the one You must find.
Dear Spirit, You’re sweeping
All over the earth.

3
Father, dear Father,
Have mercy on mankind!
He’s fallen to the pig’s pen.
When will he return?
Dear Father, just kiss them,
Your son’s coming home.

4
Father of mercy,
Clothe him with the best robe
And kill the fatted calf
And eat and be merry—
He was lost, but found,
Was dead, but now he lives

Give yourself to love the Lord.
No other way is so prevailing                     
And no other way, no other way is so safe.

2
Give yourself to love the Lord.
No other way is so rich,
And so full, oh so full, of enjoyment.
Each morning we must rise up and say to Him,
“Lord Jesus, I love You.”

3
Give yourself to love the Lord.
Do not care for anything else;
Just love Him! Do not care!
Give yourself to love the Lord!
We are not our own, Lord; all we have we give to You.
Lord Jesus! Lord Jesus!
Lord Jesus, we love You!

Lord, how I thank You that
You died on the cross for me.
Your mercy, my Savior, reached me.                     
And Lord, You paid the highest price,
My life bought with Your shed blood,
My life now belongs, Lord, to You.                     
And Lord, how can I turn away from Your love,
The eternal love which You have for me?                     
I give You my heart;
Lord, spread in every part,
Till my whole heart belongs to You.

2
Lord, gain my heart so that
It is single and pure for You.
No other love, Lord would I know.
Lord, I am so in love with You.
For You are so lovely,
My everything, my all in all.
And Lord, I really want to know
this Person inside of me.
Lord, keep my heart open to You.
Keep flowing Your life
Into me that I would grow,
And be saturated with You.

Jesus Lord, You’re our first love;                     
You’re the One we love the best.                     
When our heart is loving You,                     
How we’re filled with Your sweet rest!                     

2
Lord, we love You for Yourself,
Not for what You give or do.
Nothing else could e’er compare
With the joy of loving You.
Lord, we’ve been drawn off by many things; Fm
Now we turn our heart back—how it sings!
We repent of loving other things—
Jesus, Lord, You’re our first love.                     

3
Never more could we desire
Anything that’s less than You,
And to this we will aspire—
Simply to be filled with You.

You’re the One we love the best.
When our heart is loving You,
How we’re filled with Your sweet rest!

Lord, You love me so immensely,
I would love You more intensely.
Every day and every moment,
O Lord, capture me.
Let my goal and my life’s theme be,
Lord, to love You more supremely;
With all my heart, Lord Jesus,
Keep me faithful unto Thee.
Draw me, Lord, each day;
Take my veils away.
With a pure heart will I see You.
Lord, I just love You.
Nothing else I seek;
No one else for me.
I would fully and absolutely
Give my whole being unto Thee.

I’ve tried in vain a thousand times,
To do the good I cannot do.
I want to do, I’ve tried to do.
I’m wretched!  I need someone to
deliver me.
Can you tell me who?
My God has a heart of love.

2
E’en though I’m dead, offences great,
I’ve heard of One whose mercy’s rich.
His love is great, so great to us.
“Believe Him”, some say is the way to
deliver me.
Can this be the way?

3
I opened wide.  I asked Him in.
What peace I found.  His love is mine.
I’m now His child, a child of God.
He saved me from my old life and
delivered me!
Can I tell you who?

4
Now when I want to try to do,
I speak my heart out to this One.
He hears the whispers of my heart.
He saves me ’cause He loves me and
delivers me.
Let Him save you too!

for my full satisfaction.
I’m in love, I’m in love, I’m in love
with the most beautiful One.

2
I’m captivated by Your name
and charmed by You;
with Your fragrance covering me I was gained
as You kissed me with Your kisses.
I’m in love, I’m in love, I’m in love
with the most affectionate One.

3
I’m fellowshipping in Your love
and rejoicing in You.
In Your chambers I enjoy our sweet love
for the church, Your satisfaction.

with the most intimate One.
I’m in love.

Simply loving everyday;                     
Loving through a stormy way,
Even when my faith is small,
Loving Jesus, that is all.
Loving as the moments fly,                     
Loving as the days go by,
Loving Him whate’er befall,
Loving Jesus, that is all.

2
Brightly doth His Spirit shine
Into this poor heart of mine;
While He leads I cannot fall,
Loving Jesus, that is all.

3
Singing if my way be clear,
Praying if the path be drear;
If in danger, for Him call,
Loving Jesus, that is all.

4
Loving Him while life shall last,
Loving Him till earth is past,
Till His gracious advent call,
Loving Jesus, that is all.

Within my heart a praise o’erflowing;

The sweetest melody, a song so heavenly.
There springs a melody of love.

O wonderous love, the Lord has saved me,
Granting me new life and joy;
Amazing grace! He’s living now in me;
Grace and love I now enjoy.

Where the vict’ry song we’ll sing;
O what an honor, reigning with the Lord;

Living water flowing free;
The tree of life with fruits abundant, sweet,
Satisfies eternally.

Draw me, dear Lord;
Draw me today.
From everything else, dear Lord;
Draw me away. (Today)

2
O Lord, this whole world,
Seems to weigh me down;
All the cares, the strife, the sin;
Within me and all around.

3
But, Lord, I want to set my heart;
And Lord, I want to stay with You;
Cause only when You’re near to me.
Is everything okay.

4
And though everything may fall apart
Or everything go my way;
It doesn’t really matter, Lord,
As long as I gain You today!

Thank You, Lord Jesus, for dying for me.
It’s Your precious blood cleansing all iniquities.
It’s there on the cross where You bled and died for me.
Lord Jesus, I thank You, I’m fully justified in Thee.
Lord Jesus, I love You,
You’re precious to me.
It’s here in Your presence,
I’ve seen Your beauty.
You’re matchless, You’re priceless,
You’re everything to me.
I’ll love You forever—
You are the only One for me.

2
Daily I come to be supplied by Your word.
It’s by this supply that I’m richly satisfied.
It’s here that I’m strengthened to live the Christian life.
It’s nothing I do, but Your overflowing grace to me.

3
Each day as I wake up I come to You, Lord.
Our fellowship sweet must be daily restored.
Void of offense, keep my conscience so pure.
Soften me, Lord, so that You alone may have my heart.

From my heart comes a melody                     
Of the One who gave His life for me.
How can I turn away from Thee;
Lord, I have seen Thy changeless love for me.
Enjoyment so full!
Life’s reality!
That’s what You’re to me:
Lord, You have won my heart!                     
Take my heart, take my whole life too;
Lord, I can’t help giving myself to You.

2
From the day that I first met You.
How could I help falling in love with You?
Emptiness turned life’s pleasures blue;
No earthly love ever could see me through.
’Till I turned one day
Opened up my heart,
Let Your love flow in
And fill my deepest part.
Now I know, Lord, You’re one with me;
And I can’t help giving myself to Thee.
Lord, I can’t help giving myself to Thee.

Oh, who’s like our Jesus? He’s all we desire!
His love draws us near—sets our spirits afire!
We cannot but love Him—as one we proclaim:
“Lord Jesus, we love Thee—exalt Thy dear name!”

2
O Jesus, our Jesus, with Thee we are blest—
Our Life, our Enjoyment, our Peace and our Rest:
Thy name be our theme, and Thy love be our song;
Thy love has inspired both our heart and our tongue!

3
O Jesus, our Jesus, how can we express
Thy dearness, so precious, and Thy loveliness?
When we see Thy beauty, all else fades away—
All shadows must flee at the breaking of day!

4
We love Thee, we love Thee, we love Thee, O Lord.
We love Thee, our Jesus, we love Thee, our God!
We love Thee, we love Thee, and that Thou dost know;
As we’re in Thy presence, love for Thee will grow!

Jesus Lord, I just love You.
You’ve attracted me, and my heart renewed.                     
I pursue You like a dove;
I belong to You, and You’re my Beloved.                     
Everything under the sun is vanity:
It’s like chasing after wind, so emptily;
You have put within me, Lord, eternity...                     

2
Now I rise to come away;
In the cleft rock, Lord, I would ever stay.
Kiss me, Lord; refresh me, too,
As I gaze at You, and Your death I view.
You were broken on the cross for me, dear Lord.
All Your being, life and love for me was poured.
Precious One, You are the One that I adore...

3
Make me, Lord, a fragrance true,
As a garden filled, with Your spices new.
Transform me, Your Bride to be,
For Your heart’s desire, through eternity.
As Your lover in the veil, I long to be,
Be conformed to Your sweet death continually,
’Til Your city we become eternally.


Calgary Songbook :1743

Lord, there’s nothing in this world like You—
You fill me up completely.
And I would never give You up for anything,
Because nothing else could satisfy me so.

1
People think that they can find
Satisfaction, peace of mind.
Everything leads to another,
But I found the best.

2
No more trying something else,
Or thinking that there’s something more;
No more hoping “someday,”
’Cause today I have the best.

3
Looking not at failures past,
Hoping not in future dreams;
Not wishing I were different,
Knowing everything’s the best.


Calgary Songbook :1744


1
Not poquito, nor kidogo                     
I love the Lord a whole bunch.
(Un muchos!!)
Nicht ein bischen, shao or choto—
Grandios and muchos
Colossal un da—
I love You, Lord—O so much.
Not a little but a bunch.

2
Lord, I do not have all the words
To speak my love out to You.
For Your love to me surpasses
All words that ever I knew.
All the languages, though so different
They all can say the same thing—
That my love for You is great.
I love You, Lord—O so much!


Calgary Songbook :1745


1
Sometimes it seems that
I have no room in my heart for You.
But then You touch me
And soften me to turn to You.
Recover my heart,
Rekindle my love for You.
Fill me with love
Eternally, ever new
Make me wholly Thine.

2
Lord, I want to
Empty myself of all but You;
Giving my best love,
Preeminence in all I do.

3
I want to love You
With all my heart and all my soul.
I want no other,
I give myself to be Yours alone.


Calgary Songbook :1746

I love You, Lord Jesus!
I love, You, Lord, Precious One!
No other one compares to You!
(Repeat)    
Jesus, Lord Jesus,
Dear Lord, most lovely One,
No one compares to You!


Calgary Songbook :1747

Lord, I love You, Lord, I need You,
You’re the One, the One I need,
To live this life, Lord, I need You always;
By Your presence, Lord, take lead.
Lord, look into me,
And infuse me
To walk by the strength of Your eyes.
Lord embrace me,
Bear me in You,
Deep in Your love I hide.
And when I’m weak, Lord, and can’t go on more,
Lift my eyes to gaze on You;
Speak softly to me, Come in, subdue me;
In Your strength, Lord, take me through.


Calgary Songbook :1748


1
Lord, You are more precious than silver.
Lord, You are more costly than gold.
Lord, You are more beautiful than diamonds,
And nothing I desire compares to You.

2
Lord, Your life is divine, eternal.
Lord, Your life regenerated me.
Lord, Your life is growing within me,
Until I am fully conformed to Thee.

3
Lord, Your love is wide as the ocean.
Lord, Your love is deep as the sea.
Lord, Your love encompasses the nations,
And that is all I want to live in me.

4
Lord, Your light is shining within us.
Lord, Your light drives darkness away.
Lord, Your light is guiding us onward,
Preparing us for the coming wedding day.

1
Nearer each day to me,
Dearer each day to me,
This Person inside me is
Becoming reality.                     
Saving me, loving me,
Faith and hope giving me.
You’re all the world to me, Jesus my Lord.                     

2
Even when faith is small,
When there’s no hope at all,
I hear Him say to me,
Trust in Me and you’ll see,
That I’ll supply all your needs,
If only you will believe.
All anxious doubts will cease,
While trusting in Me.


Calgary Songbook :1750

O Lord, I love You,
I really love You,
Without You life’s really nothing.
You are so attracting
And You are so charming;
Your riches are unsearchable.
Your name’s so dear and sweet,
Calling makes one satisfied.
Now You are mine and I am Thine, Lord.
Joined and mingled with You,
God-man incorporation,
Foretaste of the New Jerusalem.


Calgary Songbook :1751

Love the Lord your God with all your heart
And all your soul and all your mind
And love all mankind as you have loved yourself.
Love the Lord your God
With all your heart
And all your soul and mind and love all mankind.
We’ve got Christian lives to live;
We’ve got Jesus’ love to give;
We’ve got nothing to hide
Because in Him we abide.
Love.(end)


Calgary Songbook :1752

I love You, Lord
With all my heart
Not with just a part
But with all of my heart
I love You, Lord
With all my heart
The Lord is making home in all my heart
The Lord is making home in my heart
The Lord is making home in my heart                     
Lord I let You in so You can begin                     
To make Your home in my heart


Calgary Songbook :1753

Lord, I just love You.
And there’s no One like You.                     
In the whole universe
I have no other One like You.                     
Lord Jesus, I love You.
To be a man, 
I must be a Christian; 
to be a Christian, 
I must be in His church, 
in His recovery; 
and to be in His recovery, 
I must be an overcomer.
If we are not overcomers, 
we will waste our entire life.

1
In this godless age,
Lord, You need some Samuels
Burdened with a vision clear of Your economy.
Where’s Your ark today?
And the ones who’d care for You,
E’en to put themselves aside to gain Your heart’s desire?
Raise up some to meet Your need, some Nazarites,
Prophets, priests, and judges, and men of prayer,
Speaking forth Your word, with Your authority,
A photo of Your heart for Your move.

2
Train us up today,
Full of vision, seeking You,
We’d await Your timing, fully subject to Your will,
Treasuring Your face,
Staying in Your presence, Lord;
E’en the very index of Your eyes would we obey.
Raise up some to meet Your need, some Nazarites,
To bring in Your kingdom on earth today,
Taking You as King that You may return
To usher in the end of the age.

3
When God wants to move,
He must gain an instrument;
Overcomers separated from the current age.
They have joined themselves
Through His word to His desire.
Overcomers constituted with the holy word.
Raise up some to meet Your need, some Nazarites,
Voluntary consecreated ones,
Who through Your word are joined to Your desire;
Your living testimony on the earth.

4
God needs men who pray;
Those who lay the tracks for Him;
God’s economy is carried out through men of prayer.
They love not themselves;
But a willing sacrifice.
What they fear—offending God, losing His presence dear.
Make us those who meet Your need, the Nazarites.
Make us those through who You’d close this age;
Who are one with You to bring the kingdom in,
Young people absolute for Your move.

We are the generation                     
The Lord has waited for.                     
He has sought us and pursued us.                     
When we touched Him, He renewed us.                     
Now the time has come
For all the young
To be in touch with Him!                     

2
God loves this generation —
He chose us for His plan.
We were young and disillusioned
In the age of mass confusion.
Now we are His choice,
We all rejoice —
To God we say “Amen”
Once we were searching,
Always worrying —
When would we end our search?
Now we’re reborn;
Our veils are torn,
Since He brought us to the church!

3
At last our search has ended;
Our praises fill the air.
We’re the chosen generation!
Jesus loves this generation!
And the time has come
For all the young
To be in love with Him!

Oh, my Lord, I give myself to You—                     
There’s nothing else to do,                     
My world is over now!                     
All the world lies in the evil one,                     
But I’m the Father’s son;                     
His love has met my need.                     
Lord, I give myself to You completely;
Lord, I need to sense the flow of life.
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
I love You, I really do!

2
Lord, I long to have You flow in me.
My heart could never be
Content with less than You.
Deep within, my heart cries out to You,
Hungry and thirsty too
For that sweet flow of life.

3
Shining One, in me direct Thy rays,
Shine through all false displays;
Let me not be deceived.
Lord, I know, I need Thy light to shine,
How else can I be Thine?
You must enlighten me.

4
Cleanse me now; don’t let one sin remain.
I cannot be the same;
Your life is all I need.
Oh forgive my failure and my sin.
Make me so clean within
So You can flow in me.

5
Oh, the joy! To have that life and peace!
Darkness and death have ceased
In Thy sweet presence, Lord.
Oh, the joy from fellowship so real!
Even the heav’ns, I feel,
Cannot compare with this.
Lord, I give myself to You completely;
How I praise You for the flow of life!
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus,
I love You, I really do!


Calgary Songbook :1803


1
Let me love and not be respected;
Let me serve and not be rewarded;
Let me labor and not be remembered;
Let me suffer and not be regarded.

2
’Tis the pouring, not the drinking;
’Tis the breaking, not the keeping—
A life suff’ring to seek other’s blessing,
A life loving and true comfort giving.

3
Not expecting pity and concern,
Not accepting solace and applause;
Even lonely, even forgotten,
Even wordless, even forsaken.

4
Tears and blood my price
For the righteous crown shall be;
Losing all, my cost for a faithful pilgrim’s life.
’Twas the life, O Lord, that You chose to live
In those days when on earth You walked.
Gladly suff’ring all injuries and loss
So that all might draw near and repose.

5
I cannot see how much farther I shall go;
Still I press on, knowing there is no return.
Let me follow Your pattern so perfect and true,
Bearing ingratitudes without complaint.
In this time of trial, O my Lord, I pray
That You’d wipe all my hidden tears away;
Let me learn, O Lord, You are my reward,
Let me be other’s blessing all my days.                     


Calgary Songbook :1804

Oh Lord, break through.
Lord, gain in me.
Lord, I want You my all to be.
Oh Lord, break through.
Oh Lord, replace me totally.
Lord, I surrender my all to You.
Right now I open to let You flow through.

2
I open now
With all my heart.
Lord, more and more possess each part.
Oh Lord, I pray
Subdue my soul.
Until You have the full control.

3
Oh Lord, make home
In all my heart.
Lord saturate and fill each part.
Oh Lord, make home
In all our heart.
Lord, constitute Your counterpart.

4
Lord, I believe
You can get through.
I give myself again to You.
Together we lay hold of You.
’Til we are Your expression true.
Lord, we would apprehend with all the saints
Your height and Your depth,
Your breadth and length.
And as we know Your love,
You will express Yourself through all of us
As Your fullness.

Praise the Lord! The God of Glory
Who appeared to Abraham
Has appeared to us in spirit
For His purpose and His plan!
God of Glory, God of Glory,
Do appear to us today,
Saturate and permeate us
’Til You fully have Your way.

2
Once we were in old Chaldea,
Worshipping the idols there;
But the God of Glory called us,
Saved us all from Satan’s snare.
Get out, get out, from Chaldea,
From that evil foreign land.
Come in, come in, to the good land,
Christ, the church, the one new man.

3
With the calling comes the promise
Of the kingdom life on earth.
This becomes our strength and motive
To get out of all the dearth!
Lord, we’re crossing every river—
For this You must call us on,
’Til Your kingdom and expression
On this earth are fully come.

4
This is now the highest gospel
To those still in Chaldee’s land—
Leave the fallen situation,
You’ve been chosen for God’s plan.
God of Glory, God of Glory,
Do appear to us each day,
Call us out into Your building,
Your desire on earth today.

I’ve given up the world because
I’ve found something more;
He’s better than anything
I’ve ever found before.
Yes, I have found the Living One,
Oh, how my spirit soars!
I called His name, I’m not the same;
I am for the Lord!
I’m for the Lord,
I’m loving Jesus,
I’m calling O Lord Jesus!                     

2
I’ve given up the world because
I’ve found something better;
I have found the Living One
And He breaks every fetter.
Yes, He’s the One who set me free,
Oh, how my spirit soars!
I called His name, I’m not the same;
I am for the Lord!

3
And now I’m really happy,
Yes, I’m fully satisfied;
I have found the Living One
And He lives right inside
Of you and me, so come and see
Now our spirits soar!
We called His name, we’re not the same;
We are for the Lord!
We’re for the Lord,
We’re loving Jesus,
We’re calling O Lord Jesus!

These are the days, my friend,                     
Time’s drawing to an end,
And we must choose,
must choose whom we will serve.
We will fight for the Lord
And stand in one accord
For the defeat of God’s arch enemy!                     

2
These are the days, O saints,
The heart of man, it faints
For Satan’s work
that’s seen throughout the land.
So we must count all loss,
Be one at any cost,
And give our all for God’s recovery.

3
These are the days, my friend,
The Spirits moving in
To raise the standard
up against the foe,
To show the one new man
According to His plan
And draw this generation to Himself.

4
These are the latter days,
Go forth and sound His praise,
Proclaim to men
the kingdom that shall come.
The army’s moving out
The enemy to rout,
And Christ will gain His rightful place on earth.


Calgary Songbook :1808


1
More of our heart, dear Lord, we’d give You now;
Even more ground to You, Lord, we’d allow.
All that distracts us we’d despise,
All that draws away our eyes—
Lord, do fill our vision
’Til the morning star has risen!
We would count all things loss, but Jesus gain;
Our inward parts cry out for You to reign.
Worthy You are our heart to claim—
Come, engrave on us Your name,
We would love You, Jesus, more.                     

2
Less we would argue, Lord, and go our way;
More we would say “Amen” to what You say.
Grant us a walk to You conformed,
’Til our living is transformed.
We adore You, Jesus—
May a pure love for You seize us.
Any unwillingness, Lord, quickly slay;
Even by faith we open all the way—
Rising to heights of love unknown,
Christ our destiny alone,
We would love You, Jesus, more!


Calgary Songbook :1809


1
Life’s too short
To waste a single day.
The kingdom life
Is closer every day.
In the midst of time,
The kingdom’s mine
Just by calling on His name each day.                     

2
The sweetest taste
Of life is deep within.
Its flowing out
Is primed by calling Him.
In the midst of time,
The kingdom’s mine.
Just by calling on His name each day.

3
Time is quickly
Running out each day,
The Lord will come
And swiftly end this age.
At the end of time,
The goal we see,
The Millennium is our entry.
The New Jerusalem we’ll be.


Calgary Songbook :1810


1
Lord, keep my heart always true to You,
Never backsliding, always viewing You,
A heart that is pure, that sees only You,
A heart that loves You and treasures only You.
Your love constrains me to give my all to You.
Lord, I can’t help it; my heart is drawn to You.
Oh what a privilege! I give myself to You!
I love You, Lord, dearest Lord.
I love You! I just love You!

2
Lord, keep my love burning brightly for You,
A love never dwindling, always hot for You,
A love shining brighter all the way for You,
A love so fresh like the day I first touched You.

3
Lord, take my life, I present it to You!
If I had a thousand, I’d pour all on You!
Nothing withholding, my all is for You.
My life and my future, dear Lord, is all for You.


Calgary Songbook :1811


1
Take my life and let it be
Consecrated, Lord, to Thee;
Take my moments and my days,
Let them flow in ceaseless praise.
For me, You were mocked and crucified;
For me, willingly You bled and died.
Lord, my life and love I willingly outpour
And will serve You evermore.

2
Take my hands and feet, I pray
For Thy work, to run Thy way.
Take my lips that I may sound
Words of truth to those around.

3
Take my silver and my gold;
Not a mite would I withhold.
Take my intellect, and use
Every power as Thou shalt choose.

4
Make my heart and will Thine own;
They belong to Thee alone.
Take my love; my Lord, I pour
At Thy feet its treasure store.

5
Take me, Lord, till I’ve become
Ever joined to Thee as one.
Take myself, and I will be
Ever, only, all for Thee.


Calgary Songbook :1812


1
We give ourselves to Thee, O Lord Jesus,
Never to turn aside;
Where’er the Lamb goes, there we would follow,
Follow whate’er betide.
We must follow the Spirit
In all simplicity.
In our spirit is Jesus—
He follows perfectly!

2
We give ourselves the flock’s steps to follow,
Knowing the Shepherd’s care.
Now in the churches Jesus is leading
And He is speaking there.

3
We give ourselves to follow the churches,
Oneness in Christ display;
Follow His move in all of the churches,
Stand fast as one this way

4
We give ourselves to enter the Kingdom,
That marriage feast, with Him;
Come persecution, suffering, and trials,
Still we will enter in.

5
Christ wants some followers here in the churches,
Followers of whom to say:
“These saw my purpose, followed me wholly”—
May we be those today!
Tune: Lord now I see


Calgary Songbook :1813


1
Lord, keep me from this evil and perverted age;
Wholly sanctify my eyes—on You to gaze.
Satisfy my deepest part.
O Lord, preserve my heart.

2
Rescue me, Lord, from this dark world—it’s just display.
Shine in me, and show me, Lord, You are the way.
Nothing matches me but You.
Only Your life will do.

3
Lord, cause my love for You to grow in me each day.
Through this love, show me the world’s passing away.
Separate me unto You.
O Lord, my heart renew.

4
Don’t let me go; I’m here for You and this You know.
Day by day, Your life within me has to grow.
Though this world is so corrupt,
I can and do love You.

5
O Lord, become a river flowing out of me,
That the world may take a drink of You and see
That You are the only way,
The One reality.


Calgary Songbook :1814


1
Lord Jesus, show me You’re real.                     
I couldn’t doubt Your love for me.
You are my everything, Lord.
Righteousness, peace, and my joy;
How did I have a heart so cold?

2
I gave myself to this world
And kept You far from my heart
Thought I was missing something
Thought I was losing something
Thought I needed much more than You.

3
It took me so long to see
You have desires and a need
My heart is so unyielding;
Why am I so self-seeking?
Burn me Lord, take my life for You.

4
Lord Jesus, show me You’re real
I know I’m likely to fall
But I am wholly cleansed now
You gave Your life for me; and
Everything I am is just You.

5
Lord Jesus, I know You’re real
Just turn my face to Your face
And all doubts fly away, Lord,
Your wants are my desires and
All I can say is I love You.


Calgary Songbook :1815


1
My Dearest Lord, I give my all
Into Your hands, to You I owe
My life, my love, to You belong.
Lift up my hands—sing You this song.
Lord You have won my heart.
Nothing can tear us apart.
To You, I give my all.
Dear Lord, I love You so.

2
O, Dearest Lord, I cry to You.
Don’t let me go away from You.
Lord, change my heart—to You belong.
My future, Lord, be Yours alone.

3
Your servant, Lord, cry out to You.
Let me be always serving You.
You, O Lord, You, O Lord,
Dear Lord, You alone.
Serving You alone.


Calgary Songbook :1816


1
Lord, by Your mercy, I would take
This opportunity
To let You live Yourself in me;
And let You, Lord, gain me.                     
Lord, save me from the past,
And save me from the future;
Yesterday is over,
Tomorrow may not be;                     
I only have this day;
I only have this moment.                     

2
And I would hope that You would take
This opportunity
To go as far as possible,
As possible in me.

3
Though many barriers hidden be,
You know, Lord, deep within—
Lord I want nothing else but You,
Lord, I want no one else but You.

4
So only this moment have I,
This opportunity;
This precious time I grant, dear Lord,
Solely unto You.


Calgary Songbook :1817

Good morning to You, Lord Jesus!
I consecrate myself to You today.
Lord Jesus!  I love You!
Oh, fill me with Your Spirit!
And saturate me Lord, I pray.                     

1
Good morning, dear Lord... Hallelujah!
My spirit is alive and bold today
Come forward is Your call
To the holiest of all
Your blood has cleared a new and living way.                     

2
Good morning, amen... Oh praise the Lord!
I live this day one spirit with You.
To Your Word I say amen.
Give me fresh experience again.
My heart, my mind, Lord soften and renew.

3
Oh Lord, this is the day of my salvation
Your living Word will operate in me
Today You are my choice
I’ll exercise to hear Your voice.
Then let You live and move and speak in me.


Calgary Songbook :1818


1
Though the world may promise me more,
I’m just made to be filled with the Lord.
Nor is life worth living a day
For the things that will soon pass away.
Doesn’t matter how rich or successful I’ll be,
Or how many pleasures be offered to me
There’s nothing that compares to my destiny
To be thoroughly filled with the Lord.

2
Even though I’m still kind of young
And my future is in front of me.
In my heart I’ve heard the Lord’s call
Just to follow Him absolutely.
Though the cup may be holding much joy or much pain
What matters is that more of Him I would gain.
Regardless what happens I never would change
’Cause I’m made to be filled with the Lord.


Calgary Songbook :1819


1
Lord I give myself to You again today
Lord, on this consecration path I choose to stay
You bought me with a price
My life I sacrifice
Lord, I am not my own.

2
Lord, I give myself to You again today
Your mercy reached me though I was so far away
You gave Yourself for me
From whose earthly dreams You freed
Lord, I am Yours alone.

3
Lord, I give myself to You again today
I open to You so that You may have a way
To work in me that I
Might serve You my whole life
Lord, I love You alone.


Calgary Songbook :1820

Oh, the joy of having nothing,
Being nothing, seeing nothing,
But a living Christ in glory,
And being careful for nothing
Oh, the joy of having nothing,
Being nothing, seeing nothing,
But a living Christ in glory,
And His interest here on earth.

I have decided to follow Jesus.                     
I have decided to follow Jesus.                     
I have decided to follow Jesus,                     
No turning back, no turning back.                     

2
The world behind me, the cross before me.
The world behind me, the cross before me.
The world behind me, the cross before me,
No turning back, no turning back.

3
Though none go with me, still I will follow.
Though none go with me, still I will follow.
Though none go with me, still I will follow,
No turning back, no turning back.

4
Where Jesus leads me, I’ll surely follow.
Where Jesus leads me, I’ll surely follow.
Where Jesus leads me, I’ll surely follow,
No turning back, no turning back.

1
I want to tell You, Lord, how much You mean to me.
Through years of careful molding, Your plan at last I see.
Though pain I’ve had—and suffering too,
Myself I yield at last, Lord, to You.

2
I want to care for You, the way You’ve cared for me.
You’ve been my friend to comfort,
received me when I’ve strayed.
And in return—I offer You
My life—so small compared, Lord, to You.

3
I’d like for You to fill me with all that You are.
And empty out my heart from everything You’re not.
You’ve blessed me Lord—by finding me.
Possess me now eternally.


Calgary Songbook :1823


1
Lord, You are my only goal!
You’re my only hope!
I only care for You!
I never could replace You,
And I would never want to.
I have everything, Lord—
I have You!

2
Lord, I only live for You—
Not anything else!
In everything, You’re my source;
No more good intentions,
No more right or wrong.
I don’t want a “good” life—
I want You!
Prayer is really powerful, 
but in order to be powerful, 
our prayer must be a prayer 
that touches the throne of God 
and the heart of God, 
and it must be a prayer 
that can move the very God.

1
I’m a beggar ’cause... I’m blind
So I take what I... can find
I’m groping for rea...lity
Only wishing I... could see
My parents, they can see
Why is this blindness in me?
All I know is I want to see reality

2
Lord, I am sitting by... the road
Begging outside of Je...richo
Now, Lord I hear that You... pass by
Lord, Son of David... I cry
Lord, Son of David, I cry
Please, Christ, don’t pass me by
I believe that you can open my eyes

3
You gave me life but where’s... my sight?
I am still blind and that’s... my plight
Blind lead the blind and then... both fall
So right now on You... I call
Jesus have mercy on me
Open my eyes that I might see
All I know is my only hope is in You

4
Lord I am rebuked by... the crowd
For You I cry out more... the loud
All the world wants to di...stract me
So I forget that I... can’t see
Jesus don’t leave me behind
You are the one I want to find
All I know is I just really need You

5
Still I’m afraid that You’ll... go on
But joyful ears hear You... respond
What would you like for me... to do
Oh Christ I just want to see You
Open my eyes to... see You
Let me find what my spirit can do
All I know is I just want to see You

6
In my spirit I... can see
Because that’s where You... touch me
By your touch dear Lord... I’m healed
All my sin and death... must yield
Now Lord, I am healed
In my spirit You are so real
All I know is I want to keep touching You

7
Lord my sight is for... one thing
So that I to You... can cling
I think I’m in love... with You
No one else for me... will do
Lord Christ let me follow You please
You’re so real and so special to me
All I know is Lord I never want to leave


Calgary Songbook :1901


1
Lord, now I see,
You only want me to believe,
Not to change.
In all my failures and defeats,
To believe what You have done,
And not in what I see.

2
Lord I believe,
When all around me is defeat
And it seems that nothing’s changing outwardly.
No! I’m not discouraged,
I’m believing You.

3
Yes, I believe,
And there is no demand on me.
Simple faith, yes, that is all You want from me.
Freed from anxious doubting—
I’m free to just believe!

4
Believing You,
Because, Lord, You are my success!
When I fail, all I must do is just confess,
And go on enjoying You—
I love believing You!


Calgary Songbook :1902


1
I never thought that God would be enjoyable;
And my experience of Him is indescribable;
When first I opened up my heart to Him;
He came in me and filled me to the brim...
O Lord, You’re wonderful,
You’re wonderful,
Jesus, Jesus.                     

2
I never sought Him, nor I ever asked for Him;
Sometimes I wonder “Am I in a heavn’ly dream?”
I don’t deserve Him, oh a sinner like me;
My explanation, friends, it’s just His mercy...
O Lord, Your mercy reached me,
Your mercy reached me,
Jesus, Jesus.

3
My friends they tell me, “Don’t be too  much for Him;
Just be so ‘normal’ and not go the extreme.”
But I can’t help it, there is no One like Him,
His love has touched me so I now have meaning...
O Lord, Your love has touched me,
Your love has reached me,
Jesus, Jesus.

4
My every moment is to live unto You;
In everything dear Lord, You must now break through;
I’m just a vessel, You’re my treasure within;
O Lord, keep spreading in my entire being...
By calling, O Lord Jesus,
That Name, most precious,
Jesus, Jesus.

5
And now I’m waiting for Your coming again;
Lord, keep me faithful to You unto the end;
To see You face to face on that great day;
’Tis my desire that I’d go all the way...
O Lord, You’re coming soon,
Our lovely Bridegroom,
Jesus, Jesus.


Calgary Songbook :1903

I’m walking down the road                     
That leads to glory.                     
I’m pressing toward the mark                     
By enjoying God!                     
I don’t know so much,                     
Just to love Him.
I’m walking down the road,                     
Glory, here I come.                     

1
With the brothers and the sisters,
We enjoy Him day by day.
It’s so simple and easy,
Our worries flee away.
Now we’re growing together,
As one big family,
Abiding in the joy of the Lord.                     

2
We enjoy You, Lord Jesus,
In our experience.
We’re getting to know You—
It’s making us leap and dance.
Just eating and drinking,
It’s what we do the best,
Delighting in the love of the Lord.

3
We’re walking, not running,
Cause we’re in the pasture land.
Our Shepherd is nearby,
We’re trusting in His hand.
He’s everything to us,
He’s all we ever need,
Resting in the peace of the Lord.


Calgary Songbook :1904


1
God’s economy                     
And His eternal plan,
His heart’s desire and intention
Is to be one with man.
Yet man has failed completely
Throughout all history.
But hallelujah!  Praise the Lord!
God’s life is now in me.

2
Now this life in me is flowing
As the river of water of life,
Washing away all my sins,
My cares, and all my strife.
This life is overcoming
Situations in my day.
Hallelujah!  Praise the Lord!
For this is what I pray:
Lord Jesus, I love You!
I give You the preeminence in what I do.
Enjoying You is the overcoming way.
Thank You for Your recovery;
Your Word we will obey.                     

3
Thank You for our situations
And the environments we are in.
That we’d turn to You in all things,
And turn away from sin.
We’d drop all our anxieties
And put our trust in You.
And experience this living One
Whose life is ever new.

4
Now the church life is so precious
With all the saints so dear.
Enjoying all Your riches,
Our vision is so clear,
That all would prophesy
Of Christ from what they’ve seen,
According to Your scripture
In First Corinthians fourteen.


Calgary Songbook :1905


1
Lord, how long, dear Bridegroom,
’Til You come, Lord, how soon?
Don’t delay for that coming day, coming day.
Grant me, Lord, to be filled
With You, Lord, ev’ry day.
Dearest Lord, take me all the way.
Come, Lord Jesus.
Please come, dear Bridegroom.
Precious One, come soon, come soon.
Lord, consume me!
Oh Lord, don’t let me stray,
Faithful to You all the way.

2
Lord, make home in all my heart,
In my secret, deepest parts,
Hidden, Lord, and reserved for You, for You.
You would be preeminent
In all things and all events,
Possessed by Thee to this extent.

3
In my prayer and deepest plea,
In my spirit always be,
Saturated and soaked with Thee, with Thee.
This would be my life daily,
Every hour expecting Thee,
This I pray, Lord, desperately.

4
The universe, in it we see,
In the sweetest touch of Thee,
You’re my choice and my destiny, destiny.
Lord, whate’er the price may be,
Lord, Amen, let it be,
Oh, my love, please come back quickly!

5
In Your love I am constrained.
What’s within, I can’t contain.
Lord I can’t anymore restrain, restrain.
In Your love, I’ll pour on Thee,
And the church, Your Bride to be.
This my choice voluntarily.


Calgary Songbook :1906

Lord, grant me today’s supply of grace;
May Your divine life grow apace;
Little by little, day by day, to grow
More and more, into You.

1
Day by day, bit by bit, life will grow as is fit,
Increasing gradually until,
However imperceptibly, Your life matures within me.                     

2
I would be desperately, constantly, patiently,
Drawing each breath of life from You, Lord;
Knowing that every day while I breathe,
Your life will permeate me.

3
Every day, may I rest, knowing that each bequest,
Matches my daily need exactly;
Jesus Christ intercedes for me, a member of His body.
Lord, grant me a heavenly, corporate view;
That all of my growth and prayers to You,
Little by little, day by day,
would cause building up into You.

4
We would be corporately, growing up steadily
Till we reach the stature of Your fullness;
Transforming and conforming us, Your
Manifested people.
(Chorus 1)
(Chorus 2)
Lord, grant me a heavenly, corporate view;
That all of my growth and prayers to You,
Little by little, day by day, would cause building up into
the New Jerusalem.

1
Just to be in You as You’re in me,
Just abide in You, Lord, constantly.
Here I’m one with You, as You’re with me.
Here we’re joined as one, Lord, mutually.
God’s dispensing, His economy,
In His Trinity,
He’s transfusing and He’s mingling
All He is to me.

2
I am just a branch, and You’re the vine.
As I dwell in You, everything is fine.
Here I’d like to be, Lord, all the time.
Here I’m Yours, dear Lord, and You are mine.

3
I’m a branch that’s been, Lord, grafted in.
I’m supplied in You in this life union.
Here Your riches, Lord, in this sweet life flow.
As I dwell in You, I will surely grow.

4
As I dwell in You, and You in me,
Here I’m joined to You, Lord, practically.
As I stay with You, as You’re with me,
We will mingle, Lord, subjectively.

5
As I’m loving You and enjoying You, Lord,
You become in me the rhema word.
Here I’ll pray in You as You pray in me.
You’ll bear fruit in me, Lord, abundantly.

6
As I dwell in You, Lord, You’re flowing through.
Lord, You’re filling me, overflowing too.
Here we all are one and expressing You.
Here our joy is full as we dwell in You.


Calgary Songbook :1908


1
Until He comes again,
I’ll watch and wait and call on Him.
I’ll pray that by His life and power,
I’ll overcome in every hour.

2
Until He comes again,
His blood will cleanse me of my sin.
His word will sanctify within,
And make me wholly unto Him.
Brothers:
He died to be Life to me                     
From death, I’m free.
Sisters:
He rose and as Spirit, He                     
Now lives in me.
Brothers:
In splendor and in glory
Like Him, I’ll be.

3
Until He comes again,
My soul-life, I’ll give up for Him.
No worldly pleasure can compare
To what my Savior has to share.

4
And when He comes again,
All saints built up and one in Him.
His Body, Bride, and Counterpart,
Eternal pleasure of His heart.
Sisters:
Lord, gain Your kingdom in me,
I long to be.
Brothers:
One with my Savior and King,
Eternally.
Sisters:
Oh, what a joy, it will be
Your face to see.

Calgary Songbook :1909


1
Bless me Lord with days and nights
Of talks alone with Thee,
With hours and minutes, moments too
That I would thus know Thee.

2
Bless me with Thy presence sweet,
For I have naught but Thee;
Yea, nothing left but Thee Thyself,
Lord, give Thyself to me.

3
Bless me with Thy shining light
And deal with every part.
That I would unreserved be
A channel of Thine heart.

4
Bless Thee Lord forevermore;
Come in these days between
’Til one day I am as Thou art
And Morning Star be seen.


Calgary Songbook :1910


1
Lord, You have searched me and You have known me
You understand my thoughts from afar!
You comprehend my path
And are acquainted with all my ways
For there is not a word on my tongue,
But behold You know it all together!
Search me, O God, and know my heart
Try me and know my anxieties
See if there is any wicked in me
And lead me in the way everlasting!

2
Lord, You have touched me and You have shown me
That I am not so simple as I thought.
I often run and hide, prone to an errant heart.
But there is not a pause and You pursue!
And behold You’ve caught me altogether!
Where can I go from Your Spirit, O Lord?
I can’t flee from Your presence, You’re inside me.
I’ve climbed the steep mountains,
but You still are there,
Descend to the valleys but You find me.

3
Now I see, there’s something more to this pattern:
You want to show me all that You are.
So You’ve drawn me from this strife, into the family life.
As one, our prayers can match Your deep desires.
Now behold we follow You together!


Calgary Songbook :1911


1
Rain on me; rain on me;
Let Your mercy rain on me;
It is not by willing or by running, Lord;
Let Your mercy rain on me.

Reign in me; reign in me;
May Your life, Lord, reign in me,
By Your grace abundant and Your righteousness;
May Your life, Lord, reign in me.

3
Overcome, overcome;
Lord, I pray to overcome,
By the Spirit sevenfold intensified;
Lord, I pray to overcome.

4
Grow in me; grow in me;
For the Body grow in me,
Through the rich dispensing of Your life supply;
For the Body grow in me.

5
Transform me; transform me;
For the Body transform me;
I behold Your glory with an unveiled face;
For the Body transform me.

6
Lord, gain me; Lord, gain me;
In the Body, Lord, gain me,
For the full expression of the Triune God;
In the Body, Lord, gain me.

7
Lord, blend me; Lord, blend me;
In the Body, Lord, blend me,
For the consummation—New Jerusalem;
In the Body, Lord, blend me.

1
As we become the same as Christ
in life, nature, expression and function,
we are qualified to work with Him for his Body

2
As we trust in the Lord helplessly,
depend on Him as our love and strength,
and listen to His speaking,
our hope is to be raptured
through the redemption of our bo - dy
and our prayer is – “Come, Lord Jesus!”
And our prayer is – “Come, Lord Jesus!”
Come, Lord Jesus!
Lord Jesus come!

Your love constrains me,
A tide overflowing
Softens my hard heart,
Erases my care
For You will take me,
Break me, remake me,
An overcomer,
Your kingdom to share.

2
None can compare with You,
Dearest Lord Jesus,
You are the ruler of
The kings of the earth
To You who loved us,
And who has washed us,
From all our sins in
Your own precious blood.

3
Live in life’s flowing,
And feed for His growing,
Drop every barrier,
Gaze in His face.
Shout Hallelujah!
Sound out Your victr’y,
You who will live Him
To finish the race.


Calgary Songbook :1914


1
On the cross You gave your life for me
that I might live again
In resurrection You have lifted me
to newness born within.
Through the blood I repent of all my sins
precious Lord I now give in.
Fill me Lord Jesus,
Lord I ask you to come in

2
Upon my heart do write O Lord,
so the Christ in me may grow
Renew me in my mind too Lord,
that your life through me may show
Calling O Lord Jesus,
wherever I may be
Thank you sweet, sweet Jesus,
for today you’ve set me free

3
Lord I really love you
You’re everything I need
Make Your home within my heart
only You I will believe.
Loving You, and Living You,
with a heart that’s pure and true,
O dear Lord Jesus
I trust my life to you

1
God’s desire—Life for man;
His intention—a building for His home;
Shame the devil, victory won.
Take the Word—soon it will be done.
Lord, I call—build me now
With the saints; O Lord, but how?
‘Praying always, in the spirit
With the Word.’ Amen, Lord!

2
Christ as Life—wondrous Person;
All His riches, now our full supply!
For the building, Life’s our need:
Life will build us—the enemy will fly

3
Let us rise—with our weapon;
Give ourselves for the Building of the Lord:
Slay contention, kill opinions:
This our weapon—the Spirit’s living sword.

4
There is a way that we can know the Life of Jesus;
And by this Life we’ll be built up as one for his home;
Just turn to Him and take His Word by prayer,
In your spirit daily pray His Word, pray His Word.
Tune: "Lord now I see"


Calgary Songbook :1916


1
Lord, do unveil
The more we strive, the more we fail
All the strife—they all come out to no avail.
Lord, they’re just not for your need
By “self”, we won’t succeed.

2
Lord, we confess
We are not able, Lord, unless
We have You; You’re all in all—You’re our success!
All we need, O Lord, is You
’Cause nothing else will do.

3
O Lord, we pray
Increase Thyself in us each day
And the “self”—decrease it ’til it’s done away.
Lord, we want the growth in life
We don’t want all the strife.

4
Lord, life’s begun
Two spirits mingled into one
Day by day, walk in the spirit and we’ve won!
Then the “self” will be decreased
And Christ in us increased.


Calgary Songbook :1917

Jesus won’t You come,
Won’t You come, won’t You come,
We say to our Bridegroom, “Come.”
Blend us all as one,
All as one that we will be
A Bride that matches You perfectly.
Make us all to be,
All to be, all to be
The expression of Your glory.
Oh, our Love!
We know You are longing for Your Bride.
Lord we long
That Your heart’s desire would be satisfied.

1
He washed away my sins.
Gave me a brand new heart.
A heart to love Him, trust Him,
seek Him in His Word.                     
He tells me, “Guard thy heart above all
that thou guardest.
For out of it flow the springs...
the springs of life.”                     

2
He walks with me each day:
I open up to Him.
He is my life, my stay and everything I need.

3
And sometimes when I fail
I forget that He is there:
He’s just there waiting, watching,
then He draws me near.

1
A life of failure is all I have at best,                     
So full of sin with much self-righteousness;
As I keep going I fail the Lord each day,                     
And I’m brought to my knees to pray:
Jehovah Savior, reach me with Your mercy now today,
I need You, Lord Jesus, to save me from my way,
You are faithful, and my hope is in You Lord,
You will deliver me more and more.

2
My heart desires You and yet there are those times,
I realize our hearts do not align;
Your heart’s for Zion, my heart’s not fully there,
But I come forward to declare:
Oh Lord, I open wide to be drawn continually,
Remove the objects of affection by degree,
Substitute them with the interest of Your heart,
A heart for Zion in me You’d impart.


Calgary Songbook :1922


1
Turn, turn my heart to You;
Lord, I confess my heart is untrue.
Turn, turn my wandering heart;
Lord, unto me Thy love impart.
Lord, I call,
I call on Thee.
You’re the only One for me!

2
Rich, rich, He’s rich to all,
Rich unto all that call on His name.
Rich, rich, He’s rich, so call;
Now and forever, Jesus the same.

3
Love, love, the love of God
Flows as a river, full to the brim.
Love, love, I’m filled with love,
Crazy in love with Jesus within.


Calgary Songbook :1923

Enter into the enjoyment
Experience the Lord                     
He’s the rich supply
Don’t let a *day go by
Without the presence of the Lord!                     
We don’t care about the tree of knowledge
Good and evil kill us dead.                     
We don’t need to behave ourselves into the grave
Just touch the living Lord instead.

Whither shall I go from Thy Spirit?                     
And whither shall I flee from Thy presence?

1
If I ascend up into the heavens
Thou art there;
Or if I make my bed in Sheol, behold,

2
If I take the wings of the dawn and dwell
In the uttermost parts of the sea, behold,
Thou art there;

3
Even there shall Thy hand lead me,
And even there Thy right hand shall hold me,
Behold, Thou art there.

Calgary Songbook :1

I once was dead-–dead in my sins;
 I was once apart from Christ you know
Behaved myself in lust of flesh
 Alien from the wealth of Israel
By nature such a child of wrath,
 Not a hope—not even one to tell
Even as the rest.
 Without God in the world.


Calgary Songbook :2

But God being so merciful
Now in Christ He has become my peace;
Because of His great love to me
By the blood of Christ I am released
Enlivened me I’m now in Christ
I am one with all the saints, since He’s
Seated in the heavenlies.
Broken down the middle wall.


Calgary Songbook :3

But that’s not all! I’m with the saints He has died creating one new man
Together we’re His workmanship
Thus fulfilling God’s eternal plan
His masterpiece expressing Him
With all saints together, let us stand
In the heavens and on earth.
Shout and sing and praise the Lord!

May my day be full of Christ.
May my words be spoken in Him.                     
May my being find rest
Lying on His sweet breast,

2
May my mind be filled with His light,
May my Spirit be shining so bright,
May His life bear much fruit,
May I be absolute,
To partake of the living Christ.

We want more of Jesus,

So we’ll give Him more of us.

I’m gonna praise God unceasingly                     
Because He lives in me,
He’s everything to me,
Gives life continually.
I’m gonna praise God unceasingly                     
Because He lives in me,
And He will never leave.                     
Now in our spirit we can feed,
Jesus Christ is all we need,
Call His name and He becomes reality.                     
Open up your mouth and you will see,
Just how rich our Lord can be.
He’s the very life supply, complete is He.

Now I live by the tree of life,
His fruit does nourish me,
O, how it strengthens me,
I’ll live eternally.
Now I live by the tree of life,
Him daily I apply,
He is my food supply.

3
There’s a river of life in me,
Flowing so livingly,
Moving continually,
He just keeps flooding me.
There’s a river of life in me,
He’s always filling me,
His name is Jesus Christ!


Calgary Songbook :2001


1
Lord, You are the living spring,
The river of water of life;                     
Only You can quench my thirst;
Only You satisfy.
Lord, You are the living tree,
You are the Tree of Life;
Only You can fill my hunger;
Only You satisfy.
Every moment in so many ways
He is the sure supply;
Now and forever and always,
Only You satisfy.

2
Lord, You are the living vine,
In You we would abide;
Only You give life divine;
Only You satisfy.
So we must praise
And we must sing,
And we must testify;
Lord, You are the only One;
Only You satisfy.
(chorus)

If you are hungry, come to the feast.
Open to Jesus—He is all you need.
He fed the thousands, now He’ll feed you.
Just open your mouth and take Him in—
That’s all you have to do.
We’ve found that calling on Jesus fills us within.
He came as food, so now we take Him in.
No doctrines or forms that you have to learn
To come and meet with us.
Just enjoy the Lord Jesus!

2
If you are thirsty, He’s heard your cry.
He is a fountain that will not run dry.
He’s quenching our longings, we’re satisfied,
Just eating and drinking the risen Lord!
Yes, that is why He died;
So He could become the Spirit, get into us,
Fill all our being—Oh, how glorious!
It’s really so simple—just take and eat;
That’s all you have to do.
Come enjoy the Lord Jesus.
God's life in us
Growing
Morning Revival
His Name
Calling

Calgary Songbook :2101

Calling, “O Lord Jesus!”
How it makes our spirit strong!
We can really touch Him,
And our gloom is turned to song!
Don’t listen to Satan, with all His distraction;
Just turn to your spirit, and spring into action!
Calling, “O Lord Jesus!”
You’ll enjoy Him all day long!                     


Calgary Songbook :2102


1
Life is God the Father
In Christ Jesus as the Spirit
Flowing out and coming into us.
He’s not just a teaching,
Or a creed or a dead doctrine,
But the processed Triune God, glorious!

2
Life is not created
As man’s body, soul, and spirit—
That’s man’s life that’s weak and temporal.
Life is uncreated.
It’s divine and it’s eternal.
And this is the life that’s indestructible.

3
And this life came in us
In our spirit through the Spirit;
This is where we were made alive!
Now this life is spreading,
Lord, don’t stop—just keep invading.
For this, Lord, we must be daily revived.

4
Life needs our maintaining,
Otherwise we’re suffocating.
Calling on His name we breathe Him in.
Everywhere we breathe Him,
Makes us fresh and makes us living.
O, this life is full of hope and meaning.

5
In our daily living
It’s this life that we are sensing.
Are we in the flesh or in the Lord?
If you’re dead and empty
And the troubles you have plenty.
Saints, get out of there and flee back to the Lord!

6
Then you’ll sense life flowing.
It’s this life that’s overcoming
Satan, flesh, and the world, and sin.
What a life we’re having.
Lord, Your virtues manifesting.
Thus, we’re branches bearing fruit in John 15.


Calgary Songbook :2103


1
I wake up this morning, Lord;
The sun shines through my windowsill.
How can I help but praise Your name!
You’re my Lord and King!
Because You...gave Your life up for me.
The Spirit...You were raised to be.
Now You are...living deep in me,
As my hope of glory.

2
Each day Your mercies they are new,
To me refreshing as the dew;
You are my bountiful supply.
Every morning You’re nigh!

3
For me You came from up above,
Because You are the God of love;
Your love will never let me go;
Everyday it flows.

4
Your love flows out to me as grace,
Enabling me to run the race;
As truth You’re my reality,
As my all to be.

5
As I walk on this pilgrim road,
My flesh and self You will erode;
In my heart, You will have Your way;
Take more room each day.

6
Each day the world I leave behind;
You write Your laws upon my mind,
Inscribing on my softened heart,
Filling every part.

7
O Lord, I’m just a tree in You,
Rooted and being built in You,
Absorbing all You are to me,
What a place to be!
Tune: Hymns 396


Calgary Songbook :2104


1
I’m pressing on the God-man way,
New Christ I’m gaining every day,
Still groaning through this world of strife,
I want to live a God-man life!
Lord grow in me! You are the seed,
Of God-man life; You’re all I need.
In all my heart, I give You ground.
Lord, may Your life in me abound!

2
My heart has no desire to stay,
On hardened ground, in the world’s way.
Satan no more shall steal Your Word,
I’ll move my heart where You are heard!

3
I want to deal with rocks in me
From hidden sins, I would be free.
My heart I would clear up through prayer,
I’ll gain more depth to root You there!

4
The choking thorns, us barren make,
The life seed soon they’ll overtake.
Riches, anxiety reject,
Just for God’s growth the ground protect!

5
The sun must shine for us to grow,
So persecution we will know.
When it seems more than we can bear,
Lord, help us drink You deeply there!

6
We want to grow to utmost height,
Until Your body comes in sight.
Yourself in man will then be shown;
Your plan at last by all be known.


Calgary Songbook :2105


1
In my life I’d have to say
I never dreamed there’d come a day
When God would be so real to me
And I knew what it meant to be
A man, simply loving the Lord.

2
Praise the Lord, my life’s begun
Since I have touched this Living One.
I’ve been set free from death and sin
So now I gladly give my life to Him,
Ever loving the Lord.
Living, Jesus is living,
And He keeps giving Himself to us.
And He keeps giving... Himself to us.

3
Though the years may come and go,
But still Your living presence flows.
My friends said it would fade away,
But, Lord, You’re home in me to stay.
How rich! Just enjoying the Lord!

4
Lord Your life is ever new,
My heart bursts forth in praise to You.
What joy You have to give to man,
And peace the world will never understand,
Only found in the Son!


Calgary Songbook :2106


1
Fallen, that’s the way we all begin:
Imprisoned by the evil state we’re in.
How can we from this hard world of sin be saved?
Just by calling, “Jesus, Jesus, Jesus.”
Every moment, each day!
Calling the name of Jesus—
We’re finding is the way.
It’s—Jesus, Lord Jesus!

2
Even though we love the Lord so much,
Somehow, it seems that we get out of touch
With Jesus. How can we be freed from such distress?

3
Sometimes we know we aren’t being real.
Then times, we just live by how we feel.
Is there some way we could ever deal with self?

4
Christians, scattered throughout all the earth
Are wand’ring—Lord, where is Your Bride of worth?
How can all those of the second birth be one?
Tune: Hymns 335


Calgary Songbook :2107


1
Now God’s Kingdom has been planted in our hearts
As the wonderful seed sown in us.
It is Jesus Christ, who all He is imparts
As the seed of the Kingdom in us!                     
Oh, He’s the seed of the Kingdom in us,
He’s the wonderful seed sown in us!
In our spirit sown, in us to be full-grown—
He’s the seed of the Kingdom in us!                     

2
Human generations form the history
Of the wonderful seed sown in us.
Mingled with the Triune God’s divinity
Is the seed of the Kingdom in us.

3
Jesus’ name means this: “Jehovah’s saving us,”
He’s the wonderful seed sown in us.
And so now we call Him our Jehovah-Plus,
He’s the seed of the Kingdom in us.

4
“Emmanuel” means it’s God Himself with us
As the wonderful seed sown in us.
No more simply God, Emmanuel is God-Plus—
That’s the seed of the Kingdom in us.

5
We have all we need to live the kingdom life
In the wonderful seed sown in us.
Hallelujah! Now we give up all our strife,
For the seed of the Kingdom’s in us.

O Lord since time began
You’ve had one aim, one goal.

Is centered ’round all man.
New, new new, Your goal is so new,
Take us, Lord, possess us to be channels for You.

Don’t let us settle down,
Be occupied or set,
But living, open, new,
Fresh, empty, young in You!
New, new, new, Your life is so new,
You’re the living One we wholly give ourselves to.

4
You long that Christ Himself,
Be known and realized,
Experienced, expressed,
In a full and living way.
New, new, new our Christ is so new,
We are here for nothing on this earth but for You.

Nothing can content me more,
Than Jesus in the morning,
Echoing the hallways of my heart.                     
My eyes from darkness clearly see,
The love within His smile, for me.
It’s then I know the reason for my life.                     
Jesus, You’re my reason for being here,
Oh, it’s so clear; so I sing!                     

2
No greater joy can be for me,
Than turning to Jesus,
When the shadows of the day
Begin to haunt me.
His soft, warm Spirit spreads throughout,
Quenching all my fear and doubt.
Jesus is the all-inclusive love.
Jesus, You’re my reason for being here,
Oh, it’s so clear; so I sing!
(Repeat verse 2)

Oh tell me, what’s the key
To build the Body?
How to be deified,
The Body realize?                     
Eat the hidden manna—
Get God into you,                     
’Cause when God gets into you,
You get into God!

2
Our God is ent’rable,
And He’s enjoyable,
Our Christ—He is the way,
We eat Him ev’ry day.

Center of centers ’tis,
The hidden manna is
Our deepest life supply;
How He does satisfy!

Don’t trust the circumstance,
For it is just the chance.
To get more God in you,
Become Him through and through!

5
Spend time alone with Him,
Just love Him, talk to Him;
By this we’re deified
And we become His Bride!

There’s a man who died to set us free,
Everybody knows it’s Jesus;
He came down from heaven just to live in me,
Everybody knows it’s Jesus!

So open up and call on Jesus;

So turn to Him and call, “Lord Jesus!”
Open up your heart and let Him into you
By calling on the name of Jesus!

O that Christ may make His home my heart!
Spread Himself in every part!
Saturate and life impart!
That with all saints, I may apprehend
All the vast dimensions of my loving Christ.                     

1
Father God, forgive me if I groan.
For so long I’ve been on a plateau.                     
Now with tears, I bow my knees and pray,
By Your Spirit make my spirit strong today.                     

2
As I came this morning to Your word
With no strength to even read a verse
Yet my plea, is “Lord I do need You!”
How You strengthen me, Your power within to prove.

3
I myself was losing heart each day
Then the Lord brought some saints my own way
I alone could not Thee apprehend
But with all the saints You now my joy have been.

4
All this year I’ve come the church to know
Yet, O Lord, there’s things I can’t let go
Yet within me there is an “Amen”
O now joy I never knew in me’s flowin’.


Calgary Songbook :2114


1
Each time in the morning, a while before dawn
To You, Lord, I whisper a praise or a song,
And feel Your life stirring so deep within me—
My cup runneth over with joy!

2
And then at the moment my heart turns to Thee,
The eyes of my spirit Your presence can see;
While all is so fresh and the sunlight breaks through—
My cup runneth over with joy!

3
And when at the noontime I’m hungry and worn
And feel that the cares of this world have me torn,
You come as my haven, my rest, and my food—
My cup runneth over with joy!

4
And then in the evening when my thoughts are free,
Remembr’ing that You, Lord, still dwell within me,
This sweet fact releases a river in me—
My cup runneth over with joy!


Calgary Songbook :2115


1
Nothing’s quite so precious
As Jesus in my spirit.
He takes away the care
And fills me with His peace.
He never leaves me,
Even as the days grow weary.
His presence goes with me.
My soul delights to hide in His arms.
I call His name, “Lord Jesus,
Help me in my weakness.”
So faithfully each day in me
He proves His life is so sufficient.                     

2
Nothing’s quite so precious
As Jesus in my spirit.
He turns my heart to Him,
To feast upon His life.
It’s nothing I do—
His mercy’s just upon me.
And God’s free gift of grace
Becomes an endless joy to me.

O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus,

1
There is a song within me;
It’s a song of Jesus moving
In the garden of my heart.
This Jesus lives within me,
Planting flowers of Himself
There to be watered by my love.
I’m loving Jesus, this lovely Person                     
with personality so strong.
He brought me to Himself                     
And said to me, “All of your heart’s
desire is found in Me;
I’m all you need and I love you.”

2
There is a peace within me
That has sprung from deep
Contentment with my Lord,
Who’s All in All.
For my delight is in this Living One
Inside of me Who is,
Himself, my everything.

Calgary Songbook :2120

It is God’s commandment and it is His desire
That His people call, call upon His name.
It’s the joyful way, the joyful way to drink
From the fountain of God’s rich salvation.                     
Calling is the way to delight oneself in God,
That is to enjoy Him, enjoy the Lord our God.
Hence, we as God’s people must daily call on Him.
This must be our practice for God’s jubilee.


Calgary Songbook :2121

I just keep calling, “O Lord!”
As I walk along;
I just keep calling, “O Lord”
And He gives a song.
Though the storm clouds darken the sky,                     
O’er the upward trail;                     
I just keep calling, “O Lord”
He will never fail.                     
He’s a faithful friend
Such a faithful friend
I can count on Him                     
To the very end.

When you say “Lord!”
You say a lot of things that nobody else can say;
You say you care enough to only want
the King of Kings!
For there is nothing more;
There’s only something less!
Jesus is all in all; He is the very best.
When you say, “Lord Jesus!”
You’ve said it all.

I have a seed of life in me
This seed of life is growing free.
This seed of life is just Christ alive in me.
Thank You, Lord, for opening my eyes!
Thank You, Lord, I’m forever satisfied!

And now He’s growing inwardly.
He saturates me thoroughly.
The fellowship is so sweet;  He fills me to the brim.
Lord, You are my life and my guide!
Lord, to You my heart is open wide!

Lord, I give my life to You
That I’d forever grow in You.
And You in me, so I’ll always be one with You.

We have found a simple way for us to
really touch the Lord:

what grace He does afford!
From our spirit now we say them, and

It’s easy to touch the Lord!                     
Oh Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!
It’s easy to touch the Lord!

Then all will see, all will know,
You are the Lord within us.

Calgary Songbook :2200


1
Don’t be afraid
When the wind is blowing strong
Don’t be afraid
When the storm’s gone on too long
It’s your Father’s hand you feel
He will take you through the gale
For the life He’s put within you
Has outlasted many storms
And won through the wiles of Satan
In all their many forms
So be trusting in your Father
In sweet fellowship with Him
For He’s walking on the waters
And He scorns the darkness grim

2
Take courage now
And just look into His face
Don’t fear to step
Through the turmoil of the days
Don’t let your gaze
Drag you down into the waves
Cry out to Him
And you’ll touch His hand of grace
Thank You Father, I’m a son of light
Amid a darkened age
Though the enemy is seeking
To devour me in rage
But my life is in the Father
And He is one with me
And His kingdom soon is coming,
Sweet divine reality!


Calgary Songbook :2201

From the morning to the evening,
His faithfulness I see;
His mercy reaching sinners,
reaching even me;
And I know, now I know.                     
Brighter than the brightest sunlight,
all doubts and fears must cease;
Sweeter than the sweetest delight,
His living word in me
And I know, now I know —
That God is there for me tomorrow,
as He is for me today;
That He’ll take my cares and sorrow,
and He’ll wipe them all away;
There’s no crisis that He can’t bear,
there’s no storm He can’t abate;
He’s my God, He’s my God.

2
Day by day His grace grows dearer;
His love has conquered me,
Never leaving, never ceasing,
His Spirit constantly
Flooding me, rich and free;
Higher than the highest heaven,
He lifts me up to see
New Jerusalem descending,
His Bride, His love to be
Eternally, it shall be.


Calgary Songbook :2202

I cast all my cares upon You.
I lay all of my burdens down at your feet.

I don’t know about tomorrow,
I just live from day to day.
I don’t borrow from its sunshine,
For its skies may turn to gray.
I don’t worry o’er the future,
For I know what Jesus said,
And today I’ll walk beside Him,
For He knows what is ahead.
Many things about tomorrow,
I don’t seem to understand;
But I know who holds tomorrow,
And I know who holds my hand.

2
I don’t know about tomorrow,
It may bring me poverty;
But the One who feeds the sparrow,
Is the One who lives in me.
And the path that be my portion,
May be through the flame or flood,
But His presence goes before me,
Bravely His path I will trod.

1
Every new day’s a new start.
Lord, again we’re coming to You.
Lord, could You ever break through within us
If, Lord, we gave You a part?
O Lord, we can’t do it on our own.
O Lord Jesus, how we need You!
Win us, woo us, to Thyself, Lord,
That we’d ever stay, Lord, with You.

2
Lord, before time had begun,
We were marked and called out by You.
We had no choice, we were trapped by You, Lord;
We had no place we could run.

3
Some of my friends are so free.
Who could I blame, Lord, but Thee?
I cannot do all the things that they do
Because You set me apart.

4
Lord, I’m realizing that
Loving You’s a tender trap.
Since You have kissed me, my heart has melted;
All my resistance has cracked.


Calgary Songbook :2205


1
When all around my sky is falling
And fear and doubt run deep in my heart,
It’s in these times I’m on You calling,
Op’ning to You, Lord, my deepest part.
Oh, Lord Jesus!
How I love You!
And I need You
All the time.
Ahh, to touch You
In my weakness,
And to hold You,
Savior mine.

2
Lord, by Your mercy You consume me.
It’s all according to God’s plan.
By resurrection life renew me,
Day by day, my inner man.


Calgary Songbook :2206

I’m just a little flower
With open face;
I’m fully turned to God,
Receiving grace.
I don’t know how to try -                     
This is my case -                     
I’m just a lily trusting God.

Abba, Father, hear our cry,
Mingled spirit deep within.
Abba, Father,
Abba, Father.

2
Thank You, Father, for sending Him;
The Spirit of Your Son Who cries within.

3
Oh! How sweet is Abba’s Name
From our spirit through our heart.

4
Every moment this mingled cry;
To Your Beloved we’re joined thereby.

5
Day by day, this cry so new;
In Your Son we come back to You.

6
In Your bosom here we’ll stay,
In Your Son and never stray.


Calgary Songbook :2208

Are you discouraged?
And are you blue?                     
Are clouds obscuring the sun from view?                     
Keep trusting Jesus, though storms assail,
You have His promise,
He will not fail.
It’s always darkest before the dawn                     
Rest in His vict’ry, the battle’s won.                     
Sing praise to Jesus, no need to wail                     
You have His promise,
He will not fail.


Calgary Songbook :2209


1
Lord, this light my heart’s longing for
Shine it forth from Your treasure store.
Make Your way so clear to me
With Your grace abundantly.                     

2
The way ahead, I know not of
’Cept to please my God, my only love.
Dark or light I plea to You
That Your grace would still break through.

3
Death and life You would ask of me.
Lord, my request through You it would be.
O’er the mounts, through valleys I go
And Your grace does ever flow.
To realize and participate 
in the deep and hidden things 
God has ordained and prepared for us 
requires us not only to believe in Him 
but also to love Him.  
To fear God, to worship God, 
and to believe in God 
are all inadequate; 
to love Him is the indispensable requirement.

Triune God
God's Economy


Calgary Songbook :2300


1
The Son with the Father by the Spirit—
O what a mystery!
The fullness of all the Godhead dwells
In Him bodily.
Wonderful One, Son with the Father,
Wonderful One, Son by the Spirit,
Wonderful Jesus Christ,
Wonderful Triune, Wonderful Triune God!

2
The Son with the Father by the Spirit,
Conceived in a virgin’s womb
The issue: a God-man, a wonderful Person,
Jesus, divine and human.
(Repeat the first chorus)    

3
This man in perfection chose God as His living;
He lived the life of God.
The sin, world, and Satan could not penetrate Him
Jesus had sinless blood.
Humanity, His blood has cleansed me.
Divinity, my guarantee.
His sinless blood cleansed me.
God’s now my guaran—, God’s now my guarantee.

4
His flesh without sin joined man’s flesh full of sin
And this trapped Satan.
Man’s flesh, sin and Satan were hanging upon Him
O what a termination!
Terminating, the old creation,
Nullifying, flesh, sin and Satan.
O what a promised seed!
He crushed the Devil’s,
He crushed the Devil’s head.

5
And in resurrection, this wonderful Person—
The Spirit He became.
The Spirit right now is the Son with the Father
To be the consummation.
Wonderful One, life-giving Spirit!
Son has become, the consummation.
Son with the Father, He
As Spirit dwells in, as Spirit dwells in me.

6
And in His ascension, this wonderful Person,
This man is on God’s throne.
The highest position, to Him it was given,
He’s ruling and reigning.
As Lord of lords, and King of kings,
The highest name, to Jesus given.
This man is on God’s throne.
Most wonderful, most wonderful Person!

7
And in His enthronement as Head over all things
The processed God is He,
Dispensing Himself as the life-giving Spirit,
Producing His Body.
The Triune God, is not for doctrine;
The Trinity, is for dispensing.
He’s now dispensing!
And we’re enjoying, and we’re enjoying,
And we’re enjoying Him.
Complete Salvation of God in Romans

God’s complete salvation
Is based upon His righteousness and through our faith.
By the two divine transfers:
Out of Adam into Christ
And out of the flesh into the Spirit.
In the one spiritual union
of the Spirit of Life with our spirit,
Forming a mingled spirit.
For us to reign in life by the abundance of grace
and of the gift of righteousness.

Reading the Bible—
I love the Word of God!                     

1
Every verse reveals Yourself to me,
Every line conveys reality.
When I pray the words that You breathed out
You become so real to me.                     

2
As I read, I pray, as I pray, I read,
Mingling both as one spontaneously.
You respond within with words so sweet,
I repeat these words to Thee.

3
I’m a newborn babe—it’s the milk I need,
Not the knowledge of the dead teaching.
When I eat Your word, it becomes to me
My heart’s joy and rejoicing.

4
Sweeter than honey, precious more than gold;
It will not be void, but as the rain and snow,
It will do Your will—bear the life divine,
Bearing fruit a hundred-fold.

5
When my heart is like a rock so cold,
It’s Your word so strong that hammers stone,
That the grain of life may come to me
And supply me inwardly.

6
It’s my food, my drink, and my life supply;
I love to eat it every day and night.
I just turn and open up to Him,
And the rivers flow right in.

The Triune God and the Person
And the work of Christ,
The Triune God is a mystery,
The mystery of life.
The Father, Son, and Spirit—
Three-One now to be,
Not for comprehending,
But to flow God into me.

2
The Triune God is forever,
Forever to be
The life supply in my spirit;
He’s dwelling in me!
The Father in the Son came
Displayed for all to see;
The Son as Spirit flows now
To flow God into me.

3
I’m calling His name “Lord Jesus”;
He’s coming in my heart.
He’s spreading out from my spirit
To all my inward parts.
The more I contact daily,
The more my heart Christ’s home,
And with the saints I’m built up
Into the church, Christ’s home!                     
(Repeat verse 3)    
Second Corinthians Banner


Calgary Songbook :2306

The new covenant ministry—a ministry of God—
is the ministry of the Spirit who gives life (who gives life)
and of righteousness as the expression of God.
The new covenant ministers are persons
Whose hearts have turned to the Lord,
Who are enjoying the Lord as the Spirit,                     
And who are being transformed
Into the image of the Lord
By beholding and reflecting Him.
The new covenant ministers are ambassadors of Christ,
Carrying out the ministry of reconciliation
To bring us into God and to make us one with God.
The new covenant ministers’ living
Is a living of grace, the experience of grace,                     
Which is the Divine Trinity
Transmitted into us for our enjoyment.

Reaps corruption of the flesh (trouble)
He who sows unto the Spirit
Will reap eternal life.
God’s not mocked,
Do not be deceived,
For whatever you sow, you will reap,
You will reap what you sow;
Sow the life seed.

Every choice is planting seeds,
So be careful what you sow. (careful)
Just as an apple seed,
It will grow an apple tree.

1
There are three kinds of life in our existence today:
There is Bios, the physical, and soul-life, Psuche;
Now the third life is God’s life and its called Zoe;
And we all have to choose what life we’ll live by today.
Oh, it’s God in Christ Jesus, through the Spirit today,
Who is flowing within us, flowing through us this way.
We don’t care for the Bios; we don’t want Psuche;
All we want is God’s Zoe life to fill us today.

2
We don’t care for the Bios, we don’t care for the soul.
We don’t care for the cares of life,
world’s pleasure and show.
We don’t care for the pride of life, the flesh and sin—
We say, “No!” to the soul life,
we’ll take God’s life within.

3
Do you know what God’s life is? Well, just listen to this:
It is God in Christ Jesus through the Spirit—no less!
He is flowing within us, He is flowing through—
Hallelujah! He’s moving to make everything new.

4
We have this Life within us, in our spirit today;
To our spirit we turn, O Lord, and take you this way.
We can overcome Bios and the Psuche too;
Hallelujah, the Spirit of the Lord takes us through.

Fallen, in her condition
Israel left her Love.
She was stubborn in her position—
To God she would not come.
Under the Lord’s chastising
She was an unturned cake.
But Jehovah, with love unchanging
Makes Israel His own son—a change to make.

2
You became a man—
Cord of love to me.
I am drawn with loving bands
And embraced by Thee.
From the heavens came,
You stepped out of eternity,
Died and rose as a man                     
That You could impart Your life to me.

The Christian life is a life,
A life of living Christ
For the constitution and building up
Of the Body of Christ;
The Christian life is a life of living Christ.
We need to work out our own salvation
By obeying the inner operating God.
We need to be conformed to the mold of Christ’s death
By the power of His resurrection that we may attain
To the out resurrection from the dead.
The Christian life is a life,
A life full of Christ
As forbearance but without anxiety;                     
The Christian life is a life full of Christ.

Corinthians 12:13, Footnote 5


Calgary Songbook :2315

To be baptized in the Spirit
Is to get into the Spirit
And to be lost in Him.
To drink of the Spirit
Is to take the Spirit in
And have our being saturated with Him.
By these two procedures
We are mingled with the Spirit.
To be baptized in the Spirit
Is the initiation of the mingling
And is once for all.
To drink the Spirit
Is the accomplishment of the mingling
And is perpetual fore ver.


Calgary Songbook :2316

If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these,
He will be a vessel unto honor sanctified,
Useful to the master,
Prepared unto every good work,
Unto every good work.
But flee youthful lusts and pursue righteousness,
Faith, love, peace with those who
call on the Lord out of a pure heart.


Calgary Songbook :2317

Christ is a genuine man,                     
The perfect and finest man,                     
Obedient, serving, no appearance of evil,
The finest personality,
Divinity expressed through humanity.
Christ is the pattern for our human living.
His perfect life is filling us.
Christ is the pattern for our human living,
The fine and balanced humanity of Jesus!
(Repeat 1st stanza)    
Remind me this whole day to reject myself, 
not to trust myself, and not to live by myself.  
Strengthen me to live by You.  
May this be a day for me to live You out, 
taking You as my everything, 
abiding in You as a branch in the vine.

God's Economy


Calgary Songbook :2400


1
Man’s Creator has a purpose
For our being here on earth.
In His image we’re created,
To express His rule on earth.
But man fell to Satan’s tempting;
Thus God’s goal was hid from view.
Still our God will have His Kingdom,
For His Son will see it through.
Jesus Christ will get His Kingdom
Inspite of Satan and his plans.
He’s getting something real and solid
By growing in the hearts of man.
It’s nothing like religion teaches,
“You have to wait until you die.”
For the Kingdom Christ is building,
Is here on earth before our eyes.

2
His Son, Jesus, is our Savior.
Once in human form He came.
Now as the Spirit He can enter
As the breath of life to man.
As a seed within our spirit
Christ takes root and starts to grow,
Spreading in our inmost being
Till His life we come to know.

3
Time is short, oh brothers hear it.
Christ is longing for His Bride.
We can hasten His returning,
Simply by the growth in life.
No more struggling, no more striving,
Simply turn to Christ within.
See the seed begin to blossom,
Growing fully into Him.
Jesus Christ will get His Kingdom
By growing in a normal way.
It’s not an instant transformation.
This growth goes on from day to day.
The seed of life is all-inclusive.
It’s got everything we’ll ever need.
Yes, our God’s eternal purpose
Is all within this precious seed.

1
Born of my father, descended from Adam,
A life in my flesh is God’s enemy.
I have inherited God’s condemnation,
Death and sin were reigning in me.

2
But love eternal appeared and He called me,
Out from the lost and hopeless race.
Into His Son now I have been transferred,
Born of the Spirit, into His grace.

3
I am God’s child now, free to enjoy Him.
The Spirit of Life is reigning in me.
Christ is my walking, my living, my breathing,
All that I have and ever will be.

4
Chosen and guided into His purpose,
From individual to corporate man.
Now in His Body, we can experience
All the unlimited grace of His plan.

5
This is the mystery hidden from ages.
For this God brought us from sinner to son.
Practical church life, daily transforming
Into the oneness, God’s expression.

God made me to be a man.
I’m so glad I’m in His plan.
He chose me before the world began—
I’m so happy that I’m a man.                     
Look at the many items in the
heaven and earth we see;
Billions of things that He has made;
It’s all for you and me.
I am a vessel made by God,
predestined as His son to be;
He chose me way back
in eternity.                     

2
Satan came to corrupt man,
And spoil God’s wonderful plan.
But our God took on the flesh of man
To die for weak, sinful man.
I never thought the
mighty God became a man like me,
To put on flesh and blood
and lay aside His glory.
He took up all our sins
upon His body to a tree
To redeem us from our sins,
we’re now set free!

3
Christ came in my deepest part—
Into my spirit and heart.
He came in to never leave apart,
Now we have a fresh, new start.
Christ came into my spirit
very, very deep within.
Simply by calling on His name
I have experienced Him.
Christ is my life and person now
in resurrection.
Oh, just call on Him,
He’ll fill you to the brim!

4
Fill, fill, fill! I’m full of Him.
Joy, joy, joy! Overflowing.
Love, love, love! Coming from Him within.
Oh, I have touched the King!


Calgary Songbook :2403


1
Praise the Lord, God sent His Son,
Hallelujah!
And salvation’s work was done,
Glory to God!
God Himself became a man,
So that we might live in Him.
That’s why I call on Him,
I give my all to Him.

2
For us He was crucified,
Hallelujah!
For the many, one Man died,
Glory to God!
One grain fell into the earth,
Many grains to bring to birth.

3
He arose in victory,
Hallelujah!
From the grave, triumphantly,
Glory to God!
Now in resurrection He
As the Spirit lives in me.

4
Call on Him from deep within,
Hallelujah!
Just by calling, He comes in,
Glory to God!
Once you call upon His name,
Nevermore you’ll be the same.
We all must call on Him,
We give our all to Him.

God has called us for His purpose,
His economy so glorious,
For which He was fully pro-cessed;
Consummated now is He.
As the Spirit He indwells us
As our God-allotted portion.
Working out His full salvation,
Making us the same as He is.
Oh, may a clear controlling vision of
The Lord’s economy direct my heart
And burn in me until my spirit’s wholly set afire.                     
With spirit strong and active we’ll press on
To consummate God’s goal—
New Jerusalem!  Hallelujah!

2
Jesus lived the God-man pattern,
Set the way for us to follow.
He denied His natural man and
Was obedient unto death.
Once He was the only God-man;
Now we are His duplication.
As the many grains we’re blended
As His corporate reproduction.

3
Living out His resurrection
Dying to the flesh and soul-life,
Living by the mingled spirit,
Natural man we will deny.
Now we’re living in the Body,
Every day we’re overcoming,
Striving for the peak of Zion,
Watching for our Lord’s appearing.

4
God and men will have one living
Always in the mingled spirit;
We two are incorporated—
One organic entity!
This, the vision of the ages,
Will control our daily living,
That the Lord may have His body,
Shining as the holy city.


Calgary Songbook :2405


1
What miracle! What mystery!
That God and man should blended be!
God became man to make man God,
Untraceable economy!
From His good pleasure, heart’s desire,                     
His highest goal attained will be.
From His good pleasure, heart’s desire,
His highest goal attained will be.                     

2
Flesh He became, the first God-man,
His pleasure that I God may be:
In life and nature I’m God’s kind,
Though Godhead’s His exclusively.
His attributes my virtues are;
His glorious image shines through me.

3
No longer I alone that live,
But God together lives with me.
Built with the saints in the Triune God,
His universal house we’ll be,
And His organic Body we
For His expression corp’rately.

4
Jerusalem, the ultimate,
Of visions the totality;
The Triune God, tripartite man—
A loving pair eternally—
As man yet God they coinhere,
A mutual dwelling place to be;
God’s glory in humanity
Shines forth in splendor radiantly!

The Bible is a romance
In the most holy sense:
God and His chosen people
In love it so presents.
This Universal Couple
Throughout it is displayed;
God in Christ is the Bridegroom,
His saints, the Bride, portrayed.

2
Through shadows, types, and figures,
God’s deepest thought is known;
As typified by Adam,
The Husband, Christ, is shown.
A rib brought forth from Adam
Reveals the source of life
By which God built a woman:
Eve, as the church, His wife.

3
To be His people’s Husband,
To take them as His wife:
This is what God desires
To live in marriage life.
Their sacrifice and worship
Alone could not content;
But with them to be married
Was God’s foremost intent.

4
This romance is the finest
As seen in the Song of Songs;
For her beloved’s kisses
His seeking lover longs.
Love’s work in her produces
No person of her own,
But she becomes the City,
Her Person, Christ alone.

5
Christ is our coming Bridegroom;
We are the Church His Bride,
Redeemed, regenerated,
The issue of His side,
In source, in life, in nature
And person fully one,
His counterpart forever,
The New Jerusalem.

005 Winter Training Banner Song

1
The building of God is the processed
Triune God wrought into us
so that under His continual dispensing we become
His enlargement, expansion and corp’rate expression,
His enlargement, expansion and corp’rate expresion.

2
The three tabernacles – the type of the tabernacle,
the reality of the tabernacle, and
the consummation of the tabernacle—
reveal the goal of God’s economy to have a corp’rate people
to be His dwelling place for His expression and
representation in eternity.

3
The intrinsic element of the work of the divine building
is to minister the building and builded God into others
for the building up of the Body, the Body of Christ

4
The desire of God’s heart is the building of God into man
and the building of man into God for the building of
a great corp’rate God-man, the New Jerusalem,


Calgary Songbook :2408


1
Oh listen to a story of abounding grace
Of how our God came down to earth to join the human race
And through His kind intention, He came up with a plan
That He Himself might be expressed by dispensing into man.
Oh what a kind intention, oh what abounding grace
How our God came down to earth to join the human race
It surely was a mystery so deep we could not trace
That we might be to the praise of the glory of His grace.

2
For God had predetermined, by His counsel and His will
That man might be a vessel, which He Himself would fill
And so for this He chose us, back in eternity
And He predestinated us His very sons to be.

3
His task, it was not easy, it surely took much grace
When on the earth He first appeared, a man in time and space
And then for 33 long years, He lived out God in Man
That He might fully carry out all of the Father’s plan.

4
At the end of His lifetime, He did a wondrous thing
Went to the cross and shed His blood, redemption to win
This brought us into favour, into a blessed place
For God forgave our offenses by the riches of His grace.

5
Now in the application, the Spirit’s moving in
Applying all the Son has done, forgiving all our sin
He’s sealing God into us, full sonship to bring
Oh, this is the mystery of the universe, and this is why we sing.

Timothy 1:1 footnote 1

1
The faith is the economy, the economy of God;
The household administration, the dispensing, of our God.
The truth is the contents, the reality, of the faith
According to God’s economy.                     
Godliness is a living that expresses
The divine reality,
An expression of God in all His riches,
His Body corp’rately.

2
Healthy teaching, words, and speaking
Are the ministry of the truth,
Ministering into people the reality of these truths.
Eternal life is the means and the power to carry out
The divine realities of the faith.

3
Faith is the response to the truth of the faith.
Conscience is a test and a check to preserve us in the faith.
The faith is the economy, the economy of God;
The household administration, the dispensing, of our God.

4
The faith; the truth; expressed in healthy words;
Carried out in power by His life;
Expressed in godly living; responded to by faith;
Kept and held in check by our conscience.

Incarnation
Human living
Crucifixion
Resurrection
Became Spirit
And ascended man!
God became a man
According to God’s plan
To dispense Himself as life to us.
He was processed thus:
Oh, how marvelous!
Then like Him we’re processed through...                     

2
Regeneration
Sanctification
Then renewing
Transformation
Conformation
Glorification—we
Become God in life
And nature, not in Godhead
Through His organic salvation.
We are processed thus:
Oh, how glorious
To express the processed Triune God.

God has a dream,
This is what He’s wanting;
And we are part of it.                     
That we would be one with Him,
God has a dream,
Realized in you and me.
God, You and me,
A dwelling place to be-
God in man,
And man in God,
One entity.                     
Now it’s my dream,
My vision and life to be,
God has a dream,
Realized in you and me.

1
The all inclusive Christ, the centrality and universality of
God’s economy is our life and the
unique constiuent of the new man.

2
We need to walk in Christ as our living land                     
and absorb Christ as our rich soil
so that we may grow with the growth of God.

3
In his economy God gives us one person –
Asus4
the all inclusive, extensive, preminent Christ –                     
and one way – the cross.

4
We need to allow the peace of Christ                     
to arbitrate in our hearts,                     
let the word of Christ dwell in us richly,
and persevere in prayer for the one new man.


Calgary Songbook :2413

God’s eternal economy
Is to make man the same as He is
In life and nature,
But not in the Godhead,
And to make Himself one with man
And man one with Him,
Thus to be enlarged and expanded in His expression,
That all His divine, that all His divine
Attributes may be expressed in human vir-tues.


Calgary Songbook :2414

In this universe there is a God who’s truly wonderful,
And no longer far away from us is He -–
He became a man, lived on the earth
and died for you and me,
Rose the Spirit to complete God’s mystery.                     
What a Person! What a Person!
What a Person is our all-inclusive processed Triune God.
Is our all-inclusive processed Triune God!                     
In nothing be anxious, but in everything, 
by prayer and petition with thanksgiving, 
let your requests be made known to God; 
Philippians 4:6
The Church


Calgary Songbook :2500


1
God the Creator became a God-man,
His death redeemed us for His glorious plan.
Now in resurrection the Spirit’s released
Producing the church.
This is God’s masterpiece.

2
Lord, You are my choice.
I have seen Your beauty.
I belong to You
Now and evermore.
You’re my only choice
Lord, You are so lovely.
Lord, I give all for Your masterpiece.

Lord, I love You.
There is no other.
I’ll love You always.

Your Life would increase.
Thank You, Lord,
I’m part of God’s masterpiece.

We have decided to walk in spirit;
We have decided to walk in spirit;

He lives in us, Hallelujah!

To walk in spirit, call “O Lord Jesus!”
To walk in spirit, call  “O Lord Jesus!”
To walk in spirit, call “O Lord Jesus!”
He’s rich, so call: Hallelujah!

3
To follow Jesus, we need the Body,
To follow Jesus, we need the Body,
We need its life, Hallelujah!

4
It is a joy to be built together,
It is a joy to be built together,
How glorious, the local church!

005 Summer Training-Banner Song (1)


Calgary Songbook :2502


1
We need to see a vision of the church
in God the Father with His life and nature
and in the Lord Jesus Christ
with all He is and has done.

2
Faith as the nature and strength of the work,
love as the motivation
for and characteristic of the labor,                     
and hope as the source of endurance are the structure of a
holy life for the church life.                     

3
To walk in a manner worthy of God,
who calls us into His kingdom and glory,
is to live God and express God in our daily living
by walking according to the mingled spirit.

4
In order to live a holy life for the church life,
we need to co-operate with God’s operation                     
to establish our heart blameless in holiness
and to sanctify us wholly,
with our spirit, soul and body preserved complete.                     


Calgary Songbook :2503

When we believe into the Son,
By His Spirit, we are made one.
Brothers:
We are one.
Sisters:
We are all made one.
Brothers:
We are one.
Sisters:
We are all made one.
Brothers:
We are one.
Sisters:
We are all made one.
Everyone: We are one.

1
The world is longing, seeking for peace,
Yet wars and rumors of wars still increase.
There is no way for men to end all this fear,
All this pain, all this hate, all these tears,                     
Yet Jesus is here!

2
We are dwelling in the love of the Lord,
He our unity has now restored.
Brothers, sisters, in one family,
As the Father and the Son, always one,
So are we!

3
How good and pleasant it can be
When brothers dwell in unity;
Like sweet anointing and the mountain dew,
Life eternal for me and for you—
All things are new!


Calgary Songbook :2504


1
Aren’t you glad, you’re now in the church—
What a joy, you’ve ended your search;
Praise the Lord, it’s so glorious;
Jesus Christ is living in us.

2
We’re no longer free to roam;
Christ has led us to our home.
Brothers and sisters, we’ve come, now we’re one:
Here the real family life has begun.

3
We have come to God’s chosen place;
It is here that we see His face.
This is where He’s put His name;
Once you’re here you’ll not be the same.

4
Hallelujah, we’ve lost our choice;
Since the day that we heard His voice.
Deep within we heard the “Amen”
“This is My choice—you’ll not choose again!”


Calgary Songbook :2505


1
Christ is life—Hallelujah for this!
Wonderful Jesus, He is such a reality!
We can sing and praise His name;
Every day He’s just the same;
Jesus is Lord—this we boldly declare to
the world.                     
For we know that
When we turn to our spirit, we enjoy Him.
We’ve found the way to release life and say,                     
O Lord Jesus!
Now we meet as the church in every city,
Praising our Lord; He is so wonderful!                     

2
Build us, Lord, in each locality;
Christ and the church shall prevail on the
earth to the end.
When we use the blood, we see
Satan and his hosts must flee.
Jesus our Lord has won for us this
great victory.

3
We express His Body on earth,
Meeting as one on the ground of each locality.
We care Lord just for your life,
No religious forms or strife.
We can rejoice in the church of His choice in this way.


Calgary Songbook :2506


1
Dearest Lord, You’ve called us here,
And opened up Your heart.
O the joy to hear Your call
And enter in the Ark.
Saving us from day to day,
O Lord, this is Your way.
In Yourself we stay afloat
Above this wicked age today.                     
Thank You, Lord, in Your eyes we find grace,
And with open hearts we come to You.                     
Regardless what our friends might say to us or do,
O Lord Jesus, we love You.

2
Seeking of this age to taste,
And of it have a part,
If we only knew, dear Lord,
The way we grieve Your heart,
We would come and turn to You
With a repenting heart,
And would give ourselves to be
With You, O Lord, inside the Ark.

3
Praise You, Lord!  We’re safe in You,
Outside death waters pour.
Many things that I once loved
Are on the ocean floor.
Keep us open to You, Lord;
Don’t let us miss the mark.
Hallelujah, praise the Lord!
We’re here within the church, the Ark.

Calgary Songbook :2508


1
In the gatherings of the christians
All can prophesy, we’re told
One by one to share and comfort,
Speaking forth for Christ so bold!
In the church each saint must function;
This is God’s desire today!
From the least one to the greatest,
Christ expressed in every way!

2
Love that’s free from all pretension;
Giving hospitality;
Some so cheerful showing mercy,
All to pray continually.

3
Some to teach, and some exhorting,
Some to minister and serve,
Some with diligence for “leading”;
Each his function must observe.

4
Some with verse or testimony,
Some with song their Christ can share;
Each with strong and ready spirit,
None in bondage to his chair.

5
For the spirits of the prophets
To the prophets subject are;
Each must exercise his spirit,
Everyone a shining star.


Calgary Songbook :2509


1
Some, these days, would tell us that our Jesus is not food,
That we only need to know about Him and do good,
But we’re glad to tell you brothers, it’s just not that way—
Jesus is the bread of life; we eat Him every day.
We love the church life,
eating, drinking, breathing Jesus.
taking in God’s Word.
We love to hear those
“O Lord, Amen, Hallelujahs!”
We love the church life,
feasting with the Lord.

2
When He fills our inward parts, we’re never quite the same,
So much richness we can taste by calling on His name.
“Services” but once a week for us will never do.
Every day we need the fellowship to take us through.

3
If these latter days and situations of the world
Make you feel that round a vicious circle you are swirled,
Then please listen closely to the things we have to say;
It may be that you will find with us a better way.


Calgary Songbook :2510

Manifest, manifest, manifest, manifest—
God is manifest in us,
In the church, in the church,
in the church, in the church—
God’s great myst’ry , the church life glorious!
Vindicated in Spirit, seen by angels and men,
Preached and believed in the nations,
And received up into glory.
Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, 
and I will give you rest.

Calgary Songbook :2602

Lovers of Christ in His ascension
Enjoy the riches of His life;
She becomes His private garden
With it’s fountain, fruit and spice;
Christ is hers, and she is Christ’s dear love.
She is as beautiful as Tirzah,
As lovely as Jerusalem;
Through her living in Christ’s ascension
Her dear heart is now His home;
She’s become the sanctuary of God.
Who is this woman I am seeing,
Shining forth as the moon and sun?
She is absolutely heavn’ly,
From the old creation free;
Overcoming all to live within the veil.
An army terrible with banners
Christ’s lovers overcome to be;
Those attracted by His beauty,
Fully trusting in His power,
Her romance is now the dances of two camps.
The Shulammite, His duplication!
His counterpart has now become;
She’s the same in life and nature,
His expression to the full;
Consummated as the New Jerusalem!


Calgary Songbook :2603


1
To live a life                     
In the Holy of Holies
We must become a captive of Christ.
Many times, reality is that
Christ is captive to us,
This becomes our own fleshly
Victory.

2
Conquer me,
Subdue me,
That I’d no longer be Your enemy.
Defeat me at any cost
That my own will would be lost.
Your desires make my own.
Never let me win.

3
I’m willing,
Defeat me.
Put the world and sins beneath my feet.
Within me is rebellion
Defeat it, conquer and subdue it.
Carry me away as Your
Captive.

4
Today
There’s a need
For us to become captives.
We will see
The effect on those around us.
So become a little captive,
A living sacrifice,
In the triumph of Christ.
But thanks be to God
Who always leads us
In the triumph
In the Christ.


Calgary Songbook :2604

Go on, go on,
Go on in the Lord.
Be strengthened, go on in the Lord.                     
Your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
You must go on, go on in the Lord.

1
Trials may come and discouragement, too.
Yesterday’s gone and His mercies are new.
Press on, press on,
Press on in the Lord.
Be strengthened, press on in the Lord.
Your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
You must press on, press on in the Lord.

2
To worry is vain—He will care for your needs.
Tomorrow’s not here and it never may be.
Sail on, sail on,
Sail on in the Lord.
Be strengthened, sail on in the Lord.
Your labor is not in vain in the Lord.
You must sail on, sail on,
Press on, press on,
You must go on, and on in the Lord.

Victory through Christ’s resurrection
The victory is won!
Praise Him for what He has done

1
The victory over death,
Over Satan and the world
He defeated them triumphantly
For all to see,
Oh, what a victory!

2
Designated as the Son
Bringing man into God
He uplifted humanity
Displayed His glory
Oh, what a victory!

3
He became the Spirit too
So that He could dwell in us
He’s dispensing into you and me
Now He’s life-giving
Oh, what a victory!

4
He regenerated us
Now we’re brothers of the Lord
We’re the members of His family
We’re in the Body
Oh, what a victory!

5
Now we partake of Him
In His victory we share
He’s available to us daily
In God’s economy
We’re enjoying...

What things were gains to me,
These I now count as loss.
Jesus - has set me free
From what I was!
All of the things I had:
Everything, good or bad,
I count as refuse—
That I may gain Christ!
I won’t give up!
I will keep running until
I have attained
The goal of my calling!
I must press on!
I must pursue until I lay hold of Him
Who laid hold of me!

2
Forget the things behind!
Stretch for the things before!
Press onward with this mind:
Always want more!
Seeking in Him to grow,
Increasingly to know
Him that I daily might
Be found in Christ.


Calgary Songbook :2607

Lord, I give myself to You right now.
I want to be occupied with You.                     
I leave all else behind
And concentrate my being on You alone.                     
Lord, You are my focus,
You are my goal.
Lord, I give myself to You right now.

Pursue Him and know Him; be found in Him.
Count all things loss for Him.                     
Just gain Him, obtain Him, lay hold of Him.
It’s Christ the central vision.
Forgetting the things which are behind,
Press on, pursue with this mind.                     
By any means each hour now redeem;
Stretch forth lay hold of Him.

2
Pursue Him and seize Him, Christ the supreme.
Just love this precious Person.
Forgetting and leaving all other things,
Love Him with your whole being.

3
Christ now is my center and reality,
My life for eternity.
All things are just dung compared to Him,
So love and just gain Him!
Therefore we do not lose heart; 
but though our outer man is decaying, 
yet our inner man is being renewed day by day.

1
Where’s the answer?
There must be more for me.
Is this all to life—an empty vanity?                     
Day by day and year by year go by.
Am I just a man, a man just born to die?
Where’s the answer? Oh I’m so empty
And plagued by this vanity.                     
Deep inside me, my conscience tells me:
I need another destiny.                     

2
I convince my friends
that everything’s alright,
That my life and future
and everything’s so bright.
But a sense inside me,
my friends, I can’t deny,
Warning deep inside me
that I was living a lie.

3
The world and its glitter left me anxious,
dark and bitter,
Always yearning, my friends
is there something better?
And religion, my friends,
is just a Sunday game—
Dead teachings and doctrines
will leave you just the same.

4
Oh God, where are You?
I need You desperately!
Oh God, who are You?
Why don’t You answer me?
The heavens declare You and the earth
shows Your beauty.
But I’m a man. Oh God, I’m so empty!
Lord, have mercy! I’m crying for You!
Please hear!  Are You really true?
I’m dark and lonely. You’re far,
far from me.
Oh Lord, I need You desperately!

5
One day a friend told me
that Jesus is the Lord.
To my great surprise,
it’s written in the Word.
They asked me to believe You.
Your name I once blasphemed.
Dear Lord, You saved me
just by calling on Your name.
Oh, Lord Jesus, dear Son, so glorious,
I’m cleansed and You enter into me.
Oh, Lord Jesus, Your name most precious!
Your Person, dear Lord, I now possess.


Calgary Songbook :2701


1
From the time I spoke Your name,
Lord, my life’s not been the same,
Since I called on the only One who’d save me.                     
When forsaken, in despair—
Who’d have thought that You’d be there!
Now I’ve found out, Jesus, You’re alive!                     
Now my eyes begin to see
I’m living as I ought to be,
As this turning, burning God
moves in my heart.
I don’t care now how I feel;
I just know that this is real,
And I know, O Jesus, You’re alive!                     

2
All my friends might think it’s square,
Since I touched You, I don’t care,
For I’ve found You’re the only life worth living.
Though some mock and criticize,
Lord, they just don’t realize
That I’ve found out, Jesus, You’re alive!

3
It’s no statue that I call,
Not a picture on the wall,
But a person who lives His life within me.
Wish they’d told me long before,
All You want’s an open door,
And that really, Jesus, You’re alive!

Do you know what you were made for;
Do you ever wonder why?
What’s the purpose for your being;
What’s the reason you’re alive?
Do you know God wants to be your life?
He wants to be your life,
He wants to be your life
He wants to be your life.
You were made with something deep within,
A vessel to contain just Him.
Intro:Option 2 
I sought for pleasure and gain,
But found life empty and vain.                     
Christ filled up the gap in my life,                     
Flowing His love within my deepest part,
Flooding my heart,
Until I could only say:
Lord, I  can no longer hold back                     
All of this love that I want to return;
My being burns;
My heart now I turn to You.
I cast off all my cares,
All that keeps my heart from loving
and enjoying You.
All I know now is that I’m in love
with You;
And not just for what You do,                     
But I have found my delight In Your eyes,
And my heart cries to be filled with love
for You.
Only You, Beloved One,
Sweet Lord, Beloved One.

1
In man’s labor and his search for meaning
Everything is vanity of Vanities
There is nothing new, there is nothing new,                     
Nothing under the sun, nothing under the sun
Man’s pleasures fail to satisfy                     
Man’s pleasures fail to satisfy.                     

2
God implanted in man’s heart eternity
A divinely implanted sense of a purpose
Working through the ages, working through the ages
Which nothing under the sun, no nothing under the sun
But only God can satisfy
But only God can satisfy.

3
Song of Songs speaks of the King of Majesty
Whose purpose, plan and goal is that He find a bride,
Becoming a country man, pursuing a country girl,
Attracted and charmed by Him, becoming the same as He.
Now she is fully satisfied
And God is fully satisfied.

4
Praise the Triune God who came to be a man,
Constituting man with His divine life,
That we may be made God, in life and in nature
To express Him corp’rately, express Him eternally
Completely satisfying God
Completely satisfying God.

O God of Glory                     
You’ve changed my destiny.
O Lord, Your mercy                     
In love appeared to me.                     
O God of Glory,
You have attracted me!                     
My heart responds to Thee
And turns spontaneously.                     
O God of Glory,                     
You have appeared to me.
Dear Lord, Your beauty,
My God, has captured me!                     

2
In darkness once I groped,
A person with no hope.
But light in darkness shined,
My heart enlightened.
You came to me as Light
And scattered all my night.
Your glory, what a sight!
You made me, Lord, so bright.

3
To You my heart was drawn,
It wasn’t on my own.
Your beauty made me turn
And caused my heart to burn.
You touched my hardened heart
And softened every part.
I saw Your shining face.
Now nothing can erase.

4
I couldn’t, Lord, believe,
But, Lord, You still appeared.
Your life in me conceived,
Dear Lord, I now believe.
You called not being as being
In me conceiving.
Your life transfusing,
I’m now reacting.
O God of Glory,
You’re now my story.
Dear One, I can’t refuse!
By You, I’ve been transfused.


Calgary Songbook :2705

What about my sinful past?
And my conscience has no rest.
Deep within I feel the pain.
I’m condemned from all my guilty stains.
O my life of misery,
In this world of vanity,
As I searched for happiness,
My reward I received just emptiness.
God was far away from me,
Great and highest One is He.
Yet You took on humanity.
You came for me,
Hung on a tree,
Bled there to die for me.
That’s why I love Him.
That’s why I treasure Him.
That’s why I give my life and all to Him.

Lord, You were in the temple, teaching all the people
Of Yourself as the life.                     
Meanwhile I was elsewhere, committing
The biggest sin of my life.                     
The Pharisees they found me, dragged me through the street
There midst the people I sat.                     
Teacher, we found this woman committing adultery
We found her there in the act.
Great I Am, stooping down.
To the ground so low where I was found.
Where are they who say that you must die today?
Woman, go and sin no more.                     

2
Down from the mountain You came;
I approached You in shame.
I’m a leper, You see.
Sin and rebellion’s in me and I long to be free;
If You’re willing, cleanse me.
My destiny is to die; can You help me survive?
Lord, I know that You can.
All others, Lord, run away, when they come see my face,
Helpless hopeless I am.
Stretching out Your hand unto me,
How my heart was warmed when You touched me
With compassion; moved with love I never knew.
By Your touch to me I’m healed.

3
I down to Jericho went,
Met my robbers who stripped me and left me half dead.
The priests and Levites ’cause they also traveled my way,
Couldn’t help me a bit.
But, Lord, You came to the earth, despised and slandered,
A Samaritan low.
With divinity there and humanity’s care,
Tender and merciful.
Bound my wounds and poured in oil and wine.
Gave Your Spirit to me and life divine.
To the church brought me where care I could receive,
Jesus, You’re my Savior true!


Calgary Songbook :2707


1
Once I was an empty man,
My destiny in my own hand,                     
Not knowing what my life was reaping.
Sometimes I smiled but inside weeping.
And this emptiness inside still remained.
No peace I gained.
Just emptiness inside me.

2
Even though I knew no way
To help myself or even pray,
Something deep within was seeking,
To know if life on earth had meaning;
And then I found the answer in a name.
I’m not the same,
Since I have called on Jesus.

3
This Jesus lives inside of me—
My Lord, my life, my all to be.
This life and peace inside increases
By calling on the name of Jesus.
There’s nothing for my soul on earth to seek.
I have no need;
I’m satisfied in Jesus.


Calgary Songbook :2708


1
I always knew deep down in me
There was a longing to be free,
A kind of hunger deep inside—
To fill it up, I tried and tried.
There were a lot of things I had;
Some things were good,
Some things were bad.
But all those things of mine before
Don’t satisfy me anymore.
Now life affords a real reward
Whenever I just call “O Lord!”
The Triune God the Spirit is,
And He can fill mine up with His.

2
Thank You, Lord Jesus, for the wine
That I enjoy as life divine.
I thank You, Lord, for mercy all
That opened me to heed Your call.
O Lord, now make Your home my heart
And fully saturate each part.
O Lord, my words just can’t express
The way You’ve filled my emptiness!
O Lord, I know that You will grow
And from my spirit overflow.
Lord, saturate me through and through—
O Lord Jesus, I love You.

3
I always knew deep down in me
There was a longing to be free.
A kind of hunger deep inside—
But now it can be satisfied...
Christ in my heart—the only way
To spread within me day by day.
Lord Jesus!  Lord, I have to say
You’re home in me and home to stay!
O Lord, I know now You will grow
And from my spirit overflow!
Now saturate me through and through!
O Lord Jesus, I love You!


Calgary Songbook :2709

There are times in my life,
When my heart is embittered;
There are questions unanswered,
Yet you’re drawing me, to enter                     
Into your blessed sanctuary,                     
And turning my eyes heavenward;                     
The questions of constant enquiry,
Are changed to these words:
Whom do I have in heaven but you,
Dear Jehovah,                     
My flesh and my heart constantly fail;                     
But God’s still                     
The strength of my heart and my portion,                     
To Him forever I’ll draw near;                     
I’ve made Jehovah my sweet refuge,
So now throughout the years,
Turn my view to see you,
How I need to see Jesus;
Though I don’t understand the ways that you take;                     
Lord make me                     
A babe and suckling always praising,                     
Enjoying your worth day by day;                     
Let each experience constitute me,
For your life I’ll display,                     
In every way.

First man Adam, then temptation;                     
Lots of trouble there for you and me;                     
Time for praying, trusting Jesus,
Full salvation, just open up your heart.
Lord I call, take me home
To the place where I belong;
Love and oneness in your family,
Take me home, precious Lord.

2
Where’s the answer?  Who can find it?
Must be somewhere, you feel it in your bones.
Where to turn to?  Who will guide you?
Who will love you when you are all alone?

3
Hear the gospel, words of wisdom,
They’re not lying, Jesus died for all;
Heart of granite, empty vessel,
Stop your running, there’s nowhere left to go.
Brothers: There is a place where you are
welcome and invited
Its here on earth and happening
right now in this town.
Sisters:
So come along and sing with us today,
Stop your wandering and come on home,                     
Brothers and Sisters:
Come on home...
(Repeat chorus)

I just existed empty, not knowing
what life was for;
Until one day someone told me that
there was something more;
At first I wouldn’t take it—
it seemed too simple to me!
Calling His name, “O Lord Jesus!”
Saying, “Amen,” when He speaks.
Filling my spirit with His life.
Filling my whole life with His life.
Flooding my living with His life.
Filling my whole life with His life!

2
But then at length I tried it—
first softly, to myself.
As I called I felt like someone sick
brought back to health.
The flow of life within me, I’d never
felt before.

3
Then as I called on Jesus I felt
that I’d been found!
I was so full; I was calling “Jesus!”
right out loud.
I’d never dreamed that I could know
reality by...

4
And now I’m full and happy, so
satisfied with Him,
Because He has come and filled me
clear up past the brim.
His life is now my portion—
I’ll go on all my life, just...


Calgary Songbook :2712


1
There’s a gospel of today
That says believe and you’ll be saved, and then
You can go to heaven and see the pearly gates
And walk the golden streets.
Words like these fail to treat
All the vanity  that is hidden in me.

2
But the gospel is to me
The Triune God within humanity
As the Spirit reaching me to be in me
The one reality.
Love untold—Gospel Thee
Never getting old—story told eternally.

3
Left the ninety-nine behind—
You searched until the lost sheep You did find.
Laid me on Your shoulders there, You bore me in
Your tender loving care.
Rejoicing—You found me,
Though a small lost sheep—You gave all to come find me.

4
Sweeping in my deepest parts,
You lit a lamp and searched my inward heart,
Sanctifying deep within You shined in me,
Exposed me of my sin.
Repenting—now I see
Lord, You’re sprinkling me with the blood You shed for me.

5
Eagerly awaiting me
That I the slightest turn to Thee would make.
Though my life had been a wreck, You ran to me
And fell upon my neck.
Kissing me affectionately,
Killed the calf for me—“Let us eat and be merry.”


Calgary Songbook :2713


1
Do you know what you were made for;
Do you ever wonder why?
What’s the purpose for your being;
What’s the reason you’re alive?
Do you know God wants to your life?
He wants to be your life, He wants to be your life.
You were made with something deep within,
A vessel to contain just Him.                     

2
Deep within you is your spirit,
Even deeper than your “heart”;
Many other things can fill you—
Only Jesus can fill this part.
You have been so empty all these years;
In spite of all you’ve tried, you’re still not satisfied.
Don’t you feel a longing deep within
To open up and take Christ in?

3
Doesn’t matter how you see things,
For in God’s eyes “all have sinned”;
Jesus shed His blood to cleanse you
For the purpose of getting in.
He’s done everything there is to do,
And He’s the Spirit now so He can get in you.
Makes no difference what your past has been;
The living Christ will still come in.

4
Just as you are in your body,
Perfectly contained therein,
God wants you for His container,
All you need to do is let Him in.
Would you open up from deep within
To let the Lord come in and fill you to the brim.
Why not open up from deep within
And call upon the name of Him.


Calgary Songbook :2714


1
The gift of righteousness is measured in abundance,
The depth of His love I’ll never understand.                     
His love reaches me and you;
His mercy goes farther too.
The One on the throne of God is called the Lamb.
So, why not open up and call His name, “Oh Lord!”
Find your spirit
where His grace has been outpoured.                     
Call His name, taste His grace,
exercise before His face;
He’s longing and yearning,
He’s hoping and waiting,
He’s ever desiring for you                     
To turn to Him.

2
He knows your deepest thought, your every situation.
He understands your heart,
He knows your history.
There’s nothing in His way,
He’s just waiting for you to say,
“Lord Jesus, my wandering heart I give to Thee.”


Calgary Songbook :2715


1
If you wish to find the Lord, do not seek Him in the world,
For the world is not the place in which He dwells.
In which He dwells, in which He dwells,

2
If you wish to find the Lord, do not seek Him in the mind,
For the mind can only know, it cannot taste.
It cannot taste, it cannot taste,

3
If you wish to find the Lord, you must open up your heart,
You must open up your heart and let Him in.
Let Him in, let Him in,

4
If you wish to let Him in, you just call upon His name,
You just call upon His name and let Him in.
Call His name, call His name,


Calgary Songbook :2716

Fill my cup Lord;                     
I lift it up Lord;
Come and quench this thirsting of my soul.
Bread of Heaven, feed me till I want no more.
Fill my cup, fill it up and make me whole.

1
Like the woman at the well, I was seeking
For things that could not satisfy.
And then I heard my Savior speaking—
“Draw from My well that never shall run dry.”

2
There are millions in this world who are seeking
For pleasures earthly goods afford.
But none can match the wondrous treasure
That I find in Jesus Christ my Lord.

3
So my brother if the things that this
world gives you
Leave hungers that won’t pass away,
My blessed Lord will come and save you
If you kneel to Him and humbly pray—


Calgary Songbook :2717

Everybody ought to know; (Everybody ought to know)
Everybody ought to know; (Everybody ought to know)
Where Jesus dwells.                     
(Repeat)    
He is dwelling in our spirit;
He is Breath and Life to us;                     
We are one with Him in spirit.
Everybody ought to know;                     

2
Everybody ought to know;
Everybody ought to know;
The living Christ.
(Repeat)    
Christ is the life-giving Spirit;
All God’s fullness He contains;
We partake of all His riches
Just by calling on His Name.

Christ is everything, I need Him.
He is everything you need, believe Him.
Life is a person, receive Him,
Open up your heart and sing                     

1
Open yourself to the new creation.
Open your eyes to the joy of change.
Life is a fruit of God’s creation.
Every new birth is a soul regained.

2
Drinking His life from a silver fountain.
Sweet water running inside of me.
Oh, how I love to live on the mountain,
Ever since Jesus set me free.

3
Follow the Lord like a charging stallion.
Race for the Son with all your might.
Guard your heart like a gold medallion,
Keep the kingdom full in sight.

I’ve found the One who’s all to me;
He’s become reality.
Now He’s in my life to stay;                     
He is the truth, the life, the way.                     
And Jesus is the One who came
Down to earth to bear our shame,
But that’s not all, He lives in me.                     
Once I was blind, but now I see.                     

2
Now through His life we have the flow,
Showing us the way to go;
Keeping us in unity,
And this is His recovery.

3
Now Jesus is the Lord of all;
On His name we all must call.
Then our spirits find release,
And thus our hearts have found real peace.


Calgary Songbook :2720

O victory in Jesus
My Savior, forever
He sought me and bought me
With His redeeming blood.
He loved me ’ere I knew Him
And all my love is due Him.
He plunged me in victory
Beneath the crimson flood.

1
I had a debt I could not pay,
He paid the debt He did not owe,
I needed someone
To wash my sins away.
And now I sing a brand new song,
“Amazing grace,” all day long,
Christ Jesus paid the debt,
That I could never pay.                     

2
He paid a debt at Calvary,
He cleansed my soul and made me free,
I’m glad that Jesus did all my sins erase;
I now can sing a brand new song,
“Amazing Grace”, day by day,
Christ Jesus paid a debt that I could never pay.


Calgary Songbook :2722


1
Call, call, won’t you call Jesus’ name—
He’s everything that’s real, and He’s always the same.
Get out of your mind, get your spirit in gear,
That’s the way to get to Jesus from here.
That’s the way to get to Jesus from here.                     

2
Life, Life, O the issue is Life.
Living isn’t worth it if you haven’t got Life.
So drop all your concepts, they’re killing you dead,
And touch the living Jesus instead.

3
God, God, O You gave us Your Son,
He died for us and rose again; the victory He won!
And now He lives within us, new life has begun.
O we praise You, Lord, it all has been done.

Calgary Songbook :2800

I am crucified with Christ;
And it is no longer I who liveth,
But it is Christ who lives in me;
And the life which I now live
In the flesh I live in faith,
The faith in the Son of God,
Who loved and gave Himself up for me.

1
And now I’m walking by the Spirit
Step by step, day by day.
O Lord, I love You.
You’re the precious One to me.
As I do this and that,
Lord, remind me where You’re at:
You’re in my spirit,
Dispensing grace to me.

2
And now I’m walking by the Spirit,
Marching on toward the goal.
O Lord, Your purpose
Means everything to me.
All self-love I lay aside
For the churches, for Your Bride,
For the fulfillment
Of Your economy.

Psalm 27:1, 5-8, 14

1
The Lord is my light and salvation;
Whom shall I fear?
The Lord is the strength of my life;
Of whom shall I be afraid?                     

2
One thing have I desired of the Lord,
That will I seek;
That I may dwell in the house of the Lord
All the days of my life,
To behold the beauty of the Lord,
And to inquire in His temple.                     

3
Hear, O Lord, when I cry with my voice;
Have mercy also upon me, and answer me.                     
When thou saidst, seek ye my face;
My heart said unto thee,
Thy face, O Lord, will I seek.                     

4
Wait on the Lord;
Be of good courage,
And He shall strengthen thine heart;
Wait, I say on the Lord.

Corinthians 3:18


Calgary Songbook :2802

We all with unveiled face
Beholding and reflecting as a mirror
The glory of the Lord
Are being transformed into the same image
(Sing the following in rounds; brothers start first)    
From glory to glory, from glory to glory
From glory to glory, we are being transformed.
Brothers:

...From glory to glory
Everyone: From glory to glory
Even as from the Lord Spirit

The law of the Lord is perfect,
Converting the soul;
The testimony of the Lord is sure,
Making wise the simple.
More to be desired are they than gold.
Yea, than much fine gold:                     
Sweeter also than honey                     
And the honeycomb

2
The statues of the Lord are right,
Rejoicing the heart:
The commandment of the Lord is pure,
Enlightening the eyes.

3
The fear of the Lord is clean,
Enduring forever;
The judgments of the Lord are true
And righteous altogether.

4
Let the words of my mouth
And the meditation of my heart,
Be acceptable in Thy sight, O Lord,
My strength, and my redeemer.
Moreover by them is Thy servant warned:
Is Thy servant warned:
And in keeping of them there is
Great reward.

Rise up, my love, my beautiful one,
And come away, for behold, the winter is past,
The rain is over and gone.
Flow’rs appear on the earth,
The time of singing has come,
And the voice of the turtle dove
Is heard in our land.
My beloved is mine,
And I am His,
He who feeds His flocks among the lilies.                     
’Til the day breaks,
And the shadows flee away,
Come my beloved,                     
Come my beloved!
Rise up, my love, my beautiful one
And come away, for behold, the winter is past,
The rain is over and gone.

O come let us sing unto the Lord;
Let us make a joyful noise
To the rock of our salvation...
Let us come before His presence
With thanksgiving,
And make a joyful noise unto Him with psalms.                     
For the Lord is a great God,
And a great King above all gods.
In His hands are the deep places of the earth.
The strength of the hills is His also,
The sea is His, and He made it,
And His hands formed the dry land.

2
O come, let us worship and bow down;
Let us kneel before the Lord, our Maker.
For He is our God, and we are
The people of His pasture,
And the sheep of His hand today
If we will hear His voice.

Psalm 50:1-6
The mighty God, even the Lord,
Hath spoken, and called the earth
From the rising of the sun
Unto the going down thereof.

1
Out of Zion,
The perfection of beauty, God hath shined.
Out of Zion,

2
Our God shall come,
He shall come and shall not keep silence;
He shall call
To the heaven above and to the earth.

3
Gather my saints
Gather my saints together unto me.
And the heavens
Shall declare His righteousness. Selah.

We may be built up together
That we may no longer be
Children tossed by waves and winds,
For out from Christ
The Body is knit together
For through Christ’s rich supply
The Body builds itself up in love.
Stand with me;
Our purpose is the same.
Run with me;
Bring others to race.
Grow with me;
In Christ in all things.
Pray with me;
For Christ to gain
(can be sung simultaneously)    
Psalm 84:1-3


Calgary Songbook :2809

How lovely are Thy dwelling places;
My soul longs for the courts of the Lord.
My heart and my flesh
They sing for joy to the living God;
You are my King and my God.

Corinthians 13:4-8a


Calgary Songbook :2810

Love suffers long. Love is kind; it is not jealous.
Love does not brag and is not puffed up.                     
It does not behave unbecomingly;
It does not seek its own things;                     
It is not provoked and does not take account of evil;
It does not rejoice because of unrighteousness,
But rejoices with the truth.                     
It covers all things, believes all things,
Hopes all things, endures all things.
Love never falls away, Love never falls away,
Love never falls away, Love never falls away.


Calgary Songbook :2811

Thou wilt show me the path of life;
Thy presence is fullness of joy.
At Thy right hand there are pleasures
Forevermore.

2
For I have set Jesus forever before me:
He’s at my right hand.

John 15:5, 4
I am the vine,
You are the branches;
He who abides in Me                     
And I in Him,
He bears much fruit,
For apart from Me, apart from Me                     
You can do nothing.
Abide in Me                     
And I in you.                     
For the branch cannot bear fruit of itself                     
Unless it abides                     
In the vine                     
So neither can you unless you abide in Me.

2

Thy word is sweet unto my taste,
Yea, sweeter more than honey.

Whatever you do,
do in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ.
And pursue with those,
Those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
