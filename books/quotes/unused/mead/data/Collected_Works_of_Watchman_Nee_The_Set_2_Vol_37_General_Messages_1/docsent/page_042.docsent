   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO HE HAS FILLED THE HUNGRY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH GOOD THINGS Scripture Reading: Luke 1:53; Matt 5:6; 2 Kings 4:1-6</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christians have two great deficiencies before God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One is the failure to know themselves, and the other is the failure to know the riches of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It would be wonderful if a Christian knew himself and knew the riches of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he does not know himself or the Lord's riches, he is doomed to failure.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All shortcomings, failures, and things that do not glorify God in the Christian life can be traced to one of these two deficiencies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These two matters are the roots of all our failures.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the one hand, the Lord's work on us shows us what we are and, on the other hand, what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we knew ourselves and if we knew Him, all spiritual problems would be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>ONE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>At this point I would like to bring one thing to our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is the necessary condition for experiencing the Lord's riches?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In other words, what is the necessary condition for receiving God's blessing or the working of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is something we must see; it is a condition which we must fulfill.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do not meet this condition, we cannot expect to receive anything from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This necessary condition is being empty before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we want to be filled with the Lord's riches continually, we have to be emptied continually.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The emptying experience is an ever-deepening experience.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we can never say that we are completely empty or that we cannot be emptied any further.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Brothers and sisters, we need to be emptied day after day, month after month, and year after year.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may be empty now, but after some time we will need a further emptying work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not think that once we are emptied, we will be empty forever.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We also should not think that once we are filled, we will be filled forever.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should have an ever-deepening knowledge of ourselves, and we should have an ever-deepening knowledge of the riches of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Luke 1:53 says, "The hungry He has filled with good things, and the rich He has sent away empty."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This verse shows us that God's grace is reserved for one type of person a hungry one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a person comes to the meeting only for the purpose of observing and listening, he will not see anything or hear anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If all that a person wants is some Bible knowledge, his real spiritual problems will not be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only those with a pressing inward need and those who are determined to meet God will receive His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must realize that spiritual progress is based on our hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Matthew 5:6 says, "Blessed are those who hunger and thirst for righteousness, for they shall be satisfied."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who hunger and thirst will be filled; they are the ones who are blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the Word of God and the experience of many saints, the first thing the Holy Spirit does within a person which is the same work He does within everyone is to create a longing heart in him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All spiritual progress begins when God initiates a good work in a person through the Holy Spirit by creating a longing within.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every time there is any spiritual progress, the Holy Spirit has initiated it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Holy Spirit makes us feel dissatisfied with our present condition; the Holy Spirit makes us feel that our present condition is wrong and that our spiritual life is too shallow.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first work of the Holy Spirit is to give us a sense of dissatisfaction and to create in us a desire to be better.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Brothers and sisters, if we want to have any spiritual progress, we must first become dissatisfied with our present spiritual condition, and we must seek for something better.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the beginning of spiritual progress.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Putting it another way, all failure and decadence is the result of self-complacency.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The beginning of failure is self-complacency.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Our feelings of dissatisfaction with ourselves indicates the Holy Spirit has begun His work in us and that is the time for us to go forward.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whenever we are ignorant of our poverty and deficiency, we have come to a standstill.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Decadence comes from self-complacency, whereas progress comes from hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a fact, and it is true throughout our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Invariably the Holy Spirit first creates a desire in us for more, and then God comes in to satisfy us and fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to perform His filling work, He must first carry out His emptying work.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we are empty, God will fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some brothers and sisters have a genuine desire before the Lord and are genuinely conscious of their deficiencies and shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They earnestly hope to live a better and fuller life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, they do not know how they can achieve this, and they do not know how they can have an abundant life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Brothers and sisters, if we have such a feeling, we can rest assured that this life will be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is because the desire does not originate from ourselves but from the work of the Holy Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We should realize that God Himself fills up whatever He has emptied.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God will not leave us empty forever; His purpose is to fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since God has emptied us, He will surely fill us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If He did not want to fill us, He would not have emptied us in the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Emptying is merely the means; filling is the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, God never empties anyone without filling him again.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If there is a longing heart in us, it proves that we are already under the operating power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Holy Spirit never engages Himself in a fruitless work.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The only question is whether or not there is some hindrance within us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If there is a genuine desire within us, we will certainly receive what we desire.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Please bear in mind and be deeply impressed that once the Holy Spirit begins His work, He always finishes it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He will never stop until the job is done.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, we may rest assured that when we are empty, He will fill us.</S>
