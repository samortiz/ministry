   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE TWENTY PHARAOH S SUBTLE BARGAINING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we go on to consider the final conflict between God and Pharaoh, we need to consider Pharaoh s subtle bargaining.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Pharaoh signifies not only Satan, but also the self and the natural man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In addition, our relatives or friends can also be a Pharaoh to us today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Furthermore, our natural mind, will, or emotion may be a Pharaoh who rebels against God or who bargains subtly with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I. GOD S DEMAND A. To Let His People Go</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>a Three Days Journey into the Wilderness</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s demand of Pharaoh is stated in 5:1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to this verse, the Lord spoke to Pharaoh through Moses and Aaron, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, the Lord required His people to take a three days journey into the wilderness and to sacrifice unto Him 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Not only does this journey of three days signify a long distance; it also signifies burial and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the Bible the third day signifies resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus was resurrected on the third day, and, according to Genesis 1, the dry land, a type of Christ in resurrection, appeared on the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, the three days journey here signifies burial and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The natural man had to be buried so that God s people could be raised up from death into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The crossing of the Red Sea signified the process of burial and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the eyes of both God and Satan, the children of Israel passed through the burial of the Red Sea and entered into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As God s called and chosen people, we also must pass through such a process of burial and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This means that we must travel a three days journey in order to be buried and resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By means of such a journey, God s people not only come out of Egypt, but they also enter, in resurrection, into a new environment.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Negatively the wilderness signifies a place of wandering, but positively it signifies a realm of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the children of Israel entered into the wilderness, they were separated from everything Egyptian, from everything worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This separation is related to burial and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once we were in Egypt, that is, in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But through burial and resurrection we have passed out of the world into the wilderness, where we are separated to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In His dealing with Pharaoh, God demanded such a separation for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>B. That His People May Hold a Feast to Him</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>and Sacrifice to Him</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Separation, however, is not the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God s goal was that the children of Israel would hold a feast to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He wanted them to be happy with Him in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To hold a feast unto God is to enjoy God with God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Everyone who has truly been saved has experienced times of overflowing with joy in the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such times are real holidays.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If you have not enjoyed such a feast with the Lord but have only been happy when participating in worldly amusements, then perhaps you have not yet been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Being saved does not depend upon having such an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nevertheless, everyone who is saved will have the experience, at least once in his Christian life, of holding a feast to the Lord, of enjoying the Lord in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Sometimes I have been so beside myself with joy in the Lord that it seemed as if I were dancing before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not doctrine or theory, but a marvelous enjoyment of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Furthermore, the children of Israel were to sacrifice unto the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>According to our experience, when we hold a feast unto the Lord, enjoying Him in His presence, our heart is deeply touched by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He becomes so dear and precious to us, and we have a fresh love for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We simply have no words to utter how sweet He is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He touches the depths of our being, and we respond by thanking the Father for His dear Son.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is to offer sacrifice unto God, to present the precious Christ to God as a sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As we offer Christ to the Father, the Father is pleased, happy, and satisfied by us through our sacrifice of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, God s demand of Pharaoh was to let His people go a three days journey into the wilderness so that they could hold a feast to Him and sacrifice unto Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the enjoyment of God s salvation.</S>
