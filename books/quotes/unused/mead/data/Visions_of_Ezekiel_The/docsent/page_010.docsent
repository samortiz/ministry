   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Corporate Expression</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These living creatures are not reckoned as individuals; they are counted as a group.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>All of them are counted as one entity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Later we will see that these living creatures are the expression of the one man on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They do not express this man in one direction only, but in every direction.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We know that on this earth there are only four directions north, east, west, and south.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that we as the four living creatures are not only the unique expression of Christ, but also the complete expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We express Christ in every direction, toward every side.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are the four living creatures expressing Christ in an adequate and complete way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>BEARING THE APPEARANCE OF A MAN</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The main point of Ezekiel 1:5 is that each of the four living creatures bears the appearance of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This word may not be pleasing to many religious friends because they would like to be angels.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps we all think that it is better to be an angel than to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Which would you rather be, a man or an angel?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am afraid that many of us would prefer to be an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God, however, has enough angels.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But God is short of men.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God does not appreciate the angels so much.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The angels are His servants.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When He tells them to go, they go.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When He tells them to come, they come.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do you know that we also have our own angels?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When Peter was released from prison and went to Mary's house, some said that it was his angel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peter had an angel and we also have angels.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Angels are not that precious; they are our servants.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must drop our concept that it would be good to be an angel.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Rather we need to see how glorious, how marvelous it is that we are men.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We should tell the whole universe, "I am a man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am a VIP.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am the meaning of the universe."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not a small matter to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we would not desire to be like angels, at least we would desire to be like God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many Christians practice day and night to be like God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But God wants to be like us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He even became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today in the heavens, the Lord Jesus who is God is still a man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>A man is upon the throne Acts 7:56 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is the Creator of the universe, but He needs an expression.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without man, God has no expression.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The millions of angels could never be the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God needs a corporate man to express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Never despise the fact that you are a man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are four men in the Bible: the first man, the second man, the new man, and the manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We were the first man by birth; we became the new man by regeneration; and now there is the prospect that we may become the manchild.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This ministry is not only for the new man, but for the manchild as well.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Though some today may talk about the expression of Christ, few realize what the real expression of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Christ whom the church must express is the man upon the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are going to express Christ, we must realize that Christ today is a man.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We do not express merely God; we express God in a man.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church is the expression of Christ, not merely the expression of God.</S>

   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He became a man, and today He is still a man.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The religious teachings in Christianity encourage you either to be like an angel or to be like God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But the revelation of God unveils to us that God's desire is to have a man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Remember that the subtle one tempted the first man by telling him that if he would take of the tree of knowledge, he would be like God Gen 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>From that day, the concept of being like God has been in our blood.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All of fallen mankind has the concept of wanting to be like God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Devilish teachings such as Buddhism and Taoism always encourage people to be something other than man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God in His redemption and salvation has no intention of making us anything other than man.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God's redemption and salvation are to bring us back to the beginning and to recover us to being a proper man.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are the living creatures, yet we bear the appearance of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Never behave as an angel.</S>

   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We, the living creatures, also bear the appearance of a man.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Each of these four living creatures has four faces.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we saw someone with four such faces, we all would be frightened.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Suppose he had the face of a man in the front, the face of a lion on the right side, the face of an ox on the left, and the face of an eagle at the back.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Would you not be frightened?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Yet this is exactly what we must be.</S>
