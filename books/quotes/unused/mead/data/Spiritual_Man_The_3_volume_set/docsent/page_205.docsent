   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONDITION OF THE MIND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because the mind can assist the spirit, even though its position is much lower than the spirit, a believer must keep his mind in a normal condition to enable it to search the interpretation of the spirit and assist in any weakness of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The activities of the spirit are governed by their laws.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Likewise, the activities of the mind are governed by their particular laws.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the mind is free to work, the burden is light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Should it become stretched like one stretches a sling , it cannot work freely.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The enemy knows that we need the mind to assist the spirit in order to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, he always presses us, keeping our mind excessively stretched and unable to function normally in order that it will not be able to assist the spirit when it is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, our mind is not simply an organ to assist the spirit; we also obtain light through it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Holy Spirit of God gives light to the mind through our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the mind is exercised excessively, there is no possibility for it to receive light from the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The evil spirit knows that if our mind is in darkness, our whole being will also be in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, it endeavors to cause us to think excessively so that we cannot be quieted to work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a believer walks according to the spirit, he must prohibit his mind from continually turning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Concentrating on one theme, anxiety, sorrow, or overly considering what the will of God is, makes the mind unable to bear the burden and work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only by maintaining a quiet and peaceful mind can one walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since the mind occupies such an important position, when working with others, a believer must be cautious not to interrupt the thoughts of his brother.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Breaking a train of thought can cause the mind to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Holy Spirit leads a believer to consider a matter through the spirit, an interruption by others is a very fearful thing.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a thought is interrupted, the mind will be stretched, and consequently, it is harder to work with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, not only should we keep our mind free, we should also take care of the mind of our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before speaking to a brother, we should first check the trend of his thought and then speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Otherwise, we will cause him to suffer.</S>
