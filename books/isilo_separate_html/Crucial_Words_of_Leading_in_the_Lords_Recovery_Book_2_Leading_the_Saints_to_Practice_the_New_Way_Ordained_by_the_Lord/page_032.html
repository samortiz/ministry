AND GROUP MEETINGS HAVING THE FUNCTION<br />
OF JOINING PEOPLE TO ONE ANOTHER</h2>
<p>Although it is very effective to bring people to salvation by visiting them in their homes, it is not that easy to bring them into the church life. After we have set up a home meeting, we may find out that it is not easy. Actually, it is rather difficult to take the next step forward. The Bible shows that when the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He fed five thousand at one time and at another time four thousand (Matt. 14:21; 15:38). These two numbers come to a total of nine thousand, not including women and children. In addition, the Lord also contacted quite a number of other people. Within three and a half years the Lord Jesus must have contacted at least one hundred thousand people. We need to reread the four Gospels and study every gospel incident thoroughly; then we will be able to see how many people the Lord Jesus contacted while He was on the earth. We believe that He must have contacted a minimum of one hundred thousand people.</p>
<p>After His resurrection the Lord Jesus appeared to over five hundred brothers at one time (1 Cor. 15:6). However, it is not clear how many He fully gained. It is difficult to tell how many were gained through the miracles and wonders He performed during the three and a half years of His ministry on the earth; moreover, it is even more difficult to know how many were gained through His vivid appearance to the more than five hundred brothers after His resurrection.</p>
<p>Recently I have been repeatedly considering our experience of going out to visit and baptize people. When we preach based on <em>The Mystery of Human Life,</em> what we speak is truthful, not false. Thus, we are able to quickly open people&rsquo;s understanding and help them to be baptized into the Lord. In the past, many had the concept that preaching the gospel should be done slowly. According to their way, if we preach the gospel to a person, and he is not enlightened, we should simply wait and preach to him again the next week. If he still has not been enlightened, we should wait until the third week. Then we should go to him and lead him to pray. This is man&rsquo;s way of salvation, not the biblical way. The record in the Bible shows that both through the Lord Jesus directly and in Acts people were saved in a quick way. In Acts 16:22-34 there was a jailer in Philippi who was guarding Paul and Silas. One night at about midnight, all the doors of the prison were opened. The jailer, supposing that the prisoners had escaped, was about to do away with himself. At that moment Paul called out with a loud voice and told the jailer not to harm himself because the prisoners had not escaped. The jailer then asked Paul and Silas what he must do to be saved, and they exhorted him to believe on the Lord Jesus so that he and his household would be saved. The jailer was baptized immediately that night, and not by himself but with his entire household. This shows that salvation and baptism as revealed in the Bible differ from our concept.</p>
<p>We do not have the assurance that every one of the thirty thousand newly baptized ones among us are truly saved, but we believe that at least two-thirds are saved. While studying how to bring them into the church life, we have received light from the Bible and have begun to consider how many people the Lord Jesus gained through His earthly ministry. We know that after resurrection, the Lord appeared to over five hundred brothers. I do not believe that the Lord Jesus appeared for only a brief moment and then quickly disappeared. He must have let them look at Him thoroughly and sufficiently. Nevertheless, it seems incredible that some may have seen the bodily-resurrected Lord Jesus, yet they were not completely gained by the Lord. In any case, I believe that of the five hundred brothers, at least one hundred must have been completely gained by the Lord.</p>
<p>The account at the beginning of Acts speaks of a gathering of one hundred twenty saints, including some women. All of the one hundred twenty were Galileans. Perhaps some may ask whether the Lord Jesus gained other people in Jerusalem and the land of Judea. I believe that He must have gained some; however, the strange thing is that the one hundred twenty were all Galileans; no one was from another province. In the Gospels the Lord Jesus frequently traveled in Galilee, and He gained a group of people including Peter, James, and John. Out of the twelve disciples, only Judas was from the land of Judea, and he was false. The rest were genuine disciples and Galileans; they were the Lord Jesus&rsquo; true helpers. Because they were gained directly by the Lord Jesus, they were used by Him to bring the one hundred twenty saints together. This is the function of home meetings and group meetings.</p>
<p>I believe that people like Peter, James, and John must have had home meetings and group meetings together. Through this, the brothers and sisters in the land of Galilee were joined to one another. In the land of Judea, however, due to the lack of such a group of people who were joined and built together, not many were brought in. From this we should see that once we gain some new ones, it is not adequate to merely baptize them or even to show them the Lord Jesus&rsquo; resurrection. Rather, there must be some who join them together continually and unceasingly. Peter, James, and John were such ones. They were continually joining people, and thus the one hundred twenty were gathered together.</p>
<p>The light in the Bible is clear. After we have baptized some, we need to be joined to them. We should have home meetings with a believer during his first week of being saved. Then we should bring him to a group meeting. The home is a foundation to keep him; once this foundation is laid, it is difficult for him to leave. If there is a meeting in his home every week, he will spontaneously be stabilized. This is the light we have received from the Bible. Peter, James, and John were the most useful helpers of the Lord Jesus, but even they did not bring in someone from Judea or Jerusalem. All whom they gained were Galileans because they were close to the Galileans. The principle is that we bring in those whom we are close to and that we lose those whom we are not close to. While the home meetings keep people, the group meetings join people together. If we want to join people together, we need the group meetings.</p>
<p>After a person is saved, we not only need to have meetings with him in his home, but we should also bring him to a group meeting. Homes stabilize people, whereas group meetings join people. The Lord Jesus Himself carried out such a work. By His resurrection He strengthened those who were under His leading; however, only those who were joined together through homes and groups remained. Even though none were brought in from Judea and Jerusalem, one hundred twenty were brought in from Galilee.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> </body></html>
