   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>and the Aaronic Priesthood</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Numbers 18 unveils to us the charge or the duties of the Levitical service and the Aaronic priesthood, with their reward.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reward was the compensation the Levites and priests received for their service.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After the rebellion in chapter sixteen, which was an attack on the priesthood of Aaron and his household, a definite word was given regarding the service of the Levites and the priesthood of Aaron and his sons and also regarding their reward.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I believe that the word here became a statute or an ordinance that was kept by the children of Israel throughout the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Service of the Levites</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The service of the Levites was to take care of the tent of meeting, the tabernacle of the testimony, which is a type of Christ and the church vv.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>1a, 2a, 3-4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In taking care of the tabernacle and its contents, the Levites did not serve God directly; rather, they served the priesthood and the priests, who served God directly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>a. The Levites Being a Gift to Aaron and His Sons</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Levites were a gift to Aaron and his sons, a gift that had been given to God v. 6b . God wanted all the firstborn of the children of Israel to do the service.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Eventually, God used the Levites to replace them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The children of Israel gave their firstborn to God as a gift, and these were replaced by the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God then gave the Levites, who had been given to Him, as a gift to the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To Join Aaron and His Sons and Minister to Them</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Levites were to join Aaron and his sons and minister to them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For the Levites to minister to the priests meant that they served the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Priesthood of Aaron and His Sons</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In English the word priesthood is sometimes used to denote a body of priests, that is, a number of priests who have been grouped together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This word is also used to denote the service of the priests, and this is mainly the meaning here in Numbers 18.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Aaron and his sons were to bear the iniquity of their priesthood v. 1b . The word iniquity is used here to charge the priests not to make mistakes while carrying out their priestly service.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The priesthood was a service to offer all kinds of offerings and sacrifices to God, all of which were types of different aspects of the rich Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, it was a very important and serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Any mistake, neglect, or shortage would have been a kind of iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The priests were required to fulfill their charge without making mistakes so that their priestly service would not have any iniquity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The priests were to keep the charge of the sanctuary, the tabernacle, and of the altar v. 5 . The whole tabernacle was the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Bible the word sanctuary is used in a very ambiguous way; it may refer to the Holy Place, to the Holy of Holies, or to both.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The sanctuary typifies Christ and also the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The altar, which was outside the sanctuary, signifies the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Therefore, the sanctuary and the altar typify Christ with the church and His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Levites served under the priests in caring for the sanctuary and the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For instance, when the children of Israel were commanded to move, the Levites packed and carried the tabernacle and all its furnishings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the people arrived at a particular place, the Levites set up the tabernacle and everything related to it.</S>
