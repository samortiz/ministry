   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXAMPLES OF THE APOSTLES CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Apostle Paul s writings in his Epistles concerning the Lord Jesus, we can actually see the writer himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Though all of Paul s Epistles concern Christ, they allow us to see Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I do not think that the Epistles of Peter need to be designated as such.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>By reading them one can immediately recognize their writer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The same is true of Paul s writings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can see the apostles from the epistles they wrote, because it was Christ whom they bore, and it was Christ who lived through them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Moses saw the vision of fire burning on the thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the Epistles by the apostles were written according to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>On the one hand, Christ used Paul as His upholder, putting Himself on Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>On the other hand, Paul lived out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because of these two points, each time they spoke concerning Christ, the apostles could not avoid being seen.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are two lines in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>One line concerns the upholding of Christ, and the other, the living out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To live out Christ is a matter of life, whereas to uphold Christ is a matter of character.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>With every apostle there are the matters of character and life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With regard to Paul s character, he was used by Christ; he bore Christ, and Christ was upheld by him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As to life, Paul took Christ as his life; he lived in Christ, and Christ lived in him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, when we read the Epistles of Paul, it is not difficult to see that some matters in them are related to character and some to life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>For example, Paul said, What do you want?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Shall I come to you with a rod, or in love and a spirit of meekness?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>1 Cor 4:21 ; he also said, Who is weak, and I am not weak?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Who is stumbled, and I do not burn?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2 Cor 11:29 , and, But when Cephas came to Antioch I opposed him to his face, because he was to be condemned Gal 2:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>These words reflect a certain character.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>On the other hand, Paul said, Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body 2 Cor 4:10 , and also, And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These words refer to life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In certain parts of the Epistles of Paul we find his character as a servant of God: strong, responsible, serious, intolerant of errors, honest, willing to rebuke others to their face.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In other places we see the very life which he lived.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not have only life without a proper character; neither can we have only a good character without life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day in Manila, during a car ride with some brothers to the countryside, we saw an elegant Catholic cathedral situated on a small hill.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The brothers brought me into the place for a visit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I entered, I saw several nuns dressed in white, kneeling.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They were motionless and appeared unreal until I looked carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They were so adept in the practice that they did not move even a little.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We watched them for a long time before one stood up.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We were transfixed as we observed the way she walked.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Such serenity and composure would be impossible to imitate.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As she went forward to get a Bible, her stride, posture, and movements commanded our utmost respect and admiration.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What marvelous conduct!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If I had not known the Lord, I would have resolved that day to join Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I believe that if some unbelievers were to see those nuns and us, they would surely conclude that we Christians are not as respectable as the Catholics.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>However, those who know Christ would realize that such conduct was not life; it was a developed character at best.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A good character devoid of life is of no value.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But life without a proper character is equally useless.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Regardless of how much we know about Christ, we cannot minister Christ without a proper character.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>THE NECESSITY OF CHARACTER</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>BUILDING FOR THE LORD S SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What kind of work are we planning to do?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do we expect to do a work that is valuable and weighty or a work that is shallow?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the Lord s service there is the need not only of the knowledge of the Lord but also of a character that upholds the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Bible requires that the elders be grave.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Is this a matter of character or of life?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is too clear that this is a matter of character and not of life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>One person may be clearly saved but still frivolous.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Another may oppose the Lord Jesus yet be serious in his character.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If these two people were to stand up and speak to a crowd, which one would gain the confidence of the people?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It would be the opposer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Because he is sober.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We can immediately realize from this illustration that our usefulness in the Lord s hand is based on our character and that it takes our character to minister life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Obviously, without life nothing is ministered, but without a proper character, life still cannot be dispensed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Admittedly, we are short in life, but I feel strongly that there is a severe, even desperate, lack in our character.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For example, according to my observation, some young brothers are totally unlearned in manners.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In their contact with people they seem to have no sense of who is older and who is younger.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They consider showing respect as shameful and politeness as undemocratic.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They care little whether the person in their presence is a school principal or a dean.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Be assured that such people are finished; they cannot serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Young brothers, in the dormitory where you live, are you polite toward your schoolmates?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Although I did not visit you every day, based on my limited observations, I know how you live.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Please forgive me for saying that you do not have the proper character at all.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I admit that you may not fight or quarrel; I also dare say that your character has not been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To build up your character, you must keep the rules governing which bed you should sleep in, where you should hang your clothes, and where you should store your suitcase.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You must abide by the rules of the school.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>You may think that these are small matters, but if you are not exercised in these things in your daily life, you will be absolutely useless to God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You will lack the character of rule-keeping.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You may freely throw your shoes under another s bed and hang your shirt on his bedpost, and his vest may somehow turn up in your area.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Believe me, this kind of person can never do a work.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Rule-keeping is on the passive side.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Positively, we need to be polite.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We should rush to do the unpleasant jobs and let others do the easy ones.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This is not life; it is merely the sign of a good character.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But if such a character is not built up in us, we cannot hope to serve the Lord properly.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>If you are not a regulated person, your preaching will likewise be undisciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If you are disorderly, what you preach will also be disorganized.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Brothers, in serving the Lord character is no less important than life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Without a proper character, you have no way to do a work.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Life is your material and character is your technique.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>A carpenter cannot make anything without wood; but this does not mean that he can make something as long as there is wood.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The saw may be useful in the hand of another but not in yours.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The ax is useful to others, but in your hand it only ruins the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You do not have a particular character simply because you have never practiced.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>As a rule, if you are about to go through a door and a younger brother wants to do the same, you should let him go first.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If you are carrying a basin and some water happens to spill on your roommate s bed, you must wipe the waterdrops quickly and look for an opportunity to apologize to him.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I do not recognize this as life, yet if you desire to serve the Lord, you must be particular about your character.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The character within you enables you to be disciplined in your service to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>THE DIFFERENCE AND RELATIONSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>BETWEEN CHARACTER AND LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Let me further illustrate the difference between character and life.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Consider a sister who loves to gossip, talks a great deal, and is always unhappy with others.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Such a condition indicates a shortage in life, not in character.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Another sister rarely speaks or becomes angry, because both her tongue and her flesh have received the dealing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>However, she is sloppy in her living and inconveniences those around her.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When others murmur, she is not angry and does not blame them.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This sister may be excellent in life, but she lacks one thing a proper character.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>This example shows the difference between the aspect of life and the aspect of character.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Nevertheless, we must realize that life and character are not independent of each other.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Life can influence our character, and on many occasions it can even replace our character.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>But character cannot affect life or substitute for life.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Often the spirituality of a spiritual person becomes his character and replaces his character.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>This was the case with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The character of the Lord Jesus was almost an expression of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>We may say that the aspects of the Lord s character, as recorded in Mark, were the expression of His life.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>In other words, much of His life was also His character.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>However, we cannot say that character is life, for even an unbeliever has his character.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>For example, the sobriety of a certain person is part of his character, not his life.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The spirituality of a spiritual person, which issues from his abiding in the Lord, can make him sober.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>The character of a Christian should not merely be character.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We should not only display outward sobriety, thoroughness, and consideration for others, with no life inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We must have both life and character.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>In fact, we should go one step further: our life and our character should be blended as one.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Although character does not equal life, life can become a great part of our character.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>I am polite because I live in Christ; I am also sober because I live in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>I can be careful because Christ is my carefulness, and I can be regulated because Christ is my regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Life and character have become one in me.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>In the beginning the person who loves the Lord often seeks after life.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Gradually he realizes that it is his character which limits his dispensing of the Lord to others.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Then he changes the way he conducts himself; that is, he begins to develop his character.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>At first this kind of character building is mostly man-made.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>As he grows in the Lord and the life in him becomes strengthened, his character is slowly brought into life.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Eventually, the life within him is mingled with his outward character.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>At this point his outward sobriety comes from his inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>His outward politeness and orderliness are also issues of the life within him.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>His character is constituted predominantly with the inward element of life.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>This was true of our Lord when He was on the earth, and it must have been true of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Today, our need before the Lord is to pay attention to the fact that in serving the Lord, without life we have nothing to minister to others.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>Likewise, if we only have life but lack the proper character, we have no way to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>In the Lord s service there is the need for life as well as the proper character.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Therefore, we must thoroughly build up our character and our human conduct.</S>
