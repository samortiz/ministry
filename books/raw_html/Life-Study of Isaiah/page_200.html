<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE STEWARD IN GOD'S HOUSE INTO WHOSE HAND<br>THE ADMINISTRATIVE AUTHORITY IS PUT</H2><P>Eliakim typifies Christ as the Steward in God's house (Isa. 22:15, 21a). Christ is the real steward of God's house, the divine household. God's household is the greatest house in the universe, including all the believers throughout the ages. In this vast divine household, Christ is the unique Steward. He takes care of God's household in every way to serve us.</P><P>His service is a kind of governing, or ruling. In His service there is the dominion, the administrative authority. When we are served by Christ, we are under His government. He governs us and rules over us, taking care of us. The more He takes care of us, the more we are under His authority, His administration. When I was initially saved, I did not consider Christ's ruling over me in His divine government. But the more I went on with the Lord and enjoyed Him, the more I was caught by Him. The more I enjoyed Him, the more I became governed by Him.</P><P>In the late 1960s and early 1970s in Elden Hall in Los Angeles, a number of hippies were saved and came into the church life. As they went on with the Lord and enjoyed the Lord, they were brought under the Lord's government. Gradually, as these young brothers were brought under the divine authority, they stopped wearing their headbands, they shaved their beards, and they put shoes and socks on their feet. Most young people want freedom. I was the same way as a young person, but I was saved by the Lord. The more I prayed to Him, the more I enjoyed Him, and the more I enjoyed Him, the more He restricted me. I was and still am experiencing His inward governing. While a steward serves the children of a certain family, he or she also governs them. Similarly, while Christ as the Steward serves us in God's house, He governs us. Christ is God's Steward taking care of God's children.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE FATHER AS THE SOURCE AND SUPPLIER<br>TO THE PEOPLE OF GOD</H2><P>Isaiah 22:21b says that Eliakim, typifying Christ, will become a father to the inhabitants of Jerusalem and to the house of Judah. Christ is a Father to us. As the Father, He is our Source and Supplier. The more we go on as children of God, the more we realize that our Savior, Christ, is our Source and our Supplier. Everything comes from Him. He supplies us and supports us physically, psychologically, and spiritually in every way. If we are short of understanding and wisdom, we should call on Him, look to Him, and wait on Him. Then He will be our understanding and wisdom. We should not be confident in our own understanding and wisdom concerning certain situations or people. We should look to Christ in everything so that He can be our understanding and wisdom. Today Christ is a Father as the Source and Supplier to support us in everything and in every way.</P>
