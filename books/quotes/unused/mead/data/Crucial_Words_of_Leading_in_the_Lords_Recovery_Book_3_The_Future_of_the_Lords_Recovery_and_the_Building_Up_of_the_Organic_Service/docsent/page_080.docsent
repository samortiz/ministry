   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICING DIVIDING INTO GROUPS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In relation to our practice, we will fellowship concerning dividing into groups.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the past we formed groups, but we gradually stopped practicing the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After observing our situation and studying the practice of other Christian groups, we are clear that a local church must stress meeting in groups.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The group is a basic unit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A church must have groups as its foundation so that the church can take root downward.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Likewise, whether or not a church stands firm also depends on the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Above the ground we need to raise our standard high, and we need to be rooted with a firm foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This foundation is the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The church in Taipei has a total of eleven thousand saints, but only five thousand meet regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to divide these saints into four hundred groups according to where they reside.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eight or ten saints in a neighborhood should gather as a group.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The groups should not be formed according to the spiritual level of the saints nor according to their age.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The groups are formed solely according to the geographical location of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Furthermore, once a few saints form a group, there should be no group leader or assistant group leader, nor is there a need for a responsible one or a coordinator.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone is equal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This practice is based on our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the past when we assigned group leaders, responsible ones, and coordinators, those who were not assigned felt that they did not have any responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As a result, there were distinctions when the saints functioned in the group.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to get rid of such concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to give the saints the impression that, in the Lord s eyes, everyone in the group is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Everyone is precious and useful, and everyone should serve.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to advance the groups, we must use the serving ones in the homes, including the full-time and part-time serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to have the manpower to advance four hundred groups.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the initial stage we do not have to spend much effort on the gospel in the community.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can wait until we have laid a good and strong foundation in the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we can preach the gospel in the communities through the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The manpower for the community gospel work must first be used to advance the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to geography, the four hundred groups can be divided into eight districts.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, every district would have fifty groups, with a total of nearly six hundred saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the beginning we need to spend more time and invest more manpower into the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our situation can be compared to an old car that has not been in operation for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are all in the car, but we have to get out and push it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This principle should be adopted in the localities, but we should not be strict in the way that we push.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At present fifty full-timers are assigned to five categories of the work: advancing the group meetings, preaching the gospel in the homes, preaching the gospel in the community, the campus work, and the children s work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we are strict and assign ten full-timers to each category of the work, not many will be assigned to advance the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we need less serving ones in the other categories.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If there are fifty groups in a district, there will be a total of five to six hundred saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need at least fifty serving ones to advance the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In other words, one serving one will work with one group.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every serving one has to be in a group.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Before joining the groups, the serving ones must have thorough fellowship and study how to advance the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They should study the situation of the meetings, the living situation of the brothers and sisters, and the spiritual level of the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then they should pray together and seek the Lord s leading to know how to enter into the groups and lead them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Knowing the Condition of the Groups</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should first know the condition of the groups and then pray to seek a way to lead them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every group may have a different condition, but in principle it is possible to find the direction to lead the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I can give only principles.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We should seek the Lord s leading to fan into flame the gift that is in every member of a group.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not expect a quick work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The first time we meet with a group, we should give the saints the opportunity to speak freely with one another in a relaxed manner.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is not the need for much prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we try to bring our old way of meeting into the group, we will bring in regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For example, although soymilk is delicious, the more we drink it the less we enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, it is better to let the members of a group feel relaxed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Please do not misunderstand me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Sometimes our piousness in the meeting is a pretense, because we are not necessarily like that in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is better to be spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the group meeting we do not have to pretend, but neither should we be wild.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We can even drink tea in the group meeting so that everyone will relax.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Without singing or praying, the serving one can say, Brothers and sisters, I thank the Lord that we can sit together.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The Lord has given the church a new leading, and we have been formed into a group so that we can know one another better, have more fellowship, and can supply and support one another.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When I am sick, you will know that I am sick.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When you have a problem, I will know that you have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We will be able to sympathize with one another and help one another.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Such a word will help the saints not to pretend.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should keep in mind that having the group meeting is not for us to hold a large worship service in a small meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The group meeting is for the saints to enjoy a fresh taste.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This taste will help the members of the group to relax.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This can be likened to rekindling an old fire with a new flame.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In such a meeting it will be easy to fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Focusing on Reality, Working Aggressively,</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>and Not Being Anxious</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>At the beginning of the meeting it is best not to speak too much concerning spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have released many messages.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The saints are well fed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>They are stout and strong, and there are many things stored within them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Instead of giving them more doctrine or spiritual material, we should give them more reality and an opportunity to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We can tell the saints, The arrangement in the group meeting is different from the arrangement in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>There is no group leader or coordinator.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We all share responsibility for the meeting, and the meetings will not always be in the same home.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Then the saints will be enlivened, the group meeting will be enjoyable, and they will be willing to come again.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They might even bring someone to the next meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>After the saints feel comfortable with the group meeting, we can begin to restore the dormant saints.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In brief, the group meeting is the starting point to form a river out of dew.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Eventually, there will be a river flowing among us.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We must pray diligently for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In particular, all those who are prepared to serve full time must assist the elders to promote the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The other areas of our work can temporarily slow down.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We must remember not to turn the atmosphere in the group meeting into an atmosphere of a small worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>That is organization.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We must be organic.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In our service and our work we should always remember to be aggressive but not anxious.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It is good if we can achieve something today, and it is also good if we can achieve it tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should not be overly concerned with time.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, we must be aggressive and not be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>This is a principle for receiving the Lord s blessing.</S>
