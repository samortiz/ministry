<p>The Spirit also transforms the sanctified saints (2 Cor. 3:18b). Transformation is a metabolic change. It is an inward change caused by a new element replacing the old. The Spirit works Himself into us to be the new element to replace and discharge all of the old things. Then we are transformed into the image of the Lord from one degree of glory to another degree of glory. This transformation is by the Lord Spirit. The Spirit&rsquo;s work is to work the elements of what the Triune God is, has passed through, and has accomplished, obtained, and attained into our being. He desires to constitute us with these elements, to make these elements our elements for our spiritual and divine constitution. The entire constitution of our spiritual being is a kind of organic union, and this organic union is of the divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE OF THE WORK OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The work of the Spirit issues in the baptism of all the believers in the one Spirit into one Body (1 Cor. 12:13a). We were separate individuals, but after being baptized in the one Spirit, we became a corporate Body, the Body of Christ. The issue of the work of the Spirit is also that all the Spirit-baptized believers are drinking of the same one Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13b). We have been put into a position to drink of the Spirit. To be baptized into the Spirit is to get into the Spirit. To drink the Spirit is to get the Spirit into us. We have been outwardly baptized in the Spirit, and we are now inwardly drinking the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVING THE LORD IN THE ORGANIC UNION</h2>
<p>Now we need to apply what we have fellowshipped so far. We may love the Lord and love the church. We may like to serve the Lord in the church life. But most of us love the Lord and serve the Lord in the church life in our natural way. We may think that to serve the Lord in the church life, we need to be humble. Then we may pray, &ldquo;Lord, help me and grant me to be humble.&rdquo; But after a period of time, we will not be able to tolerate our situation in the church life. A certain saint was trying to serve the Lord in the church life in a humble way. One day another saint impolitely charged this one to clean the rest room thoroughly. The saint who was trying to be humble got offended. When another saint charges us to do something, we may think something like this: &ldquo;Who are you to charge me and tell me to clean the rest room? Why wouldn&rsquo;t you do it? Are you an elder? You are younger than I am. I am forty-five and you are only twenty-five.&rdquo; Such a reaction is a sign that our service to the Lord in the church life is by our natural life and not in the organic union. If we serve the Lord in the church life by the organic union, we will always realize that we are terminated. In the organic union, it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me (Gal. 2:20). In the organic union, for me to live is Christ (Phil. 1:21). If we serve the Lord in the church life in such an organic union, we will not be offended by anyone.</p>
<p>Let us use another illustration of a brother who loves the Lord and who serves in the church life. Here is a brother who is fifty years old and who has a big heart that can embrace many things. He was also told in an impolite way to clean the rest room thoroughly. At first, he became offended. But then he thought, &ldquo;I am serving the Lord in the church life, and I should not be angry with anyone. I should not be offended, but I should be patient with the one who told me to clean the rest room.&rdquo; As a result, this brother humbled himself to clean the rest room without complaint. Was this service in the organic union? Actually, this kind of service is in the principle of the teaching of Confucius. The Chinese were taught by Confucius to practice self-humility in this manner. Instead of the organic union service in the church life, we may have the Chinese ethics service.</p>
<p>We have to consider the content of our practical church life throughout the years. We have to know the difference between the &ldquo;vinegar&rdquo; of our natural life and the &ldquo;sugar&rdquo; of the divine life in the organic union. Are we serving the Lord in the church life in the organic union, in our American culture, or according to Chinese ethics? Anything other than the organic union will be exhausted sooner or later. Our patience is limited. Only the patience of Christ is unlimited. In Ephesians 3 Paul prays that we may be able to apprehend the breadth, length, height, and depth with all the saints (v. 18). The breadth, length, height, and depth are the unlimited dimensions of Christ. His dimensions are unlimited, immeasurable. But we are so limited. Our patience, our love, and our humility are limited and will be exhausted. In the organic union, however, everything is eternal.</p>
<p>The church as the Body of Christ is the organism of the Triune God. This organism is not in ourselves but in the organic union of the divine Trinity. Thank the Lord that in His salvation we can experience this organic union which is wrapped up with the Spirit as the person. We always have to be filled and saturated with Him. I mostly pray for two things: the cleansing and covering blood and the anointing Spirit. I need the cleansing and the anointing. This means that I need the working of the Spirit in the organic union.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Organism of the Triune God in the Organic Union of His Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
