But they are all in the Lord and they are children of God, so we should still love them. Once a pastor came to see me. He did not speak of anything except the question of the church and leaving the denominations. I thought I did not need to speak about this. However, he kept asking and quizzing me, and he exhorted me, saying, "You are very good, but there is one thing that you do that is not good. Because of your meeting, you are taking members of other congregations from them; the number of attendants in the nearby churches has decreased." He also said that I was not very polite to him and was too rude. At that time, I did not debate with him because he was older than I. Later, he introduced me to another old pastor who spoke about the same thing. The other old pastor also exhorted me to stop the meetings because the numbers in their churches had decreased. He also said, "It is not easy for a church to get people to come listen to the Word or to become members and come to their meetings. They had worked very hard for this. Now you have pulled them all away at once." He thought I should not do that. At that time, I could no longer hold my peace. I said a few straight words. I said to him, "Pastor, if all the people in Ch'angsha went to your church meetings, but the Lord did not gain anything, what would you gain? I did not come here to gain anybody. I only have one goal. I want the Lord to gain something, and that is enough. If someone was raised up by God, and every believer in my meeting went to hear him, I would be happy because this is the Lord's work. It is the Lord's gain." He said, "That is reasonable." Oh, it saddens me to see people going after things other than the Lord and uplifting these things rather than the Lord. Their only goal is an increase in attendance. It is indeed sad that they put the Lord aside! As I was speaking, two verses came to me: One was when David was hiding from Absalom, and Ziba, the servant of Mephibosheth, gained his master's wealth through craftiness. After David returned, Mephibosheth said a word to David, "What right therefore have I yet to cry any more unto the king?...Let him take all, forasmuch as my lord the king is come again in peace unto his own house." The other verse is in John 3 when the people said to John the Baptist, "He who was with you across the Jordan, of whom you have testified, behold, He is baptizing and all are coming to Him." John said, "He must increase, but I must decrease." I feel that indeed, "No one can come to Me unless it has been given to him from the Father." I told the brothers that if there was only one person here at our meeting, we still had to keep meeting because the Lord said, "Not abandoning our own assembling together." If some brother stopped meeting, we could visit him on the one hand, but on the other, we must remember that whatever is sown will be plucked up, if it is not sown by My Father. Oh, I am nothing; the work is nothing; only the Lord's will is enough.</P><P>There is one other thing. I went to observe the True Jesus Church in Ch'ang-sha to see how they spoke in tongues, rolled on the floor, and shook, etc. But I only saw them speaking in tongues. I did not see anything else. I went on the Lord's Day. (Their real meeting is on Saturday.) That day I met one of their deacons and asked him about the matter of tongues, but his attitude was not very good. Actually, I went with a good attitude. If speaking in tongues was right, I also wanted it. However, on his side, he thought I was trying to give him a hard time. Finally, I asked him, "Is there anyone else here?" He said, "They have all left. The preacher is not here either." So I made an appointment to go the next Saturday. I met the preacher when I went. I asked him about the matters of speaking in tongues and the Holy Spirit. He asked me whether I could speak in tongues. I said I could not. He said, "You have not been saved." I said, "I am saved because I have definitely believed in the Lord Jesus as my Savior." He said, "Even though you believe, you still do not have the indwelling Holy Spirit." I asked him, "Do all believers have to speak in tongues?" He said, "Of course, they should. What is more, they certainly must." At that time I said, "I want to speak in tongues. If it is real, I really want it. But I must first test this Spirit." Then he said that I was not saved because I still could not speak in tongues. I asked him about 1 Corinthians 12:30: "Do all speak in tongues?" He could not explain it and could only interrupt with other words. He related many testimonies to me. I also sat through one of their sermons. This happened before I went to speak with him. The only thing that they kept speaking about was that other churches are not churches, and that they are the only church. They base their assertion on the claim that the other churches are not like those in the age of the apostles. It is a shame! They are a meeting which only uplifts itself. They do not uplift the Lord!</P><P>Ya Li University is very close to us. They also invited me to speak the Word. They had originally wanted the director of our hospital to go, but later they invited me. I thought I should not refuse this invitation. It was very good to have the opportunity to preach the gospel. Unfortunately, I only went twice because they only have it once every two weeks. If the Lord is willing, I think that there must be some who can be saved.</P><P>When I went to Ch'ang-sha, my desire was not that great. I felt that if one person was saved, I had not gone in vain. Thank God, many people have been saved to my surprise. With regard to myself, I have missed so much perfecting and could not hear so many precious words. I could not see so many dear brothers. I am alone there by myself and have not had much growth. I have so many areas that cannot satisfy the Lord. Many times, I know that a certain matter is wrong, but the flesh will not let me go, and I still do it. For example, I bought many things that were not necessary. The strength of the flesh is strongest here. It seems that there is no way to overcome it. Before I did not know, but now I know a little. Once I thought, have I really fallen so low? Do I really love the world like this? The book of 1 John tells the young believers not to love the world and the things in the world. If a person loves the world, the love of the Father is not in him. This is not said to the fathers but to the young men. It is something very difficult. Unless the cross operates in us, the strength of the flesh is too great for us. I did not know before, but now I have really seen this. The flesh wants to grab me and drag me to buy things that I do not really need. This is my individual failure. I do not have much more to say. In any case, I must always thank God because He is with me.</P><P>Yu Cheng Hua<br>Winter, 1933, Shanghai</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 25: Collection of Newsletters (1) &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
