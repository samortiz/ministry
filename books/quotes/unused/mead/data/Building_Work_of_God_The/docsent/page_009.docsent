   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD'S BUILDING IN THE NEW TESTAMENT THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ALSO HAVING THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN AS ITS CENTER</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now let us look at the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first matter in the beginning of the New Testament is the incarnation, which is God's coming into man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is a marvelous matter!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today's Christianity constantly pays attention to the story of Bethlehem, saying that a Savior was born there for us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Surely this is right, but it is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The story of Bethlehem is not only about a Savior but also about the mingling of God and man, about God coming into man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The significance of what happened in Bethlehem is that God became flesh and entered into man to be mingled with man and to become one with man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is a mystery that God comes into man to be God to man.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whereas formerly God was outside of man, now God has entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not a matter of God's descending from the heavens to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's descending from the heavens to the earth is a human thought, not a divine concept.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The significance of what happened in Bethlehem is not merely that God came from the heavens to the earth but that God entered into man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Incarnation is God's coming into man, entering into a union with man, and tabernacling among men.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to remember that the Word becoming flesh and tabernacling among men is related to building.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When the Word became flesh, a substantial building, a practical building, began.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God began to build Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now there was a man who could say, "God is in Me. Outside of Me you cannot find God and you do not have God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am a man born of Mary, and I am a Nazarene whose name is Jesus, yet there is God in Me. Within Me is the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am the tabernacle; I am the temple; I am the building of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Have you ever seen the tabernacle?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Have you ever seen the temple?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am the temple."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One day the Jews asked Him, "What sign do you show us, seeing that You do these things?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He answered, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up" John 2:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He had no other signs to show them except this one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Jews did not understand what He meant.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All they saw was the temple before their eyes, which was the temple built by King Herod.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The temple in the Old Testament had three stages.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first stage was the temple built by King Solomon and destroyed by the Babylonians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The second stage was the temple rebuilt by Ezra and his companions after their return from the land of captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The scale of that temple was very small.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The third stage was the temple reconstructed by Herod when he became the king of the Jewish people shortly before the birth of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In order to please the Jews, Herod rebuilt and enlarged the temple, spending forty-six years to complete it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This was the temple the Jews saw at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They said to the Lord, "This temple was built in forty-six years, and You will raise it up in three days?"</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was because they did not understand that the Lord was speaking of the temple of His body vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God was mingled with Him, and He was the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Satan, however, hated this temple and wanted to get rid of it and to destroy it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, when the Lord Jesus was being judged, the Jews cried out, "Take Him away!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Take Him away!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Crucify Him!"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>19:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Satan thought that he could destroy the temple of God, the building of God, by destroying this man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After three days, however, the Lord resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Through the Lord's resurrection the small temple became enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Originally the Lord was one grain of wheat, but now through death and resurrection He produced many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Formerly the Lord alone was the temple, but after He resurrected from the dead and imparted His life into His people, they also became the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before the Lord's resurrection, only Jesus the Nazarene was the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, after the Lord's resurrection, the Galileans who belonged to the Lord and all those who had received the Lord's life all became a part of this temple.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is what the Lord meant when He said, "Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, after His resurrection, the Lord's physical body became His mystical Body, which includes Peter, James, and John, as well as all of us, the saved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After His resurrection the Lord's Body is an immense Body, an immeasurable temple.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This Body, which He raised up in His resurrection, is His church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church is His Body, His temple.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Dear brothers and sisters, we need to see clearly this matter of God's building in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>First, the Lord as the Word became flesh to be a tabernacle, a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God mingled Himself with Him and dwelt within Him.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At that time, however, the scale of that temple was very small.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It was limited to one man, whose name is Jesus, the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the entire human race, the building of God was within Him alone.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He alone was the tabernacle of God, the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God dwelt in Him, and He dwelt in God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Then God caused Him to go through death and resurrection so that He could impart His life into His people.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In this way, what happened in Bethlehem in the incarnation could also happen in them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Thus, God entered into these people and was constituted into them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They were also brought into God, and they became the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As a result, the temple has been enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is no longer limited to one person but has been enlarged to include thousands and thousands of people.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Since that day that He entered into His people, God has been building this temple.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Lord said, "Upon this rock I will build My church" Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What is this rock?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This rock refers to the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Immediately after Peter received the revelation and knew that the Lord was the Christ, the Son of the living God v. 16 , the Lord said, "Upon this rock I will build My church." The church is being built upon Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Since that day God's work has been to build the Body the church as the temple of God upon this rock as the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In this divine building the Lord Himself is not only the rock, the foundation, but also the cornerstone Eph 2:20b; Matt 21:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Every stone in this house is joined to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, 1 Peter 2:4-5 says that the Lord is a living stone, and that all the saved ones as living stones are joined to Him and are being built upon Him as a spiritual house for God and His people to dwell in.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>For two thousand years God has been doing this building work in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The apostle Paul told us that after the Lord's resurrection and ascension, He gave some as apostles, some as prophets, some as evangelists, and some as shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>All these gifts are for the building up of His Body, which is the church Eph 4:8-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Furthermore, he said that in Christ all of us who are saved are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit 2:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He also said that we are the temple of God 1 Cor 3:16 , and that "he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit" 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Therefore, this building is the union of God and man in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is man and God becoming one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This one spirit is a building, a spiritual house, which is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Both God and man are in this spirit and dwell in this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>This is God's work of building in the New Testament age.</S>
