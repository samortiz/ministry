   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lying to and Testing the Holy Spirit God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 5:4 indicates that selling possessions and distributing them to others was not considered by the apostles a practice of legality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The believers were not required to have all things common.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That was something that should have been done willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If Ananias and Sapphira did not want to sell their property, they were not required to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Furthermore, the money from the sale was in their own authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It would not have been sinful for them to keep their property or to keep the proceeds from the sale of the property.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Their sin consisted in lying to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Their intention was to cheat the church and to get a name for themselves by lying.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was a gross sin that offended the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their sin was a willing cooperation with Satan, the evil resident within them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In 5:3 Peter told Ananias that he lied to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then at the end of verse 4 Peter said to him, "You did not lie to men, but to God."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This proves that the Holy Spirit in verse 3 is God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Later, when Peter was speaking to Sapphira, he said to her, "Why was it agreed together by you to test the Spirit of the Lord?" v. 9 . The Holy Spirit in verse 3, God in verse 4, and the Lord in verse 9 are all one, especially in the experience of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not think that the Spirit to whom Ananias and Sapphira lied was the Spirit in the heavens, the Spirit outside them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They did not lie merely to an objective Spirit; they lied to the very Spirit who was within them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the Holy Spirit had not been within them, Peter would not have said that they had lied to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Both Satan and the Holy Spirit resided in Ananias and Sapphira at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The fact that Ananias and Sapphira suffered the punishment of physical death for lying to the Holy Spirit does not mean that they will suffer eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although Ananias and Sapphira were saved, they committed a sin unto death 1 John 5:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In God's governmental dealing, some of His children may be destined to physical death in this age due to a certain sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This was the situation of Ananias and Sapphira, who were punished with physical death because of their lying to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Their case teaches us to be extremely careful about ambition and dishonesty in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Pretending to Be Absolute for the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Ananias and Sapphira pretended to be absolute for the Lord vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>3b-4a, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They pretended to give everything to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was their hypocrisy, which was due to their ambition to be somebody and to have a name for vainglory.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. Being Overcome by Racial Difference</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The second failure in the churches was the failure of being overcome by racial difference.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Acts 6:1 says, "In these days, when the disciples were multiplying, there was a murmuring of the Hellenists against the Hebrews, because their widows were overlooked in the daily dispensing."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Hellenists were Jews who spoke Greek, and the Hebrews were Jews who spoke Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the very beginning of the practice of the church life, there was a failure that seemed to be caused by different languages.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Apparently the problem in the church at Jerusalem was a problem of language related to those who spoke Hebrew and those who spoke Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, this was a problem not mainly of language but of race.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We know from Acts 2 that Jews had come from their dispersion to Jerusalem to keep the feast of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who had been dispersed among other races gradually came to speak the languages of those races.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Thus, when they came to Jerusalem to celebrate the feast of Pentecost, they were not able to speak Hebrew but spoke their native languages.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In particular, the Hellenists spoke Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The difference of language became a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, the source of the trouble was not language but race.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If all of mankind were of one race, there would probably be just one language.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Different languages are the result of different races.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to Genesis 11, the source of this problem was Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since the time of Babel, mankind has been divided into different races that have formed their own nations and kingdoms.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This division is the basic problem of the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to Ephesians 2, the Lord Jesus on the cross abolished all the ordinances among the races.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, the church at Jerusalem suffered from racial differences.</S>
