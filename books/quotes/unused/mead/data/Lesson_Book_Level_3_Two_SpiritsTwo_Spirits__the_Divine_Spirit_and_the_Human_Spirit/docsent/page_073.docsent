   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. In the Spirit 1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Not in Oldness of Letter</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now we come to a crucial point; that is, we need to learn how to serve in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 7:6 says, "But now we are discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, that we should serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We need to learn to serve in the spirit not in the letter, not in the law, not in doctrine, but in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Second Corinthians 3:6 indicates that the New Testament service is a matter of the Spirit, not of the letter: "Who also made us sufficient as ministers of a new covenant, not of letter, but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 8 continues, "How shall not rather the ministry of the Spirit be in glory?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Newness of Our Regenerated Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am afraid that many believers simply do not know what it means to serve in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Before we were saved, we were dead in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>On one hand, we were very active in the mind and in the emotion; yet we were dead in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But, praise the Lord, at the time we were saved, the Lord regenerated our spirit and made it alive.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From that time, we need to learn to live, to walk, to act in the spirit, not in the mind or emotion, not in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to learn not only to walk, to live, in the spirit but also to serve in the spirit, and to serve in the newness of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My burden is to help you know something in a practical way, not in the way of doctrine or theory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What does it mean to serve the Lord in the spirit and in the newness of the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A spirit has been created within us, and we have been regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Our spirit has been renewed, and the Spirit of God is now dwelling in this quickened, renewed spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore our spirit is now a strong factor in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because this spirit has been renewed and made alive, and because it has been strengthened by the indwelling of the Holy Spirit, it surely is a strong factor in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Yet, due to the fact that we lack the proper teaching, we simply do not realize that we have such a renewed spirit with the Holy Spirit indwelling it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, we should have some realization because of all the speaking in the ministry concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On one hand, we need to walk, to live, in this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are not speaking of the Holy Spirit, but of our renewed spirit in which the Holy Spirit dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To walk, to live, in our spirit means that we will be in the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit is now indwelling our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to live in the spirit, and we need to learn to serve in the spirit.</S>
