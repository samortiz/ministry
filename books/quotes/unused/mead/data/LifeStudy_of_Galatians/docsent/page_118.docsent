   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST FORMED IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As sons of God, we now need Christ to be formed in us 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For Christ to be formed in us requires that we forget our self-made laws and allow Christ to occupy us in full.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more Christ occupies us inwardly, the more He is formed within us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>THE FRUIT OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In chapter five Paul charges us to walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In verse 16 he says, Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To walk by the Spirit here actually means to live Christ, to move, act, and have our being according to the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our reason for not losing our temper or for not indulging in certain kinds of worldly entertainment should be that we are living according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, if we are calm or excited, the reason for our calmness or excitement should simply be that we are living according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we live Christ in this way, we shall spontaneously have a living which issues in the fruit of the Spirit 5:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After naming various aspects of the fruit of the Spirit, Paul says that against such things there is no law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His use of the expression such things indicates that the fruit of the Spirit is not limited to the items mentioned in verses 22 and 23.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the items mentioned by Paul are virtues which are different aspects of Christ expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These virtues are not works; they are fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hatred is a work of the flesh, whereas love is a fruit of the Spirit, the spontaneous issue of living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A tree does not produce fruit by working.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The fruit produced by a tree is an issue of the inner life of the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Likewise, love, joy, peace, longsuffering, kindness, and all the other aspects of the fruit of the Spirit are not the result of our working; they are different aspects of the unique spiritual fruit which is produced out from the Christ who dwells within us and whom we live out.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>LIVING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>TO EXPRESS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In all the small matters of our daily life, we need to walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For example, when a brother gets a haircut, he should not have his hair cut according to a certain way or standard, but according to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even in the matter of a haircut he should have fellowship with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Likewise, the sisters need to dress according to the Spirit, not according to a certain way practiced in the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To conform to a certain way of dressing common to those in the local churches may be a very good habit or practice, but it is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the sisters dress according to a certain habit, the issue will not be life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if they dress by the Spirit and according to the Spirit, the result will be life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To walk by the Spirit and thereby to have every aspect of our daily walk in correspondence to the Spirit is altogether a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not a matter of habit, custom, or conformity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From the human point of view, it may be good for people to conform to certain standards and practices, for this will result in improved behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It may cause those who are crude and unruly to become kind and obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although such an outward change is good, it has nothing to do with Christ or the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What God wants is not that we conform to certain customs and habits, even though such conformity may be very good in human eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God wants us to live Christ, who is realized as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God s New Testament economy is wholly a matter of walking by the Spirit to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The first kind of walk by the Spirit revealed in the book of Galatians is a walk in which we live Christ, expressing the various aspects of the fruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our daily life as Christians should be a life of walking by the Spirit to live Christ by expressing Him with all His excellent virtues.</S>
