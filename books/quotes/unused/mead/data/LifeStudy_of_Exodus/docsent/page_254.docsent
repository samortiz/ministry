   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Causing Them to Live to Full Age</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Exodus 23:26 also says, The number of thy days I will fulfil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This means that God would cause the people to live to full age, to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today there are very few persons who have come to full spiritual maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you consider the writings of Christians today and what is spoken on the radio broadcasts, you will realize that most Christians are childish.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Where can you find believers who are spiritually mature, who have come to full spiritual age?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Such Christians are very rare indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This lack proves that the situation among most Christians is not under God s blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God is willing to bless them, but He has no way to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is why the Lord has need of the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We look to Him that in His recovery we may always have the blessed food and drink, that we shall be spiritually healthy in every way in our sight, hearing, speech, and activities and that we shall not be afflicted with miscarriage or barrenness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We look to Him that we shall come to full age and become mature spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>More than forty years ago in the church life, there were very few elders who were truly spiritual fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Most of those who were elders were not yet very mature in life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But I can testify that many who have been in the recovery for thirty or forty years have become very mature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They did not have a premature death, spiritually speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I am also encouraged by the fact that some of the saints among us today are much more experienced and mature than five years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I hope that during the next several years many more will come to maturity and that, spiritually speaking, none will die prematurely.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do not think that the elders are the only ones who need to be mature.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No, all the saints must mature.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I hope that even those who are young sisters today will become mature in the years to come.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many who have been with us for decades are still growing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that God is still fulfilling the number of their days.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is important, for in the church life in the Lord s recovery we need a good number of those who are spiritually aged.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the Lord delays His coming back for many years, I hope that all the saints will keep on growing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even this aspect of growth is one of the details of the way to take possession of Christ and gain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am sorry that among most Christian groups you find miscarriage, barrenness, and immaturity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Much of the talk among them is on a kindergarten level.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The situation must be different in the church life in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we have many among us who are spiritually aged, mature, this is a proof that we are taking Christ as our possession.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have pointed out that God s complete care of His people includes four items: blessing their food and water, taking sickness away from them, granting them multiplication, and causing them to live to full age.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These matters are arranged in an excellent sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we have proper food and water, there will be no disease among us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we shall be fruitful and not have miscarriages.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Finally, our days will be fulfilled, and we shall have a long life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The second, third, and fourth aspects of the Lord s complete care are dependent on the first His blessing on our food and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We all need the proper food of the Word and the proper drink of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then we shall be healthy, fruitful, and mature.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We shall have a healthy and abundant life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>As a result, we shall have the strength to take the initiative to drive out the pagan tribes, the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then the whole land, the entire Christ, will become our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I appreciate the picture in the Old Testament formed by putting together the different pieces of the puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First we have Christ as the sent One, the Angel of Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we have God, the One working for us, and also the food and water under His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we eat and drink properly, we shall grow and multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Among us there will be no sickness, miscarriage, barrenness, or premature spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Through our growth, multiplication, and maturity we shall be qualified to drive out the natural life, allow Christ to replace it, and then enjoy Him and take full possession of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We thank the Lord for this picture in the Old Testament showing us in detail how to take possession of Christ as the good land.</S>
