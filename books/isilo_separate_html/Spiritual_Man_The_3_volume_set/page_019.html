We can see this from the following verses:</P><blockquote>"For Jehovah your God hardened his spirit" (Deut. 2:30).<br>"Jehovah...saves those who are contrite in spirit" (Psa. 34:18).<br>"Renew a steadfast spirit within me" (Psa. 51:10).<br>"When Jesus had said these things, He became troubled in His spirit" (John 13:21).<br>"His spirit was provoked within him as he beheld that the city was full of idols" (Acts 17:16).<br>"For you have not received a spirit of slavery bringing you into fear again" (Rom. 8:15).<br>"The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God" (Rom. 8:16).<br>"For I,...present in the spirit, have already judged, as if being present, him who has thus done this" (1 Cor. 5:3).<br>"I had no rest in my spirit" (2 Cor. 2:13).<br>"For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice" (2 Tim. 1:7).</blockquote><P>The spirit has the function of intuition, or consciousness. We can see this from the following verses:</P><blockquote>"The spirit is willing" (Matt. 26:41).<br>"Jesus, knowing fully in His spirit" (Mark 2:8).<br>"And He groaned deeply in His spirit" (Mark 8:12).<br>"Jesus...was moved with indignation in His spirit" (John 11:33).<br>"This man...being fervent in spirit" (Acts 18:25).<br>"I am going bound in the spirit to Jerusalem" (Acts 20:22).<br>"For who among men knows the things of man, except the spirit of man which is in him?" (1 Cor. 2:11).<br>"For they refreshed my spirit and yours" (1 Cor. 16:18).<br>"Because his spirit has been refreshed by all of you" (2 Cor. 7:13).</blockquote><P>The spirit has the function of fellowship, or worship. We can see this from the following verses:</P><blockquote>"And my spirit has exulted in God my Savior" (Luke 1:47).<br>"The true worshippers will worship the Father in spirit and truthfulness" (John 4:23).<br>"For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit" (Rom. 1:9).<br>"We serve in newness of spirit" (Rom. 7:6).<br>"You have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father!" (Rom. 8:15).<br>"The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit" (Rom. 8:16).<br>"But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit" (1 Cor. 6:17).<br>"I will pray with the spirit" (1 Cor. 14:15).<br>"If you bless with the spirit" (1 Cor. 14:16).<br>"And he carried me away in spirit" (Rev. 21:10).</blockquote><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_018.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_020.html">Next</a> </body></html>
