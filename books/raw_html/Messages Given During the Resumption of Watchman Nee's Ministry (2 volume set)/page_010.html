<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>ALLOWING GOD<br>TO LIVE HIMSELF OUT OF US</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>SPECIAL CONFERENCE (2)</H1><P>Date:Evening, December 27, 1947<br>Place:Hong Kong<br>Speaker:Witness Lee</P><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Phil. 2:12-13; 3:8-10</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S PURPOSE IN MAN&#151;WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</H2><P>If we read through the Old and the New Testament, we will see that God has one specific purpose in man. Whether in creating man or in redeeming man, God desires to achieve this purpose. This purpose can be considered the center of the universe. If a man does not meet this purpose while he lives on earth, he will feel empty. Even a Christian who does not see this purpose will feel that his life is meaningless. God has shown us in many ways through His word what this purpose is. God's purpose is to work Himself into man. At the end of Revelation we are told that in the new heaven and new earth, when God's work is completed, He will have worked Himself completely into man. By that time, God will be fully in man, and man will be fully in God. God and man will become one. We may think that we were destined for perdition and hell. After we are saved, we may think that now, as a saved person, we are satisfied as long as we can go to heaven. However, this is not the highest purpose of God, His ultimate purpose. God's highest purpose, His ultimate purpose, is to work Himself into man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SALVATION BEING GOD ADDED INTO MAN</H2><P>God created man according to His image (Gen. 1:26). What is the meaning of an image? When you see a picture, you recognize the person represented by the picture. There are many great men in this world; it is difficult for us to meet them face to face. However, we can recognize them from their pictures. Man is God's picture. At the time of creation, man had only God's image; he did not have God's life. At that time, man bore only God's outward appearance. After he is saved, he possesses God's life as well (2 Pet. 1:3). Salvation means that God comes into us. By this, we become a man with God, having received nothing other than God and nothing less than God Himself. Salvation is not a matter of turning an evil man into a good man, or turning a filthy man into a clean man. No matter how much man cleanses himself, he is still only a man. The meaning of salvation is God added into man. Man's number is seven, and seven is three plus four. Four is the number of the creatures, and three is the number of God. Three plus four means God added into man.</P><P>In 1932, I was meeting in the denominations. There were many people in my denomination, and not a few were saved. One older gentleman was a professional man in the law. Although he was old, he was very healthy. I noticed him in the services, but I had never had a chance to talk to him. One day I met him on the street, and I asked him, "Have you believed in the Lord?" He told me happily that he had. I asked, "Are you saved?" He said that he was. I then asked, "How do you know that you are saved?" He said, "I know I am saved because God and I have become one." This word was marvelous. Even if you were to give the whole world to me, I would still be one individual person, an empty person. But one day I was saved, and God entered into me. From that time on, the two became one. This is like an electric light. Before the switch is turned on, the light does not shine. But once the switch is turned on and the electricity comes, the light comes on. When we are saved, God is added into us. The two have become one. This is not something for the future, but something that is for the present. What does this mean? It means that God is added into man. In the future, who will the perishing ones be? The perishing ones will be those who are empty, those who do not have God inside them. Who are the saved ones? They are the filled-up ones, those who have God inside them. On the day of salvation, God entered into us. Many times, I considered myself an evil person. Sometimes I have even hit myself. But then I would remember that the God within me is marvelous.</P>
