   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>5 Concerning Reuben a Being the Firstborn to Have the Preeminence</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in Dignity and in Power</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us now consider Jacob's word to Reuben.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because Reuben was corrupted, defiled, and full of germs, in Jacob's blessing with prophecy he is isolated from all the other brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 3 says, "Reuben, thou art my firstborn, my might, and the firstfruits of my strength, the preeminence of dignity, and the preeminence of power" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As the firstborn, Reuben had the preeminence in dignity and in power.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Look at the words Jacob used to describe him: "my firstborn," "my might," "the firstfruits of my strength," "the preeminence of dignity," and "the preeminence of power."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>b Having Lost the Preeminence of the Birthright</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>because of His Ebullition in Lust</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although Reuben had the preeminence of the birthright, he lost it because of his defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 4 says, "Ebullient as water, thou shalt not have preeminence; because thou wentest up to thy father's bed; then defiledst thou it: he went up to my couch" Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Hebrew word rendered "unstable" in the King James Version is very difficult to translate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I believe that the best rendering is "ebullient," which means boiling, to move violently.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Reuben, who was boiling over with lust, moved violently to defile his father's bed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In doing that, Reuben went too far.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That indulgence in lust caused him to lose his birthright.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because in his ebullience Reuben had defiled his father's bed, Jacob said that he would not have preeminence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, the preeminence of the birthright was taken away from him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As Jacob was prophesying regarding Reuben in chapter forty-nine, he undoubtedly remembered that he had already given the birthright to Joseph 48:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Jacob did not give it to Joseph by accident; rather, he must have considered the matter for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to 48:5, Jacob said, "And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, in 48:22, Jacob said, "Moreover I have given to thee one portion above thy brethren, which I took out of the hand of the Amorite with my sword and with my bow."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, Joseph received two portions of the land, one portion for Ephraim and another for Manasseh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eventually, this prophecy was fulfilled in Joshua 16 and 17.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the land was divided by lot, Joseph received two portions.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was not accomplished through human maneuvering; it was accomplished through lot, which was controlled by God for the fulfillment of Jacob's prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At this point I need to say a strong word, especially to the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do not think that defilement is an insignificant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We were made by God in His image.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because we have the image of God, we are honorable, even according to our natural make-up.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although other sins may not damage our body, fornication causes direct damage to our physical body, a vessel of honor 1 Cor 6:18; 1 Thes 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Because we have been regenerated, our body is now the temple of the Holy Spirit 1 Cor 6:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, not only do we bear the image of God in our physical body, but after regeneration our body is the temple of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, you must keep your body in an honorable way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nothing damages your body as much as fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The practice of the world today is utterly hellish, devilish, and satanic.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How devilish it is for young people to have contact with one another without any restriction!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I wish to warn all the young people, even the young brothers and sisters in the church life, to exercise certain restrictions upon their contact with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a young brother coming into the ministry, I went to Shanghai to receive help from Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>During those days, Brother Nee had many long talks with me.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first instruction he gave me, as a brother in the Lord's ministry, was never to contact a member of the opposite sex alone, but, for my protection, to always have the presence of a third party.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have never forgotten this word; it has been a great help and protection to me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>By the Lord's mercy, I have followed his word throughout the years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We are fallen human beings, and we all have lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>None of us can say that he does not have lust.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In 1930 there was in my home province a particular so-called Pentecostal movement.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A certain group declared that because they had received the baptism of the Holy Spirit, they no longer had any lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus, males and females began to live together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, this practice resulted in fornication, and great shame was brought upon the Lord's name.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because of the fornication among this group, the door to the gospel was closed in that district for quite a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Approximately fifteen years ago, the same kind of thing occurred in Korea.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many Korean Christians who had had so-called Pentecostal experiences began to contact one another without restriction, and the result was fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Remember, you are still in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For a male and a female of the same age to be alone gives opportunity for the enemy to tempt them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because your past experiences have already convinced you of this, there is no need for me to say too much.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Never consider fornication as an unimportant matter.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As we have seen, nothing damages your honorable physical body as much as fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What a shame it is that some of those in the government want to legalize homosexuality!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To do this is to turn this country into a Sodom.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Reuben lost the preeminence of the birthright because of one sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Today this preeminence is the top portion of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The double portion of the land signifies the top portion of the enjoyment of the riches of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once anyone commits such an awful and terrible sin, he is through with the top enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Not only the young people but even those who are middle-aged must be aware of the danger of being alone with a member of the opposite sex.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To do this is to take a great risk, for it opens the door for the subtle one to come in. You do not know how subtle and how evil your flesh is.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The lusts in our flesh are terrible!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thus, we should have no trust in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do not think that it is impossible for you to commit such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The best protection is following the word I received from Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Do not say that my word is the word of a conservative Chinese man from the Far East, and that you live in modern America.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As one who is over seventy years of age, I have passed through all the human experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Please take heed to my word regarding fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Again and again in the New Testament the Apostle Paul issued the warning that no fornicator would have any inheritance in the kingdom of God 1 Cor 6:9-10; Gal 5:19-21; Eph 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we come to Matthew 5 in our life-study, we shall see how strict the Lord Jesus was regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Never be loose in contacting members of the opposite sex.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For the Lord's name, for the church's testimony, for your protection, and for the honor of your physical body, you must follow this principle of not being alone with a member of the opposite sex.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If you follow this principle, you will be preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Remember, due to his defilement, Reuben's natural status, the status derived from birth, was altogether changed.</S>
