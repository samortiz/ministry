   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE MEETING FOR PREACHING THE GOSPEL Scripture Reading: Isa 45:11</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have much to learn and practice concerning the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We will first consider the way to invite people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some may say that this is very simple; it requires no training, and we know it already.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yes, we may know something about it, but there is a better technique for our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>PRAYING WITH LIVING FAITH TO COMMAND THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First of all, we must trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We cannot do anything independently from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we prepare to invite people, we must have adequate prayer about it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to pray to seek the Lord's mind concerning whom we contact.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we must pray for the persons who we feel it is of the Lord that we invite them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We must remember them, bringing their names to the Lord day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to pray in a prevailing way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Isaiah 45:11 says, "Thus says Jehovah, / The Holy One of Israel and the One who formed him, / Ask Me about the things to come concerning My sons, / And concerning the work of My hands, command Me."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this verse the Lord gives us the ground to command Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a sense, He says, "I am your Servant.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Give Me the order."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must learn to pray in this way, saying, "Lord, while I am here remaining with You and looking to You, I tell You that You have to do something."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is the mysterious principle of faith in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Faith honors the Lord, so the Lord always honors faith.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To not have a living, prevailing, and powerful faith means that either we depend on ourselves or that we have an evil heart of unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, if we would not trust in and depend on ourselves, and if we believe, we will have the living faith to claim something, to command the Lord to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To command the Lord to do something means that we do not trust in ourselves and that we believe; the Lord will honor this faith.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We need to pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All kinds of doubts come from the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must learn to believe and exercise a living faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Learn to pray for your contact with people, and learn to see how the Lord answers your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Tell the Lord, "Lord, I need to see that You have saved at least one person I have prayed for."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Tell this to Him definitely, challenging Him a little.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then you will see that He will come in. We can even say, "Lord, while I am praying here, at this very minute, You must work in the heart of the person for whom I am praying.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am waiting to hear a testimony from him that something happened within him at this very day, hour, and minute."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Learn to prove the Lord, not as the people of Israel did in the wilderness with an evil heart of unbelief, but with a believing heart.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we have the living faith in prayer, we will have an impact in preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we come to our friend, we will have the impact because we have prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Since we have commanded the Lord, we come to him with impact and assurance to tell him that he must be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the way to invite people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Luke 14:23 says that a master told his slaves not merely to invite but to compel people to come to his great dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some versions translate compel as force or constrain.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have to compel, force, press, and constrain people to come.</S>
