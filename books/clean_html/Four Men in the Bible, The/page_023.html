<h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE OF JERUSALEM<br />
BEING ONENESS WITHOUT CONFUSION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Confusion and Oneness in the Old Testament History</h2>
<p>After the tower of Babel in Genesis 11, man was divided and confused on the earth. God, however, came to Ur of the Chaldeans, the location of Babylon, and in the midst of a divided and confused situation, He called out Abraham and brought him to the land of Canaan and gave him the land (12:1-5). Although Abraham&rsquo;s descendants, the twelve tribes of Israel, subsequently failed because of famine and left the land of Canaan to go down into Egypt, God redeemed them and brought them out of Egypt, back to the land of Canaan. Even though there were twelve tribes in the land of Israel, God did not allow His people to be in a situation of division and confusion. Rather, God maintained the oneness of His people by establishing a unique center of worship on a unique ground. In Deuteronomy God repeatedly exhorted and charged the children of Israel not to casually worship and offer up sacrifices in any place. Instead, He charged them to worship at the unique place that He had chosen to put His name (12:5-7; 14:22-23; 15:20; 16:2, 5-7, 15-16). This unique ground, center, and place of worship maintained and preserved the oneness among God&rsquo;s people. This place was Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Whereas Babylon signifies division and confusion, Jerusalem signifies oneness without confusion. This is a matter of biblical history. Babylon represents division and confusion among men, and Jerusalem represents the oneness of God&rsquo;s people without confusion. Even though the children of Israel were made up of twelve tribes, their normal condition did not involve division and confusion. Furthermore, even though the Jews have been scattered throughout the nations, there never has been more than one holy temple on the earth. The site for the holy temple is in Jerusalem. All Jews are clear concerning God&rsquo;s charge in chapters 12, 14, 15, and 16; consequently, no one has dared to build a temple in any other place. Today all the Jews are awaiting the rebuilding of the holy temple on the temple site, which is the high peak of Zion in Jerusalem. Only this place is the center and unique ground of their oneness. Jerusalem represents the oneness of God&rsquo;s people without confusion, and Babylon represents division and confusion.</p>
<p>At the time of 2 Kings 25, the children of Israel were in desolation. Consequently, Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came with his whole army, breached the walls of Jerusalem, destroyed the holy temple, and took the captured Israelites to Babylon. Jerusalem was conquered by Babylon. When Babylon overcame Jerusalem, God&rsquo;s people were scattered everywhere, and they lost their oneness. After seventy years, God enabled the scattered captives, particularly the Israelites in Babylon, to rise up and return to Jerusalem (Ezra 1:1-6). Leaving Jerusalem is a matter of scattering and confusion, but returning to Jerusalem is a matter of recovering the oneness without confusion. The book of Ezra shows that only a small number of the children of Israel returned to Jerusalem. Nevertheless, the testimony of Jerusalem was recovered. This recovery lasted until the first coming of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Confusion and Division in the New Testament History</h2>
<p>The Old Testament speaks of things that have historical, physical, and symbolic significance. With the coming of the Lord Jesus in the New Testament, the spiritual significance of these things becomes apparent. For example, when the church was formed on the day of Pentecost, the situation of division that was brought in at Babel was reversed by the spiritual reality of the formation of the church. At Babel everyone spoke different languages or dialects, and no one could understand each other. But on the day of Pentecost, when people who spoke different languages from various nations were gathered in Jerusalem, the Holy Spirit descended upon the disciples, and they spoke in tongues so that these people could understand. At Babel there were division and confusion; at Pentecost in Jerusalem there was oneness without confusion. According to the record of Acts 2:14, when Peter stood with the eleven and spoke, everyone heard his word, and &ldquo;they were pricked in their heart&rdquo; (v. 37). Thus, the division and confusion brought in by Babel were terminated, and there was oneness in Jerusalem.</p>
<p>The church is the genuine Jerusalem, and it is based on the principle of oneness without confusion. This is the spiritual reality of Jerusalem. The spiritual reality of Jerusalem is the church, and the church is one and without confusion. Today in the church we can worship God in oneness and without confusion. Both God&rsquo;s name and God&rsquo;s habitation are with the church. Acts 2 records the oneness and the absence of confusion in the church on the day of Pentecost; this is Jerusalem. However, Satan still has subtle schemes. In 1 Corinthians 1:10 Paul said to the Corinthians, &ldquo;Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.&rdquo; Paul&rsquo;s exhortation to speak the same thing indicates that there were divisions among the Corinthians: one said that he was of Paul, another said that he was of Cephas, and yet another said that he was of Christ (v. 12). At Pentecost there was oneness without confusion, but in Corinth there were division and confusion, and even the reappearance of a spiritual aspect of Babylon. The spiritual aspect of Jerusalem was manifested on the day of Pentecost, but the spiritual aspect of Babylon was later manifested in Corinth. Gradually, this confusion developed into Roman Catholicism.</p>
