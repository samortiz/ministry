<h1 class=series>THE TRIUNE GOD’S REVELATION AND HIS MOVE</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE TWO</h1><h1 class=title>THE SEQUENCE OF THE ARRANGEMENT OF THE BIBLE</h1><h1 class=msg>(1)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:1; Mal. 4:5-6; Matt. 1:1; Rev. 22:20-21</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The Old Testament—a figurative portrait of God’s eternal economy:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>In types—Genesis to Deuteronomy:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Unveiling the Triune God embodied in Christ as the center and circumference of His eternal economy.</li>		<li>Unveiling this Christ as the blessing and everything to the Triune God’s chosen people.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>In history—Joshua to Esther:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Unveiling the Triune God’s move in His chosen people to possess, inherit, and enjoy His promised all-inclusive Christ as the good land.</li>		<li>Unveiling the failures of His chosen people as a warning to His New Testament chosen people.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>In poetry—Job to Song of Songs:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Unveiling that the Triune God should be man’s pursuit as his perfection, and this God was incarnated to be a man in the flesh to be His Anointed, who is His delight and has been exalted by Him and who should be received, treasured, and exalted by His chosen people.</li>		<li>Unveiling that all things in the human life under the sun are vanity of vanities and Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God is the unique satisfaction to God’s chosen people.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>In prophecy—Isaiah to Malachi:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Unveiling that the Triune God embodied in Christ will come to be the God-man (Isa. 7:14; 9:6) to accomplish redemption (Isa. 53) for the fulfillment of God’s eternal economy according to the preceding three categories of the books in the Old Testament.</li>		<li>Unveiling that the accomplishment of the processed and consummated Triune God in Christ will consummate in the new heaven and new earth—Isa. 65:17; 66:22; 2 Pet. 3:13; Rev. 21:1.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><p>A concluding note:<br>All the above points present us a vivid portrait of the all-inclusive Christ in and for God’s eternal economy in the Old Testament. In types, we see that Christ is the centrality and universality of God’s eternal economy and the divine blessing to all God’s chosen people. In history, we see that the all-inclusive Christ is the God-promised good land that all God’s chosen people should take, possess, inherit, and enjoy to the uttermost, even to the level of kingship. In poetry, we see that Christ is the unique perfection for God’s chosen people to pursue after and the unique satisfaction for God’s chosen people to obtain and enjoy. In prophecy, we see that the Triune God has become a God-man to accomplish His full redemption for the fulfillment of His eternal economy which will consummate in the new heaven and new earth.</p></ol>
