[1]  THE ASSEMBLY LIFE Preface to the Chinese Edition Introduction Authority in the Church Chapter One The Practice of Fellowship Chapter Two How to Meet Chapter Three The Boundary of the Local Assembly Chapter Four
[2]  Volume 22 of The Collected Works contains two books by Watchman Nee on the subject of the church.
[3]  The first book, The Assembly Life, is based on a Bible study conducted by Brother Watchman Nee with the brothers in Shanghai after the Third Overcomer Conference in January 1934.
[4]  The second book, The Prayer Ministry of the Church, is on the spiritual responsibility of the church to coordinate with God in prayer for the carrying out of His eternal purpose.
[5]  In recent years, God has raised up many brothers and sisters in various places.
[6]  As a result of seeing the truth concerning the church, they have gathered together to meet in the Lord's name.
[7]  They have left human organizations and things that are apart from the Bible, and they have come together to serve the Lord with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.
[8]  Although these scattered brothers who are meeting in the Lord's name have seen much concerning human organizations, they do not have, as yet, a deep enough understanding of the Body of Christ.
[9]  Although they have given up things that should not be in the church, they have not fully lived out the proper living of the Body of Christ.
[10]  God does not want His children to move freely on earth; He rules over His church through the authority He establishes in the church.
[11]  Brothers and sisters, although this meeting is in the nature of a Bible study, we cannot read all the scriptural references because of the limitation of time.
[12]  However, we know that the purpose of God from beginning to end is to have a corporate Christ, which is the church, so that Christ might be the Head and the believers might be the members.
[13]  If your eyes are open, you will see that all these things should be dropped and that you should turn your attention to the church, because the church life, the life of the Body of Christ, is the goal of God.
[14]  We come together every Lord's Day morning and afternoon to listen to messages, and we come together every Lord's Day evening to break the bread.
[15]  Can we be considered good believers just by doing this?
[16]  Or should we pursue being good brothers or good sisters by trying to render help to the meeting and the church?
[17]  Therefore, we have decided to study the following subjects: the authority of the church, the fellowship of the church, the way to meet, the way to divide up our local assembly into one meeting on Wen-teh Lane and another meeting on Gordon Lane, and how the two are one.
[18]  In order to understand authority in the church, we must first understand what authority is.
[19]  Otherwise, we will not understand authority in the church.
[20]  God desires that man submit to authority because the authorities are not only appointed by God, but they also represent God.
[21]  Therefore, the Bible mentions authority, on the one hand, and submission, on the other hand.
[22]  In the church God has also appointed His authority, and we should submit to this authority.
[23]  In an assembly, there are always a few brothers whose growth is more obvious than the others'.
[24]  In the Bible, there are clear guidelines concerning the qualifications of the elders.
[25]  2 The elders express opinions and make judgments on various matters.
[26]  Only the elders can express their opinion concerning certain matters.
[27]  No brother can stand up in the meeting at will to express his opinion concerning what to believe and what not to believe.
[28]  Therefore, only the elders have the authority to judge, utter declarations or announcements that are directed toward the public, and make judgments concerning disputes in truths; this is not the work of ordinary brothers.
[29]  Suppose that some of them purposely try to entice some of our brothers and sisters to join them in their Bible study in their homes, after breaking bread with us, or suppose that they gather some of the brothers and sisters who are meeting with us to listen to their opinionated doctrines.
[30]  But God tells the elders, "Therefore the elders among you...shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God...nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock" 1 Pet 5:1-3 .
[31]  God's gifts, such as the evangelists, shepherds, and teachers, can function anywhere because these gifts are given by God to the whole church Eph 4 , and they are for all the local assemblies.
[32]  If we think this way, we are more evil than the most evil persons in the world, and we become worse than those who have not left the denominations, because those who have not left the denominations are still under man's authority even though they do not have the God-ordained authority.
[33]  Answer: Acts 20 clearly says that the Holy Spirit has placed men to be overseers over the flock.
[34]  This is because 1 Corinthians 12 says that gifts are not appointed by men and are not obtained according to human will; they are distributed to all respectively even as He purposes v. 11 . Pastoring is a gift of the Holy Spirit and is given to the church by God through the Spirit.
[35]  Answer: No. Elders cannot be elected, because they are appointed by the apostles.
[36]  If someone asks if we are the church on Hardoon Road, you should say no. We should not admit that we are the church in Shanghai, because besides us there are the Shou-jin Chapel, the Mu-re Chapel, the Chin-lin Chapel, etc. There are many saved ones who are not meeting with us.
[37]  If others ask us what we are, we have to answer that we are not the church; we are not the church in Shanghai.
[38]  Question: Will God take back the gifts at times?
[39]  We can have three different attitudes toward God's gifts: 1 we can misuse them, like the Corinthians; 2 we can bury them, like the one in Matthew 25; and 3 God can stop the gifts.
[40]  In the church there should not only be responsible ones like the elders, but the church should also have serving ones like the deacons.
[41]  The church needs men who give proposals and who manage and oversee the brothers, like the elders.
[42]  CHAPTER TWO THE PRACTICE OF FELLOWSHIP THERE BEING ONLY ONE CHURCH
[43]  The Bible says that there is only one church.
[44]  The church which Paul was in is the same church that we are in. The church that we are in is the same church that the apostle John, Martin Luther, John Calvin, and all regenerated persons are in. The church in the Bible is not separated by time, locality, or race.
[45]  Since Ephesians mentions one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God, why does the Bible mention churches also?
[46]  Although you are a miniature church and a small community within a certain boundary, God intends that this miniature church, this small community, express the large-scale church, the large community.
[47]  If a brother has been received into the bread-breaking meeting, he is not received into the assembly in Hangchow, Tientsin, or Soo-chow but into the churches of God, the outward house of God.
[48]  When we receive a brother in Hangchow, we are receiving him on behalf of the churches in Tientsin, Shanghai, Soo-chow, and other places.
[49]  If we intend to receive a person in Shanghai and think that the brothers in Hangchow and Peking may not receive him, we should not receive him either.
[50]  If you know that the thing you are about to do in your locality will be considered inappropriate in other localities, you must not take care of the views of the few in your locality and do it anyway.
[51]  If what we do individually cannot represent the brothers in Shanghai, we should not do it.
[52]  If a brother wants to be received into the bread-breaking meeting, we must examine him carefully because we are receiving him not only on behalf of the brothers in Shanghai, but also on behalf of the brothers meeting in Tientsin, Hangchow, Wenchow, and other places.
[53]  In practice, we have to ask: What responsibility should the brothers bear?
[54]  Every brother should bear the responsibility not only of the local assembly but of the brothers and sisters who are in fellowship with them in the whole of China.
[55]  If anyone wants to set up an assembly in a place and does not want to fellowship or communicate with other assemblies, he is not standing on the ground of the church.
[56]  In other countries, among all the so-called churches, we have not yet found an assembly that is standing on the same ground of the church as we are.
[57]  If there are such assemblies and we care only for the churches in China and refuse to communicate with these churches in foreign countries, we are wrong.
[58]  Question: Suppose a brother has a letter of recommendation from the church in Tsinan, and he comes to meet with the assembly in Shanghai.
[59]  Later, if he is excommunicated by the assembly in Shanghai, should the brothers in Tsinan be consulted before he is excommunicated?
[60]  Since the brothers in Tsinan are willing to recommend him, their decision must be right; we should believe in the words of the brothers in Tsinan absolutely and receive him initially.
[61]  But if later we deal with this person and excommunicate him, we do not have to inform the brothers in Tsinan.
[62]  Question: Some believers are critical of the truth we hold.
[63]  They cling tenaciously to their own "Bible study," yet they want to break bread with us and even preach in our bread-breaking meeting.
[64]  Answer: If there is an exclusive Bible study meeting, it is not being conducted according to the principle of the church.
[65]  If this table does not represent the Lord's table, and if you break bread just because others are breaking bread and remember the Lord just because others are remembering the Lord, what good will this bread do you?
[66]  Second Thessalonians 3:6 says, "Now we charge you, brothers, in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you keep away from every brother walking disorderly and not according to the things which were handed down to you and which you received from us."
[67]  Question: We know that when we receive a person, we have to ask him four questions: 1 Is he saved?
[68]  2 Does he have the obvious sins in 1 Corinthians 5?
[69]  If a person is saved and does not have any obvious sins that forbid him from partaking of the bread, yet he does not want to be responsible to the meeting or fellowship with the brothers, and instead wants to control us, what should we do?
[70]  First, we have to discern that this Body is the Body of the Lord Jesus and that when we break bread, we are eating and drinking for the remembrance of the Lord.
[71]  When we gather together on the Lord's Day evening to break bread, we should realize not only that the ones who are breaking bread together are the Body of Christ, but that all those who are redeemed by the precious blood of the Lord are the Body of Christ.
[72]  Question: What kind of oil should we use for the anointing, and where should we apply the oil?
[73]  But if one does not have olive oil, he can use any kind of oil.
[74]  Question: How should one deal with a believer who has disturbed the meeting and been stopped by the elders but does not listen, but who has not committed the sins of 1 Corinthians 5?
[75]  If a few responsible brothers would deal with such matters in one accord and in a sober way, many tragic, serious, and dangerous things can happen because God will use His appointed authority to judge.
[76]  Answer: If you go to a new place and find an assembly in which baptism, the breaking of bread, the way of meeting, the place given to woman, and the appointment of elders and deacons are all done according to the Bible and which is the same as we are, you must not rashly join their table and their fellowship.
[77]  We are closed because we cannot go to others for fellowship or the breaking of bread, as long as they are not standing on the ground of the church, no matter how scriptural in form their meeting may be.
[78]  If there are brothers who are not in a sect in one place who do not fellowship with those who are not in a sect in another place, they are the same as the denominations and not standing on the ground of the church.
[79]  There are several kinds of meetings, but we have to pay attention to two things with every meeting:
[80]  Although we can learn to remember the Lord by following the leading of the Spirit and start the meeting for the remembrance of the Lord in different ways, sometimes with His suffering, sometimes with the forgiveness of sins, and sometimes with the Lord's glory, a person who is late to the meeting will not know how the meeting has begun, and his prayer and hymn selection will not be in line with the meeting.
[81]  The brothers and sisters in Shanghai used to have a Bible study meeting.
[82]  This kind of Bible study meeting is not for only one person to speak; it is for the brothers to study the Word together before God.
[83]  Every time we come to the meeting, we have to remember that we are here to be a servant to the brothers and sisters; we are here to serve the brothers and sisters and not just to listen to a message.
[84]  The question is whether or not you should go to the meeting to strengthen the hand of the brothers so that the brothers will not have to fight alone.
[85]  The number attending our prayer meeting is not very many.
[86]  Of course, we have to do our best to forgive the brothers and sisters.
[87]  But if we want to accomplish anything, and if we want to have the maximum power, the prayer meeting is where we can receive considerable help.
[88]  Since Shanghai is so large, the brothers and sisters are all scattered, and there is little fellowship between them.
[89]  Question: What does the meeting in 1 Corinthians 14 refer to?
[90]  Question: Should we stand up, sit down, or kneel down when we pray?
[91]  If we do not kneel down when we pray, does this mean that we are being disrespectful?
[92]  The reason we do not kneel down is that the place is too small and would present a problem if we all knelt down.
[93]  But this does not mean that God will not hear us if our brothers pray with their heads covered and our sisters pray with their heads uncovered.
[94]  Tonight we will discuss the mutual relationship between the meeting in Gordon Lane and that in Wen-teh Lane.
[95]  In other words, we will speak on the boundary of the local church or the extent of the border of the local church.
[96]  Before we speak on this matter, there are a few things which we need to explain to the brothers from out of town.
[97]  God dislikes the fact that man can be misled to think that there must be centers on earth.
[98]  Therefore, He put Jerusalem aside and made Antioch the place from which the apostles set off for their work Acts 13 .
[99]  This avoided the misunderstanding that the church in Jerusalem was the mother church, the headquarters church, and that all the other churches were subordinate churches and branch churches.
[100]  Hence, the maximum reach of a local church is the city; no boundary can be larger than the city.
[101]  In the Bible we cannot find a church that rules over one province or county.
[102]  We have seen that the Bible takes a city or a village as the unit for an assembly.
[103]  In Shanghai, we now have a meeting in Wen-teh Lane and another in Gordon Lane.
[104]  This designation does not mean that the brothers and sisters residing to the north of the Soochow River cannot meet in Wen-teh Lane or that the brothers and sisters residing to the south of the Soochow River cannot meet in Gordon Lane.
[105]  Question: Paul imparted gifts to Timothy through the laying on of hands 2 Tim 1:6 .
[106]  Does this not mean that gifts come from the laying on of hands?
[107]  Concerning the matter of receiving, I have to mention a few things.
[108]  Through these messages we hope that God's children will learn to pray with His eternal purpose as the center and learn to carry out the responsibility and authority God has given the church to withstand Satan's attack against prayer.
[109]  "Moreover if your brother sins against you, go, reprove him between you and him alone.
[110]  If he hears you, you have gained your brother.
[111]  But if he does not hear you, take with you one or two more, that by the mouth of two or three witnesses every word may be established.
[112]  And if he refuses to hear them, tell it to the church; and if he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector.
[113]  Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven.
[114]  Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter for which they ask, it will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens.
[115]  Some may ask why God would want the earth to control heaven.
[116]  If we want to understand this, we have to remember that our God is limited by time.
[117]  No, the church is a group of people who have been redeemed by the blood, who have been regenerated by the Holy Spirit, who have committed themselves to God's hand, and who are willing to take God's will, do His will, and stand for God on earth for the sake of maintaining His testimony.
[118]  Yet God does not act independently; He will not do anything by Himself.
[119]  Even though God has a will, He wants the free will on earth to echo His will before He does anything.
[120]  If there is only a will in heaven, God will not move.
[121]  This does not mean that we should not preach the gospel; it means that the ministry of the church is not merely the preaching of the gospel.
[122]  We have seen that the church should bind what God wants to bind and loose what God wants to loose.
[123]  The Lord tells us in verse 19, "Again, truly I say to you that if two of you are in harmony on earth concerning any matter, any matter that they ask will be done for them from My Father who is in the heavens" alternate translation .
[124]  The ministry of the church is the ministry of the Body of Christ, and the ministry of the Body of Christ is prayer.
[125]  This prayer is not just for spiritual edification and personal needs but for "heaven."
[126]  This prayer, for example, tells others that a person has lost his fellowship with God, that he has not listened to the reproof of one brother or even two or three brothers, and that he does not take the judgment of the church.
[127]  But He will not do this immediately; He has to wait for the church to do it first.
[128]  God has to wait for the church to judge this brother as a Gentile and a tax collector in its prayer before He will do the same thing in heaven.
[129]  If the church takes up this responsibility to pray, it will see that from that day forward his life and spiritual walk will dry up.
[130]  Brothers and sisters, when we truly stand on the ground of the church and take up the responsibility of such a ministry of prayer before God, we will see God's will carried out in the church where we are.
[131]  If we know the Body of Christ and stand on the proper ground of this Body to deny the flesh, if we do not ask things for ourselves but ask for God's will to be done on earth, we will see that our prayer is in harmony.
[132]  In verse 20 the Lord says, "For where there are two or three gathered into My name, there am I in their midst."
[133]  If you want something, not because you want it but because the Lord wants it, and if you reject something, not because you reject it, but because the Lord rejects it, there will be harmony.
[134]  But you, when you pray, enter into your private room, and shut your door and pray to your Father who is in secret; and your Father who sees in secret will repay you.
[135]  The Lord taught us not only to shut ourselves up in secret when we pray; He also taught us not to "babble empty words as the Gentiles do; for they suppose that in their multiplicity of words they will be heard."
[136]  God has an expectation that we all pray for His name to be sanctified by men.
[137]  When a man takes the name of God in vain, God does not show His wrath by striking him with thunder.
[138]  Prayer means that God wants to do something, yet He will not do it Himself; He will wait for man on earth to pray about it before He does it.
[139]  The reason that we need to pray is because God will not do anything by Himself; He has to wait for man to pray before He works.
[140]  But the Bible shows us that God first has a will and wants to do something, next He shows us His will, and then we speak out with our mouth the will that we have come to understand.
[141]  The second section is on three things that one prays for oneself.
[142]  When some read this, they do not understand why the Lord turns suddenly from God's name, His kingdom, and His will to our daily bread.
[143]  The Lord wants us to ask God for our bread day by day because He wants us to learn to look to the Father day by day; He wants us to exercise our faith day by day.
[144]  If there is something which you should do to a brother or a sister or if there is something you should say to them and you have not done it, you may not have sinned, but you have incurred a debt.
[145]  On the one hand, when we live for God on earth and have a strong desire to be for His name, His kingdom, and His will, we have material needs; we need to ask for our daily bread.
[146]  We must ask the Lord to not bring us into any temptation, not allowing us to encounter anyone that we should not encounter nor to come across anything that we should not come across.
[147]  Brothers and sisters, we have to pray for God to protect us so that our daily bread is provided, our conscience is clean, and we do not face temptation.
[148]  Not only do we have to ask God not to bring us into temptation, but we also have to ask Him to "deliver us from the evil one."
[149]  We pray that the Lord would deliver us from the evil one because the kingdom is the Father's and not Satan's, because the power is the Father's and not Satan's, and because the glory is the Father's and not Satan's. This is the main point: since the kingdom belongs to the Father, we should not fall into the hand of Satan; since the power belongs to the Father, we should not fall into the hand of Satan; and since the glory belongs to the Father, we should not fall into the hand of Satan.
[150]  After the Lord finished His teaching on prayer, He went on to say, "For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also; but if you do not forgive men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses."
[151]  This is the Lord's interpretation of verse 12, which says, "Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors."
[152]  If we have no intention of behaving like the church and if we want to each take our own way as soon as we disagree with a single word, we do not need to forgive one another.
[153]  CHAPTER THREE IN THE NAME OF THE LORD JESUS
[154]  No one on earth can be saved without the name of the Lord Jesus, and no one can be useful in the hand of God without knowing the name of the Lord Jesus.
[155]  Philippians 2:10-11 says, "That in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are in heaven and on earth and under the earth, and every tongue should openly confess that Jesus Christ is Lord to the glory of God the Father."
[156]  If we read God's Word carefully and if we pursue the spiritual pathway, we may often say that we do things in the name of the Lord Jesus or that we do things in the name of Jesus Christ, but actually we do not know what it is to be in this name.
[157]  Why do we say that God has committed the name of Jesus to us?
[158]  God commissions us to preach the gospel; He commissions us to do a certain work, and He commissions us to go to a certain place and speak for Him.
[159]  All these are what God has commissioned us to do.
[160]  Being in the name of the Lord Jesus means that God has committed His Son to us.
[161]  God is not committing us to do a work; He has committed His Son to us.
[162]  We see in the Bible one example of acting in the name of the Lord.
[163]  When the archangel Michael argued with the devil over the body of Moses, did he say, "I rebuke you" or "May the Lord rebuke you"?
[164]  Doing things in the name of the Lord Jesus means that we use His name as we use our own name.
[165]  If we are not standing on the ground of baptism, we cannot use His name, because the cross will not have a free way in us, and the Lord Jesus will not have any effect on us; we cannot use the name.
[166]  Luke 24:47 says, "And that repentance for forgiveness of sins would be proclaimed in His name to all the nations, beginning from Jerusalem."
[167]  Acts 10:43 says, "To this One all the prophets testify that through His name everyone who believes into Him will receive forgiveness of sins."
[168]  First Corinthians 6:11 says, "And these things were some of you; but you were washed, but you were sanctified, but you were justified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God."
[169]  At that time, Peter was filled with the Holy Spirit, and he said to them, "Let it be known to you all and to all the people of Israel that in the name of Jesus Christ the Nazarene, whom you crucified and whom God has raised from the dead, in this name this man stands before you in good health."
[170]  Moreover, the Lord's name has been given to us not only to deal with men, to save men, to heal men, to have authority over the demons, and to cast them out of men.
[171]  Even more precious is the fact that the Lord's name enables us to go to the Father and speak to Him.
[172]  The Lord said, "You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I set you that you should go forth and bear fruit and that your fruit should remain, that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you" 15:16 .
[173]  The day will come when God opens our eyes to see the power in this name, the greatness in this name, and what a wonder it is that God has committed this name to us.
[174]  Brothers and sisters, since this name is placed in our hands for the purpose of dealing with men, the devil, and God, we should realize that we must live a certain kind of life before we can have the power to use this name.
[175]  May the Lord give the church abundant knowledge concerning this name so that the position, authority, and power of this name is recovered among us today and the church will receive many spiritual riches through His name.
[176]  CHAPTER FOUR THE PRAYER OF AUTHORITY Scripture Reading: Matt 18:18-19; Mark 11:23-24; Eph 1:20-22; 2:6; 6:12-13, 18-19
[177]  The Bible contains a most lofty and spiritual prayer.
[178]  We have to pay attention to Ephesians 1, 2, and 6.
[179]  Chapter six shows us what the church should do after it has acquired its position in Christ.
[180]  It is by the church having full faith, being without doubt and being clear that what we do is fully according to God's will.
[181]  Whenever we are not clear about God's will, we do not have faith.
[182]  Therefore, before we do anything, we have to be clear whether what we are about to do is according to God's will.
[183]  If we are not sure that something is God's will, we will not be sure that it can be accomplished.
[184]  If Christ had not ascended, there would be no way for us to turn.
[185]  Since He is the Head of all things on behalf of the church, all things are necessarily under the church.
[186]  Brothers and sisters, if we seek after God but do not deny our self, we do not have faith, and we do not have authority.
[187]  "By means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit and watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints" Eph 6:18 .
[188]  Despite the facts that problems are piling up and that we acknowledge with our mouth that prayer is the only way to solve them, we talk more than we pray, and we worry and resort to methods more than we pray.
[189]  If we find that our prayer life has been completely annulled or has fallen into such a confined place that we become completely helpless in living a spiritual and transcendent, overcoming life, under these circumstances, we should pray to the Lord, "Lord, while I pray, I will commit my responsibilities to You.
[190]  After we have offered to God the portion and position that He deserves and have tithed to God, we will discover that we can more effectively use the other nine-tenths of our time, more so than when we were trying to use all our time for ourselves before tithing it to the Lord.
[191]  The above words can be a great reminder and warning to us.
[192]  Brothers and sisters, we must fight for the time to pray, and we must secure a time to pray.
[193]  Satan will harass us not only through all kinds of things and outward circumstances that force us to have no time to pray, but even after we actually kneel down to pray he will also use all kinds of deception to frustrate us from prayer.
[194]  We begin to remember things that we do not need to remember, and we begin to think of things that we do not need to think about ahead of time.
[195]  Brothers and sisters, when we kneel down to pray, if we do not know what we want, how can we expect God to answer our prayer?
[196]  When we pray, there must be not only the desire but also the word to express the desire.
[197]  Sometimes in our desire we have something we want, but the more we speak the further away we seem to be from our desire.
[198]  Satan's strategy is either to hold us back so that we do not pray or push us forward while we pray so that the more we pray the more we are lost.
[199]  Therefore, when we pray we have to guard ourselves so that our words will not deviate from the center.
[200]  Satan will often accuse us after we fail a little and cause us to analyze ourselves while we pray so that we cannot open our mouth to God.
[201]  Brothers and sisters, if our prayer is to be according to God's will, we have to persist in our prayer until the end. Even when we fail, we can come before God through the blood of the Lamb; there is no need for Satan to interfere with us.
