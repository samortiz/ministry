WITHOUT LEARNING LESSONS</h2>
<p>However, it may not be beneficial for the workers who have not learned any lessons to move. It may be better for these workers to remain in their locality until they learn some lessons. We all have a portion of supply, and we have our problems. These problems hinder us from learning lessons. In some places the workers and the local saints are unable to coordinate. A worker who cannot coordinate with the local saints has not learned some lessons. Every worker must learn lessons to be able to coordinate with the saints in any locality. When a worker has problems coordinating with local saints, the difficulty in coordinating is not because of the local saints; it is because the worker has not learned some lessons.</p>
<p>In a recent training we said that the character of a worker must be as pliable as paste. Paste can be applied to any surface. It can be applied to a surface that is hollow or that protrudes. It can be applied to a surface that is rough or that is smooth. There is hardly a surface to which paste cannot be applied. Therefore, if a worker is not able to coordinate with the local brothers, most likely it is because he has not learned the lessons that make his character as pliable as paste.</p>
<p>Workers who travel to a place and lord it over the saints have not learned this lesson (1 Pet. 5:3). The workers who are pliable as paste will be subject to the local brothers and willing to learn from them. If the local brothers need them to sweep the floor, they will sweep the floor. The workers should be willing to learn from the local brothers who take the lead. We first need to learn from others before we can lead others to learn from us. If we have a better way to sweep the floor, the leading brothers will notice and learn from us. However, some workers think that they are assigned to bear all the responsibility in a place. Therefore, they take over everything and assign the saints to sweep the floor, move tables, set up chairs, and do other services. It is not right to overturn everything that has been arranged by others.</p>
<p>It is also inappropriate for a worker to hold a conference simply because he knows more than the saints. Even if he truly knows something, there is no need for him to hold a conference. If there is a need to hold a conference, the local brothers should initiate it and ask the worker to help. A worker should never insist on holding a conference because he was sent by the workers to care for the church and to supply their need.</p>
<p>This has happened in the past, and it indicates that workers who have not learned some basic lessons should not go out to help the churches. Workers who have not learned these lessons are always eager to travel. They want to coordinate with saints in other places, even though they cannot coordinate with the saints in their own locality. Hence, the workers who want to go out must learn some serious lessons. In many cases, the workers who want to travel should stay in their locality, and the workers who are reluctant to travel should be sent out to supply the churches. Often, the workers who want to travel have problems in their locality; consequently, they are eager to go out. The saints are happy when these workers go out to travel. Such workers should not travel. When workers who may not want to travel are sent out, the saints miss them because these workers are always taking care of the needs of the church. Such workers truly supply the churches. This is a good lesson for us to learn.</p>
<p>A worker who cannot coordinate with the local saints should examine himself. The workers must learn this lesson. We should never blame the saints and say that they cannot coordinate with us. Rather, we should find the reason that we cannot coordinate with them. This can be compared to a child learning to write. There is no problem with the pen and the ink; the problem is that the child lacks practice and skill. Hence, when we encounter a problem, we should consider ourselves, not the saints. We must learn this lesson.</p>
<p>There are many scientific things that I do not understand, but I know and understand spiritual matters. We should be able to coordinate with anyone. As long as we learn spiritual lessons, we will be able to coordinate with any brother.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING SKILLS<br />
IN ADDITION TO LEARNING LESSONS</h2>
<p>In order to coordinate, we not only need to learn lessons; even more we need to learn skills. To learn a skill does not mean that we are political. Rather, it means that we learn to handle a situation. When we cannot coordinate with the saints, we should consider whether we should change the way that we coordinate. We need to willingly and in all sincerity seek the advice of the saints whom we are coordinating with.</p>
<p>I am the most troublesome worker. I have adjusted others frequently and pointed out their mistakes. Nevertheless, wherever I go, I can coordinate with the saints and not cause anyone to be irritated and stop serving. In order to coordinate, we must learn to accommodate others and be willing to learn from them. This requires much learning. This is a spiritual lesson in the divine life that requires much time and practice to learn.</p>
<p>In the same principle, we should never say that we cannot get through because the saints do not accept our work. We should never condemn the saints and say that they are too busy, their hearts are hardened, or they do not have a heart for the Lord. There would be no need for us to preach the gospel if the people in the world had a heart for the Lord. Neither would there be a need for us to supply the saints if every brother and sister were like the apostle Paul. The saints need us to work with them and serve them because they are busy and have a less than fervent heart for the Lord. Therefore, we should never leave a place simply because we encounter some difficulty. If we cannot get through in one way, we should find another way, and if the second way does not work, we should try a third way. We should continue trying until we get through.</p>
<p>There is no place or person that cannot be built up. Some tools can cut wood, and other tools can cut diamonds. When we were in England, we were taken to a place where diamonds are cut. Diamond is the hardest rock. It is easy to find a person who can cut glass or metal, but it is difficult to find a person who can cut a diamond. To cut a diamond requires skill; it does not depend on the diamond. Therefore, we should never say that we cannot work in a place because the saints are not good and because they reject our work. We must learn spiritual lessons and also learn skills.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_039.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_041.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Perfecting of the Saints and the Building Up of the House of God &nbsp; pg 40</div><br></body></html>
