Thinking More Highly of Yourself Than You Ought to Think Is Another Form of Pride</H2><P>Paul told us that if we desire to live the life of the Body of Christ, we must not think more highly of ourselves than we ought to think (Rom. 12:3). Never measure yourself too highly; measuring yourself lowly is safe. To think more highly of oneself than one ought to think is another form of pride.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. The Model of Christ</H2><P>Christ in His humanity humbling Himself to wash His disciples' feet (John 13:3-5) gives us a good model of how to humble ourselves for us to escape from pride.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Arguing about Who Is Greater Is an Ugly Form of Pride</H2><P>In the church, arguing about who is greater (Mark 9:34) is an ugly form of pride.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. Wanting to Be Great and Not to Be a Servant and Wanting to Be the First and Not to Be a Slave Are Also a Sign of Pride</H2><P>In His last journey into Jerusalem, the Lord explicitly told His disciples that He would suffer death and then be resurrected. However, the disciples were arguing about who was greater and no one cared for what the Lord said concerning His death and resurrection. The Lord taught them, saying, "Whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, and whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave" (Matt. 20:26-27). Wanting to be great and not to be a servant and wanting to be the first and not to be a slave are also a sign of pride.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>13. Lording It over the Members of Your Church under Your Shepherding Is a Strong Sign of Your Pride</H2><P>Lording it over the members of your church under your shepherding is a strong sign of your pride. The elders often have the problem of feeling that "I am an elder, and you all ought to listen to me." For this reason Peter spoke a strong word, "...the elders among you...nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock" (1 Pet. 5:1-3).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>14. The Apostle Paul's Model</H2><P>The apostle Paul preached not only Christ as the Lord but also himself as the believers' slave for the Lord's sake (2Cor. 4:5). He also testified that whoever was weak, he also was weak, and that to the weak he became weak that he might gain the weak (2 Cor. 11:29; 1 Cor. 9:22). Paul was humble. When someone was weak, he did not have the feeling that only he was strong and the other person was weak. He was a model of our serving the Lord and ministering to people.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> </body></html>
