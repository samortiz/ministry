   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>We should know that each of the six days is a twenty-four hour day.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the Bible a day is often used to represent a period of time, such as "the day of the Lord," etc. But the six days are not six periods.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No reader without preconceived opinions would consider these as periods of time.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whenever the Bible uses "day" to stand for a period, there is no numerical indication associated with it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If there is a number before the day, it must indicate the time of one revolution of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Furthermore, it clearly states "the evening and the morning were the first day" v. 5 . Combining evening and morning as the first day is an indication of a twenty-four hour day.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moreover, God later established a Sabbath, according to His own rest on the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Sabbath in Exodus 20 is a twenty-four hour day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If the seventh day is a twenty-four hour day, then the six preceding days must also be twenty-four hour days.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Again, if we consider these six days as six geological periods, then what corresponds to the "evenings" of these geological periods, and what corresponds to the "mornings" of these periods?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, if these six days correspond to six geological periods, there would have been no grass or trees on the earth before the third period, and there would have been no animal fossils on the earth before the sixth period.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But this is not the case, because there is no separation between animals and plants in the geological strata below the surface of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the six days were six long periods, then Adam, who was created in the sixth period, would have had to live a long time in paradise before he could have committed sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moses, who wrote the book of Genesis, had no thought of using days to represent periods.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We must not twist the Word of God to fit our own concept or to lessen people's attack.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we explain the Bible according to our own idea, we will be blamed by others and also put the Holy Scripture in jeopardy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With these proofs we must conclude that these six days were just six days and not six periods.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our God is almighty; one day is sufficient for Him to restore.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no need for six periods.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But since it pleased Him to restore the world in six days, we need to humbly observe God's work and praise His greatness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Why should we adapt ourselves to the opinion of unregenerated people?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We know that if geology is correct, the period between verse 1 and verse 2 is long enough to produce all the geological formations of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the second day God commanded again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God put air in the firmament to divide the waters which were under the firmament from the waters which were above the firmament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God separated the waters on the earth from the moisture of the atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Again, the scientists ought to praise this beautiful record.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is just the phenomenon of the expansion of the air, separating the water in the atmosphere from the water below; and yet the boundary is not immovable.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The atmosphere above us can be filled with moisture as recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This atmosphere is not a solid reservoir to reserve water in the heaven, because verse 20 mentions "fowl that may fly above the earth in the open firmament of heaven."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This open firmament is a region or sphere in which fowl could fly around.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"And God called the firmament Heaven" v. 8 . This "heaven" is different from the "heaven" in verse 1.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>"Heaven" in verse 1 denotes the whole universe with all its contents.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The "heaven" in verse 8 is the "heaven" of this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The "heaven" in verse 1 did not deteriorate; only our earth and its celestial position were changed from its original condition due to God's judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God saw His works and considered that they were good on five of the six days.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After the second day, the words "and God saw that it was good" were not mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Does the Word of God overlook this day?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No, the words which God omits are just as meaningful as the words He speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every word and every phrase of the Bible is inspired by God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This omission has something to do with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He is the ruler of the authority of the air Eph 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The demons under him are the "spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies" Eph 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God probably saw the air as the dwelling place of Satan and his demons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That is why He did not say that it was good.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Some may ask, "How could the evil spirits Eph 2:2 ascend to the air?"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have said that their prison was the deep sea which was the "deep" that covered the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>While God was separating the waters, they probably took the chance to escape out of their prison by attaching themselves to the upper waters, and thus they migrated to the heaven where their ruler stayed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is why we have records in the New Testament of evil spirits existing in heaven and working on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although they are fugitives, God has temporarily allowed them to stay there until the time for them to be thrown into the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Since the air is the headquarters of the kingdom of darkness, most of Satan's work starts from the air.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, when we come together to meet or pray, we should ask God to cleanse the atmosphere with the precious blood of the Lord, in order that we may not be oppressed by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the third day, although the water was separated, there was still water covering the whole earth and there was no dry land.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God commanded again, "Let the waters under the heaven be gathered together unto one place, and let the dry land appear" Gen 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is spoken of here matches what we have already explained.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God commanded, "Let the dry land appear," so there was land buried beneath the water for a long time which did not reappear until then.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God did not say, "Let the dry land come out of nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He simply commanded the waters to withdraw, allowing the land which was originally created by Him to reappear.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This further proves that the six-day work of God was one of restoration rather than creation.</S>
