   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE MIRACULOUS NORMALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN GOD S ECONOMY Scripture Reading: Rom 10:6-13; 8:2, 6, 9-11</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What I speak to you this morning may surprise you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, if you have some deeper knowledge of the Bible and have experience in the spiritual life, you will know that what I am transfusing into you is accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ALL THE MATTERS OF SPIRITUAL LIFE BEING NORMAL</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Let me begin with my testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I was saved when I was nineteen years old.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At that time, I was not clear regarding my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Only afterward did I know that I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At that time, I had a natural imagination within me that salvation should be an extraordinarily miraculous thing, and that some great things should happen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although I did not express it, I had the concept that some extraordinary and unusual miracle should happen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Otherwise, how could I be considered saved?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>At that time, I pursued the Lord fervently.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I read in the Bible that when the Holy Spirit came upon men, men began to speak in tongues Acts 2:4; 10:45-46; 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I then thought that if the Holy Spirit came upon me, I would also have some special manifestations.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some time later, I also read in Acts and the Epistles of Paul that the Holy Spirit wants to fill us within.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I thought that this must also be an extraordinary thing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, I spent time to pursue the matters of experiencing salvation and the filling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I pursued to the point of not sleeping or eating.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I did not sleep well, nor did I have the desire to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I wanted to know whether I had actually been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, no matter how much I tried, I did not obtain any extraordinary experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Besides this, regarding being filled by the Spirit, I also pursued in a serious manner.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I was hoping that one day some great thing would happen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But after I had passed through many experiences, I had never had anything extraordinary happen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Instead, all that happened in my spiritual experience concerned merely normal matters.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Today, over half a century has gone by.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more I have experienced, the more I feel that these matters of spiritual life, which are matters in God s New Testament economy, do not have anything that may shock people outwardly; rather, they all appear to be normal occurrences.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I first was saved, I was not clear concerning this point.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But the more I experienced, the more I felt normal.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And now, I see clearly that as far as spiritual matters are concerned, the more normal they are, the more proper and real they are.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And the more normal they are, the more rich they are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Bible there is a principle that the Lord uses the visible, tangible physical things to signify the invisible, intangible spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every good Bible student admits this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God uses the tangible physical things in the universe to signify, represent, and describe the invisible spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the past few decades, I have had several serious illnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have discovered that our body is truly an organism full of the organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you are ill, you do not depend only on taking medicine, but you must also depend on the organic function of the body itself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The human body is indeed wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is first conceived in the mother s womb; after development, the members of the body gradually become formed, and then the baby is born.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>During the development from a baby to a child, then to a young person, then to a middle-aged person, and then to an old person, many things take place.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yet these things that happen are altogether a matter of organic function.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every one of us is born with all the organic functions of our entire body; these functions are even the same in all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The organic functions of our physical life are real to us; in the same way, according to the revelation of the Bible, the life we obtained through regeneration is also real.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is not imagination or superstition.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can have this assurance, primarily not by our experience, but by the word of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I can testify to you that the most valuable and superior book in the world is this Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If there were no God, human beings absolutely would not be able to write such a book.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Throughout the generations, not one book of wisdom written by the philosophers could compare with the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All the wonderful expressions, words of wisdom, and mysterious points in the Bible adequately prove the existence of God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They also prove that the spiritual life given by God is real.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moreover, from the viewpoint of experience, I can truly testify from more than sixty-three years experience that the spiritual life of God within us is a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is not the physical life created by God, but God coming into us, born within us, to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our outward man is the God-created life; our inward man is God being our life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christianity has nearly discarded the aspect of God becoming our life within.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They have also made the matter of the Holy Spirit coming upon men and the Holy Spirit filling men a rare and strange thing.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In fact, this spiritual matter of God coming into us to be our life is a very normal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To be saved is a very normal matter.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, everyone who desires to be saved or who has been saved considers it as an extraordinary event and expects something unusual to happen to him when he is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In 1938, I was preaching the gospel in my school in my home town.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the audience was a judge who also taught classes there; he became very interested as he listened.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He came to me and said that he was willing to believe, but he did not know how to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I told him that he should simply kneel down beside his bed after he went home and pray to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After he went home, he did what I suggested.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He told me afterward that while he was praying, he was preparing for something to happen to him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although he waited quite a while, nothing happened.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He thought that if believing in Jesus could cause one to be saved, then something had to happen.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But why was nothing happening?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He was afraid that what he had done did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Because he felt that his prayer did not work, he went to bed disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The following morning, on the way to the courthouse, without any reason he suddenly sensed that the sky was beautiful, and the earth was also lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Formerly, whenever he saw a cat or a dog, he was disgusted.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But now when he saw the dogs and cats running around on the street, he instead felt very interested in them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Whatever he saw, he felt it was lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After he went into the courthouse, his colleagues saw his face overflowing with smiles and asked him whether he had made a fortune, or why he was so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He could not tell how this had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>While he was working, in his heart was happiness.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After he went home from work, it was still like that.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It was only after a few days that he realized that he was saved and that the Spirit of God had entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>At the time of his believing and prayer, nothing special had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It was in this way, however, that he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>When I was a young person, eighteen or nineteen years old, what I liked the most was to play soccer and watch the Peking opera.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Once I believed in the Lord, I did not do those two things again.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Formerly, watching the Peking opera was really enjoyable, and playing soccer was really exciting.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>But after I was saved, although no one forbade me or taught me, I spontaneously lost my taste for those things.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>At that time, what I liked the best was reading the Bible, then prayer, and also preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I remember very well that at that time I loved reading the Bible to the point that the Bible never left my hands.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When I lay in bed at night, I still would read a few more verses before turning off the lights.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>As soon as I woke up in the morning, even before I crawled out of the blankets, I took the Bible next to my pillow and began to read.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>No one had taught me; I simply loved reading the Bible, praying, and preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the past sixty years, I have experienced a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The principle is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>I have spoken all of these things with the intention of changing your natural concept that you may see that the matters of spiritual life are normal matters of spiritual life.</S>
