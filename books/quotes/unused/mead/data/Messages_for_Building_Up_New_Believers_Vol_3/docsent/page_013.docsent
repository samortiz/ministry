   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NO IDLE WORDS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Another type of words which should never come out of our mouth is idle words.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matthew 12:35-37 says, The good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For by your words you shall be justified, and by your words you shall be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Before the Lord Jesus said this, He said, Either make the tree good and its fruit good, or make the tree corrupt and its fruit corrupt; for by the fruit the tree is known v. 33 . According to the context, the fruit does not refer to one s conduct, but to one s word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that a person s words are good if that person is good, and a person s words are evil if that person is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We know a person by the words he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are some who gossip day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They tell tales all the time about others and are full of slander, railing, criticism, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Their mouths are filled with all kinds of filthy, dirty, and evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is obvious that they are corrupt trees.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The problem among God s children today is that they cannot judge others by the words they speak.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They cannot judge, because they are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord tells us that the good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The mouth speaks out of the abundance of the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By its fruit the tree is known.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If a brother spreads evil, critical, or sinful things all the time, we do not need to determine whether his words are true.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We can tell him that his act of spreading such things is itself an unclean matter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must realize that the words of God s children are the fruit of their mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>No one whose heart is holy will speak filthy things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>No one whose heart is filled with love will speak hatred.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By its fruit the tree is known.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This does not mean that we can speak anything as long as it is true and factual.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes it is not a matter of whether or not something is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Something may be a fact, a definite fact, yet it should not be a fruit of our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It may be true, but we should not utter it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not a matter of truth, but a matter of idle words.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The word may be true, but it is an idle word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have just said that our speaking must be according to facts.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, not all facts need to be spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot and we need not speak idle words.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord said, And I say to you that every idle word which men shall speak, they will render an account concerning it in the day of judgment v. 36 . Idle words from a Christian s mouth will not be spoken once but twice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whatever is spoken carelessly today will be repeated again in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It will be repeated in full, sentence by sentence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When it is repeated the second time, we will be justified or condemned based on it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We will have to render an account on the judgment day for every idle word we have spoken.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I hope that God s children will learn to fear Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should learn to reject every inaccurate word and to speak accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should never speak about things that do not concern us, and we should not say anything that reaps no benefit to others or to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One can tell how much a person has been dealt with by the Lord by the words out of his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>No one who has been disciplined by God has an undisciplined mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A person who lies or who speaks idle and careless words is of little use to God; he is good only for the day of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to learn this lesson from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who speak defiled words are defiled persons.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who speak corrupted words are corrupted in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The kind of words we speak reveals the kind of persons we are.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>By its fruit a tree is known.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By our words we are known.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is important that we pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We know a brother by the way he speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today the church is filled with lies and idle words.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How strange it is that few children of God ever condemn them!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>No one among us has the right to speak any idle words.</S>
