[1]  In this universe there is a unique person, who alone is both God and man.
[2]  Because of Him God is no longer so distant that we cannot know Him, nor so abstract that we cannot experience Him.
[3]  The eternal only begotten Son of God became the Son of Man, who died for our sins and was raised for our acceptance before God Rom 4:25 ; and in resurrection this God-man became the firstborn Son of God, making us who believe in Him His many brothers, the many sons of God.
