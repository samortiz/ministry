GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h1>

<p>This series of messages will cover first the apostles&rsquo; teaching and then the New Testament leadership.</p>
<p>Many Christians have never heard a message regarding the apostles&rsquo; teaching, and it may be that they have never even heard such terminology. Nevertheless, there is such a term in the Bible. Acts 2:42 says, &ldquo;And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.&rdquo; This verse indicates that all the three thousand who were saved on the day of Pentecost continued in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles.</p>
<p>In this verse there are two things pertaining to the apostles: the teaching and the fellowship. According to my knowledge, after the apostles, only one group of Christians has paid adequate attention to this verse. Beginning from the 1820s, the Brethren stressed the apostles&rsquo; teaching very much. John Nelson Darby and other Brethren teachers stressed that we must continue in the apostles&rsquo; teaching and in the apostles&rsquo; fellowship.</p>
<p>We must continue in these two things&mdash;in the teaching of the apostles and in the fellowship of the apostles. If we intend to continue in the fellowship of the apostles, we must first continue in the teaching of the apostles. Teaching must come first; then fellowship follows. Very few Christians are able to tell us what the apostles&rsquo; teaching and the apostles&rsquo; fellowship are. Because these two things have been altogether neglected, all of Christianity is confused and divided. Today Christianity is characterized by confusion and division.</p>
<p>If there were no constitution in the United States, there could be no proper government. The Constitution controls all the laws. No legislation can be established that is not in the realm of the Constitution, because the Constitution is the very base or realm of any law that the legislators would make. The Constitution of the United States is higher even than the president of the United States. If a president does something that is contrary to the Constitution, he will no longer be justified in remaining in office.</p>
<p>During this past year some said that the church is the church of the saints, just as a democratic country is a country of the people. However, no democratic country is a country of lawless people. Rather, a proper country is a country of people who keep the constitution and live under the constitution. Even the number one person in this country, the president, must be under the Constitution. Everyone in this country must be under the Constitution absolutely.</p>
<p>Our constitution is the apostles&rsquo; teaching. I came to this country and began my ministry in December 1962. I have been ministering and serving here for over twenty-seven years. From the first year I said that everything we do must be according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching. The apostles&rsquo; teaching is our constitution. It is sad that nearly all of Christianity does not know the apostles&rsquo; teaching or even that there is such a thing. We received much help in this regard from the Brethren, who passed on to us some basic, proper teachings that are according to the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p>
<p>In the term <em>the apostles&rsquo; teaching,</em> the word <em>apostles&rsquo;</em> is plural, but the word <em>teaching</em> is singular. The apostles&rsquo; teaching is the teaching of the apostles. It is not the teaching only of Peter, of John, or of Paul, but of others as well.</p>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching does not concern matters such as whether we should baptize people in fresh water or salt water, whether we should use wine or grape juice at the Lord&rsquo;s table, or whether the sisters should wear a head covering or not. All these minor things are not counted as the teaching of the apostles. Christians have fought over these things for centuries. Such disputes are nothing but vanity. This shows that Christians have not seen the light of the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ENTIRE SPEAKING OF GOD<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Apostles&rsquo; Speaking</h2>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching is the entire speaking of God in the New Testament. The entire New Testament is the apostles&rsquo; teaching. It is true that matters such as foot-washing and baptism by immersion are included in this book, but they are not the basic, intrinsic, central, and elementary thing.</p>
<p>In the universe there is a marvelous matter&mdash;God&rsquo;s speaking. The first marvelous thing in the universe is God Himself. What a tragedy if there were no God in the universe! However, if there is a God, yet He would not speak, we would be in misery. Without God, the universe is a tragedy, and without the speaking of God, we would be in misery. But, hallelujah, we have God, and we have God&rsquo;s speaking.</p>
<p>God has spoken, and today God still speaks. There are many matters in God&rsquo;s speaking. For instance, Hebrews 1:1-2 says, &ldquo;In many portions and in many ways, God, having spoken of old to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son, whom He appointed Heir of all things, through whom also He made the universe.&rdquo; Today God speaks to us in the Son. He does not speak to us in many portions or in many ways, or through the prophets, but in the Son. He speaks to us in one person, the Son. Darby has pointed out that in the Greek, the article in the English phrase <em>in the Son</em> is not present. A literal rendering of the Greek would read, &ldquo;God...has...spoken to us in Son.&rdquo; Darby had a marvelous realization. He said that since there is no article, it must mean that God speaks in the person of the Son. There is only one God (Isa. 45:5; 1 Cor. 8:4), and the name of our God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). This is similar to the practice in many societies of naming one person with three names, first, middle, and last. This is quite meaningful. M. R. Vincent indicated in his writing that a name always denotes a person. Thus, God&rsquo;s speaking &ldquo;in Son&rdquo; means that God speaks in the person of the Son. The New Testament is very particular. From such a passage we can realize that God&rsquo;s speaking in the New Testament is in the way of incarnation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Speaking in the Son as the Man,<br />
in the Four Gospels</h2>
<p>The incarnation is recorded in the four Gospels. The Jesus who spoke in the four Gospels was the very Son of God, and the Son of God is God Himself. Thus we can say that the Lord Jesus&rsquo; speaking was God&rsquo;s speaking in the Son as the man in the four Gospels (John 14:10; 5:24; Matt. 28:19-20). John 14:10 says, &ldquo;Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works.&rdquo; The Father and the Son are one (John 10:30). When the Son spoke, the Father was speaking. The Father spoke in the person of the Son.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Speaking in the Son as the Spirit<br />
through the Apostles, from Acts to Revelation</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s speaking did not stop in the four Gospels. He also spoke in the Son as the Spirit through the apostles, from Acts to Revelation (John 16:12-15; Rev. 2:1, 7; 1 Cor. 4:17b; 7:17b; 2 Pet. 3:15-16; Rev. 1:1-2). While God was speaking in the Son, one day the Son told His disciples, &ldquo;I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now. But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come. He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; therefore I said that He receives of Mine and shall disclose it to you&rdquo; (John 16:12-15). It is as though the Lord Jesus was saying, &ldquo;When the Spirit of reality comes, He will bring you into all the reality. Yet even He Himself will not speak anything of Himself. He will receive from Me, and then He will disclose to you whatever He receives of Me.&rdquo; This means that after the four Gospels, there would be God&rsquo;s further speaking.</p>
<p>God spoke further in the Acts, in the fourteen Epistles of the Apostle Paul, in James, in Peter&rsquo;s two Epistles, in John&rsquo;s three Epistles, in Jude, and in Revelation. All these are God&rsquo;s speaking in the Son. First, God&rsquo;s speaking is in the person of the Son. Second, God&rsquo;s speaking is in the person of the Spirit. God spoke first in the Son as the man in the four Gospels. In the Acts, in the Epistles, and in Revelation, God spoke further, in the Son as the Spirit through the apostles. In the four Gospels God did not speak &ldquo;through&rdquo; someone. But in the Acts, in the Epistles, and in Revelation, God spoke in the Son as the Spirit through the apostles. The apostles through whom God spoke in the Son as the Spirit were only a few. They were Peter, John, Paul, James, and Jude. Nearly the entire New Testament was uttered by these five persons.</p>
<p>The four Gospels were spoken by the Lord Jesus. Then in Matthew 28:20 He told His disciples that whatever He had commanded them, they were to teach to those whom they would baptize into the Triune God. Matthew 5, 6, and 7 record the so-called Sermon on the Mount. Matthew 13 records the seven parables concerning the mystery of the kingdom. Matthew 24 and 25 record the prophecies given by the Lord on the Mount of Olives. These three portions of the Gospel of Matthew are marvelous. No philosopher or great teacher can speak words of depth and wisdom like those recorded in these portions. No doubt these six chapters were taught by the apostles to the believers who came to the Lord after them. John 14, 15, 16, and 17 are profound and far beyond our understanding, yet they were spoken by the man Jesus. Jesus charged His believers to teach these portions to the ones who would follow after them. All the contents of the four Gospels must have been repeated again and again by the apostles.</p>
<p>After the Gospels we have the Acts, where Peter and Paul spoke. Then we have the fourteen Epistles spoken by Paul, the one Epistle spoken by James, the two Epistles spoken by Peter, the three Epistles spoken by John, and the one Epistle spoken by Jude. Finally, we have Revelation, which the Lord Jesus spoke as the Spirit and which was given through John. In reading Revelation carefully we can realize that this was the word spoken by the Lord as the Spirit through John, because John wrote that book. This is marvelous! In chapters two and three of Revelation there are seven epistles. At the beginning of each epistle it is the Lord Jesus who &ldquo;says.&rdquo; But at the end of each epistle we are told to &ldquo;hear what the Spirit says to the churches.&rdquo; This indicates that the Lord&rsquo;s speaking was the Spirit&rsquo;s speaking, because He is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). This speaking was written through John. All the epistles written to individual churches were also for all the churches (1 Cor. 4:17b; 7:17b; Col. 4:16). This is God&rsquo;s speaking.</p>
<p>Paul was used by the Lord in his speaking to complete the word of God, especially concerning the mystery of the Triune God (Col. 1:24-25). Paul completed the part of God&rsquo;s speaking that concerns the mystery of the Triune God, but John completed the entire speaking of God. Therefore, at the end of Revelation there is a concluding word which says that no one has the right to add anything to this book or to subtract anything from this book (Rev. 22:18-19). In the book of Revelation God&rsquo;s speaking is fully completed, fully perfected. No one can add anything to it. Joseph Smith of the Mormons claimed that he received something in addition to the Bible. Such a claim is devilish. No one can say that there is any speaking of God in addition to what is in the Bible. God&rsquo;s speaking is complete. Thus, when God speaks today, He simply repeats what He has already spoken.</p>
<p>The teaching of the apostles is the entire speaking of God in the New Testament, first in the Son as a man, then in the Son as the Spirit through the apostles. In the New Testament God cannot depart from the principle of incarnation. He must speak through man. In the four Gospels the man was Jesus. In the succeeding twenty-three books, the men were the apostles. Today we are the men. God speaks in the principle of incarnation.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY<br />
 FROM THE INCARNATION OF GOD TO<br />
THE CONSUMMATION OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching is the entire speaking of God concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy from the incarnation of God to the consummation of the New Jerusalem (Matt. 1:18-25; Rev. 21:1-3, 9-11). This speaking is not concerning baptism, head covering, foot-washing, or the Lord&rsquo;s table; it is concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Many Christians have never heard the term <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</em> The Greek word for <em>economy</em> may also be translated <em>arrangement, administration,</em> or <em>plan.</em> God has a plan, and thus, He has an arrangement. In order to carry out His plan under His arrangement, He needs an administration.</p>
<p>Every day I have a plan. I rise up early in the morning to be with the Lord. Then I eat breakfast. After breakfast I walk for about ten minutes. Then I go to do my day&rsquo;s work. I may read or answer some correspondence, or I may listen to the reading of some messages, or write some outlines, or study some verses. At 11:30 I may have an appointment. After that I have lunch. In the afternoon after a nap, I may have another appointment. Then I have dinner. After dinner I may have an evening meeting. This shows that I have a plan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Incarnation of the Triune God</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s New Testament plan is to get Himself incarnated (Luke 1:30-31, 34-35). How marvelous this is! For thousands of years God remained as the divine God, but He had a New Testament plan. The first step of His plan was to become incarnated, to get Himself mingled with man in order to enter into man. This was the procedure by which God was brought into man that He might mingle Himself with man.</p>
<p>God was born in a virgin (Matt 1:18, 20) and spent nine months in Mary&rsquo;s womb. In this way He partook of man&rsquo;s blood and flesh (Heb. 2:14a). After His birth He passed through human living (Acts 10:38; 1:21). Human living is a part of the incarnation. God became a man in order to live on this earth. He did not become a man to stay on the earth for only a few hours and then go back to the heavens. No, He stayed here for thirty-three and a half years. He spent approximately thirty years in a carpenter&rsquo;s home. Then He began to travel as a traveling preacher. That was His living. He suffered very much, and He knew the feeling of summer and of winter. He knew all the turmoils common to man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The All-inclusive Death of Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>The second step in God&rsquo;s plan is the marvelous, all-inclusive death of Jesus Christ. Such an all-inclusive death dealt with sin (2 Cor. 5:21) and with sins (1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18; 1 Cor. 15:3). It also dealt with the old man (Rom. 6:6) and the flesh (Gal. 5:24). The all-inclusive death of Christ also dealt with Satan, the serpent (John 3:14; Heb. 2:14b), and with the world (John 12:31-33, 24a), which is hanging on Satan (1 John 5:19). This death solved all the problems between man and God and accomplished God&rsquo;s eternal redemption, signified by the blood flowing out of the crucified Jesus (Heb. 9:12; John 19:34).</p>
<p>The all-inclusive death of Jesus Christ also released the divine life as the eternal life, signified by the water flowing out of the crucified Christ (John 19:34). The all-inclusive death of Christ is our death and is our history, because we are in Him. How marvelous is His death!</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Resurrection of Jesus Christ</h2>
<p>After His all-inclusive death, the Lord Jesus resurrected (Matt. 16:21b; Acts 2:24; 3:15; 5:30). The resurrection of Jesus Christ testifies that God is satisfied with His death for us and that we are justified by God in Him and with Him (Rom. 4:25b). Our being justified in Him is the objective justification, and our being justified with Him is the subjective justification. Christ now lives with us, and we live with Christ. Thus we live a life that enables us to be justified subjectively.</p>
<p>In His resurrection Jesus the man was begotten as the Son of God (Acts 13:33; Rom. 1:4). The resurrection of Jesus Christ was Christ&rsquo;s birth. Jesus the man was born as the Son of God. The resurrection of Christ also imparted the divine life into the believers of Jesus Christ and begot them as the many sons of God (1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 8:29; John 12:24b).</p>
<p>The resurrection of Jesus Christ also made Him the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Finally, this resurrection consummated the Triune God and made the Spirit of God the ultimate consummation of the Triune God as the Spirit (Matt. 28:19; John 7:39; Rev. 22:17). Before His incarnation the Triune God as the divine person did not have the human nature. Thus, we may say that He was perfect but not completed. He was short of the human nature. Through incarnation He obtained the human nature; yet He was still short of something in that He had never entered into death. Even after He died on the cross, the Triune God was still short of something because He had not yet entered into resurrection. In resurrection the consummation of the Triune God was completed. It was not until this consummation of the Triune God in resurrection that the Triune God&rsquo;s title &ldquo;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&rdquo; was mentioned. After His resurrection the Lord Jesus met the disciples on a mountain in Galilee (Matt. 28:16), and He told them to go and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19).</p>
<p>The Triune God has now been completed; He has now been consummated. Christ&rsquo;s resurrection was the consummating of the Triune God. The Spirit of God is now released, and the Spirit of God is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God as the Spirit. The title &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; is simple, but the significance of this title is not simple. The Spirit is the processed Triune God. John 7:39 says, &ldquo;But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.&rdquo; Jesus was glorified in His resurrection. After He was glorified, the Spirit was there. In the last chapter of the last book of the New Testament, the title &ldquo;the Spirit&rdquo; is used (Rev. 22:17). In such a title no reference is made to God, to Christ, to the Son, or to the Father. The Spirit is the consummated, processed Triune God. This One is the Bridegroom. Our Bridegroom is a marvelous person&mdash;the Triune God, processed and ultimately consummated as the Spirit. In the Spirit is the Father, the Son, the human nature, the all-inclusive death, and the resurrection. Everything is in the Spirit. The Spirit is the Bridegroom, and the regenerated, sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified tripartite man is the bride. At the end of the Bible there is a wonderful couple who constitute a wonderful story of the Bridegroom with the bride. Still, with Christ&rsquo;s resurrection God&rsquo;s plan was not yet finished.</p><h2 class="head2">The Ascension of Christ</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Secret Part</h2>
<p>The final part of God&rsquo;s plan is the ascension of Christ. The New Testament reveals that Christ&rsquo;s ascension had two parts, the secret part and the open part. Most readers of the Scriptures have not realized that there was a secret part to Christ&rsquo;s ascension. This secret part took place early in the morning on the day of resurrection. On that morning the resurrected Christ did not see anyone but Mary. After Mary realized who He was, she tried to touch Him, but He would not allow her to do so because He had not yet ascended to the Father (John 20:17). Later He came back to His disciples and offered Himself to be touched by them (John 20:27). Before His coming beck to the disciples, He did not allow anyone to touch Him, because the freshness of His resurrection should be presented to the Father for the Father&rsquo;s satisfaction, that God might taste His freshness in resurrection. This was typified by the firstfruit of the harvest (Lev. 23:10-11).</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Open Part</h2>
<p>There was also an open part to Christ&rsquo;s ascension. A number of the Lord&rsquo;s disciples saw His open ascension. At that time the angels came to declare that Christ would come back in the same way as they saw Him ascend to the heavens (Acts 1:9-11). The open part of Christ&rsquo;s ascension was for Christ to be crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 2:7), to be made both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36), to be made a Leader and Savior (Acts 5:31), and to be made Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22). Such an ascension is the consummation of Christ as the Savior. A little man, a Nazarene, was made the Lord of all and the Christ, the Accomplisher of God&rsquo;s economy. Christ was made the top Leader among all the leaders so that He also could be a Savior. If He were not a leader, He would not have the capacity to save us. As a leader, He has every kind of capacity to be our Savior.</p>
<p>If the Lord needed a war between America and Russia in order that one hundred people may be saved, the Lord could arrange a war just for the salvation of those one hundred chosen people. When I was a young person, my mother had a very close relationship with the missionaries. Through her I came to know quite a lot about America. I loved America, and I thought about it frequently. But I never had the thought that I would come to America. Rather, during the Second World War, I thought that after the war China would be freed, and that it would be helped by the United States to build up a great democratic republic that would match the United States in order to secure the Pacific. Having such a view, my thought was to develop Inner Mongolia. However, eventually I came to the United States. My coming to this country was accomplished through the Second World War. If there had been no Second World War, I could never have come here. This is not a small thing. Many Chinese people of high quality have come to America because of that war. This shows that the Lord Jesus is the One who was managing that war.</p>
<p>Each day I wait with anticipation for the newspaper. Recent political changes in Russia indicate that the Soviet Union is becoming a democratic country. I am waiting to see whether Red China might also become democratic before long. The great image in the prophecy in Daniel chapter two has a head of gold, breasts and arms of silver, an abdomen of brass, and two legs of iron. The feet of that image are partly of iron and partly of clay (Dan. 2:32-33), that is, of iron mixed with clay. When the Communist Party was the only party governing Russia, all the &ldquo;clay&rdquo; was annulled. Now the clay has risen up to say something. This helps us to see the fulfillment of the prophecy in Daniel 2. According to that prophecy, the Lord Jesus will come back as a stone hewn not by man&rsquo;s hands but by God. This stone will smash the feet of the great image, on the ten toes of clay mixed with iron (Dan. 2:34). Without the events of this previous year, the prophecy in Daniel 2 could not be fulfilled. Hallelujah, Christ is the Leader who manages all things!</p>
<p>Christ is also the Savior. To become the Savior He accomplished everything. He passed through death, entered into resurrection, and ascended to the heavens. He was glorified; He was crowned with glory and honor. He was made the Lord and Christ and was also made the Leader and Savior. Furthermore, He was made Head over all things to the church. Now He is fully consummated as the Savior, the One who is able to save (Heb. 7:25). Christ is also omnipresent. He is the life-giving Spirit. Like the air that surrounds the globe, He is waiting for people to believe in Him and to receive Him.</p>
<p>The first four basic steps of God&rsquo;s plan include incarnation, the all-inclusive death of Jesus Christ, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the ascension of Christ. The Triune God has been completed, and our Savior has been consummated. These are the things that the apostles&rsquo; teaching covers. We need to learn to know all these things. The first step in God&rsquo;s plan is the incarnation of the Triune God. The incarnation of the Triune God was God&rsquo;s being born in a virgin. Matthew 1:20 tells us that that which was born in Mary was begotten of the Holy Spirit. God was born in a virgin, and He stayed there for nine months. This God partook of man&rsquo;s blood and flesh. We may not like blood and flesh, but God desired to partake of man&rsquo;s blood and flesh so that He could be the same as we are. He became a man to bring God into man. Before the incarnation, God was God and man was man. But through incarnation, God entered into man that God may mingle Himself with man. The result of this mingling was a God-man; God and man became one. Then He passed through human living. During Jesus&rsquo; years, there was a man who was God living on this earth.</p>
<p>We need to go around the globe to teach all these things. We should not teach concerning the kind of water in which people should be baptized, or concerning the use of grape juice or wine at the Lord&rsquo;s table. We should learn all the main things contained in the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 2:1-4, 17a, 18a, 33; 1:5b, 8a; 10:44-46; 11:15-16; 1 Cor. 12:13; Acts 10:47-48; 2:38, 41; 16:33; 19:5; Matt. 28:19; Gal. 3:27-28; Eph. 1:23; 5:23b; Rev. 19:7, 9; John 3:29-30; Gen. 2:20b-23; Eph. 5:24-25, 31-32; Rev. 21:2, 9-10; Eph. 2:15-16; 4:22-24; Col. 3:9-11</h1>
<p>During the past twenty centuries, there have been many disputes and divisions in Christianity. These have been the result of a lack of the proper knowledge concerning the apostles&rsquo; teaching. The New Testament is a very clear book, and its entire contents are the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p>
<p>Some may argue that there are many other things in the New Testament, such as baptism. Over the centuries Christians have disputed over the kind of water&mdash;hot, cold, fresh, or salt water&mdash;in which people should be baptized. Some Christians have become preoccupied with many small details concerning baptism. For example, the Greek word for <em>baptism</em> indicates that baptism should be by immersion, but some Christians have argued over whether a person should be immersed in the forward or backward direction. Christians have also argued over such matters as the number of times a person may be baptized. This kind of preoccupation shows that these believers do not know what the apostles&rsquo; teaching covers.</p>
<p>In the United States there is a constitution, yet not everyone is qualified to interpret it. In this country there are nine very skilled Supreme Court justices who have the responsibility of interpreting the Constitution. Our laws acknowledge that they are qualified to be the ones who interpret the Constitution. Regarding the apostles&rsquo; teaching, it seems that everyone feels qualified to interpret it. A recent publication was put out by some opposing ones indicating that God&rsquo;s economy is in opposition to deputy authority. Such a writing is a sign that there is division among us. A few brothers and sisters have caused a division in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and they are speaking and writing quite freely. Therefore, we must have a clear view of the apostles&rsquo; teaching in order to counter them with the truth.</p>
<p>We have studied the history of the Brethren, especially of those who were with John Nelson Darby. If something had happened among them like the situation we are encountering today, they would have promptly excommunicated the instigators. From our very beginning, more than sixty years ago, we realized that this was not the proper approach. Although through the years we have suffered from the dissenting and opposing ones, we would not pursue the practice of excommunication. In Romans 16:17 Paul begged us to &ldquo;keep a watchful eye on those who make divisions and causes of falling contrary to the teaching which you have learned, and turn away from them.&rdquo; Titus 3:10 says, &ldquo;A factious man after a first and second admonition refuse.&rdquo; A factious person is a sectarian person. We should warn such a person once, then a second time; if after that he does not repent, we should reject him. Rejecting any kind of division is similar to the medical practice of quarantining. To keep oneself away from anything divisive is to exercise to quarantine the divisive ones.</p>
<p>If a family member becomes very sick with a contagious disease, the family will not excommunicate that member. However, that member needs to be quarantined in order that others in the family would not become infected. The quarantining does not mean that the family no longer loves the ill member. On the contrary, this is a means of expressing love toward that member and toward all the other family members. The quarantine is exercised to keep that member safe and to keep the whole family from being contaminated with the illness.</p>
<p>Because of the present situation among us, I felt burdened to speak to the saints at the end of the 1989 winter training regarding the apostles&rsquo; teaching and the New Testament leadership. As I was speaking, I realized that those meetings were not adequate to cover these two matters; thus, we will spend time during this term of the full-time training to cover them in a more thorough way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ENTIRE SPEAKING OF GOD<br />
IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching is the entire speaking of God in the New Testament. The entire speaking of God in the New Testament concerns God&rsquo;s New Testament economy from the incarnation of God to the consummation of the New Jerusalem. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy has been unveiled to us in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY<br />
 FROM THE INCARNATION OF GOD<br />
TO THE CONSUMMATION OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</h2>
<p>The first four sections of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy are the incarnation of the Triune God, the all-inclusive death of Jesus Christ, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the ascension of Christ. The fifth section is the most complicated and the most complicating section. Many of the disputes and divisions are centered on this section.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Outpouring of the Holy Spirit<br />
for the Baptizing of All the Believers<br />
into One Body</h2>
<p>The first four sections of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy are altogether concerning Christ. Christ is God incarnated. The incarnation includes Christ&rsquo;s human living. The next three sections of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;the all-inclusive death of Jesus Christ, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, and the ascension of Christ&mdash;also concern Christ Himself. The next section, the fifth, concerns the church. In the past, many saints have declared that they are for Christ and the church. This may have become a slogan to many of us. If we say that we are for Christ and the church, we must know what Christ is, and we must know what the church is. The sixth and seventh sections of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy concern the kingdom and the New Jerusalem, respectively.</p>
<p>In this message we shall begin to consider the apostles&rsquo; teaching concerning the church. After the ascension of Christ, the Holy Spirit was poured out for the baptizing of all the believers into one Body (Acts 2:1-4, 17a, 18a, 33; 1:5b, 8a; 10:44-46; 11:15-16; 1 Cor. 12:13), making the believers the Body of Christ, having Christ as the Head (Eph. 1:22-23; 5:23b), and making them the bride of Christ (Rev. 19:7, 9) and the universal new man (Col. 3:10; Eph. 4:24).</p>
<p>The first page of the New Testament begins with the incarnation of God. The last page of Revelation is concerned with the New Jerusalem. The incarnation of God includes Christ&rsquo;s human living. Human living is a prolonged section of incarnation. After the incarnation of God are the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, the ascension of Christ, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit for the baptizing of all the believers into one Body, the church. The sixth section of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is the kingdom, and the final section is the New Jerusalem. God&rsquo;s New Testament economy consummates with the New Jerusalem. This is all that the New Testament teaches. The New Testament is the apostles&rsquo; teaching. The apostles&rsquo; teaching is the entire speaking of God in the New Testament, and this speaking concerns God&rsquo;s New Testament economy from the incarnation of the Triune God to the consummation of the New Jerusalem. Between these two ends are Christ&rsquo;s death, resurrection, and ascension, the outpouring of the Spirit, and the kingdom.</p>
<p>In the incarnation of the Triune God, God was born in a virgin (Matt. 1:18, 20) so that He could partake of man&rsquo;s blood and flesh in order to bring God into man that He might mingle Himself with man and pass through human living. This is incarnation.</p>
<p>The all-inclusive death of Christ solved all the problems between man and God and accomplished God&rsquo;s eternal redemption, signified by the blood flowing out of the crucified Jesus (Heb. 9:12; John 19:34). This all-inclusive death also released the divine life as the eternal life, signified by the water flowing out of the crucified Christ (John 19:34).</p>
<p>First, the resurrection of Christ testifies that God is satisfied with His death for us and that we are justified by God in Him and with Him (Rom. 4:25b). Second, the resurrection begot Jesus the man as the Son of God (Acts 13:33; Rom. 1:4). Third, the resurrection imparted the divine life into the believers of Jesus Christ and begot them as the many sons of God (1 Pet. 1:3; Rom. 8:29; John 12:24b). Fourth, the resurrection made Christ the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). Finally, the resurrection consummated the Triune God and made the Spirit of God the ultimate consummation of the Triune God as the Spirit (Matt. 28:19; John 7:39; Rev. 22:17).</p>
<p>The ascension of Christ had a secret part and an open part. The secret part was for Christ to be presented to God as the firstfruit of the harvest and for God to taste His freshness in resurrection (Lev. 23:10-11). The open part of the ascension was for Christ to be crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 2:7), to be made both Lord and Christ (Acts 2:36), to be made a Leader and Savior (Acts 5:31), and to be made Head over all things to the church (Eph. 1:22). This is the consummation of Christ as the Savior.</p>
<p>God was incarnated, lived on the earth, and experienced human living. He went to the cross to die an all-inclusive death, solving all the problems between man and God. He resurrected to be the life-giving Spirit and to be the firstborn Son of God, generating us to be the many sons of God. In the morning of the day of His resurrection, He ascended secretly, and forty days later He ascended openly. All the things concerning God&rsquo;s plan and redemption were fully accomplished. After such a marvelous accomplishment, there should have been a great celebration. Ephesians 4:8 gives us a hint concerning such a celebration: &ldquo;Wherefore He says, Having ascended to the height, He led captive those taken captive and gave gifts to men.&rdquo; This is a small window through which we can see a parade, a celebrating procession, celebrating Christ&rsquo;s victory, which He accomplished in His death and in His resurrection. In Christ&rsquo;s ascension He led a procession celebrating His victory.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in His ascension He reached the heavens as the consummated God. After the ascension the Triune God was altogether consummated. Before the creation of the world, in eternity past, God had only His divinity. He did not yet have the human nature or the experience of human living. He had not yet gone through an all-inclusive death. He did not yet have the element of humanity or the element of death, and although He was resurrection (John 11:25), He had never experienced resurrection. Furthermore, there had been no ascension, because there had been no descension. After Christ&rsquo;s ascension, the Triune God became full of many elements. He now has the divine element, the human element, the element of death, the element of resurrection, and the element of ascension.</p>
<p>If you compare God before His process and God after His process, you will find that there is quite a difference. Before His process He was the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God. To say that God in eternity past was &ldquo;raw&rdquo; is not heresy but the truth. God was &ldquo;raw&rdquo; because He was not yet &ldquo;cooked,&rdquo; He was not yet processed. The cooking of a raw fish adds many elements to it. For example, in Spanish cooking a number of spices might be added to the fish. Instead of going into an oven, God went into the womb of a virgin. He did not stay there for two hours; rather, He stayed there for nine months. What a long process He passed through! He lived more than thirty years on this earth. Even in His death, the process lasted six hours, from nine o&rsquo;clock in the morning to three o&rsquo;clock in the afternoon. Then He entered into resurrection, and He ascended. This was quite a procedure composed of several long processes. God is now in His ascension. He is now the consummated God. He was the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God, but after being &ldquo;cooked,&rdquo; He became the consummated God.</p>
<p>This consummated God is not divided into three separate persons. Acts 2:33 says, &ldquo;Therefore having been exalted to the right hand of God, and having received the promise of the Holy Spirit from the Father, He poured out this which you both see and hear.&rdquo; It may seem that on the day of Pentecost only the Holy Spirit was poured out, but we must not forget that Christ received the Holy Spirit from the Father. The New Testament principle is that when the Spirit comes from the Father, the Father comes with Him. If we were to be sent by the Lord Jesus to Africa, would we go alone? When the Lord sends us to knock on people&rsquo;s doors, do we go alone? Does the Lord Jesus remain in the heavens as we go out? We must believe that as we go, He goes as well. When Christ received the Holy Spirit from the Father, the Father came with the Holy Spirit. Christ poured out the Spirit with the Father.</p>
<p>When He poured out the Spirit with the Father, He did not remain in the heavens. When the Lord Jesus received the Spirit from the Father, the Father was with the Spirit. When the Lord poured out this Spirit, the Lord was with the Spirit. Thus, the Spirit, the Son, and the Father&mdash;the entire Triune God&mdash;were poured out. The Spirit poured out on the day of Pentecost was the consummated Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God.</p>
<p>When I was a young person in Christianity, I learned their theology, which taught that the Father was sitting on the throne, and the Son came down to the earth. I was taught, further, that the Father gave the Spirit to the Son and that the Spirit alone was poured out, the Father remaining on the throne and Christ remaining in the heavens. This is the teaching of Christianity, but it is not the teaching of the New Testament. According to the New Testament, when Christ ascended to the heavens, He received the Holy Spirit from the Father and with the Father. The Holy Spirit comes from the Father, and the Father comes with the Holy Spirit. The Father is one with the Spirit (Matt. 10:20). The Lord Jesus poured out this Spirit, who is one with the Father, in such a way that the Lord was one with the Spirit and with the Father. Eventually the One who poured out was the One who was poured out, and this One is the Triune God in His consummation. That which was poured out on the day of Pentecost was the consummated God in His consummation. He poured Himself out as the Triune God upon all His believers, including the Jews, the Gentiles, the believers in ancient times, and the believers in the present time. We all were baptized in that consummated Spirit, who is the consummation of the Triune God, and we all were baptized into one Body.</p>
<p>Acts 2:1-4 records the accomplishment of the outpouring of the Spirit: &ldquo;And when the day of Pentecost was being fulfilled, they were all together in the same place. And suddenly there came a noise out of heaven like a rushing violent wind, and it filled the whole house where they were sitting. And there appeared to them tongues as of fire, which were divided and sat on each one of them; and they were all filled with the Holy Spirit, and they began to speak in different tongues, even as the Spirit gave them to speak out.&rdquo; A few verses later, Acts explains clearly that what occurred there was definitely the outpouring of the Spirit: &ldquo;And it shall be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh&rdquo; (2:17a). The next verse continues: &ldquo;And upon My slaves, both men and women, I will pour out of My Spirit in those days&rdquo; (v. 18a). Verse 33 tells us that what was poured out was not just the Spirit alone, but the complete Triune God, the Spirit with the Father and with the Son. This is the fulfillment of Acts 1:5, where the Lord prophesied, &ldquo;You shall be baptized in the Holy Spirit not many days from now.&rdquo; Then in verse 8 the Lord said, &ldquo;But you shall receive power when the Holy Spirit has come upon you, and you shall be My witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The accomplishment of the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy took place first with the Jews on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem, and later, as revealed in Acts 10:44-46 and 11:15-17, with the Gentiles in the house of Cornelius. These passages in Acts 2 and in Acts 10 and 11 show a complete baptism, with all the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers through all the generations being baptized together into one Body. Paul confirmed this in 1 Corinthians 12:13: &ldquo;For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.&rdquo; This is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, the baptism of all the believers into one Body for the formation of the one Body.</p>
<p>The baptizing of all the believers into one Body universally is the corporate aspect of baptism. In addition to this aspect, there is an individual aspect, which is the application and realization of, and participation in, the corporate baptism (Acts 10:47-48; 2:38, 41; 16:33; 19:5; Matt. 28:19; Gal. 3:27-28). Every believer should be baptized. In Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; We must be baptized into the Triune God. To be baptized into the Triune God is to be baptized into Christ, because Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9). One cannot be baptized into Christ and say that he has not yet been baptized into the Father and the Spirit. As long as one is baptized into Christ, he is baptized into the Father and into the Spirit as well.</p>
<p>The corporate baptism of all the believers into the one Body was applied to us at the time we believed into Christ. A Jew who believes into Christ receives the application of the baptism that occurred on the day of Pentecost in Jerusalem, and a Gentile believer receives the application of the baptism that occurred in Cornelius&rsquo; house. The application of the corporate baptism is through our believing. As such, it is the realization that we have been baptized, and it becomes a participation in the corporate baptism that took place two thousand years ago.</p>
<p>Most Christians have never seen this, even though it has been in print for over nineteen hundred years. Thank the Lord that He has given us the light to see these things in these days. Approximately sixty years ago, I read some writing that said that our baptism is the application of what took place in Acts, but at that time I did not have as much comprehension of the meaning as I have today. Whenever we immerse someone, that immersion is the application and realization of what occurred two thousand years ago, and it is the participation in that corporate baptism. Hallelujah, we have been baptized in the Holy Spirit! We were baptized in the consummated Triune God two thousand years ago. Our individual baptism is the application and realization of, and participation in, that baptism. This is the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p>
<p>To insist on certain practices such as tongue-speaking is to go beyond the apostles&rsquo; teaching. Such insistence becomes a different teaching (1 Tim. 1:3) and a wind of teaching (Eph. 4:14) that blows the saints away from the Body of Christ, thus causing division.</p><h2 class="head3">To Be the Body of Christ<br />
Having Christ as the Head</h2>
<p>All the believers were baptized into one Body in order that they might be the Body of Christ having Christ as the Head (Eph. 1:23; 5:23b). The Body is the fullness of Christ, the One who fills all in all. If we care only for the Head and not for the Body, there will be no fullness. The phrase <em>the fullness of the One who fills all in all</em> indicates that Christ is universally great. His greatness has no limit, because He fills all in all.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is also the full growth, the rich surplus, of Christ. A person may have a normal-sized head and a small body, like that of a dwarf. Such a body does not have the full growth. If there is the full growth of the body, there is also a surplus. Therefore, the church as the Body of Christ is Christ&rsquo;s full growth and Christ&rsquo;s rich surplus.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is also the extension, the spread, of Christ. On one hand, Christ is like a pine tree, shooting toward the sky. He is also the vine (John 15: 1a, 5a), spreading to cover the entire earth. A number of years ago some brothers in England took me to see a large vine of their queen, and one of them asked me if I was impressed at its size. My reply to him was that that vine was not nearly the size of the true vine that is spreading all around the globe. Today Christ is extending Himself as the vine, the Body of Christ, the church, all over the earth.</p>
<p>The Body is also the continuation of Christ. Christ has not been terminated; rather, He is continuing today. The Body of Christ is the reproduction, duplication, and multiplication of Christ. Every reproduction is a duplication. As in xeroxing, every duplication becomes the reproduction or multiplication of the original, or master, copy. This is a picture of the church as the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The Body of Christ is also the expression of Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God. The body of a person is the expression of that person. Because of this, it is sometimes possible to recognize a person even though he is turned away so that his face is not visible. The Body of Christ expresses the One who is the embodiment of the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Be the Bride of Christ</h2>
<p>The church is also the bride of Christ (Rev. 19:7, 9). The bride is the increase, the enlargement, of Christ (John 3:29-30). A man who is single is not complete, because he is only half of a couple. Marriage makes a man and a woman a couple. In the eyes of God, it is not good for man to live alone (Gen. 2:18). Thus, God built a wife for man so that the couple could be complete. The first part, the man, is the source, and the second part, the woman, is the enlargement of the first part.</p>
<p>The bride of Christ is the counterpart of Christ, typified by Eve as the counterpart of Adam (Gen. 2:20b-23; Eph. 5:31-32). Eve was not created; she was a rib that was taken out of Adam. God built the rib into a woman to match the man. The man is the husband, and the woman is the counterpart of that husband. After Eve was built, she and Adam became one. The same is true of the church in relation to Christ.</p>
<p>The bride is the wife of Christ, and this wife will be consummated in the New Jerusalem (Eph. 5:24-25; Rev. 21:2, 9-10). This wife has not yet been consummated, because today the church does not include Abraham, David, or any of the other Old Testament saints. In the New Jerusalem, all the saints, including the Old Testament and the New Testament saints, become the consummated wife of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Be the Universal New Man</h2>
<p>The church is also the universal new man (Col. 3:10; Eph. 4:24). The Head of this new man is Christ, and the Body of this new man is the church. The new man is created of the Jews and the Gentiles as one Body through Christ&rsquo;s death (Eph. 2:15-16). Before Christ&rsquo;s death, there was a definite partition between the Jews and the Gentiles; but Christ died on the cross to take away the partition and put the two together as one Body. In His death and resurrection, He terminated these two parties in the old creation and germinated them in the new creation, making them not just a body but a new man. These matters are all quite meaningful, and these matters are the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:11 says, &ldquo;Where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo;<em> All...in all</em> in this verse signifies something different from <em>all in all</em> in Ephesians 1:23. In Ephesians <em>all in all</em> refers to the universe, whereas in Colossians it refers to Christ&rsquo;s Body. In Christ&rsquo;s Body there are many members, and Christ is all the members. Christ is you, and Christ is me. Christ is every member in His Body. Christ is also in us. He is in you, He is in me, and He is in every member of His Body. The entire new man is just Christ. Paul said that for him to live was Christ (Phil. 1:21).</p>
<p>The universal new man is being consummated by being renewed through the putting off of the old man and the putting on of the new man (Eph. 4:22-24; Col. 3:9-10). The new man has not yet been consummated because something of the old creation still remains in us. Therefore, we must be renewed day by day (2 Cor. 4:16) by putting off the old man and by putting on the new man. Day by day something of our old man should be put off and something of the new man should be put on. The new man has not yet been completed; it is still under the process of being renewed.</p>
<p>One of the most difficult things for us to put off is our racial character. Whether we are Japanese, Korean, Chinese, English, Dutch, or American, we all have our particular racial character. For example, the Americans are very frank. We may say that it is possible to see through to the very marrow of their bones. On the other hand, it seems as if the Chinese wear many layers of clothing so that nothing shows through. If day by day we put off the old man and put on the new man, the only character we will possess will be the character of Christ. As we are being renewed day by day, the new man is being consummated.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE OUTPOURING OF THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
FOR THE BAPTIZING<br />

<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 2:19; 1 Tim. 3:15; Heb. 3:6; 1 Pet. 4:17; 1 Cor. 3:16-17; Eph. 2:21-22; 1 Cor. 1:2; 10:32; Rom. 16:16; 1 Cor. 14:33b; Eph. 1:22; Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rom. 16:1; Rev. 1:4a, 11</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for all that You are. We thank You that You are the Lord. You are the sovereign One. Lord, we thank You for the cleansing of Your precious blood, and we thank You that we are gathered into Your name again. We believe that You are with us. Your word is here. Your Spirit is here. Thank You for all the provisions You have given us. We humble ourselves before You. Lord, we admit that we are nothing and can do nothing. We trust in Your blessing under the cleansing of Your precious blood. Lord, cleanse us again and anoint us. We desire to enjoy You as the anointing ointment. Lord, be with us in our speaking.

Amen.</p>
<p>In earlier messages on the apostles&rsquo; teaching, we have covered four main points concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy: the incarnation of the Triune God; the all-inclusive death of the incarnated Triune God, Jesus Christ; the resurrection of Christ; and the ascension of Christ. After the ascension of Christ, the outpouring of the Holy Spirit took place for the baptizing of all the believers into one Body, which is composed of many wonderful items. First, this wonderful Body is the Body of Christ. Second, it is the bride of Christ. Third, it is the universal new man. All three of these items relate to Christ. Now we will consider the church as it relates to God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Be the Household of God&mdash;the Family of God</h2>
<p>The fourth item related to the Body is that it is the household of God, the family of God (Eph. 2:19; 1 Tim. 3:15; Heb. 3:6; 1 Pet. 4:17). The household of God is the family of God. We are the household of God, God&rsquo;s family. We believers are now a divine family. Before we were saved, we were a human family, born of Adam, but now we are members of the divine family. We have a great Father, and we are His children. He considers all His children His household, His folks. We, as God&rsquo;s children, constitute His family.</p>
<p>In Greek, the same word is used to denote both <em>house</em> and <em>household</em>. In the English language also, the two words are treated as nearly the same. The Chinese language is similar in that the word for<em> home</em> also refers to a family. God&rsquo;s house and God&rsquo;s household are one entity, not two separate entities. We may think of a home as being a house with a family living in it. With God, the family is the home and the home is the family.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s dwelling place is His children, and His children not only have been born by a natural birth, but also have been reborn by the divine birth. We are born of God; we are not adopted by God. We are children born directly of God into His family. This family is a living entity and is God&rsquo;s home. God does not live in a home that is separate from His family. He lives in His children, taking them as His home yet still considering them His children. Therefore, we are both God&rsquo;s family and God&rsquo;s home. This is the one Body.</p>
<p>We were constituted to be God&rsquo;s home two thousand years ago, either at Jerusalem on the day of Pentecost in Acts 2, or at the house of Cornelius in Acts 10. This was accomplished under the outpouring of the Holy Spirit for the baptizing of all the believers into one Body, which is the household of God. We are now such a household. Though we are of different colors and races, we are folks of the same family. If this were not true, we could not call each other brother and sister. We all have been born of the one Father in a great delivery (John 16:19-22; 20:17; 1 Pet. 1:3). Paul was born in the same delivery as you and I; thus, we all are of the same family.</p>
<p>A household refers to life. Without life there could be no family. In the book of Numbers, the numbering of the children of Israel was by their families, according to their fathers&rsquo; houses (1:2; 26:2), indicating that it was according to life. In the church life our first concern is with life. The life we are concerned with is not our forefather Adam&rsquo;s life, but God&rsquo;s life, the divine life. We have been born of the divine life and are today in a divine family.</p><h2 class="head3">To Be the Temple of God,<br />
Where God as the Spirit Dwells and<br />
Where We as His People Worship God</h2>
<p>The Greek word for <em>temple</em> refers to the inner temple, not the outer temple. The temple of God is where God as the Spirit dwells and where we as His people worship Him. The temple is the place where we can render our worship to God. We must worship God in His temple. Today He is the Spirit who dwells in our spirit (John 4:24).</p>
<p>The temple is also the one Body, the church. First Corinthians 3:16 refers to a local church as God&rsquo;s temple. The very next verse (v. 17) refers to the universal church as God&rsquo;s temple. How many temples are there? In the state of California, there are more than fifty local churches. Each one of these local churches is an expression of God&rsquo;s one temple. In each of these expressions, we are being fitted together and are growing into a holy temple in the Lord (Eph. 2:21).</p>
<p>Whether universal or local, all of these temples are God&rsquo;s habitation, God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Since a habitation is a dwelling place, God can dwell in His temple and rest there. A home is a place of rest. The place where God dwells and rests is our spirit (Eph. 2:22). How marvelous our spirit is! The great God can rest in our spirit.</p>
<p>The source of these aspects of the Body is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God. In eternity past, our God was triune, but He was not yet processed. He began to be processed by being incarnated. He continued His process by being crucified on the cross. He was processed further by being resurrected from death and Hades. He completed His process in His ascension. Now He is the processed Triune God. As the processed Triune God, He poured Himself out as the Holy Spirit to baptize all His chosen ones, the believers in Christ, into one Body. This one Body is first the Body of Christ, then the bride of Christ, then the universal new man, then God&rsquo;s household or God&rsquo;s family, and then God&rsquo;s temple, which is God&rsquo;s habitation.</p>
<p>Within the tabernacle there were the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies. The ark was within the Holy of Holies. All the marvelous, divine things were wrapped up with the ark, and today the ark is within our spirit. The ark within our spirit is Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God. Our spirit is the place where He dwells, rests, and does His secret things. Many secret things are done by God in our spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Be the Church&mdash;the Called-out Assembly</h2>
<p>The church is the called-out assembly. We may say also that it is the called-out congregation. In ancient Greek society, a mayor of a certain large city would call out the people to make them a congregation that he might speak something to them. The New Testament uses the Greek word <em>ekklesia,</em> meaning <em>a called-out assembly,</em> to signify what the church is.</p>
<p>As God&rsquo;s chosen people, we were scattered among the unbelievers. One day God called each of us out. Before that time, we were not thinking about God. We might have been thinking about our future or many things other than God. God called us out of all those things. In the teaching of the New Testament, God&rsquo;s calling is a great thing. We are the called saints. In 1 Corinthians 1:2, Paul said that he wrote his letter to &ldquo;the church of God which is in Corinth...called saints.&rdquo; The called saints are the church of God. That the church is &ldquo;of God&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:2; 10:32) denotes the divine essence of the church. As the called ones, we have been gathered to be a congregation, an assembly. The church consists of the called-out and gathered ones. Many who have not yet been called cannot understand why we meet so often. They have not yet realized that to meet together is to be gathered as the called-out assembly.</p>
<p>The church, the called-out assembly, is not only of God, but also of Christ. That the church is &ldquo;of Christ&rdquo; (Rom. 16:16) denotes the church&rsquo;s element in life. The church is also &ldquo;of the saints&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:33b), denoting the human components of the church. Based on these designations of the church, it is accurate to say that God or Christ is the owner, the possessor, of the church; but to say that the saints are the owners of the church is not an adequate interpretation.</p>
<p>The expression <em>the church of God</em> denotes the essence of the church. God, the divine person, is the very intrinsic essence of the church. Every entity has an essence; it has not only a nature but an essence as well. The church&rsquo;s essence is God. At our regeneration, God was born into our being. According to our realization, we might feel that we were born of God only a short time ago. However, in the eyes of God, we were born of Him two thousand years ago (1 Pet. 1:3). When we were regenerated, the essence of God was born into us.</p>
<p>Our natural essence is not loveable. We may think that we are quite wonderful, but our natural essence is not lovely at all. We need another essence, God&rsquo;s essence, to be born into us. God&rsquo;s essence thus becomes the essence of the church. When we speak of the church, we must realize in a deeper way that the church is of God essentially. God&rsquo;s very intrinsic essence is the church&rsquo;s essence. In Revelation, the church is likened to a pure, golden lampstand (1:12). Gold symbolizes God&rsquo;s divine essence. Since the church has God&rsquo;s essence, it is pure, golden. God is the church&rsquo;s essence, and Christ is the church&rsquo;s element in life. The church is a matter of life, and life is the element of the church.</p>
<p>The church is also of the saints, denoting that the church is composed of human beings. God could never have a church composed of angels, because the angels are not qualified. The angels are God&rsquo;s servants. They are not of the same family as God, but we are. God needs human beings to constitute the church. God&rsquo;s divine essence and Christ&rsquo;s element in life need human beings. Therefore, the church must be of God as the essence, of Christ as the element in life, and of the saints as the human components. Hallelujah for such a church, for such a marvelous called-out assembly!</p>
<h2 class="head4">Two Aspects of the Church</h2>
<p>The church has two aspects. First, since it is uniquely one in the whole universe, the church is universal, comprising all the believers in Christ in all times and in all places (Eph. 1:22). The universal church comprises all God&rsquo;s redeemed saints in the New Testament age. The Old Testament saints, such as Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Moses, David, and Isaiah, were not members of the New Testament church. The New Testament church began at the outpouring of the Holy Spirit in the book of Acts. John the Baptist was not in the New Testament church. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I tell you, among those born of women, there is no one greater than John; yet he who is littler in the kingdom of God is greater than he&rdquo; (Luke 7:28). This shows that John was not a member of the New Testament church.</p>
<p>At His coming back, the Lord Jesus will close the church age, and many Jews will repent. Zechariah 12 gives us the details of their salvation. The Jews will be saved, but they will not be in the New Testament church. We are the most blessed people because we are in the most blessed age, the age of the church. This church has a universal aspect, and it includes Peter, John, Paul, and all the believers through the centuries. It includes us, and it includes those who will follow us in the future.</p>
<p>The church also has a local aspect. In each locality on the earth, there should be only one local church. The local church comprises only those believers in Christ who live in a particular locality (Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rom. 16:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; Rev. 1:4a, 11). The last point the Bible teaches us concerning the church, in Revelation, involves the local churches. Revelation, the last book of the New Testament, depicts seven churches in Asia&mdash;the church in Ephesus, the church in Smyrna, the church in Pergamos, the church in Thyatira, the church in Sardis, the church in Philadelphia, and the church in Laodicea. These were seven churches in seven cities. The local churches are the many expressions of the one universal church. In the universal existence, all the churches are one, but in the local expressions, the one universal church is expressed through and in many local churches. These are the two aspects of the church.</p>
<p>The church is the Body, constituted by the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, to be the Body of Christ, the bride of Christ, the new man, the household or family of God, the temple of God, and the church, the called-out assembly. We must see all these items in the proper interpretation of the teaching of the apostles. Once we clearly see that which is the teaching of the apostles, we can see that which is not the teaching of the apostles.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You and thank You for this blessed hour in which You have called us into Your name. What a blessing that we can be with You to seek after You through Your word! Lord, bless Your word and bless our spirit. Lord, bless our mind. We desire to hear You, to meet You, to be touched by You, and to touch You. Thank You, Lord, for Your living word. Thank You for Your presence. We enjoy it. We believe and feel assuredly that You are with us. You are with us in Your word and in our spirit. You are with us to be one spirit with us. We desire to speak You forth to others in the spirit. Thank You, Lord. Every time we speak Your word, You are speaking with us. We practice the very fact that You are one with our spirit.

Lord, at least You have gained us; we are one with You on this earth to testify of You, to tell the whole universe that God is the very God, the very Lord of the entire universe, not only in the heavens but also on earth. We are here testifying of You. O Lord Jesus! Tonight, shame the enemy; shame Satan. Lord Jesus, we accuse him before Your throne. Lord, put him to shame and release all Your riches. Amen.</p>
<p>The entire New Testament concerns God&rsquo;s New Testament economy from the incarnation of God to the consummation of the New Jerusalem. The first thing that the New Testament teaches us is the incarnation of the Triune God. The second thing is the all-inclusive death of Christ, the third is the resurrection of Christ, and the fourth is the ascension of Christ. The fifth item of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy is the outpouring of the Holy Spirit for the baptizing of all the believers into one Body. In previous messages we have covered six aspects of the one Body: the Body of Christ, the bride of Christ, the universal new man, the household, or family, of God, the temple of God, and the church, the called-out assembly. In this message we shall begin to consider an additional aspect of the one Body&mdash;the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head3">To Be the Kingdom of God<br />
and the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2>
<p>In the Bible the kingdom has many aspects. The first aspect of the kingdom is the kingdom of God, and the second is the kingdom of the heavens. Very few students of the Bible know what the difference between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens is. Mark, Luke, and John refer to the kingdom of God, whereas Matthew refers to the kingdom of the heavens. This causes many Bible students to think that the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens are identical. However, there is a great difference between the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the kingdom is a complicated matter. For example, certain portions of the New Testament indicate that even at the time of the apostles the kingdom of God was something that would come in the future (Acts 14:22b; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; 15:50); whereas other portions of the New Testament indicate that it is present now (Rom. 14:17; 1 Cor. 4:20; Col. 4:11b). Thus, it is not easy to know the truth concerning the kingdom in the Bible. According to the New Testament teaching, we must classify the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens as two different, particular matters. In this message we shall cover the kingdom of God, and in the next message we shall consider the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head4">The Kingdom of God</h2>
<h2 class="head5">The Realm of God&rsquo;s Governmental Administration,<br />
Like His Existence, from Eternity to Eternity</h2>
<p>The kingdom of God is the realm of God&rsquo;s governmental administration, which like His existence, is from eternity to eternity (Psa. 90:2; Dan. 2:44; Matt. 21:43). Psalm 90:2 says that God&rsquo;s existence is from eternity to eternity. The kingdom of God comes with God&rsquo;s existence. God&rsquo;s kingdom goes along with God&rsquo;s existence. Since God exists, His kingdom surely is present. Wherever God is, His kingdom also is there.</p>
<p>Every man has many desires and intentions. To carry them out, he needs a kingdom; that is, he needs a realm in which to carry out his intentions. When he marries, his wife becomes the first citizen in his &ldquo;kingdom.&rdquo; Later, he may have children, who also become citizens of his kingdom. When the man is away from his family, his wife and children may feel free to do as they please, but when he is at home, his presence becomes a kingdom, a ruling influence, to them. Thus, the man&rsquo;s existence is a kingdom to his family. The duration of this kingdom is the length of the man&rsquo;s life, or the duration of his existence. His existence determines the duration of his kingdom.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s existence is nearly equivalent to His kingdom. God&rsquo;s existence is from eternity to eternity; hence, His kingdom also is from eternity to eternity. The whole universe is under the government of God. This is a view of God&rsquo;s kingdom in a broad sense. Adam was in God&rsquo;s kingdom, as were Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, and the people of Israel. In Matthew 21:43 the Lord Jesus told the chief priests and the Pharisees, &ldquo;Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing the fruits of it.&rdquo; This proves that the kingdom of God was among the children of Israel in the Old Testament time. Daniel 2:44 indicates that God&rsquo;s kingdom will never be destroyed and that it will stand forever.</p><h2 class="head5">Its Section of the Divine Life<br />
in God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</h2>
<p>The kingdom of God has different sections. One section, mentioned previously, is the kingdom of God in the Old Testament age. The kingdom of God as the realm of God&rsquo;s governmental administration also has a particular section which is the kingdom of God in the New Testament age, that is, in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The section in the New Testament is different from that in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>The particular characteristic of the New Testament section is the divine life. The kingdom of God has a section of the divine life in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (Mark 1:15). The divine life was only partially revealed in the Old Testament, but the divine life is a particular characteristic of the New Testament. In Genesis 2 the divine life was revealed in a symbolic way with the tree of life (v. 9). It was not revealed as definitely in the Old Testament as it is in the New Testament. In John 10:10 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I came that they may have life.&rdquo; In Greek the word for <em>life</em> in this verse is <em>zoe,</em> referring to the eternal divine life, not <em>psuche,</em> referring to the soulish life, or <em>bios,</em> referring to the physical life. In Colossians 3:4 Paul used the expression &ldquo;Christ our life.&rdquo; We cannot find such a definite and clear expression in the Old Testament. In John 3:14-15 the Lord said, &ldquo;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that everyone who believes in Him may have eternal life.&rdquo; Again, the life referred to here is the divine life.</p>
<p>The particular characteristic of the New Testament is this divine life. This is why in John 3 the Lord Jesus told us that if we desire to enter into the New Testament section of the kingdom of God, we must be reborn, or regenerated (vv. 3, 5). Nicodemus was a leading teacher in Israel, yet he could not understand such a word spoken by the Lord. He misunderstood the Lord&rsquo;s word to mean that he had to return to his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born a second time. The Lord Jesus told him that even if he could return to his mother&rsquo;s womb, he would still be the flesh, because &ldquo;that which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo; (v. 6). The flesh and the spirit are of two different realms and of two different natures. If we desire to enter into the New Testament section of the kingdom of God, we must be born of the Spirit; we must have another life.</p>
<p>Every kingdom has its particular life. One cannot enter into a kingdom without having the life that matches that kingdom. To enter the animal kingdom, we must have the animal life, and to enter the vegetable kingdom, we must have the vegetable life. If we are not a lion, we could never be a part of the kingdom of the lions. If we desire to understand the communication among the birds, we must be born into the kingdom of birds. The only way to be a part of a particular kingdom is to be born into that kingdom. By our physical birth we were born into the kingdom of man, and by the divine birth we, as men, are born into the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>As we have seen, a particular matter in the New Testament section of the kingdom of God is the divine life, the life of God, which is God Himself to be our life. In the Old Testament, we could not see that God was life to Noah or to Abraham. But today, in the New Testament age, God is life to us. Thus, the realm of God&rsquo;s governmental administration has a section of the divine life in the New Testament economy of God. Mark 1:15 indicates that at the time the Lord Jesus lived on the earth, the kingdom of God had only drawn near. However, Matthew 21:43 indicates that the kingdom of God was already present with the children of Israel. It seems that these two verses contradict each other. Actually, they refer to two sections of the kingdom of God. In Mark 1:15 the Lord Jesus preached the gospel, saying, &ldquo;The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near.&rdquo; This indicates that while the old section of the kingdom of God was in existence, a new section was about to begin. This new section is new in the divine life. In the old section, the divine life had not yet come. However, the very content of the new section of the kingdom of God is God&rsquo;s divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head6">Of the Seed of Life Sown by Christ</h2>
<p>The new section of the kingdom of God is of the seed of life sown by Christ. Mark 4:3 says, &ldquo;The sower went out to sow.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus was the Sower, and He sowed Himself as the seed of life into Peter, John, James, and all the disciples. In verses 26-27 of the same chapter we find, &ldquo;So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth, and sleep and rise night and day, and the seed sprouts and lengthens&mdash;how, he does not know.&rdquo; The kingdom of God is like a seed that grows after it has been sown. This is something new.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, there was no regeneration. God was not a seed sown into His chosen people that this seed might grow in them. The word concerning the new section of the kingdom of God reveals that God came through incarnation to sow Himself as the seed of life into His chosen people. The seed of life is the seed of the kingdom of God. It grows up to be the kingdom of God. This does not refer to the old section of the kingdom of God. In the old section of the kingdom of God, God Himself was not there growing as the seed of life. It was in the new section of the kingdom of God that God came to sow Himself as the seed of life into His chosen people. Hallelujah, God has been sown into us!</p>
<p>The kingdom of God in the new section is God Himself as the seed of life that is sown into us and grows to be the kingdom of God. The seed of life, which is God Himself, not only produces the kingdom of God; it grows to be the kingdom of God. Just as the kingdom of lions is the lions themselves, and the kingdom of vegetables is the vegetables themselves, so the kingdom of God is God Himself growing in us. We are part of the kingdom of God because God is in us growing as the kingdom of God. If we do not walk according to God, we will not bear the appearance of the kingdom of God. Whenever we walk according to God, we bear the appearance of the kingdom of God.</p><h2 class="head6">Not with Observation</h2>
<p>In Luke 17 the Pharisees questioned the Lord Jesus as to when the kingdom of God would come. He answered them, &ldquo;The kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, Look, here! Or, There! For behold, the kingdom of God is among you&rdquo; (vv. 20-21). Since Jesus was there, God was there; and since God was there, the kingdom of God was there, for the kingdom of God is God Himself. We must know the kingdom of God in a spiritual way. The kingdom of God does not come with the observation of our physical eyes. The very Jesus who was speaking there was the kingdom of God, because He is God.</p>
<h2 class="head5">Brought in by the Gospel of God</h2>
<p>This section of the kingdom of God was brought in by the gospel of God (Mark 1:14-15; Acts 8:12). Mark 1:14-15 says, &ldquo;And after John was delivered up, Jesus came into Galilee, preaching the gospel of God, and saying, The time is fulfilled, and the kingdom of God has drawn near. Repent and believe in the gospel!&rdquo; This clearly shows that the kingdom of God was brought in by the gospel. As we preach the gospel, going to visit people by knocking on their doors, we are spreading the kingdom of God. We are bringing the kingdom of God into those homes, because our going is with the purpose of dispensing God into people. Any time we preach the gospel to people, we dispense God into them. Immediately after baptizing a certain one, we are able to declare, &ldquo;Hallelujah, the kingdom of God is here!&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head5">Taught by Christ and the Apostles<br />
for the Producing and the Establishing<br />
of the Church</h2>
<p>The kingdom of God was taught by Christ and the apostles for the producing and the establishing of the church (Acts 1:3; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 31). In the book of Acts, the word <em>kingdom</em> is used as well as the word <em>church.</em> We must not think of the kingdom of God as one thing and the church as something else. These two are actually one thing. On the one hand, the Body formed on the day of Pentecost by the outpouring of the Spirit is the church of God, and on the other hand, this church of God is also the kingdom of God. The church and the kingdom of God are one entity in two aspects. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit on the day of Pentecost did not produce two entities. The outpouring produced one Body as the Body of Christ, the bride of Christ, the new man, the family of God, the temple of God, the church, and the kingdom. These are seven aspects of the one Body.</p>
<p>The Brethren taught that since the Jewish people rejected Jesus when He brought the kingdom of God to them, the kingdom of God has been and still is suspended. Therefore, it could not now be present on the earth. They taught that the church and the kingdom are different, that the church is present but the kingdom is yet to come. This is contrary to what both the Lord Jesus (Acts 1:3) and the Apostle Paul taught. At one time Paul spent three months teaching concerning the kingdom of God (Acts 19:8). In his ministry he went about proclaiming the kingdom (Acts 20:25). In fact, the book of Acts closes with his testifying of the kingdom of God (Acts 28:23) and proclaiming the kingdom of God (Acts 28:31). In actuality, the New Testament section of the kingdom of God is just the church.</p>
<h2 class="head5">The Saints of the Churches<br />
Being the Citizens of the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>The saints of the churches are the citizens of the kingdom of God (1 Cor. 14:33b; Eph. 2:19). Ephesians 2:19 says that we all are fellow citizens of the saints. This means that all the believers, who are the members of the church, are the citizens of the kingdom of God. As citizens of the kingdom of God, we are fellow citizens with the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head5">The Life of the Kingdom of God Being<br />
the Life of the Body of Christ<br />
in the Local Expressions</h2>
<p>The life of the kingdom of God is the life of the Body of Christ in the local expressions (Rom. 14:17; Rom. 12&mdash;16). The beginning of the book of Romans depicts men as sinners (3:23). In the second part of chapter three, these sinners are redeemed (3:24), and in chapter four, these redeemed sinners are justified (4:2, 25). In chapters five, six, seven, and eight, they are wonderful persons who have the Spirit (8:9). They are those who have their daily life and even their being according to the Spirit (8:4-6, 14). Then in chapter twelve we have the Body (vv. 4-5). The Body life is described in chapters twelve through sixteen. In chapter one there are sinners, but in chapter sixteen there are the local churches. This indicates that through the redemption of Christ and through the justification by God, those who were originally sinners have become saints. In chapter twelve those who have become saints are described as the Body. The remainder of the book of Romans, chapters twelve through sixteen, gives a clear presentation of the life of the Body of Christ. In the middle of these five chapters, there is a verse, Romans 14:17, which says that the kingdom of God is not eating and drinking, but righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit. This verse is speaking of the Body life, yet this Body life is called the kingdom of God. This indicates that today&rsquo;s church life is the life of the kingdom of God. In this instance, <em>life</em> means not only the life within but also the living without. The living of the church is the living of the Body of Christ. When we say &ldquo;the life of the kingdom of God,&rdquo; we mean the living of the citizens of the kingdom of God. This living of the kingdom of God is the living of the Body of Christ in its local expressions, which are the local churches. Hence, every local church is a part of the New Testament section of the kingdom of God.</p><h2 class="head5">The Church of God Referring to<br />
the Believers&rsquo; Life and Right,<br />
and the Kingdom of God<br />
 Referring to Their Obligation and Exercise</h2>
<p>The church of God refers to the believers&rsquo; life and right (1 Cor. 1:2; 10:32). <em>Life</em> here indicates the believers&rsquo; inner life. The church is a matter of life and also a matter of right. Today the people on this earth, especially Americans, are fighting for human rights. We also have a divine right, and we need to fight for our divine right. If we have the American life, we surely have the American right. Right is based on life.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God refers to the believers&rsquo; obligation and exercise (1 Cor. 6:9-10; Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5; Acts 14:22). We may prefer to have the life and right in the church rather than the obligation and exercise in the kingdom. One may be in the church of God, but he will be excluded from the kingdom of God if he is a sinful person (1 Cor. 6:9-10; Gal. 5:21; Eph. 5:5). If we are fleshly, we can be sure that we will have no share in the kingdom of God. This means that we will have no inheritance, no participation, in the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Acts 14:22 tells us that to enter into the kingdom of God, we must pass through much tribulation. The Christian life is a life with many tribulations. Every tribulation is an exercise, a training, and a discipline. As we suffer, we sense that we are being disciplined, trained, adjusted, and corrected. We prefer to have blessings and do not like tribulations. However, mere outward blessings often are vanity; but tribulations, sufferings, and afflictions always bring us many genuine blessings.</p>
<h2 class="head5">The Realm of the Divine Life&rsquo;s<br />
Rule and Discipline</h2>
<p>The kingdom is the realm of the divine life&rsquo;s rule and discipline (1 Thes. 2:12). The new section of the kingdom of God is of the divine life in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, but the divine life is for us to be ruled, to be disciplined, and to be trained. A prince in a royal family lives a life that is always under a certain kind of rule and discipline. He must learn how to sit and how to talk with people. He must be strictly ruled, adjusted, restricted, and disciplined in everything. That means that he must be trained. If we would be kings, we must be trained and disciplined in everything. The kingdom of God with the divine life is for our training.</p>
<h2 class="head5">Regeneration Being the Initial Entrance<br />
into the Divine Realm</h2>
<p>Regeneration is the initial entrance into this divine realm. In John 3:5 the Lord Jesus told Nicodemus, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, unless a man is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Regeneration is the beginning, the initial entrance into the kingdom of God, but not the entire entrance. We are still entering into the kingdom through tribulations. Every step of our entering into the kingdom of God is a tribulation. Although we may not like to walk the way of tribulations, there is no other way for us to enter into the kingdom except by the way of being exercised, trained, and disciplined.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<h2 class="head5">The Kingdom of the Heavens</h2>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 3:2; 5:3, 10) is a very crucial item in the New Testament. This item is troublesome to Bible students. For this reason, we need to receive light so that we may see a clear vision of the things concerning God&rsquo;s mysterious economy and concerning the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens is the last item related to the Body that was constituted by the outpouring of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit as the consummated Triune God was for the baptizing of all the believers into one Body. All the believers universally, in space and in time, were baptized in this outpouring of the Spirit into one Body. This one Body comprises a number of items: the Body of Christ, the bride of Christ, the universal new man, the household of God, the temple of God, the church, and the kingdom. The first three items&mdash;the Body of Christ, the bride of Christ, and the universal new man&mdash;are related to Christ. The last four items&mdash;the household of God, the temple of God, the church, and the kingdom&mdash;are related to God.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the kingdom implies both the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens. These are not one thing but two. They are two aspects of the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head6">The Strict Section of the Kingdom of God<br />
in God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy,<br />
Including Only the Church Age and the Kingdom Age</h2>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens is the strict section of the kingdom of God (Matt 3:2, cf. Mark 1:15; Matt. 13:24, cf. Mark 4:26), while the kingdom of God is the kingdom in a broad sense. A person who visits the state of California from another country may say either that he is visiting California or that he is visiting the United States. These are not two separate places, but two ways to designate the same place. To say that we are visiting the United States is to speak in a broad sense, whereas to say that we are visiting California is to speak of the same place, but in a narrower sense, since California is a section of the United States. In the same way, the kingdom of the heavens is a section, the most crucial section, of the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>In the previous message we saw that the kingdom of God is a wide sphere and that, like God&rsquo;s existence, it is eternal. Where God&rsquo;s existence is, there His kingdom is also. God&rsquo;s kingdom was in existence long before man was created, because at that time the angels were under God&rsquo;s rule. God&rsquo;s kingdom is unlimited, but the kingdom of the heavens, comparatively speaking, is very narrow. It comprises only two ages: the church age, which began on the day of Pentecost, and the kingdom age, which will end at the close of the millennium. The church age is approximately two thousand years in length, and the kingdom age is exactly one thousand years. Together, these two ages constitute the sphere, the realm, of the kingdom of the heavens, which will last approximately three thousand years. The New Jerusalem, which will come after the millennium, is not included in the kingdom of the heavens; it is a part of the kingdom of God. Today, we are in the church age; therefore, we are in the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>The kingdom of God, being broader than the kingdom of the heavens, includes the Old Testament age. However, the kingdom of the heavens has nothing to do with the Old Testament age, since the kingdom of the heavens began on the day of Pentecost in the New Testament age and will conclude at the close of the millennium. The kingdom of the heavens is in the New Testament economy of God and includes the church age and the kingdom age. Matthew 3:2 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens has drawn near.&rdquo; This proves that even at the time of John the Baptist, the kingdom of the heavens was not yet present; it had only drawn near.</p>
<p>Mark 1:15, which says, &ldquo;The kingdom of God has drawn near,&rdquo; is nearly identical with Matthew 3:2. The latter refers to the kingdom of the heavens, whereas the former speaks of the kingdom of God. Matthew 13:24 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens was likened to a man sowing good seed in his field,&rdquo; and Mark 4:26 says, &ldquo;So is the kingdom of God, as if a man should cast seed on the earth.&rdquo; Again, the two verses are nearly the same, except that Matthew refers to the kingdom of the heavens, whereas Mark refers to the kingdom of God. This indicates that the kingdom of God and the kingdom of the heavens are two aspects of the same thing.</p><h2 class="head6">The Realm of God&rsquo;s Heavenly Rule<br />
in the New Testament Believers in Christ</h2>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens is the realm of God&rsquo;s heavenly rule in the New Testament believers in Christ (cf. Dan. 4:26). We are presently in such a realm. However, some teachers of the Bible, most notably those among the Brethren, have taught that, because the Jews rejected the kingdom when it was offered to them by the Lord Jesus, the kingdom of the heavens was suspended, and the church age came in to replace the kingdom. According to this teaching, after the church age has passed through a period of about two thousand years, the kingdom of the heavens will come down to the earth. Such a teaching regarding the kingdom is inaccurate. The kingdom of the heavens has not been suspended, and we are not waiting for the kingdom of the heavens to come. We are in the kingdom of the heavens today, and we are even part of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens has three aspects: the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, and the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. Without a proper understanding of these three aspects, we could never understand such a subject as the kingdom of the heavens in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head6">The Reality of the Kingdom of the Heavens,<br />
as Revealed by the Lord&rsquo;s Sermon on the Mount<br />
in Matthew 5&mdash;7</h2>
<h2 class="head7">The Victorious Living of the Overcoming Believers</h2>
<p>In chapters five through seven of Matthew, the Lord Jesus gave a long message to His disciples. In this long discourse, He unveiled to them that the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is the victorious living of the overcoming believers. When we rise early in the morning to have a morning revival in the holy Word with the Lord, while we are there enjoying and praising the Lord, we are a part of the heavenly kingdom. This is an aspect of our victorious living. If, on the other hand, we sleep late and do not rise up early to be with the Lord, that should be considered a defeated living, a living that is not part of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head7">A Living Surpassing That of the Law,<br />
with the Highest Standard of Ethics</h2>
<p>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is a living that surpasses that of the law, with the highest standard of ethics. Matthew 5:20-44 shows us that the standard of the Lord Jesus is much higher than that of the law. For example, the law tells us to love our neighbor (Lev. 19:18), but the Lord Jesus tells us to love our enemies as well (Matt. 5:44). This indicates that the standard of ethics in the kingdom of the heavens is much higher than that of the law.</p>
<h2 class="head7">A Living by the Divine Life<br />
Expressed in the Human Life</h2>
<p>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is a living by the divine life expressed in the human life (Matt. 5:45). The human life is not capable of living a life that matches the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. A dog cannot live the human life; only a human being can live such a life. Similarly, only the divine life can live a life that matches the reality of the kingdom of the heavens. The marvelous thing is that the living of the divine life is expressed through the human life. It is the living of a mingled life. This is proven by Matthew 5:45, which says, &ldquo;...that you may become sons of your Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo; We can live the divine life because we are children of the divine Father. We could never live such a life as children of our human father. There is a much greater capacity in the divine life than in the human life. To live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens by the capacity of the divine life, we need to exercise our spirit to praise Him, to fellowship with Him, and even to remain in Him and to abide in Him all day.</p>
<h2 class="head7">A Living That Is the Expression<br />
of the Processed Triune God Mingled with<br />
the Regenerated and Transformed Believers</h2>
<p>Such a living is the expression of the processed Triune God mingled with the regenerated and transformed believers (Matt. 5:48). During our morning revival with the Lord and in the church meetings, we all enjoy the Lord and are living in the reality of the heavenly kingdom. However, those who have experienced more of the Lord&rsquo;s transformation will be in this reality to a greater degree than those who have been saved only recently. If several pieces of cloth are put into blue dye, all the pieces will become blue, but the darkness of the blue will vary depending on the length of time each piece has been in the dye. Likewise, all believers are the same in being regenerated, but not all are the same in the degree of transformation. The process of transformation is somewhat like the procedure of dying a piece of cloth. The degree of transformation we have experienced depends on how much we have given the Lord the opportunity to mingle Himself with us. We all enjoy the same Lord, but there is a difference in our enjoyment based on the degree of our transformation.</p>
<p>Matthew 5:48 says, &ldquo;You, therefore, shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.&rdquo; In order to be perfect, we must be perfected, and the only way for us to be perfected is to be mingled with the Father. Other than the way of mingling, there is no way for us to be perfected. We may illustrate the process of being perfected by the pouring of lemon juice into a glass of tea. The more we pour lemon juice into the tea, the more the tea will be &ldquo;lemoned&rdquo;; that is, the more it will be perfected to be like the lemon juice in its color, taste, and element. Without the heavenly Father&rsquo;s mingling of Himself with us, there is no way for us to be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect.</p>
<p>The Apostle Peter was one who became perfected. On the day of Pentecost, he was not as fully perfected as he was when he wrote his two epistles, 1 Peter and 2 Peter. Between these two times, Peter&rsquo;s being perfected became very much intensified. On the day of Pentecost, Peter had not experienced much mingling, but at the time that he wrote his two epistles, his experience of the mingling had greatly increased. The same can be said of the Apostle Paul. By comparing 2 Timothy with 1 Thessalonians, it is clear that 1 Thessalonians was written by a younger apostle, and 2 Timothy by an older, more mature apostle. At the time of the writing of 2 Timothy, Paul had experienced much more mingling.</p>
<p>Matthew 5:45 indicates that we have the heavenly life because we are children of the heavenly Father. Matthew 5:48 indicates that we shall be perfect as our heavenly Father is perfect. These two verses show not only that we have the life of the heavenly Father, but also that our being becomes mingled with the heavenly Father&rsquo;s being.</p><h2 class="head7">A Living That Brings the Heavenly Rule<br />
to the Earth for the Fulfillment<br />
of God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</h2>
<p>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens is a living that brings the heavenly rule to the earth for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy (Matt. 6:10). In ancient times, the Jewish people wore a long gown with a blue band encircling the bottom, signifying that their conduct (typified by the garment) was under the rule of the heavens (signified by the band of blue) and reminding them to keep God&rsquo;s commandments (Num. 15:38-39). Today, as we live under the heavenly ruling, the heavenly rule is brought down to the earth. This rule is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens and is for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, which is to build up the organic Body of Christ. The Lord&rsquo;s goal, the Lord&rsquo;s purpose, in saving sinners, dealing with us, disciplining us, and operating in us is the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</p>
<p>In our going to visit people and baptize them, in our speaking the Lord&rsquo;s word to others, in our praying for certain ones who are on our heart, everything should be for the building up of the Body of Christ. If we are not under the heavenly rule of the kingdom of the heavens, it will be very difficult for us to have any capacity to participate in the building up of the organic Body of Christ. The more we are under the heavenly rule of the kingdom of the heavens, the more capacity we have. Then whatever we do, whatever we are, whatever we say, however we act, and wherever we go will be for the building up of the Body of Christ. This is for the purpose of fulfilling God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>The kingdom is for the church. Matthew 16:18 says, &ldquo;I will build My church,&rdquo; and verse 19 says, &ldquo;I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; One verse concerns the building up of the church, and the other verse concerns the establishing of the kingdom. If the church is not built up, there can be no establishing of the kingdom. The building up of the church is for the kingdom, and whatever the kingdom is, is for the building up of the church. In the two verses quoted above, the church and the kingdom are mentioned interchangeably, indicating that the church and the kingdom are closely related to one another. In a sense, the church is for the kingdom, and in a deeper sense, the kingdom is for the church.</p>
<p>If there is no kingdom rule in a local church, there will be no building up of the Body in that locality. If there is quarreling, debating, murmuring, and reasoning in a local church, there can be no rule of the heavens in that church. In that case, the building up of the church will be annulled. If those in that locality would live a life that brings the heavenly rule to the earth, then God&rsquo;s New Testament economy will be fulfilled.</p>
<h2 class="head7">Beginning with the Formation<br />
of the Church on the Day of Pentecost</h2>
<p>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens had its beginning with the formation of the church on the day of Pentecost (Matt. 16:18-19). Before the day of Pentecost, there was no reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head5">The Appearance of the Kingdom of the Heavens,<br />
as Revealed by the Lord&rsquo;s Parables<br />
on the Seashore in Matthew 13</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s sermon revealing the reality of the kingdom of the heavens was given on a mountain in Matthew 5&mdash;7, whereas the Lord&rsquo;s parables revealing the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens were spoken on the seashore in Matthew 13. In typology, a mountain signifies elevation, which corresponds to the heavenly nature of the kingdom, and the sea signifies the corrupted world under Satan. This indicates that the reality of the kingdom of the heavens is higher than the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head7">As the Tares (the Nominal Christians)<br />
Growing Together with the Wheat (the Real Believers)</h2>
<p>According to Matthew 13, there are three things that denote the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. The first of these is the tares, signifying the nominal Christians, growing together with the wheat, the real believers (Matt. 13:24, 30). The nominal Christians are those who have the name of a Christian but do not have the reality in life. The tares were not sown among the wheat by the Lord, but by the Lord&rsquo;s enemy, Satan (Matt. 13:25, 28). Tares bear the appearance of wheat but do not have the life of wheat. Similarly, the nominal Christians do not have the life of God. When I was young, I read an article describing the appearance of the tares. As the tares grow they appear to be identical to the wheat. They can be differentiated from the wheat only at the point that the fruit is produced. The fruit of the wheat is golden yellow, but that of the tares is black. Actually, what the tares produce is not fruit at all (Matt. 13:26). Once the fruit comes forth, it is obvious to everyone which are the wheat and which are the tares. This is why it is often difficult to discern whether a person is a nominal Christian or a real believer.</p><h2 class="head7">As the Mustard Herb<br />
Growing Abnormally into a Tree</h2>
<p>The second item in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is the mustard herb growing abnormally into a tree (Matt. 13:31-32). Mustard is an herb, not a tree. When a mustard plant grows into a tree, it becomes abnormally large. The mustard in the Lord&rsquo;s parable grew abnormally into a large tree, as indicated by the fact that birds come to roost in its branches (v. 32). In typology, the tree signifies abnormal Christianity. Nominal Christianity is abnormally large. In Luke 12:32, the Lord Jesus called the church a &ldquo;little flock.&rdquo; Comparatively speaking, the church should be much smaller than human society; yet today, approximately one-third of the people on the earth, including both the Catholics and the Protestants, call themselves Christians.</p>
<p>When the mustard herb becomes abnormally large, the branches of its tree become the roosting place for the birds. The birds signify the persons and matters that are related to Satan, the enemy who sowed the tares among the wheat (Matt. 13:25, 28). In today&rsquo;s Christianity there are many enterprises, and there are many &ldquo;birds,&rdquo; denoting Satan and all the persons and matters that belong to Satan, roosting in these enterprises.</p>
<h2 class="head7">As Leaven Taken by a Woman<br />
and Hidden in Three Measures of Meal</h2>
<p>The third item in the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens is leaven taken by a woman and hidden in three measures of meal (Matt. 13:33). Bread made without leaven is hard and is not easy to eat. Leaven makes bread easier and more pleasant to eat. This principle has been applied by the Catholic Church to many spiritual things. For example, in order to help people to know who Jesus is, Catholicism utilized a painting done in the Middle Ages by a skillful artist and called it a &ldquo;picture of Jesus.&rdquo; However, the handsome man in that painting is not the real Jesus (Isa. 53:2). That picture is devilish and idolatrous. Now, not only Catholics, but many Protestants as well, revere that picture. Such pictures are idols and are leaven.</p>
<p>Leaven signifies evil things and evil doctrines (1 Cor. 5:6, 8; Matt. 16:6, 11-12). Many evil things can be found in today&rsquo;s Christianity, especially in Catholicism. The woman in Matthew 13 signifies the Catholic Church, which has taken many pagan practices, heretical doctrines, and evil matters and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ to leaven the whole content of Christianity (Rev. 2:20, 24b). Two clear examples of such leaven are Christmas and Easter.</p>
<p>The meal in which the woman hid the leaven is the fine flour for making the meal offering (Lev. 2:1), signifying Christ as food to both God and man. Today this food has become mixed with leaven. The Catholic Church does teach something concerning Christ, but all its teachings are leavened. In a sense, there are some deeper truths in Catholicism, but every teaching has been leavened.</p>
<p>Three measures of meal is the quantity needed to make a full meal, signifying that the Catholic Church has fully leavened in a hidden way all the teachings concerning Christ. There is not one exception; baptism, the Lord&rsquo;s table, and everything concerning Christ has been leavened. Unless we have a keen discernment to see through the good outward appearance, we will not be able to detect the leaven.</p>
<h2 class="head7">This Appearance Beginning Immediately after<br />
the Formation of the Church on the Day of Pentecost</h2>
<p>The reality of the kingdom of the heavens began on the day of Pentecost with the formation of the church. The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens began immediately after the formation of the church on the day of Pentecost. Immediately after the baptism of all the believers, possibly even the next day, Satan came in to sow the tares. When farmers sow wheat, they may examine each individual grain, yet tares will still appear as the wheat grows. No one knows where the tares come from. It is unlikely that they could come from the birds or from the wind. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 13:25 and 28, the sowing of the tares is the work of the enemy, Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head6">The Manifestation of the Kingdom of the Heavens,<br />
as Revealed by the Lord&rsquo;s Prophecy<br />
on the Mount of Olives in Matthew 24&mdash;25</h2>
<p>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the last aspect of the kingdom of the heavens. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is revealed by the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy on the Mount of Olives in Matthew 24 and 25. Today, among us there is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens, but this reality is hidden. Most unbelievers do not see this reality; what they see is the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens. They see the false appearance that is today&rsquo;s Christianity.</p>
<h2 class="head7">At the Lord&rsquo;s Coming Back</h2>
<p>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will occur at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (Matt. 24:33, 39, 42-44; 25:6, 19).</p>
<h2 class="head7">Being the Reality of the Kingdom of the Heavens<br />
Manifested as the Heavenly Part of the Millennium</h2>
<p>This manifestation is the reality of the kingdom of the heavens manifested as the heavenly part of the millennium (Rev. 20:4-6). The reality of the kingdom of the heavens today will be the heavenly part of the thousand year kingdom. The thousand year kingdom will have two parts: the upper part as the heavenly part and the lower part as the earthly part. In the heavenly part will be the overcoming saints, including both those in the Old Testament, such as Abraham, and those in the New Testament.</p>
<p>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is for the overcoming saints as the kings with Christ to rule over the nations as the people and over Israel on the earth (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5a; 20:4; Matt. 19:28). At the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, all Israel will be saved (Rom. 11:25-27), but they will not be transfigured right away; they will remain in the body of flesh. However, by that time the overcoming Christians will have been transfigured to have a glorious body like Christ&rsquo;s.</p>
<p>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is also for the overcoming saints as priests to serve God and Christ (Rev. 20:6). On one hand, the overcoming saints will be kings to rule over the people. On the other hand, they will be priests to serve God and Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head7">As a Reward to All the Overcoming Saints<br />
of Both the Old Testament and the New Testament</h2>
<p>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will be a reward to all the overcoming saints of both the Old Testament and the New Testament (Matt. 24:45-47; 25:21-23; 2 Tim. 2:12a; 4:18b; 2 Pet. 1:11; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; Gal. 5:19-21; Eph. 5:4-5). To be in the kingdom of God is one thing, and to inherit the kingdom of God is another. In referring to the kingdom, 1 Corinthians 6:9-10, Galatians 5:19-21, and Ephesians 5:4-5 all use the word <em>inherit,</em> saying that those who are sinful can never inherit the kingdom of God. To inherit the kingdom of God as the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, we must pay a price. We must live a kingdom life, a higher life with a higher standard of ethics. We also must overcome all the things that are against God. Otherwise, we will have no right to inherit the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head7">Ending at the Close of the Millennium</h2>
<p>The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens will end at the close of the millennium.</p>
<p>It is worthwhile for us to study the three aspects of the kingdom of the heavens&mdash;its reality, its appearance, and its manifestation&mdash;and to remember the items that constitute each aspect.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE MINISTRY OF CHRIST<br />
IN HIS ASCENSION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Mark 16:19; Heb. 4:14a; Eph. 1:20a-23; Heb. 8:1b; Rev. 3:21b; Heb. 2:7b; Rev. 5:1, 6-7; Acts 2:36b; 10:36b; 5:31a; Heb. 4:14-15; 7:26; 8:2; Rev. 1:5a; Eph. 1:22; 5:23a; Matt. 3:16; Luke 4:18-19; Mark 16:9a, 19; Acts 2:1-4, 17, 33; Heb. 9:28b; 2 Tim. 4:1b; John 1:29; Rev. 5:5-7</h1>
<p>We have seen that the apostles&rsquo; teaching is the entire speaking of God in the New Testament. This teaching is concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy from the incarnation of God to the consummation of the New Jerusalem, and it includes the entire New Testament from Matthew to Revelation. The items of the apostles&rsquo; teaching that we have seen thus far are the incarnation of the Triune God, the all-inclusive death of Jesus Christ, the resurrection of Jesus Christ, the ascension of Christ, and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit for the baptizing of all the believers into one Body. The church is the Body of Christ, the bride of Christ, the universal new man, the household of God, the temple of God, the called-out assembly, the kingdom of God, and the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<p>There are three major items between the church and the millennium, the kingdom of a thousand years. These three major items are the ministry of Christ in His ascension, the second coming of Christ, and the rapture of the saints. We will cover these three major items before we cover the kingdom of a thousand years. The ministry of Christ in His ascension goes along with the church. Without the second coming of Christ, there cannot be the thousand-year kingdom. Without the rapture of the saints, the overcoming saints cannot enter into the reality of the heavenly part of the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium. The heavenly ministry of Christ, the second coming of Christ, and our rapture are three crucial items of the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p>
<p>Among most Christians, the general emphasis is put on the work which Christ did on earth. But who talks about the heavenly ministry of Christ? Most Christians have not heard much concerning Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry. In this message we want to see the ministry of Christ in His ascension. In particular we want to see the Christ in ascension, the offices of Christ in His ascension, and the heavenly ministry of Christ as the continuation and complement of His earthly ministry. Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry and His heavenly ministry are actually not two ministries. They are two sections of Christ&rsquo;s ministry. Christ&rsquo;s ministry comprises not only what He did on earth but also what He is doing in the heavens. He has not finished His ministry.</p>
<p>When I was a young man with the Brethren, they stressed John 19:30 where Christ said on the cross, &ldquo;It is finished!&rdquo; The Brethren said that all the work concerning our salvation was finished. It is correct to say that the first section of Christ&rsquo;s ministry is finished. Through His crucifixion He finished the work of His all-inclusive death by which He accomplished redemption. But actually our salvation is not finished yet; it is still going on. Christ&rsquo;s ministry goes on after His work in His earthly ministry. What Christ is doing in His heavenly ministry is indispensable. For more details concerning Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry, I would recommend the book which we have published entitled <em>The Heavenly Ministry of Christ.</em></p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRIST IN ASCENSION</h2>
<p>Before we see the Christ in ascension, we need to consider the striking aspects of the Christ on earth. The striking symbols of Christ&rsquo;s work on earth were the manger and the cross. The manger refers to Christ&rsquo;s incarnation, to Christ&rsquo;s first coming, and the cross refers to Christ&rsquo;s death. A king may live in a palace, but after Jesus&rsquo; birth, He was laid in a manger. The Man-Savior&rsquo;s life began with a manger in the lowest estate. His first lodging place on this earth was a manger.</p>
<p>In Christ&rsquo;s heavenly work, His ministry in ascension, the significant signs are the throne and the crown. The throne replaces the manger, and the crown replaces the cross. This is very meaningful. In the past on earth, Jesus was related to the manger and the cross. But now Christ is in the heavens. He is in ascension (Mark 16:19; Heb. 4:14a). We need to see what kind of Christ we have in the heavens, in His ascension.</p>
<p>In His ascension, Christ is seated at the right hand of God (Eph. 1:20b). He is also seated on the throne of God. Hebrews 8:1b says that Christ &ldquo;sat down on the right hand of the throne of the Majesty in the heavens.&rdquo; Christ is sitting in the heavens on the right hand of the throne. In Revelation 3:21b the Lord says, &ldquo;I also overcame and sat down with My Father on His throne.&rdquo; Christ is seated at the right hand of the throne and on the Father&rsquo;s throne.</p>
<p>In His ascension, Christ is also crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 2:7b, 9). Glory refers to a condition, a situation, and honor refers to a position. In the heavens in ascension, Christ is in a splendid situation and condition full of glory. He is also in a position full of honor. Both glory and honor are a crown to Him. The word <em>crowned</em> implies being designated. Christ was designated with glory and honor. Christ being seated at the right hand of God means that He is in a position of honor. He occupies the first place. Christ needs to be honored because He is honorable, and He needs to be praised because He is glorious. Glory is the splendor related to Jesus&rsquo; person; honor is the preciousness related to Jesus&rsquo; worth, value (1 Pet. 2:7, &ldquo;preciousness&rdquo; in Greek is the same word as &ldquo;honor&rdquo; in Heb. 2:9), and dignity which is related to His position (2 Pet. 1:17; cf. 1 Pet. 2:17; Rom. 13:7).</p>
<p>In His ascension Christ is also far above all rule, authority, power, lordship, and every name in this age and in the age to come (Eph. 1:21). Rule refers to the highest office, authority to every kind of official power (Matt. 8:9), power to the mere might of authority, and lordship to the preeminence which power establishes. Every name that is named refers not only to titles of honor, but also to everything that has a name. Christ has been seated far above everything, not only the things in this age, but also those in the coming age. This means that no one can compare with Christ. Everyone is under Him. Christ is far above presidents, kings, and queens. He is the top Ruler and the top Being in the entire universe. He is the unique Head and the unique authority. In His ascension Christ is the most glorious One, the most honorable One, the most powerful One, and the highest authority. When we call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; what is our realization concerning Him? We are short of the adequate knowledge concerning Christ. We need to see and know the Christ in ascension.</p>
<p>In His ascension He has all things subjected under His feet (Eph. 1:22a). Everything is under His feet. We have all become the members of Christ. The lowest part of Christ is His feet. Because all things are under His feet, that means all things are under us. We are not under the feet of Christ because we are members of His Body.</p>
<p>The Christ in ascension was given to be Head over all things to the church, to be the Head of His Body as the fullness of Him who fills all in all (Eph. 1:22b-23). The Body is the fullness, the full expression of Christ, the One who fills all in all. As the One who fills all in all, He is unlimited, unsearchable, and immeasurable.</p>
<p>This One has received of God the authority to administrate the entire universe (Rev. 5:1, 6-7). Christ is the real administrator of the heavens and of all the nations on earth. In Matthew 28:18 the Lord told the disciples that all authority had been given to Him in heaven and on earth. Revelation 4 and 5 show us a picture of the scene in the heavens immediately after Christ&rsquo;s ascension into the heavens. In Revelation 5 Christ as the Lamb of God was standing in the midst of the four living creatures and the elders. The One who was sitting on the throne was holding a scroll sealed with seven seals. That scroll can be likened to a &ldquo;schedule sheet&rdquo; of what will happen from the ascension of Christ to the New Jerusalem. God was sitting on the throne holding this scroll, the schedule of His administration in the entire universe. The seven seals with which the scroll is sealed are actually its contents. John saw an angel proclaiming with a loud voice, &ldquo;Who is worthy to open the scroll and to break its seals?&rdquo; (5:2). John wept because no one was found worthy to do it (vv. 3-4). Then one of the elders said to John, &ldquo;Do not weep; behold, the Lion of the tribe of Judah, the Root of David, has overcome to open the scroll and its seven seals&rdquo; (v. 5). Christ is the One who is qualified to open the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy and to carry it out. This indicates that Christ is the One who has received the very authority to administrate the entire universe.</p><h2 class="head1">THE OFFICES OF CHRIST IN HIS ASCENSION</h2>
<p>Now we want to go on to see the offices of Christ in His ascension. In His ascension He is the Christ (Acts 2:36b). He is God&rsquo;s anointed One to carry out God&rsquo;s commission, the great commission of God&rsquo;s eternal, New Testament economy. As the Christ, He has been commissioned and appointed by God to carry out God&rsquo;s eternal plan, His eternal economy. He is also the Lord (Acts 2:36b; 10:36b). As the Lord, He is the Possessor, the Owner, the One that has the power to possess all things, all matters, and all persons. Christ is the Possessor and the Owner of everything in the universe.</p>
<p>In His ascension He is the Leader, the Ruler (Acts 5:31a). The Greek word for leader also means prince, author, or originator (Acts 3:15). Christ is the Ruler as the Leader. He rules all the things on earth. Acts 5:31 indicates that Christ as the Ruler and the Leader directs the whole world situation and environment so that God&rsquo;s chosen ones can be saved one by one. He rules sovereignly over the earth with His authority that the environment might be fit for God&rsquo;s chosen people to receive His salvation (cf. Acts 17:26-27; John 17:2).</p>
<p>The Leader then becomes our Savior (Acts 5:31a). He directed us into a position to save us, and He is qualified to save us. In ascension He is not only our Savior but also our High Priest (Heb. 4:14-15; 7:26). After saving us, He is now praying for us in the heavens. Now Christ as the High Priest is taking care of us before the face of God, and He is taking care of us in our environment. He is also a Minister (Heb. 8:2). While He is praying for us and taking care of us, He is ministering Himself with all of His riches into us. In His ascension, Christ is also the Ruler of the kings of the earth (Rev. 1:5a). All of the kings are under Him. The rulers of this world are not the real rulers. Christ is the One ruling over the world. He is also the Head over all things (Eph. 1:22) and the Head of the church (Eph. 5:23a).</p>
<p>No one can compare with Christ. He is the Christ, the Lord, the Leader, the Savior, the High Priest, the Minister, the Ruler of the kings of the earth, the Head over all things, and the Head of the church. His being the Head over all things is for Him to be the Head of the church. This means that whatever He is, is for the church. We are now in the church, which is greatly blessed by having the all-inclusive Christ as its Head.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HEAVENLY MINISTRY OF CHRIST BEING<br />
THE CONTINUATION AND COMPLEMENT<br />
OF HIS EARTHLY MINISTRY</h2>
<p>The heavenly ministry of Christ is the continuation and complement of His earthly ministry. We should not think that Christ&rsquo;s ministry is finished. His ministry is still going on in the heavens. His ministry in the heavens is a continuation of the ministry He accomplished on this earth. This continuation is also the complement. Without Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry, His earthly ministry could never be complemented or completed.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s earthly ministry began from His being baptized in water and anointed with the Holy Spirit and ended in His resurrection (Matt. 3:16; Luke 4:18-19; Mark 16:9a, 19). When Christ was baptized in water, He was anointed by the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit as a dove descended upon Him. That was the anointing of God through the Holy Spirit. That inaugurated Him into His ministry. First, He was assigned and appointed by God. Then He was inaugurated at the Jordan River when He was baptized. From His being baptized to His resurrection was the period of time of His earthly ministry. The major items in the section of His earthly ministry are His human living, His crucifixion, and His resurrection.</p>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry began from His outpouring of the Holy Spirit and will end in His second appearing on the earth (Acts 2:1-4, 17, 33; Heb. 9:28b; 2 Tim. 4:1b). The major items in the section of His heavenly ministry are to take care of the church, making it a glorious church, to enforce the new covenant and execute the new testament, to minister to the believers as the High Priest, the Advocate, and the Minister in the heavens, to come back, and to transfigure His believers.</p>
<p>In His earthly ministry, He ministered as the Lamb (John 1:29). As the Lamb in His earthly ministry, Christ accomplished God&rsquo;s full redemption for us by being slain on the cross to die the all-inclusive death according to God&rsquo;s requirements of righteousness, holiness, and glory.</p>
<p>In His heavenly ministry, He ministers as the Lion-Lamb (Rev. 5:5-7). The Lion-Lamb indicates that the very Christ who was the Redeemer has become a Victor as the Lion. In His heavenly ministry, as such a Victor, He will conquer all His enemies and bring in His kingdom to this earth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE MINISTRY OF CHRIST<br />
IN HIS ASCENSION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:23a, 26-27, 29; Heb. 8:6; 7:22; 9:16; 4:14-15; 7:25-26; Phil. 3:10; Rom. 8:2; 1 John 2:1b; Heb. 8:2; Eph. 1:22; Rev. 1:5a; 5:1, 6-7</h1>
<p>In the last message, we saw Christ&rsquo;s position in His ascension and the offices of Christ in His ascension. We also saw that the heavenly ministry of Christ is the continuation and complement of His earthly ministry. In this message, we want to see the practice of His heavenly ministry. In this practice are His responsibilities. Because He has such a wonderful position in the heavenlies with many offices, He bears many responsibilities.</p>
<p>Now in the heavens, Christ is ministering, and His ministry in the heavens today is for His church and His believers. He is doing something there for you and me. His ministry in the heavens is the continuation of His earthly ministry. Christ&rsquo;s former ministry on this earth started from His being baptized in water and anointed with the Holy Spirit. When Christ came out of the water of baptism, the Spirit descended upon Him. Humanly speaking, His baptism in water was carried out by John the Baptist. At the same time, God the Father also anointed Him with the Holy Spirit. That was the start of Christ&rsquo;s former ministry on this earth.</p>
<p>During the course of His human living in His earthly ministry, He did much visiting and teaching. We have stressed that we have to visit people for the preaching of the gospel to get them to believe and be baptized. Then we have to feed them. We also have to perfect them. Finally, we have to bring them into prophesying so that the Body of Christ might be built up. After Christ was baptized and anointed, He began to preach, to reach people. This was the first step of His ministry. He also fed people through His speaking and teaching. Furthermore, He perfected others. At least, He perfected the apostles who were with Him. At the time of His baptism, He was anointed with the economical Spirit for His ministry. In His ministry, He spoke for God and spoke forth God, that is, He prophesied. But His disciples had not yet received the economical Spirit. After they received the economical Spirit on the day of Pentecost, they began to prophesy.</p>
<p>While Jesus was on earth, He practiced preaching, feeding, perfecting, and prophesying. He carried these things out through His human living. Then He entered into His all-inclusive death, which consummated in His resurrection. That ended His earthly ministry. Then He entered into His ascension. His ascension may be likened to a boundary line between His earthly ministry and His heavenly ministry. Before His ascension was His earthly ministry; after His ascension is His heavenly ministry. Now we want to see the responsibilities which He bears in His heavenly ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HEAVENLY MINISTRY OF CHRIST<br />
FOR HIS CHURCH AND HIS BELIEVERS</h2>
<p>In His ministry in ascension, Christ bears the responsibility to take care of His church and His believers. Not many Christians realize that today Christ is working in the heavens to take care of the churches and His believers. Do we believe that even today He is taking care of us? He is in the heavens working for us. Without Christ&rsquo;s working in the heavens, we could not live the Christian life and the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the Head of the Church<br />
to Take Care of the Church</h2>
<p>In His ascension Christ is the Head of the church to take care of the church (Eph. 5:23a). He takes care of the church by nourishing and cherishing it (Eph. 5:29) to sanctify it (v. 26). Christ today is doing a sanctifying work. The Lord&rsquo;s sanctifying work in us separates us from the world. When the sisters are looking for sales in the newspaper in the way of self-indulgence, they are out of Christ&rsquo;s sanctification. They are making themselves common, worldly. By the sisters&rsquo; looking in the newspaper for sales to satisfy their lust, they become contaminated. Today Christ is carrying out a work to sanctify the church. The purpose of Christ in giving Himself to the church is to sanctify her, not only separating her to Himself from anything common but also saturating her with Himself that she may be His counterpart.</p>
<p>He sanctifies the church by cleansing her through the washing of the water in the word (Eph. 5:26). In the word is the flowing life of God typified by flowing water. When we read the Bible with a heart seeking after Christ, the word of the Bible washes us. The more we read the Bible, the more we get washed with the water in the word. Whether or not we remember what we have read, we still receive the washing. When a housewife washes dishes, she may rinse them again and again. This makes the dishes absolutely clean. In His sanctifying work, Christ &ldquo;rinses&rdquo; us again and again by the washing of the water in the word.</p>
<p>He sanctifies the church to make it a glorious church, without spot or wrinkle (Eph. 5:27). Spots are of the natural life, and wrinkles are a matter of oldness. Only the water of life can metabolically wash away such defects by the transformation of life. Eventually Christ&rsquo;s sanctifying work will make the church glorious. Glory is God expressed. Hence, to be glorious is to be God&rsquo;s expression. Eventually, the church presented to Christ will be a God-expressing one.</p><h2 class="head2">As the Mediator, the Executor,<br />
of the New Covenant</h2>
<p>In His ascension Christ is the Mediator, the Executor, of the new covenant (Heb. 8:6). In Greek the same word is used for both <em>covenant</em> and <em>testament.</em> A covenant is an agreement with some promises to accomplish certain things for the covenanted people. It can be an agreement signed by two parties, in which the first party promises what he will do for the second party. A testament is a will. When a person prepares to leave this earth, he makes a will, bequeathing all of his possessions to people. A testament is a will with certain accomplished things bequeathed to the inheritor (see Hebrews 9:16, note 1, Recovery Version).</p>
<p>Christ is the Mediator, the Executor, of the new covenant to guarantee the effectiveness of the new covenant as its surety (Heb. 7:22). He enacted the new covenant by His death, but who is going to bear the responsibility to guarantee that whatever is in this covenant is effective? The resurrected and ascended Christ in the heavens guarantees the effectiveness of this covenant. By His death He enacted, formed, and made this covenant. Then in His resurrection and ascension, He is the guarantee, the surety, of this covenant to guarantee that whatever is mentioned in this covenant is effective.</p>
<p>He also executes the new testament as a will bequeathed to us by His death (Heb. 9:16). When the Lord died, He bequeathed a testament to us. The Bible is a testament to us. The believers in Christ have a New Testament. It is a will full of items. One item of this will is that he who believes in the Son shall have eternal life. Another item is that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved. Every page of our New Testament, our will, is full of items that Christ has bequeathed to us. Every item is a bequest. Christ acts as the Mediator, the Executor, of the new testament.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As the High Priest in His Humanity<br />
and by His Divine Life</h2>
<p>In His heavenly ministry, Christ is the High Priest in His humanity and by His divine life (Heb. 2:14, 17; 4:14-15; 7:16, 26). If Christ were merely God, He could not be our High Priest. His humanity qualifies Him to be such a High Priest because He can sympathize with us in the things related to our human life. He lived as a man for thirty-three and a half years, passing through all the human sufferings. Today He surely knows our environment and understands all the sufferings through which we are passing. As such a God-man, He can sympathize with us. His humanity qualifies Him for this.</p>
<p>Besides being a man, our High Priest is the very God. We may be able to sympathize with others&rsquo; sufferings as human beings, but what can we do for them? While Jesus was on earth, He sympathized with the suffering ones, but He was also able to help them because of His divine life. He resurrected some who were dead, telling them to rise up (Luke 7:14-15; John 11:43-44). In His word there was the omnipotent divine life. He can sympathize with us because He is a man, and He can do everything that is needed for us because He is God. His humanity qualifies Him, and His divinity empowers Him. He is a High Priest in His humanity and by His divine life.</p>
<p>As such a priest, He intercedes for His redeemed (Heb. 7:25b). Today He is praying for us, interceding for us. Whatever our God-man Intercessor prays for will be fulfilled. His intercession is based upon His redemption, which was accomplished by His death. He undertakes our case by interceding for us. He appears before God on our behalf, praying for us that we may be saved and brought fully into God&rsquo;s eternal purpose.</p>
<p>He saves those who come forward to God through Him (Heb. 7:25a). Christ died for all mankind, but not everyone will be saved. This is because not everyone comes forward to God through Him. Although we may have been saved in the sense of being regenerated, we still need more saving. If we do not come forward, we cannot receive His saving. It may be raining, but a vessel cannot receive this rain if its opening is not toward the heavens. Many real Christians today do not receive Christ&rsquo;s saving because they do not come forward to God. Christ&rsquo;s saving in His priesthood will not reach the ones who will not come forward.</p>
<p>Hebrews 7:25 says that He saves to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him. Sometimes we may be saved from our temper only to a certain extent and not to the uttermost. A sister may be about to lose her temper, so she turns to Christ and is stopped from losing her temper. She may be saved from her temper but not to the uttermost. If she were saved from her temper to the uttermost, she would be rejoicing in the Lord. For the Lord&rsquo;s sake, we may forgive others&rsquo; mistakes. But to be saved from remembering others&rsquo; mistakes is to be saved to the uttermost. We may forgive others and yet still remember their mistakes. We may even tell others, &ldquo;This brother offended me in a certain matter, but I have forgiven him.&rdquo; This shows that we forgive, but we still remember the offense. The Bible tells us that when God forgives us, He forgets (Heb. 8:12). This is why some have said that to forgive is to forget. If our forgiving does not equal forgetting, we are not saved to the uttermost. C. H. Spurgeon said that often our forgiving can be likened to burying a dead dog while leaving its tail sticking out above the earth. After we forgive, we may invite people to see the &ldquo;tail&rdquo; of what we supposedly have forgiven. If we have really forgiven someone, we should also forget the offense. We have to be saved to the uttermost in our forgiving of others and from all our daily troubles. When we come forward to God through Christ, our High Priest, He saves us in the power of His resurrection (Phil. 3:10) and by the law of the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2).</p><h2 class="head2">As Our Advocate to Take Care of<br />
Our Case before God</h2>
<p>First John 2:1b reveals that Christ is our Advocate to take care of our case before God. An advocate is a lawyer, an attorney. Christ is our Advocate in the law court in the heavens. The Greek word for advocate is <em>parakletos,</em> which refers to one who is called to another&rsquo;s side to help him, one who offers legal aid, or one who intercedes on behalf of someone else. The word denotes consoling and consolation; hence, it can be translated &ldquo;Comforter,&rdquo; as it is in the Gospel of John (14:16, 26; 15:26; 16:7). In 1 John 2:1 the Lord Jesus is our Advocate with the Father, caring for our case, interceding (Rom. 8:34) and pleading for us if we sin, based upon His propitiation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">As a Minister to Minister Heaven<br />
with the Heavenly Blessings to Us</h2>
<p>In the heavens today, Christ is a minister to minister heaven with the heavenly blessings to us (Heb. 8:2). Christ as a Minister of the true (heavenly) tabernacle, ministers heaven (which is not only a place, but also a condition of life) into us, that we may have the heavenly life and power to live a heavenly life on earth as He did while He was here.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HEAVENLY MINISTRY OF CHRIST<br />
FOR THE UNIVERSE</h2>
<p>The ministry of Christ in His ascension is the heavenly ministry of Christ for the universe also. Christ as the embodiment of God is the Administrator of the universe today. He is the Head over all things to rule the entire universe (Eph. 1:22). According to 1 Corinthians 11:3, God is the head of Christ. Christ administrates the universe under the headship of God because God has given Christ to be the Head over all things.</p>
<p>Christ is also the Ruler of the kings of the earth to administrate God&rsquo;s plan for man. Revelation 1 and 5 tell us that Christ is the Ruler of the kings of the earth (1:5a; 5:1, 6-7), while Revelation 17 and 19 say that He is the King of kings (17:14; 19:16). Today He is the Ruler of the kings. When He comes again to the earth with His kingdom, He will be the King of kings. He is not yet the King of kings because He has not come to the earth to possess it for His kingdom. But today He is the Ruler of all the kings of the earth to administrate God&rsquo;s plan for man.</p>
<p>According to Acts 5:31, Christ is a Leader and a Savior. His being a Leader is related to His authority as a Ruler, and His being a Savior is related to His salvation. He rules over our environment in order to save us. Jesus sovereignly rules over our environment to save us and to administrate God&rsquo;s plan for us. I am happy that in God&rsquo;s sovereignty, I was born in a city on the coast of mainland China. There were many missionaries there, so I eventually was saved. After I entered into the Lord&rsquo;s work, I intended to go to Mongolia. But because of the Second World War, I am now in the United States. Jesus brought me here. He managed it. He administrated the entire world situation to bring me from China to the United States to minister to the Lord&rsquo;s children here. Jesus Christ today is the Ruler of all the authorities to manage the world affairs. We have to worship Him for all of His sovereign arrangement.</p>
<p>Today in His heavenly ministry, He takes care of His church and His believers. Also, as the Head of all things to rule the entire universe, He is managing the environment on this earth for us. Whatever is going on in the world situation is for the church. Thank the Lord that we can receive the benefit of Christ&rsquo;s heavenly administration.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RAPTURE OF THE SAINTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 8:23; Eph. 4:30; 1 Cor. 1:30; Luke 21:28; Phil. 3:21; Rom. 8:30, 17; 2 Thes. 1:10; 1 Pet. 5:10; 2 Tim. 2:10; Heb. 2:10; Matt. 24:3, 21; Dan. 9:24-27; Rev. 12:5, 6, 12-17; 11:2-3; 14:1, 4, 9-12; 3:7-8, 10; Matt. 24:21; Rev. 12:13-14; 3:12; Luke 21:34-36; Matt. 24:21, 36-42; 1 Thes. 4:15-17; Matt. 25:1-12; Rev. 20:4, 6; 15:2; 1 Cor. 15:51-52; Matt. 13:39; 2 Thes. 2:1, 3b-4; Matt. 13:30; Rev. 14:14-16; 16:12-16; 19:7-9, 11-15, 19-21; 11:11-12</h1>
<p>After fellowshipping concerning the ministry of Christ in His ascension in messages six and seven, we now come to the rapture of the saints. The study of the rapture of the saints has a history. The Brethren, who were raised up in England in the early part of the nineteenth century, and G. H. Pember, Robert Govett, and D. M. Panton all rendered us much help concerning the Lord&rsquo;s second coming and the rapture of the saints. In this matter we are on their shoulders to have some further studies, and the Lord has continuously shown us something more. This is what I am going to present to you tonight. But I must make one thing clear to all of us&mdash;all the teachers who paid much attention to the second coming and the rapture of the saints did not stress the matter of life. Actually, the rapture of the saints is wrapped up with life, but even the excellent books written on the second coming and the rapture do not pay much attention to life.</p>
<p>M. E. Barber, who lived in China at the time of Brother Nee and rendered him much help, paid much attention to the Lord&rsquo;s second coming and the rapture. But she paid more attention to life than others. She was waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Brother Nee told us that she and he went for a walk one time, and as they rounded the corner of a building, she said to him, &ldquo;Maybe as we turn the corner, He will be there and we will meet Him.&rdquo; She was waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming and expecting her rapture to such an extent.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSUMMATING STEP<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S FULL SALVATION IN LIFE</h2>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; teaching is concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy from the incarnation of God to the consummation of the New Jerusalem. One of the major items of this teaching is the rapture of the saints. The rapture of the saints is the consummating step of God&rsquo;s full salvation in life. God&rsquo;s salvation is in two aspects&mdash;in redemption and in life. Romans 5:10 says that through Christ&rsquo;s death we were reconciled to God; we were justified. This is the objective aspect of God&rsquo;s salvation in redemption. Then Romans 5:10 says that since we have been reconciled to God through the death of Christ, much more we shall be saved in the life of Christ. This is the subjective aspect of God&rsquo;s salvation in His divine life. The first step in this salvation in life is that God regenerated us. Following this, He is now transforming us. The consummating step of His salvation in life is the transfiguration of our body. Our bodies are not yet redeemed, but they are on the way to being redeemed. The redemption of our body will be a change in its nature and condition. Our physical nature is one that is always weak, sick, and dying. To redeem our body changes its nature to one that is strong, healthy, and living.</p>
<p>The redemption of our body is through the saturation of the divine element by the sealing of the Spirit of God (Rom. 8:23; Eph. 4:30; 1 Cor. 1:30; Luke 21:28). We believers are being saturated with the divine element. Outwardly, we may look the same as the unbelievers. But inwardly, something hidden is going on within us. Inwardly, we are being saturated with the divine element of God&rsquo;s life. This saturating is by the sealing of the Spirit of God. When a piece of paper is sealed with a seal, the ink on the image of the seal saturates the paper. Within us the sealing of the Spirit of God is going on.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1:13-14 and 4:30 speak of this sealing. The Holy Spirit is the sealing ink, and God has sealed us with the Spirit as the sealing ink. This sealing is going on unto the redemption of our body. The word &ldquo;unto&rdquo; is the Greek word <em>eis</em>, which means resulting in, or issuing in. The sealing of the Holy Spirit within us is issuing in the redemption of our body. We are like a cotton ball which is being saturated with ink. The Holy Spirit is the sealing ink. As long as the sealing is going on in us, the divine ink is saturating us. Then the sealing will saturate our entire body, until our entire being will be permeated and saturated with the divine element as the sealing ink. Someone who has been recently saved has a small amount of the divine ink within him. As he grows in the divine life, the divine ink permeates and saturates him. Eventually, this saturation will reach his body. That will be the time of his rapture, which is the redemption of his body. We need to be permeated and saturated with the Spirit until the redemption of our body.</p>
 <p>The redemption of our body is the transfiguration of our body of humiliation (Phil. 3:21). Our body has been humiliated by the fall. By the fall, sin invaded our body. Therefore, today in the members of our body, according to Romans 7, there is an evil thing called sin. Sin dwells in us (v. 20) and has become a law of sin dwelling in the members of our body (v. 23). This sin brings in death, and death implies weakness and sickness. Our body has been humiliated by sin, by weakness, by sickness, and eventually by death. Our body is not something glorious. It is something humiliated with mainly these four things&mdash;sin, weakness, sickness, and death.</p>
<p>Actually, we human beings are not living. Everybody is dying. Eventually, all of us will die. We are dying persons. This is a kind of humiliation. But the redemption of our body will change the nature and the condition of our body. That change will be a transfiguration. Philippians 3:21 says that Christ &ldquo;will transfigure the body of our humiliation, conforming it to the body of His glory, according to the operation of Him who is able even to subject all things to Himself.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The redemption of our body to transfigure the nature and the condition of our body of humiliation is also the full sonship of God. We are sons of God today because we have the very reality of the sonship of God in our spirit. But today we do not have the sonship of God in our body. Our body has not yet entered into divinity. But one day our body will enter into divinity. Divinity is now saturating our being. One day this saturation will reach a consummation, and our entire body will be consummated in divinity. By that time we will enjoy the full sonship. None of the unbelievers can discern that we are the sons of God today. To them we are the same as they are. But according to Romans 8, one day the sons of God will be manifested. Everyone will be able to see that we are the sons of God. The redemption of our body is the full sonship of God.</p>
<p>The redemption of our body, which is the transfiguration of our body of humiliation, will be the glorification of our entire being (Rom. 8:30, 17; 2 Thes. 1:10; 1 Pet. 5:10; 2 Tim. 2:10; Heb. 2:10). This means that our entire being will be saturated with the glory of the divine life. In other words, our humiliated body will be filled with the splendor of the divine life.</p>
<p>Second Thessalonians 1:10 says that Christ will come to glorify Himself in us. This is a hard word to understand. How will Christ come to glorify Himself in us? On the one hand, Christ&rsquo;s coming is from the heavens. On the other hand, Christ&rsquo;s coming is from within us. Today Christ is first in the heavens and then in us. When He comes, He will come from these two directions. He will come from the heavens above to the earth. He also will come from within us. He is coming out from our spirit to appear in our body. The appearance of Christ from within us is His coming. This kind of coming is His glorification. Christ in us is a mystery. He is in us as the hope of glory (Col. 1:27). One day this hope will be manifested, and that will be our glory. When the inner hope is manifested, He will become the outer glorification. In that day Christ will glorify Himself in us. That is our glorification, and in our glorification Christ will be glorified.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TIME OF THE RAPTURE OF THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>Now we have to see when the rapture of the saints will take place. This redemption, this transfiguration, and this glorification will take place with the coming (<em>parousia</em>&mdash;presence) of Christ (Matt. 24:3). In Greek the word for coming is <em>parousia</em>, meaning presence. In ancient times among the Greeks, a dignified person&rsquo;s coming was his <em>parousia</em>, his presence. The New Testament uses such a word to denote Christ&rsquo;s second coming. His second coming is the presence of Himself as the most dignified person, and this presence will begin from the throne of God in the third heaven before the great tribulation. Then this presence, this <em>parousia</em>, will travel from the third heaven to the air and will linger in the air for a short while. Eventually, this <em>parousia</em> will reach the earth. When it reaches earth, 2 Thessalonians 2:8 says that there will be the appearing of His presence (coming). Thus, the rapture of the saints will take place with the coming, the <em>parousia</em>, of Christ.</p>
<p>The rapture of the saints into Christ&rsquo;s presence (coming) will take place before the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21) for the overcomers and at the end of the great tribulation for the majority of the saints. The great tribulation will last three and a half years, beginning from the sixth seal (Rev. 6:12-17) and ending at the seventh bowl (Rev. 16:17-21). These three and a half years will be the second half of the last week, the last seven years, of the present age. This week will be the last week of the seventy weeks revealed in Daniel 9:24-27. We are still awaiting and expecting the coming of this seventieth week, the last week, which will be one of the strong signs of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back.</p>
<p>The New Testament gives us some signs of the coming of the last week. One strong sign is the restoration of the kingdom of Israel. Many centuries ago the Jews lost their nation, they became captives, and they were scattered on the earth among the Gentiles. But the Bible promised that one day the Lord would bring them back to their fathers&rsquo; land and restore the nation of Israel. After I was saved in 1925, I wondered how the scattered Jews could be gathered together to their fathers&rsquo; land again. But eventually in 1948, Israel was restored again as a nation. This was a sign of the Lord&rsquo;s coming. The Bible also prophesied that the city of Jerusalem would eventually be returned to the people of Israel. Jerusalem was taken over by the king of Babylon about 600 B.C., approximately twenty-six centuries ago. But in 1967, nineteen years after the nation of Israel had been restored, the city of Jerusalem was reclaimed by the Jews. This was another sign of the Lord&rsquo;s coming. These signs are the fulfillment of the Lord&rsquo;s prophecy in Matthew 24:32 concerning the branch of the fig tree (the nation of Israel) becoming tender and putting forth its leaves.</p>
<p>The things that are happening today are also the fulfillment of biblical prophecy. Daniel&rsquo;s interpretation of the image in Daniel 2 is actually a prophecy concerning the nations of the earth. The head symbolizes the Babylonian empire, the breast and arms of silver symbolize Medo-Persia, the belly and thighs of bronze symbolize the empire of Macedonia and Greece, and the two legs of iron symbolize the Roman Empire. Finally, the feet of the image are part iron and part clay signifying the nations in the period after the fall of Rome and before the second coming of Christ. Iron signifies the power of dictatorship, or autocracy, and clay signifies the people. In Russia and eastern Europe, the practice of communism has actually been the practice of autocracy, dictatorship. Now the people, the clay, are rising up to weaken the iron. As the clay rises up, the strength of the iron is weakened. This shows that we are in the iron-clay stage of the image depicted in Daniel 2 as another sign of the approaching of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back.</p>
<p>According to Daniel 9:27, at the time close to the end of the present age, that is, at the last week of the seventy weeks, Antichrist will make a firm covenant (an agreement of peace) with the nation of Israel for seven years. In the midst of the seven years, he will break the covenant and begin to persecute the children of Israel and the Christians. From that time the great tribulation begins and will last for three and a half years, that is, forty-two months or one thousand two hundred sixty days (Dan. 12:7; Rev. 11:2-3; 12:6, 14; 13:5). The making of the seven-year covenant by Antichrist with the nation of Israel will be another sign of the Lord&rsquo;s coming back for the rapture of the saints. This is why we are awaiting and expecting the last week of the seventy weeks, revealed in Daniel 9, to come.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SECTIONS OF THE RAPTURE</h2>
<p>According to the New Testament, the rapture has different sections. The harvest of the crop in the field in the Old Testament typifies the rapture of the saints. Before the general harvest, the firstfruit is reaped, brought into the sanctuary, the house of God, and presented to God for His fresh enjoyment (Lev. 23:9-14; Exo. 23:19). After a period of time, the entire harvest is reaped. Therefore, in the type of the harvest, there are the firstfruit and the harvest.</p>
<p>The rapture of the saints is according to this typology. The firstfruit is mentioned in Revelation 14:1-5. Then verses 14 through 16 speak of the harvest of the majority of the believers. These are the two sections of the rapture: the firstfruit and the harvest.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Section of the Overcomers</h2>
<p>The section of the overcomers is the first section of the rapture. These overcomers are of five classifications: the man-child, the firstfruit, the overcomers in Philadelphia, the watchful and beseeching saints, and the watchful one of the two saints.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Man-child</h2>
<p>First, there is the man-child mentioned in Revelation 12:5. Revelation 12 depicts a universal and heavenly woman who is clothed with the sun, having the moon underneath her feet and a crown of twelve stars on her head. That woman signifies the totality of God&rsquo;s people. The man-child delivered by her is the stronger part of God&rsquo;s people, the overcomers. They will be raptured before the great tribulation of the three and a half years of the last week of this age (Rev. 12:6, 12-17). They will be raptured to God and to His throne in the third heaven where Christ is today. Revelation 12:11 says that the overcomers who are a part of the man-child are faithful unto death. All of them have been martyred. Hence, the man-child, which includes all the dead overcomers, is different from the firstfruit, who are the living overcomers.</p><h2 class="head3">The Firstfruit</h2>
<p>The rapture of the firstfruit is depicted in Revelation 14:1 and 4. They will be raptured before the manifestation of Antichrist and his persecution of the saints (Rev. 14:9-12). This means that their rapture will be before the three and a half years of the great tribulation. They will be raptured to Mount Zion in the third heaven where Christ with the Father is today. In the Bible there are two Zions. One is the earthly Zion, which is one of the mountains on which Jerusalem was built. The other is the heavenly Zion in the third heaven where Christ with the Father is today.</p>
<p>Revelation 14 does not say that the firstfruit will be raptured. This is because these overcomers followed the Lamb all the time. Because they were always with the Lamb, having followed the Lamb wherever He went, they are seen in Revelation 14 standing with the Lamb on Mount Zion. Because they are already in the Lord&rsquo;s presence, the rapture will not come as a surprise to them. They are living in the heavens today, and they will be standing with the Lamb in the heavens on Mount Zion in the future.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Overcomers in Philadelphia</h2>
<p>The third kind of overcomers are those in Philadelphia (Rev. 3:7-8). Philadelphia is the top church among the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3. This church had two top points. First, they kept the word of God even though they had a little strength. Second, they did not deny the name of Christ. This is why we do not like to have any denominational names such as Baptist, Lutheran, Presbyterian, Episcopalian, or Methodist. All these names are an insult to Christ. If a wife were to take another name besides the name of her husband, this would be an insult to her husband. We are Christians. We are not Baptists, Lutherans, Presbyterians, Episcopalians, or Methodists. We are Christ&rsquo;s, so we must keep His name. We must be like those in Philadelphia who kept His word and did not deny His name. These overcomers in Philadelphia will be raptured before the hour of trial on the whole inhabited earth, that is, the time of the great tribulation of the last three and a half years of this age (Rev. 3:10; Matt. 24:21; Rev. 12:13-14). They will be raptured to the temple of God in the third heaven where Christ with God is today (Rev. 3:12). These overcomers will be pillars in the temple of God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Watchful and Beseeching Saints</h2>
<p>The overcomers will also be the watchful and beseeching saints (Luke 21:36). They will be raptured before the coming of the great tribulation (Luke 21:34-35; Matt. 24:21) to the third heaven where Christ is today.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Watchful One of the Two Saints</h2>
<p>The fifth category of overcomers is depicted by the watchful one of the two saints in Matthew 24:40-42, which says, &ldquo;Then shall two men be in the field; one is taken, and one is left. Two women shall be grinding at the mill; one is taken, and one is left. Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes.&rdquo; These men are brothers in Christ, and the women are sisters in the Lord. The phrases &ldquo;watch therefore&rdquo; and &ldquo;your Lord&rdquo; prove that the two men and two women are saved believers. The Lord would not charge unsaved people to watch, nor is He the Lord of the unsaved. The time will come when the watchful ones will be suddenly taken by the Lord. This will be before the coming of the &ldquo;flood&rdquo; of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:36-39) for them to be with Christ in His <em>parousia</em> (presence) in the third heaven. The great tribulation will be like the flood at Noah&rsquo;s time to judge the entire world.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s prophecy in Matthew 24 and 25 covers all the people of God, signified by the number twelve, which is used several times for the New Jerusalem as the totality of God&rsquo;s redeemed and glorified people. The two men or two women in Matthew 24, represent the living believers at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming by the number two, which is a minor part of the number twelve; and the ten virgins in Matthew 25 represent the dead saints at the Lord&rsquo;s second coming by the number ten, which is the major part of the number twelve. Among the living ones, some will be raptured, taken away, earlier, and the others will be left. Among the dead ones, the man-child will be resurrected and raptured three and a half years earlier, while the rest of the dead saints have to wait for three and a half years for their resurrection and rapture.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Section of the Majority of the Saints,<br />
including the Resurrected Ones<br />
and the Remaining Ones</h2>
<p>The second section of the rapture is the section of the majority of the saints, including the resurrected ones and the remaining ones. All the dead saints through the centuries, through the generations, will be resurrected, and join the remaining ones, the living ones, to be raptured together at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (1 Thes. 4:15-17; Matt. 25:1-12; Rev. 20:4, 6; 15:2; 1 Cor. 15:51-52). This will take place at the consummation of this age in the Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> (presence) and at the close of the great tribulation, after the manifestation of Antichrist (Matt. 13:39; 1 Thes. 4:15-16; 2 Thes. 2:1, 3b-4; Matt. 24:21; Rev. 14:9-12).</p>
<p>The majority of the saints will be raptured to the Lord&rsquo;s barn in the air within the clouds, where Christ&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> (presence) will be then (Matt. 13:30; 1 Thes. 4:17; Rev. 14:14-16). The Lord will come to the air, and in the air He will have a place to receive His harvest. This is His barn in the air within the clouds. By that time Christ&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> will no longer be in the third heaven, but it will have traveled to the air and will linger there for a short time. As we have seen, the firstfruit is brought from the field into the temple of God, the house of God, for God&rsquo;s enjoyment and satisfaction. The firstfruit of the believers, the overcomers, will be brought directly to God&rsquo;s house in the heavens. When the field is completely ripe, that is the time of the harvest. At that time, the majority of the believers will be harvested and taken to the Lord&rsquo;s barn in the air.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Section of the Two Witnesses</h2>
<p>The final section of the rapture is the section of the two witnesses (Rev. 11:11-12). These do not belong to the firstfruit or the harvest. These two witnesses will be Moses and Elijah (see Rev. 11:3, note 1, Recovery Version). Their rapture will be at the end of the one thousand two hundred and sixty days&mdash;forty-two months, the second three and a half years of the last week. Revelation 11:2 and 3 tell us that these two witnesses will prophesy for a thousand two hundred and sixty days. Then they will be killed, resurrected, and raptured to the air where Christ&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> (presence) will be.</p>
<p>Their rapture will take place on the same day that Antichrist is put into the lake of fire. Christ and His heavenly army will defeat Antichrist with his earthly army, and Antichrist and the false prophet will be thrown alive into the lake of fire (Rev. 19:19-20). When the Lord returns on that day, the whole house of Israel will repent. Therefore, on the day the two witnesses are raptured, Antichrist will be thrown into the lake of fire, and the children of Israel all will repent. That is the last day of the three and a half years of tribulation, and that will be the last day of this age. Then the next age will begin.</p><h2 class="head1">A CONCLUDING WORD</h2>
<p>Now I would like to present a summary of what we have fellowshipped concerning the rapture of the saints. Today we are in the church age. The two strong signs of the Lord&rsquo;s coming and the coming last week of the seventy weeks in Daniel are the restoration of the nation of Israel and the return of Jerusalem to the people of Israel. At the beginning of the last week, the last seven years of this age, Antichrist will make an agreement with the nation of Israel to allow them to worship God freely. This is clearly spoken of in Daniel 9. Then in the middle of this seven-year period, Antichrist will annul his agreement. This will be the time when Antichrist begins to persecute the Jews and the Christians. Revelation refers to them as the ones who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus (12:17; 14:12). The ones who keep the law are the Jews, and the ones who have the testimony of Jesus are the Christians.</p>
<p>Before this period of tribulation begins, the overcomers represented by the man-child, the firstfruit, the overcomers in Philadelphia, the watchful and beseeching saints, and the watchful one of the two saints will be raptured to the third heaven to God&rsquo;s temple. The majority of the living Christians will be left on this earth. They have to pass through the time of three and a half years of the great tribulation to be disciplined for their maturity. At the end of the great tribulation, the majority of the saints, including the resurrected saints and the living saints, will be raptured to the air. After the rapture of the majority of the dead and resurrected saints and of the living ones, Christ will judge all the saints at His judgment seat. At His judgment seat, He will decide who among His saints should be rewarded as overcomers and who should be disciplined as defeated ones. After His judgment seat, Christ will have a wedding and marry His overcomers.</p>
<p>The two witnesses will prophesy for one thousand two hundred and sixty days during the great tribulation. Antichrist will kill them, and their corpses will lie on the street of the city of Jerusalem for three and a half days (Rev. 11:8-9). These two witnesses will then be resurrected and raptured (vv. 11-12), and will probably also pass through the judgment at Christ&rsquo;s judgment seat and participate in His marriage (Rev. 19:7-8). Then Christ will come down with His overcomers to defeat Antichrist and his armies at Armageddon.</p>
<p>Revelation 14 shows that after the harvest of the majority of the believers, there will be the treading of the great winepress (v. 19), that is, the battle at Armageddon (Rev. 16:14, 16). The war at Armageddon is also mentioned in Revelation 19:11-21. Christ as the One from the heavens with His heavenly army, the overcomers, will come down to defeat Antichrist and to throw him into the lake of fire. Revelation 17:14 also refers to this war, saying that the overcomers, the ones who are called and chosen and faithful, will defeat Antichrist and his armies. They are the bride who will come down from the heavens with her husband to fight against Antichrist.</p>
<p>On the same day these four things will take place: the majority of the saints will be raptured to the air, the two witnesses will be resurrected and raptured also to the air, Christ will come down to defeat Antichrist and throw him into the lake of fire, and all of Israel will repent and be saved. All these things will take place on the last day of the great tribulation. That will be the close of this age. Then a new age will begin. This will be the age of the millennium, the thousand-year reign of Christ.</p>
<p>In the light of the truth concerning the rapture of the saints, we need to prepare ourselves, to make ourselves ready for the Lord&rsquo;s coming by watching and praying. We need to watch and pray so that we can grow and mature in the spiritual life. Then we will mature earlier and be raptured before the hour of trial, the great tribulation. The tribulation may be likened to the scorching sun. The suffering of the great tribulation will be like the scorching sun, drying the earthly waters from the believers then remaining so that they may ripen. This means that we all have to grow so that we may become ripe for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back. There are surely details of the Lord&rsquo;s coming that are not revealed in the Bible, but the principles that the Bible gives us are sufficient to teach us the spiritual lessons.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SEVEN SEALS,<br />
THE SEVEN TRUMPETS,<br />
AND THE SEVEN BOWLS<br />
IN RELATION TO THE<br />
RAPTURE OF THE SAINTS AND<br />
THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST&mdash;<br />
AS THE SECRETS OF THE UNIVERSE<br />
CONCERNING MAN FROM THE TIME<br />
OF CHRIST&rsquo;S ASCENSION TO ETERNITY<br />
IN THE FUTURE WITHOUT ENDING</h1>
<p>This message is quite crucial in our fellowship on the apostles&rsquo; teaching concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy from the incarnation of God to the consummation of the New Jerusalem. In this message we want to see the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls in relation to the rapture of the saints&mdash;as the secrets of the universe concerning man from the time of Christ&rsquo;s ascension to eternity in the future without ending. If we are going to understand the rapture, we must understand these three sets of &ldquo;sevens&rdquo;&mdash;the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEVEN SEALS&mdash;<br />
THE MYSTERY OF GOD&rsquo;S ECONOMY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The First Four Seals</h2>
<p>The seven seals are the mystery of God&rsquo;s economy (Rev. 6:1-17; 8:1-2). The first four seals are the course of the four horses: gospel preaching, war, famine, and death (Rev. 6:1-8; Matt. 24:6-8, 14). The course of these four horses is the course of the world in the present age of the church. Immediately after Christ&rsquo;s ascension, these four things&mdash;the gospel, war, famine, and death&mdash;began to run like riders on four horses and will continue until the end of this age. Beginning with the first century, the gospel has been spreading throughout all these twenty centuries. The gospel takes the lead. War among the human race has also been proceeding simultaneously. War has always caused famine, and famine has issued in death. These four seals began from the ascension of Christ and will continue to the supernatural calamities in the sixth seal (Rev. 6:12-17).</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fifth Seal</h2>
<p>The fifth seal is the cry of the martyred saints for vengeance (Rev. 6:9-11). While the gospel is being preached, as indicated by the first seal, there is always the martyrdom of the faithful saints. Now we need to consider the rapture of the overcomers. We can consider this as an insertion between the fifth and sixth seals.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">____________________________________________________________</p>
<h2 class="head1">INSERTION I.</h2>
<h2 class="head1">THE RAPTURE OF THE OVERCOMERS</h2>
<p class="indent1">Before the sixth seal is opened, there will be the rapture of the overcomers. Before the supernatural calamities come in, God will take away His faithful ones. They will be raptured to Zion in the heavens where the throne of God and Christ are today, and the time of their rapture will be before the beginning of the great tribulation in the sixth seal. The great tribulation begins from the sixth seal and ends with the seventh bowl.</p>
<p class="indent1">According to the Bible, we can classify the overcomers into five categories. First, there is the man-child, composed of the resurrected martyrs who should participate in &ldquo;the extra resurrection,&rdquo; &ldquo;the better resurrection&rdquo; (Rev. 12:5; Phil. 3:11; Heb. 11:35). Paul said in Philippians 3:11 that he wanted to attain to the extra resurrection. In Greek, the prefix ex is added to the Greek word for <em>resurrection.</em> Paul wanted to attain to such an ex-resurrection. In Hebrews 11:35 the term &ldquo;the better resurrection&rdquo; is used. The man-child will participate in this extra resurrection, the better resurrection.</p>
<p class="indent1">The second category of overcomers is the firstfruit (Rev. 14:1, 4). The third category is the Philadelphia overcomers (Rev. 3:7-8). The watchful and beseeching overcomers are the fourth category (Luke 21:36). Finally, the fifth category is the watchful one of the two saints (Matt. 24:40-42). The two saints in Matthew 24 represent the living saints at the time of the Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia.</em> In Matthew 25 the ten virgins represent the dead saints. Ten is the majority of twelve, whereas two is the remainder. At the Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia,</em> at His coming, a majority of the saints, represented by ten-twelfths, are the dead ones, and a minority of the saints, represented by two-twelfths, are the living ones. Among the living ones, some will be taken away, raptured, and some will be left.</p>
<p class="indent1">The above five categories of overcomers will be raptured before the opening of the sixth seal. After the rapture of the overcomers, in the midst of the last week (seven years) of the seventy weeks revealed in Daniel 9:24-27, Antichrist will break his one-week (seven years) covenant with Israel, and the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21) will begin and last for three and a half years&mdash;forty-two months&mdash;one thousand two hundred and sixty days, in which period of time the following evils, supernatural calamities, plagues, and woes will take place. First, Satan will be cast from heaven to the earth to cause, with great rage, woes to the earth and the sea and to persecute God&rsquo;s people, those who still remain on the earth, and he will war with the Jews, who keep the commandments of God, and the believers, who have the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 12:7, 12b-13, 17). Second, Antichrist, who will come up out of the abyss (Rev. 17:8), will exalt himself above all that is called God or an object of worship, seating himself in the temple of God and proclaiming that he is God (2 Thes. 2:4; Dan. 9:27b; Matt. 24:15). Third, all those dwelling on the earth will worship Satan (the dragon) and worship Antichrist (the beast) and his image; those who would not worship him and his image will be slain (Rev. 13:3-4, 8, 15). Some Christians surely will be slain because in Revelation 15, these slain ones will be resurrected and raptured. They become the ones standing on the glassy sea (Rev. 15:2-4). Revelation 20:4 also mentions these martyrs in the great tribulation who would not worship the beast and his image. Fourth, Antichrist will war with the saints, overcome them, and act as he wills for forty-two months (Rev. 13:7, 5). During that time, an angel will announce an eternal gospel to those settled on the earth, charging them to fear God and worship Him, that is, not to worship Antichrist and his image, because the hour of His judgment has come (Rev. 14:6-7, 9-11). Because of this gospel, some among the nations will not worship the Antichrist or his image. Instead, according to Matthew 25, they will treat God&rsquo;s people, the Lord&rsquo;s brothers, kindly. When the Lord comes to earth, He will consider them as ``sheep&rsquo;&rsquo; and make them the people on the earth in the millennium. Fifth, the false prophet (another beast) will do great signs to deceive people to make an image for Antichrist and worship it (Rev. 13:11-15; 16:13; 19:20). Sixth, in addition to all the devastations caused by the satanic trinity&mdash; Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet&mdash;God will mete out His judgment in His wrath to men on the earth with supernatural calamities, killings, a malignant sore, and darkness, as woes in the sixth seal, the first six trumpets, and the seven bowls of the seventh trumpet. Now we come to the opening of the sixth seal.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">__________________________________________________________</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Sixth Seal&mdash;<br />
the Shaking of the Earth and Heaven</h2>
<p>The sixth seal is the shaking of the earth and heaven (Rev. 6:12-17). It is the beginning of the supernatural calamities to damage the inhabitable earth and heaven with its hosts (Luke 21:11), as the beginning of God&rsquo;s answer to the martyrs&rsquo; cry in the fifth seal (Rev. 6:9-11). The sixth seal is also the initiation of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21) of three and a half years (Dan. 12:7; Rev. 11:2; 13:5), the hour of trial to come on the whole inhabited earth (Rev. 3:10). It is also a warning to the inhabitants on the earth (Rev. 6:15-17). After the sixth seal comes the seventh seal, which is the ushering in of the seven trumpets (Rev. 8:1-2).</p><h2 class="head1">THE SEVEN TRUMPETS&mdash;<br />
THE CONTENTS OF THE SEVENTH SEAL</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The First Four Trumpets&mdash;<br />
the Intensified Supernatural Calamities<br />
to Damage All the Sources of<br />
Natural Provisions for Men&rsquo;s Living</h2>
<p>The seven trumpets are the contents of the seventh seal (Rev. 8:6&mdash;9:21; 11:14-18). The first four trumpets will be the intensified supernatural calamities to damage all the sources of natural provisions for men&rsquo;s living. All the provisions for us to live on earth were prepared by God, but all these will be damaged with the first four trumpets. The first trumpet will be God&rsquo;s judgment on the earth: hail and fire mingled with blood will be cast to the earth; the third of the earth, the third of the trees, and all the green grass will be burnt (Rev. 8:7). The second trumpet will be God&rsquo;s judgment on the sea: a great mountain burning with fire will be cast into the sea; the third part of the sea will become blood, the third part of the living creatures in the sea will die, and the third part of the ships will be destroyed (Rev. 8:8-9). The third trumpet will be God&rsquo;s judgment on the rivers: a great star, called Wormwood, will fall out of heaven, burning like a torch, and will fall upon the third part of the rivers and upon the springs of waters; the third part of the waters will become wormwood, and many men will die from the bitter waters (Rev. 8:10-11). The fourth trumpet will be God&rsquo;s judgment on the sun, moon, and stars: the third part of the sun, of the moon, and of the stars will be smitten; the third part of the three lights (the sun, moon, and stars) will be darkened, the day and night not appearing for the third part of them (Rev. 8:12). The third part of the day will be dark. The moon and the stars will not shine for the third part of the night. This is God&rsquo;s judgment to damage the sources of the natural provisions for men&rsquo;s living.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fifth Trumpet&mdash;the First Woe&mdash;<br />
God&rsquo;s Judgment on Men<br />
to Torment Men by Satan<br />
Collaborating with Antichrist</h2>
<p>The fifth trumpet, which is the first woe, is God&rsquo;s judgment on men to torment men by Satan collaborating with Antichrist (Rev. 8:13&mdash;9:11). There will not be much difference in time between the sixth seal, in Revelation 6:12-17, and the first five trumpets, in Revelation 8:7&mdash;9:11. Joel 2:30-31 proves this. The sixth seal and the first five trumpets are linked together as a group, covering the first two times of the supernatural calamities: the first time is to shake and damage the inhabitable earth and heaven with its hosts (Rev. 6:12-17); the second time is to judge all the sources of natural provisions for men&rsquo;s living (Rev. 8:7-12). They will take place nearly at the same time in continuation.</p>
<p>After the sounding of the fifth trumpet, Satan as a star will fall out of heaven to the earth to release &ldquo;locusts&rdquo; from the abyss (the bottomless pit) to torment men by stinging as scorpions for five months (Rev. 9:1-5, 7-10). Furthermore, Antichrist, the angel of the abyss, will be the king over the tormenting locusts, with the name of Abaddon (destruction) in Hebrew, and Apollyon (destroyer) in Greek (Rev. 9:11). Antichrist will be both the destruction and the destroyer. He will come up from the abyss just to destroy man. In those five months, men will seek death and long to die, but by no means will they find it, because death will flee from them (Rev. 9:6). Today we do not want death. In that time men will want death, but they will not find it.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Sixth Trumpet&mdash;the Second Woe&mdash;<br />
God&rsquo;s Further Judgment on Men<br />
by Two Hundred Million Cavalry Troops<br />
Killing the Third Part of Men</h2>
<p>The sixth trumpet, which is the second woe, is God&rsquo;s further judgment on men by two hundred million cavalry troops killing the third part of men (Rev. 9:12-21). After this trumpet is sounded, the four angels who are bound at the great river Euphrates are loosed to kill the third part of men within thirteen months and one day and one hour by two hundred million cavalry troops (Rev. 9:14-16). The cavalry troops will kill men by fire, smoke, and sulphur proceeding out of the mouth of their horses and by the tails of their horses, which are like the tails of serpents (Rev. 9:17-19). The rest of the men who have not been killed by these plagues will not repent of their idolatry, murders, witchcrafts, fornication, and thefts (Rev. 9:20-21). The fifth trumpet and the sixth trumpet will last for more than one and a half years. After the sixth trumpet and before the seventh trumpet is another insertion related to the rapture of the saints and the second coming of Christ. This insertion is concerning Christ&rsquo;s coming down out of heaven to the air.</p><p style="text-align:center">___________________________________________________________</p>
<h2 class="head1">INSERTION II.</h2>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S COMING DOWN<br />
OUT OF HEAVEN TO THE AIR</h2>
<p class="indent1">Revelation 10:1 through 6 shows us Christ&rsquo;s coming down out of heaven to the air. Before that time Christ was in the heavens with the overcomers who were raptured to the throne. That was the beginning of His <em>parousia</em> (presence). Now His <em>parousia</em> comes down out of heaven to the air. In His <em>parousia</em> in the air, He is clothed with a cloud&mdash;in secrecy (Rev. 10:1a). This is His secret coming, the secret section of His <em>parousia.</em> The rainbow is upon His head as a reminder of the covenant God made with Noah concerning the existence of the living creatures on the earth (Rev. 10:1b; Gen. 9:8-17). He will place His right foot on the sea and the left foot on the land&mdash;to take possession of the earth (Rev. 10:2b). At that juncture He will declare that there should be delay no longer, but in the days of the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet, the mystery of God will be finished as the good news God announced to the prophets (Rev. 10:6-7). After this insertion of Christ&rsquo;s coming down out of heaven to the air, God&rsquo;s plan continues to be carried out with the sounding of the seventh trumpet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">___________________________________________________________</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Seventh Trumpet&mdash;<br />
the Finishing of the Mystery of God</h2>
<p>In the days of the seventh trumpet will be the finishing of the mystery of God (Rev. 10:7; 11:14-18).</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Eternal Kingdom of God and of Christ<br />
and the Judgment of the Dead</h2>
<p>At the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet will be the eternal kingdom of God and of Christ (Rev. 11:15). It will be at that time that the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of God and of Christ. He shall reign forever and ever. The trumpeting of the seventh trumpet also comprises the judgment of the dead (Rev. 11:18a) to decide among all the dead persons who should participate in the first resurrection (Rev. 20:6a), the resurrection of life (John 5:29a) before the millennium, and who should still remain in death until the resurrection of judgment (John 5:29b) after the millennium to be judged at the great white throne (Rev. 20:11-12). First Corinthians 15:52 says that at the last trumpet, the dead will be raised. This is the seventh trumpet, a trumpet of God (1 Thes. 4:16). This brings us to the insertions of the rapture of the majority of the saints and the rapture of the two witnesses.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">___________________________________________________________</p>
<h2 class="head1">INSERTION III.</h2>
<h2 class="head1">THE RAPTURE OF<br />
THE MAJORITY OF THE SAINTS</h2>
<p class="indent1">The rapture of the majority of the saints will be to the Lord&rsquo;s barn in the air within the clouds (Matt. 13:30), where Christ&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> (presence) will then be (1 Thes. 4:17). The majority of the saints will be raptured not to the peak of the universe, to Zion in the third heavens, but to the air. The Bible likens the believers to the harvest and the Lord to a farmer. The rapture of the majority of the saints as the harvest will be at the consummation of this age, after the manifestation of Antichrist, at the end of the great tribulation, at the last trumpet, that is, the seventh trumpet (Matt. 13:39; 2 Thes. 2:1, 3b-4; Rev. 14:9-12). This rapture will comprise the resurrected saints who will be resurrected &ldquo;in the twinkling of an eye&rdquo; (Matt. 25:1-12; Rev. 15:2; 20:4-6; 1 Thes. 4:16; 1 Cor. 15:51-52), and also the remaining saints (1 Thes. 4:15-16; Rev. 16:15; 14:14-16; Matt. 13:30). The majority of the remaining saints, who will be left after the rapture of the overcomers to pass through the three and a half years of the great tribulation, will be preserved in a place prepared by God for them in the wilderness for those three and a half years (Rev. 12:6, 14). Because they are preserved in a place prepared for them by God for those three and a half years, which is the entire length of time of the great tribulation, the rapture of the majority of the saints must be at the very end, the last day, of the great tribulation. Those who will be saved in Christ and have the testimony of Jesus during the great tribulation (Rev. 12:17) will all be included among the remaining saints, whom the Lord will remind of His coming in Revelation 16:15.</p>
<h2 class="head1">INSERTION IV.</h2>
<h2 class="head1">THE RAPTURE OF THE TWO WITNESSES&mdash;<br />
MOSES AND ELIJAH</h2>
<p class="indent1">At the end of the great tribulation, there will be also the rapture of the two witnesses&mdash;Moses and Elijah (Rev. 11:3-12). What they will do in Revelation 11:5-6 is just like the deeds of Moses and Elijah (Exo. 7:17, 19; 9:14; 11:1; 2 Kings 1:10-12; 1 Kings 17:1), who appeared before the Lord on the mount of transfiguration (Matt. 17:1-3). Moses, representing the law, and Elijah, representing the prophets (Luke 16:16), both testify for God. They are the two olive trees, the two sons of oil (Rev. 11:4) in Zechariah 4:3 and 11-14. They will prophesy a thousand two hundred and sixty days, when the holy city, Jerusalem, will be trampled by Antichrist for forty-two months (Rev. 11:3, 2). When they will have completed their testimony, Antichrist will war with them and kill them (Rev. 11:7). Their corpses will be on the street of the great city (Jerusalem) for three and a half days (Rev. 11:8-9). After the three and a half days, they will resurrect and be raptured in the cloud on the last day of their ministry of one thousand two hundred and sixty days, that is, on the last day of the great tribulation (Rev. 11:11-12). Since we have seen the insertions of the rapture of the majority of the saints and of the two witnesses, we come to the seven bowls, which are the negative contents of the seventh trumpet.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">___________________________________________________________</p><h2 class="head3">The Seven Bowls&mdash;the Third Woe,<br />
the Last Plagues of the Great Tribulation&mdash;<br />
the Negative Contents of the Seventh Trumpet</h2>
<p>We have seen that the contents of the seventh trumpet include the eternal kingdom of God and of Christ and the judgment of the dead. Now we need to see the seven bowls as the negative contents of the seventh trumpet. The seven bowls will be the third woe, the last plagues of the great tribulation (Rev. 11:14, 18a; 15:5-8; 16:1). The first woe is the fifth trumpet, the second woe is the sixth trumpet, and the third woe is the seven bowls of the seventh trumpet. Human words cannot describe how terrible these three woes will be.</p>
<p>The first four bowls are the consummating supernatural calamities to utterly damage men&rsquo;s habitation in the universe (Rev. 16:2-9). The first bowl will be God&rsquo;s further judgment on the earth, causing an evil and malignant sore upon the worshippers of Antichrist (Rev. 16:1-2). The second bowl will be God&rsquo;s further judgment on the sea, causing the sea to become blood and every living soul in the sea to die (Rev. 16:3). The third bowl will be God&rsquo;s further judgment on the rivers and springs, causing them to become blood that men have to drink (Rev. 16:4-7). The fourth bowl will be God&rsquo;s further judgment on the sun causing it to burn men with fire, and men being burned to blaspheme the name of God (Rev. 16:8-9). The fifth bowl will be God&rsquo;s ultimate judgment on the kingdom of Antichrist executed on his throne, causing his kingdom to become darkened and his people to gnaw their tongues for pain and blaspheme God for their sores (Rev. 16:10-11). The sixth bowl will be the damage on the great river Euphrates, causing it to dry up for the preparation of the way for the kings from the rising of the sun for the war at Armageddon (Rev. 16:12 with v. 16). Between the sixth and seventh bowls is the insertion of the preparation for the war at Armageddon.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">___________________________________________________________</p>
<h2 class="head1">INSERTION V.</h2>
<h2 class="head1">THE PREPARATION<br />
FOR THE WAR AT ARMAGEDDON</h2>
<p class="indent1">Three unclean demonic spirits like frogs out of the mouths of Satan, Antichrist, and the false prophet will go forth to gather the kings of the whole inhabited earth for the war at Armageddon on the great day of God (Rev. 16:13-16). During the gathering of the kings by the three unclean spirits, the Lord will remind the remaining living saints concerning His coming (Rev. 16:15). After this insertion of the preparation for the war at Armageddon is the seventh bowl.</p>
<p style="text-align:center">___________________________________________________________</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Seventh Bowl&mdash;the Concluding Plague<br />
of the Great Tribulation</h2>
<p>The seventh bowl will be the concluding plague of the great tribulation: the greatest earthquake and the great hail (Rev. 16:17-21). That earthquake will be the last earthquake in the whole universe and the biggest one. The earthquake will divide the great city&mdash;Jerusalem&mdash;into three parts and the cities of the nations will fall (Rev. 16:19a). Babylon the great (the material city of Rome) will be destroyed (Rev. 16:19b). Every island will flee and mountains will disappear (Rev. 16:20). The great hail (each weighing about one talent&mdash;approximately one hundred pounds) will smite men, and men will blaspheme God (Rev. 16:21).</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Giving of the Reward to the Overcomers, Judged at the Judgment Seat of Christ</h2>
<p>After the seven bowls is the giving of the reward to the overcomers, judged at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10; Rev. 11:18c). Right after the rapture of the majority of the saints, there will be the judgment seat. At the judgment seat, the Lord will give a reward to the overcomers. The marriage of the Lamb in Revelation 19:7-8 should be after the judgment seat of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The War at Armageddon</h2>
<p>After the judgment seat, the giving of the reward, and the marriage of Christ and His overcomers, He will come with His bride from the air to the earth (Matt. 24:27-28) to fight against and defeat Antichrist at the war of Armageddon (Rev. 16:14, 16). The war at Armageddon will be the last war of this age. At Armageddon Christ will tread the great winepress of the fury of God on the evildoers of the earth (Rev. 14:19-20). That war will be a winepress to press all the evildoers. Christ with His bride&mdash;the overcomers&mdash;will fight Antichrist, the ten kings, and their armies and overcome them within one hour (Rev. 17:12-14) to destroy the destroyers of the earth (Rev. 11:18d). Christ will cast Antichrist and his false prophet alive into the lake of fire (Rev. 19:19-20), into which the devil, Satan, whom they follow, will be cast also, to suffer the eternal torment by fire (Rev. 20:10). It is by this war that the nation of Israel with their holy city Jerusalem will be rescued from the siege of Antichrist, and at that time the whole house of Israel will repent to the Lord and be saved by Him (Zech. 12:10-14).</p><h2 class="head3">The Destruction of<br />
the Religious and Mysterious Babylon<br />
and of the Political and Physical Babylon</h2>
<p>The title Babylon is used in Revelation as a symbol in two aspects. In the first aspect, it symbolizes the apostate Roman Catholic Church as the religious and mysterious Babylon revealed in Revelation 17; and in the second aspect, it symbolizes the city of Rome as the political and physical Babylon revealed in Revelation 18. Both are evil and abominable in the eyes of God. Hence, God first will destroy the religious and mystical Babylon (Rev. 14:8), that is, the apostate Roman Church, by Antichrist at the beginning of the great tribulation when he will break the covenant with Israel (Dan. 9:27) and begin to persecute all religions (Dan. 8:11; 2 Thes. 2:3-4). At the end of the great tribulation, right after the war at Armageddon in the seventh bowl, God will also destroy the political and physical Babylon (Rev. 16:19), that is, the city of Rome.</p>
<p>By all that we have seen thus far, at the trumpeting of the seventh trumpet, all the following things will take place on the same day, the last day of the great tribulation of three and a half years:</p>
<p>1) The kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of God and of Christ.</p>
<p>2) The dead saints will be resurrected and will be raptured with the remaining saints to the air.</p>
<p>3) The two witnesses will be resurrected and raptured to the air. This will take place probably after the rapture of the majority of the saints or even at the same time.</p>
<p>4) Christ will judge all His saints at His judgment seat to reward the overcoming ones.</p>
<p>5) Christ will have His marriage with the overcoming saints.</p>
<p>6) Christ with His bride, the overcoming saints, will come down to the earth to defeat Antichrist and his army, destroy the destroyers of the earth at the war at Armageddon, and cast Antichrist and the false prophet into the lake of fire.</p>
<p>7) By the war at Armageddon, Christ will deliver the nation of Israel from the siege of Antichrist, and the whole house of Israel will repent and be saved.</p>
<p>8) The political and physical Babylon, the city of Rome, will be destroyed.</p>
<p>9) In the meantime, the seven bowls which constitute the last woe of the great tribulation will take place, and in the sixth bowl will be the war of Armageddon by which Antichrist and his army will be destroyed. The plagues of these seven bowls will be the negative contents of the seventh trumpet, which will be meted out by God on the same day, probably while the above-mentioned positive things will be taking place.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Binding of Satan and<br />
</em><em>His Being Cast into the Abyss</h2>
<p>After Christ has defeated and destroyed Antichrist and his followers, Satan will be bound and cast into the abyss, the bottomless pit. This is included in the seventh trumpet.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Judgment on the Nations</h2>
<p>The seventh trumpet also includes the judgment on the nations by Christ at His throne of glory in Jerusalem (Matt. 19:28; Jer. 3:17) to divide them into &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; to be the people in the millennial kingdom and &ldquo;goats&rdquo; to perish in the eternal fire (Matt. 25:31-46). This is the last judgment before God&rsquo;s judgment at the great white throne.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Setting Up<br />
of the Millennial Kingdom,<br />
the Last Rebellion of the Nations<br />
and Satan&rsquo;s Perdition in the Lake of Fire,<br />
the Eternal Judgment at the Great White Throne,<br />
and the New Heaven and New Earth as<br />
the Realm with the New Jerusalem<br />
as the Center of the Eternal<br />
Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>After this judgment on the nations, the Lord will set up the millennial kingdom, the kingdom of Christ for a thousand years (Rev. 20:4-6). At the end of the millennium, the nations, who are the people of the millennium on the earth, will be deceived by Satan who will then be loosed out of his prison to rebel against the Lord. The rebellious nations will be devoured by fire from heaven, and Satan, the devil, will be cast into the lake of fire to be tormented forever (Rev. 20:7-10). Then there will be the eternal judgment at the great white throne to judge all the dead unbelievers throughout all the centuries (Rev. 20:11-15). After that judgment, there will be the new heaven and new earth as the realm of the eternal kingdom of God with the New Jerusalem as the center of the eternal kingdom of God (Rev. 21&mdash;22). This is the conclusion of the seventh seal and of the seventh trumpet which will last forever. All these items are also the contents of the seventh trumpet which is the greater part of the seventh seal that will proceed forever. This fellowship with all the Scripture references should be a help to us in understanding the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls in relation to the rapture of the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WORD CONCERNING THE DAY,<br />
THE HOUR, AND THE YEAR</h2>
<p>In Matthew 24:36 the Lord said, &ldquo;Concerning that day and hour no one knows, neither the angels of the heavens, nor the Son, but the Father only.&rdquo; According to the context of this word, Matthew 24:32-44, &ldquo;that day and hour&rdquo; refers to the day and hour of the rapture of the overcomers into the secret section of His <em>parousia</em> (coming) in the third heavens. That day and hour no one knows but the Father only who keeps that day and hour in Himself as secrecy.</p>
<p>However, the year of the appearing of the public section of His <em>parousia</em> (coming) to the earth can be figured out according to the last week (seven years) of the seventy weeks revealed in Daniel 9:24-27. According to Daniel&rsquo;s prophecy, at the coming of the last week, Antichrist will make a firm covenant with Israel for seven years, and at the midst of the seven years, he will break that covenant and persecute the people of Israel and the remaining believers (Dan. 9:27). When the believers see the coming Antichrist making a covenant with the Jews for seven years, we can figure out, by the prophecies in Matthew 24:15-44; 1 Corinthians 15:51-52; 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17; 2 Thessalonians 2:1-8; and Revelation 6&mdash;16, the year of the rapture of the overcomers which should probably be in the first half of the fourth year of the last week, and the year of the rapture of the majority of the saints and of the two witnesses which will be the last year of the last week. We can even figure out the day of the rapture of the majority of the saints and the two witnesses which will be the last day of the last week as we have seen already in this message.</p>
<p>The Lord in Matthew 24:32-33 gives us some signs that we may know the period of His <em>parousia</em> which will be in the last part of the last week. The Lord says, &ldquo;Learn the parable from the fig tree: when its branch has already become tender and puts forth its leaves.&rdquo; The fig tree here symbolizes the nation of Israel which was condemned by the Lord to be dried up in Matthew 21:19, and the branch becoming tender and putting forth its leaves signifies the restoration of the nation of Israel which has taken place already. By this kind of sign, we have to realize that we are now in a time which is very close to the last week of the present age. Hence, we have to be more on the alert to get ourselves prepared for the Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> (coming).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SECOND COMING OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 24:3, 27, 37, 39; Rev. 12:5; 14:1-4; 2 Thes. 2:8; Rev. 1:7; Matt. 24:36-43; Rev. 10:1; 1 Thes. 4:16-17; Rev. 14:14-16; 2 Cor. 5:10; 1 Cor. 4:5; Matt. 25:19; Luke 19:15; Rom. 14:10, 12; Rev. 11:18b; Luke 14:14; Matt. 24:45-47, 50-51; 25:20-46; Luke 19:16-26; Rev. 19:7-9; Luke 14:8a; Matt. 22:2, 11-14; Zech. 12:9; Rev. 19:19-21; Matt. 24:28; Zech. 12:10-14; Rev. 19:11-21; 17:14; 14:17-20; Rom. 11:26-27; Dan. 7:13-14; Luke 19:12; Rev. 11:15; 20:4, 6</h1>
<p>We have seen that the apostles&rsquo; teaching is concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy from the incarnation of God to the consummation of the New Jerusalem. It is the entire teaching of the New Testament from the first page of Matthew to the last page of Revelation. The apostles&rsquo; teaching concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy includes the incarnation of the Triune God; the all-inclusive death of Jesus Christ; the resurrection of Jesus Christ; the ascension of Christ; the outpouring of the Holy Spirit for the baptizing of all His believers into one Body; the ministry of Christ in His ascension; the rapture of the saints; the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven bowls in relation to the rapture of the saints and the second coming of Christ; the second coming of Christ; the thousand-year kingdom; and the New Jerusalem. In this message we want to fellowship concerning the second coming of Christ. The second coming of Christ is a great subject. His first coming was in His incarnation, the incarnation of God. His second coming will bring His kingdom to the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROMISED <em>PAROUSIA</em><br />
(PRESENCE=COMING) OF CHRIST</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Christ&rsquo;s Complete Presence with His Believers</h2>
<p>The second coming of Christ is the promised <em>parousia</em> (presence=coming) of Christ. <em>Parousia</em> is the Greek word for <em>coming</em> (Matt. 24:3, 27, 37, 39) and means presence. This word was used for the coming (presence) of a dignified person. Before the Lord Jesus ascended, He promised that He would come again. Christ&rsquo;s second coming will be His presence with His people. The promised <em>parousia</em> is Christ&rsquo;s complete presence with His believers.</p>
<p>Even today we enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s presence, but it is not His complete presence. Today His presence is just in the Spirit, not physical. One day He will be with us not only in the Spirit but also physically. Today we can sense the Lord&rsquo;s presence, but we cannot see Him physically (1 Pet. 1:8). But one day we will see Him physically in resurrection. His second coming will be His complete presence with us. In Matthew 28:20, the Lord promised that He would be with us all the days. The Lord is with us today, but the unbelievers do not believe this because His presence with us is unseen. The day will come, however, when Christ will come openly to the earth, and all will see Him because His presence with us will be visible.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Beginning from the Rapture of the Man-child<br />
and the Firstfruit to the Heavens</h2>
<p>Christ&rsquo;s second coming, His <em>parousia,</em> begins from the rapture of the man-child and the firstfruit to the heavens (Rev. 12:5; 14:1-4) and ends with His appearing on the earth with His saints. His <em>parousia</em> will probably last about three and a half years. The Bible tells us that the end of this age will be a period of seven years, which is the last week of the seventy weeks mentioned in Daniel 9:24-27. The second half of these seven years, the last three and a half years of this age, will be the time of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21). Daniel 12:7 and Revelation 12:14 refer to these three and a half years as &ldquo;a time, and times, and half a time.&rdquo; Revelation 11:2 and 3 tell us that this tribulation lasts forty-two months, or a thousand two hundred and sixty days. This is about three and a half years. The Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> will last about the same time.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> will begin from the rapture of the man-child mentioned in Revelation 12:5. The universal woman in Revelation 12 signifies the totality of God&rsquo;s chosen people. She is clothed with the sun, the moon is underneath her feet, and on her head there is a crown of twelve stars. This means that although she is on the earth, she is a heavenly woman (see Rev. 12:1, note 1, Recovery Version). Out of God&rsquo;s chosen people, typified by this woman, a man-child will be born. That child is actually a corporate child, signifying the stronger part of God&rsquo;s people. The man-child is composed of the dead overcoming saints in both the Old and the New Testaments. Old Testament saints such as Abel, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob will be included in that man-child which will be raptured to the throne of God. Revelation 12 reveals that this rapture takes place before the three and a half years of the great tribulation (vv. 5-6).</p>
<p>The rapture of the living overcomers also takes place before the great tribulation. This is the rapture of the firstfruit of the believers seen in Revelation 14:1-4. These living overcomers are raptured to the heavenly Mount Zion (Heb. 12:22). They will be the first ripe ones in God&rsquo;s field. Hence, they will be reaped before the harvest as &ldquo;firstfruit to God and to the Lamb&rdquo; (Rev. 14:4). The Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> begins from the rapture of the overcomers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Ending with Christ&rsquo;s Appearing on the Earth</h2>
<p>This <em>parousia</em> of the Lord will end with Christ&rsquo;s appearing on the earth. Second Thessalonians 2:8 refers to the &ldquo;appearing of His coming.&rdquo; The appearing of the Lord&rsquo;s coming will be with a kind of shining. The appearing of Christ&rsquo;s coming is the shining of His <em>parousia.</em> Antichrist will be brought to nothing by the shining appearance of the Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia.</em> First, His <em>parousia</em> will be secret and hidden in the heavens. Then this <em>parousia</em> will be brought to the air on the way. Eventually, His <em>parousia</em> will have an appearing, and that shining appearing will bring the Antichrist to nothing.</p>
<p>The &ldquo;appearing of His coming&rdquo; is a particular term. This indicates that the Lord&rsquo;s coming is hidden before it appears openly. This also indicates that the Lord&rsquo;s coming involves a period of time. It will remain in secret, and then it will appear to the public. Matthew 24:27 says, &ldquo;For as the lightning comes forth from the east and shines to the west, so shall the coming of the Son of Man be.&rdquo; The lightning coming forth from the east and shining to the west means that the Lord&rsquo;s appearing will be around the globe. The lightning signifies the open aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Christ will be clothed with a cloud (Rev. 10:1) in the air for a time and then will suddenly appear like a flash of lightning to the earth.</p>
<p>His appearing on the earth will be seen by all men. Revelation 1:7 says, &ldquo;Behold, He comes with the clouds, and every eye shall see Him, those also who pierced Him, and all the tribes of the land shall wail over Him. Yes, amen.&rdquo; All the eyes on the earth shall see Him. The tribes mentioned here are the twelve tribes of the Holy Land who have pierced Him and who are referred to in Zechariah 12:10-14. These verses say that they shall look upon Him whom they have pierced and shall mourn for Him. When the Lord appears as lightning, coming with power and glory to be seen by all in the Holy Land, the twelve tribes will behold Him and weep. The Lord will appear as a flash of lightning and will set His feet upon the Mount of Olives (Zech. 14:4). He will descend to the very spot from which He ascended (Acts 1:11-12).</p><h2 class="head1">THE SECRET ASPECT OF CHRIST&rsquo;S <em>PAROUSIA</em>,<br />
PRESENCE, COMING, IN THE HEAVENS</h2>
<p>Matthew 24:36-43 describes what it will be like during the secret aspect of the Lord&rsquo;s coming in the heavens. If we do not have the concept of the secret aspect of His coming, we cannot understand these verses. Verse 37 says that the Lord&rsquo;s coming, <em>parousia,</em> will be as the days of Noah. This indicates that the Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> will be a period of time. This period will be as the days of Noah, that is, the situation of the Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> will be like that in the days of Noah.</p>
<p>Revelation 14:1 and 12:5 also refer to the secret aspect of Christ&rsquo;s coming in the heavens. Revelation 14:1 shows that Christ and the firstfruit, the hundred and forty-four thousand, are standing on Mount Zion in the heavens. Revelation 12:5 tells us that the overcomers will be raptured to where God is on His throne.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ON THE WAY OF HIS <em>PAROUSIA</em></h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> will travel. It will be on the way. His <em>parousia,</em> His presence, will travel from the throne of God in the third heaven to the air.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Being Clothed with a Cloud in the Air</h2>
<p>Revelation 10:1 reveals Christ coming down out of heaven and being clothed with a cloud in the air. At this time He is clothed with a cloud, not yet &ldquo;on the cloud&rdquo; as in 14:14 and Matthew 24:30 and 26:64. To be &ldquo;on the cloud&rdquo; is to come openly, whereas to be &ldquo;clothed with a cloud&rdquo; is to come secretly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Rapturing the Majority of the Believers<br />
into the Clouds in the Air</h2>
<p>Christ will linger in the air for a while to do a number of things. First, He will rapture the majority of the believers into the clouds. First Thessalonians 4:16 and 17 say, &ldquo;Because the Lord Himself, with a cry of command, with the voice of an archangel, and with a trumpet of God, will descend from heaven, and the dead in Christ shall rise first; then we who are living, who remain, shall be caught up at the same time together with them in clouds into a meeting of the Lord in the air; and so we shall be always together with the Lord.&rdquo; These verses refer to the rapture of the majority of the believers, including all the dead saints of the Old Testament.</p>
<p>The man-child and the firstfruit, the overcomers, will be raptured to the third heavens before the last three and a half years of the great tribulation. The man-child will be raptured to the throne of God in the heavens, and the firstfruit will be raptured to Mount Zion in the heavens. But the majority of the saints will be raptured into the clouds in the air. They will be raptured after Christ&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> travels from the third heavens to the air. While Christ is lingering in the air, He will rapture all of His believers. Verse 17 says that the majority of the believers will be &ldquo;caught up...in clouds into a meeting of the Lord in the air.&rdquo; As believers in Christ, we should all expect to be raptured, but do we expect to be raptured to the throne or to the air? The throne is higher than the air. The throne of God is the peak. To climb a mountain to reach its peak is not so easy. If we want to be raptured to the throne, we must overcome.</p>
<p>While the <em>parousia</em> of Christ is lingering in the air, Christ raptures the majority of the believers. They are the harvest, not the firstfruit. The firstfruit is mentioned at the beginning of Revelation 14 (vv. 1-5), and the harvest is mentioned near the end (vv. 14-16). Between the firstfruit and the harvest is the three and a half years of the great tribulation (vv. 6-13). Revelation 14 tells us four things: the rapture of the firstfruit to Mount Zion in the heavens, the manifestation of Antichrist to damage the world, the harvest of the majority of the believers near the end of the great tribulation, and the gathering of the grapes (the evil doers) for the great winepress at the end of the great tribulation (vv. 17-20). Wheat in typology signifies God&rsquo;s people, but grapes signify the evil persons, which include Antichrist and the evil, worldly forces, whom Christ will destroy at Armageddon (Rev. 16:13-16).</p>
<h2 class="head2">Judging All the Saints at His Judgment Seat</h2>
<p>After this rapture of all God&rsquo;s chosen people in both the Old and New Testament times, Christ will judge all the saints at His judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10; 1 Cor. 4:5; Matt. 25:19; Luke 19:15; Rom. 14:10, 12). Many believers think that when Christ comes again, everything related to them will be all right. Surely, if we are overcomers, everything will be wonderful to us when He comes. But what if we are defeated Christians? Matthew 24 and 25 reveal that if the Lord&rsquo;s slaves are faithful, He will reward them. But if they are not faithful, they will be punished. Matthew 24 says that the evil slave will have his portion with the hypocrites, where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth (vv. 48-51). In Matthew 25 the Lord tells a parable of a man going into another country and distributing talents to all his slaves. To one he gives five talents, to another two, and to another one. When he comes back, he asks his slaves to give him an account. In this parable, the slaves with five and two talents fully used their gift and doubled what their master gave them (vv. 16-17). But the slave with one talent went away and hid his talent in the earth (v. 18). The Lord said that this useless slave will be cast out into the outer darkness where there shall be weeping and gnashing of teeth (v. 30). When the Lord comes back, He will ask His slaves to give Him an account at His judgment seat. Many Christians will have problems when they appear before the judgment seat of Christ. In Matthew 12 the Lord said that men shall have to give an account in the day of judgment concerning every idle word that they speak (vv. 36-37). If we always gossip and criticize others, what will be our situation at the judgment seat of Christ?</p>
 <p>The term &ldquo;the judgment seat of Christ&rdquo; is found in 2 Corinthians 5:10. Romans 14:10 calls this judgment seat &ldquo;the judgment-seat of God.&rdquo; The judgment seat of Christ is the judgment seat of God. In 1 Corinthians 4:5 Paul said that we should not judge anything before the time when the Lord comes. This verse indicates that the Lord will judge everything at His judgment seat. Matthew 25:19 and Luke 19:15 both show that the Lord&rsquo;s servants will render an account to Him, and He will either reward or punish them. The judgment at Christ&rsquo;s judgment seat will be for reward to the overcomers (Rev. 11:18b; Luke 14:14; Matt. 24:45-47; 25:20-23; Luke 19:16-19). It will also be for punishment of the defeated believers (Matt. 24:50-51; 25:24-30; Luke 19:20-26).</p><h2 class="head2">Marrying His Overcomers</h2>
<p>The third thing the Lord will do during His <em>parousia</em> in the air will be to marry His overcomers (Rev. 19:7-9). At His judgment seat, He will make clear who the overcomers and the defeated ones are. He will marry the overcomers, leaving the defeated ones in shame, in a position of punishment to be disciplined. Because the defeated ones are not perfected, they need to be disciplined. The marriage of Christ to His overcomers will be on the way of His <em>parousia</em>.</p>
<p>Following the wedding is the wedding feast. This wedding feast will be the kingdom of a thousand years (Luke 14:8a; Matt. 22:2, 11-14). The feast will last one thousand years, which is one day in the eyes of God (2 Pet. 3:8). The entire kingdom is a feast. We should remember that on the way of His <em>parousia,</em> Christ will do three things: rapture the majority of the saints, judge all the saints at His judgment seat, and marry His overcomers. This also, as the part of the Lord&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> in the third heavens, is the secret aspect of His coming in the air.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OPEN ASPECT OF CHRIST&rsquo;S <em>PAROUSIA,</em><br />
PRESENCE, COMING, TO THE EARTH</h2>
<p>Now we come to the open aspect of Christ&rsquo;s<em> parousia,</em> presence, coming, to the earth. As we have seen in Matthew 24:27, Christ&rsquo;s <em>parousia</em> will be like the lightning coming forth from the east and shining to the west. His coming will be around Jerusalem where Antichrist and his armies will be (Zech. 12:9; Rev. 19:19-21; Matt. 24:28). Zechariah 12:9 says that at that time the Lord will destroy all the nations that come against Jerusalem. Revelation 19 tells us that Christ as the heavenly Warrior with His married bride will defeat Antichrist, the kings under him and their armies, and the false prophet at Armageddon (vv. 11-21; 16:14, 16). Matthew 24:28 says, &ldquo;Wherever the corpse is, there the vultures shall be gathered together.&rdquo; Antichrist and his evil armies, who will war against the Lord at Armageddon, will be, in the eyes of the Lord, the corpse good for the vultures&rsquo; appetite. Both the Lord and those who trust in Him are likened to the vultures, eagles (Exo. 19:4; Deut. 32:11-12; Isa. 40:31), and the swift destroying armies are also likened to the flying eagles (Deut. 28:49; Hosea 8:1&mdash;NASB). Therefore, the vultures here, raptorial of the eagle kind, must refer to Christ and the overcomers, who will come as a swift flying army to war against Antichrist and his armies and destroy them, thus executing God&rsquo;s judgment upon them at Armageddon.</p>
<p>The open aspect of Christ&rsquo;s coming will be at Jerusalem, where the tribes of Israel will be (Zech. 12:10-11; Rev. 1:7). As we have seen, Christ, together with His newly married overcomers, will come to defeat and destroy Antichrist and his followers (Rev. 19:11-21; 17:14; 14:17-20). His coming will be to save the whole house of Israel. Romans 11:26-27 and Zechariah 12:10-14 describe this. When Christ returns, the house of David, the whole house of Israel, will repent and be saved by Christ.</p>
<p>His coming will also be to judge the nations, to prepare the &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; to be the people on the earth in the millennium. Matthew 25:31-46 shows that when Christ comes in His glory, all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will divide the sheep from the goats. By doing this Christ prepares the sheep to be the people on the earth in the millennium.</p>
<p>In the open aspect of Christ&rsquo;s coming, He will cause Satan to be bound and cast into the abyss (Rev. 20:1-3). The abyss is a bottomless pit into which Satan will be cast and bound for one thousand years. Christ&rsquo;s coming will also bring His kingdom to the earth and establish it as the kingdom of a thousand years (Dan. 7:13-14; Luke 19:12; Rev. 11:15; 20:4, 6). In Daniel 7:13 and 14, we are told that Christ as the Son of Man comes to God the Father to receive the kingdom from Him. Luke 19:12 also tells us this. After He receives the kingdom, He comes back with the kingdom. Revelation 11:15 says that at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ. The Lord will establish His kingdom on earth as the kingdom of a thousand years.</p>
<p>This message presents a brief yet full and proper picture of the second coming of Christ. We have to realize that there will be different judgments given by the Lord during and after His second coming. The main judgment will be the judgment concerning who will enjoy eternal salvation and who will suffer eternal perdition. This judgment will occur at the great white throne after the millennium (Rev. 20:11-15). In John 5:29 the Lord calls this &ldquo;the resurrection of judgment.&rdquo; But there will be another judgment at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10) before the millennium. This judgment is not concerning our eternal salvation or eternal perdition. This judgment is concerning our reward or punishment. We have to be clear about these types of judgment.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM OF A THOUSAND YEARS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 20:4-6; Matt. 24:46-47; 25:19-23; Luke 19:15-19; Rev. 2:26-27; 3:21; 2 Tim. 2:12a; Matt. 13:43; Acts 15:16; 1:6; Matt. 13:41; Rev. 11:15; 2 Sam. 7:13; Rom. 11:26-27; Zech. 12:10; Ezek. 36:25-28; Zech. 8:20-23; Isa. 2:2-3; Acts 3:21; Matt. 25:32-34; 2 Tim. 4:1, 18b; Matt. 24:48-51; 25:26-30</h1>
<p>In the previous messages, we saw the truth concerning the second coming of Christ. In this message we want to see the truth concerning the kingdom of a thousand years revealed in Revelation 20:4-6. It is generally called the millennium.</p>
<p>The kingdom of a thousand years is different from the New Testament church. There are no Old Testament saints in the church age, but in the kingdom of a thousand years, the overcoming Old Testament saints are present with the overcoming New Testament saints. The kingdom of a thousand years includes Old Testament saints such as Abraham, Noah, Moses, David, and Elijah. These were some of the ones who were overcoming in the Old Testament times.</p>
<p>Just before the Lord was transfigured on the mount, He told His disciples, &ldquo;There are some of those standing here who shall by no means taste death until they see the Son of Man coming in His kingdom&rdquo; (Matt. 16:28). This was fulfilled by the Lord&rsquo;s transfiguration on the mountain (17:1-3), which was His &ldquo;coming in His kingdom.&rdquo; It was seen by His three disciples, Peter, James, and John. Furthermore, Moses and Elijah were there conversing with the Lord. His transfiguration there prefigured the coming kingdom. Moses and Elijah represent the Old Testament overcomers who will be in the manifestation of the kingdom, whereas Peter, James, and John represent the New Testament overcomers. The ones selected to reign as kings in the kingdom of a thousand years will be the overcomers, the perfected ones.</p>
<p>The history of man from the creation of Adam can be divided into four ages. The first age is the age of the patriarchs from Adam to Moses. The time of the patriarchs was before the law was given, so we can term it the age before the law. It began from the creation of Adam and concluded at the time that Moses received the law and passed the law on to the children of Israel. The second age is the age of law. This age comprises the period of time from Moses to Christ&rsquo;s first coming. The church age follows the age of the law. The church age began at the day of Pentecost with the outpouring of the Holy Spirit for the baptizing of all the believers into one Body and continues to the beginning of the thousand-year kingdom. In the church age, God works Himself into man. God is presently working Himself into us every day. The coming kingdom age will be the result of God&rsquo;s work in the church age.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HEAVENLY SECTION</h2>
<p>The kingdom of a thousand years has two sections: the heavenly section and the earthly section. The heavenly section of the kingdom of a thousand years is the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens (Matt. 24:46-47; 25:19-23; Luke 19:15-19; Rev. 2:26-27; 3:21; 2 Tim. 2:12a). The kingdom of the heavens has three aspects: the reality, the appearance, and the manifestation. The reality of the kingdom of the heavens, depicted in Matthew 5&mdash;7, is within us. The appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, depicted in Matthew 13, is with today&rsquo;s Christianity. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, depicted in Matthew 24 and 25, will be the thousand-year kingdom. The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens is the heavenly part of the thousand-year kingdom.</p>
<p>The heavenly section of the kingdom of a thousand years is the kingdom of the Father (Matt. 13:43). The Father has a royal family. All of His children who have been faithful will be kings in His kingdom. That kingdom will be a dear family to the Father. The firstborn Son of the Father, Jesus, is the first king. He is the firstborn Son, and we are the many sons, His brothers. All the brothers will be kings in the Father&rsquo;s kingdom as the Father&rsquo;s home. Matthew 13:43 says, &ldquo;Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father.&rdquo; Christ and the overcoming saints will be the kings in the heavenly section of the kingdom of a thousand years.</p>
 <h2 class="head1">THE EARTHLY SECTION</h2>
<p>The earthly section of the thousand-year kingdom will be the tabernacle of David. Acts 15:16 says, &ldquo;After these things I will return, and I will rebuild the tabernacle of David which has fallen; and I will rebuild its ruins, and I will erect it again.&rdquo; The term that is used to denote the kingdom of Israel is <em>the tabernacle of David.</em> God considers the kingdom of Israel in the millennium as a tabernacle, which is something temporary rather than permanent.</p>
<p>The earthly section of the kingdom of a thousand years is also the restored kingdom of Israel (Acts 1:6) and the kingdom of the Son of Man (Matt. 13:41; Rev. 11:15). The heavenly part of the kingdom of a thousand years is the Father&rsquo;s kingdom. The earthly part is the Son&rsquo;s kingdom. Matthew 13:41 says, &ldquo;The Son of Man shall send His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all stumblingblocks and those who do lawlessness.&rdquo; Revelation 11:15 says, &ldquo;And the seventh angel trumpeted; and there were loud voices in heaven, saying, The kingdom of the world has become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ, and He shall reign forever and ever.&rdquo; This word reveals that when the thousand-year kingdom comes, the entire earth will be the kingdom of Christ.</p>
<p>The heavenly section of the thousand-year kingdom will be the Father&rsquo;s kingdom, and the earthly section will be the Son&rsquo;s so that He might rule over the earth. The earthly section of the kingdom of a thousand years is also the kingdom of Messiah (2 Sam. 7:13). A king is the ruler of the people in a kingdom. In the kingdom of a thousand years, the dwelling place of the King is in the heavens, and the dwelling place of the people is on the earth.</p>
<p>In the earthly section of the kingdom of a thousand years, the saved Israelites will be the priests, and the restored nations will be the people. When the Lord returns openly to the earth, the Spirit will be poured out as the latter rain upon the house of Israel, and they will repent and be saved (Zech. 12:10; Rom. 11:26-27; Ezek. 36:25-28). Following this, the Lord will judge the remaining nations, the Gentiles, and restore the good ones, the &ldquo;sheep&rdquo; (Matt. 25:31-32), to be the people in the thousand-year kingdom. As the priests, the Israelites will teach the nations as the people to know God, to serve God, and to worship God (Zech. 8:20-23; Isa. 2:2-3). This is according to the Old Testament type. The Gentile nations will come up to Jerusalem to the Jews, seeking after the Lord and asking to be taught.</p>
<p>The kingdom of a thousand years will be the age of restoration (Acts 3:21). Before the Lord&rsquo;s return, there will be the great tribulation of three and a half years. At that time the earth will become an unpleasant place in which to dwell. Many people will follow the Antichrist. At the end of the great tribulation, Christ will come to defeat Antichrist and destroy all his followers at Armageddon. After this battle, there will still be a large number of people left among the nations. Then the Lord Jesus will set up His throne in Jerusalem (Matt. 19:28; Jer. 3:17) to judge all the nations who are left. Matthew 25:31-46 tells us that at that time the nations will be gathered before the Lord, and He will separate them as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. The goats are the evil ones who will be sent to the lake of fire (vv. 41-46a). The good ones are the sheep. These will enter into eternal life in the thousand-year kingdom (vv. 34-40, 46b). They will be on the earth as the people.</p>
<p>In the kingdom of a thousand years there will be a heavenly section with the overcomers of the Old Testament and of the New Testament. There will be an earthly section that will be the tabernacle of David, the kingdom of Christ as the Son of Man, and the kingdom of Messiah. In the earthly section, all the Jews will have been saved and regenerated, but they will have missed the age of the church. God will keep them in the earthly section to be His priests teaching all the restored nations. The nations who are the people in the earthly section of the thousand-year kingdom will not have been saved but only restored back to their created situation. They will be the people in the earthly section of the kingdom of a thousand years. Thus, the kingdom of a thousand years will be a kingdom with kings, with priests, and with people. If we are the overcomers, we will be in the heavenly section of the kingdom of a thousand years as kings; the saved, regenerated Jews will be the priests; and the restored nations will be the people.</p><h2 class="head1">WHAT THE HEAVENLY SECTION<br />
OF THE KINGDOM OF A THOUSAND YEARS SHOULD BE<br />
 TO THE BELIEVERS IN THE PRESENT AGE<br />
AND WHAT IT WILL BE TO THE BELIEVERS<br />
IN THE COMING AGE</h2>
<p>The heavenly section of the kingdom of a thousand years should be an exercise and encouragement to the New Testament believers in the present age (2 Tim. 4:1, 18b; 2:12a). The manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, which will be the heavenly section of the thousand-year kingdom, is the reward, the prize, to the overcomers. It is also an exercise. Today many Christians are saved and love the Lord to some extent. They believe this to be sufficient. They are grateful for the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace but lack a strong exercise to pursue the Lord.</p>
<p>If we know the truth, we will not be so complacent because we realize there is a reward set before us. Olympic athletes go through rigorous training and exercise in order to win the prize. If they do not exercise, they will miss the prize for which they are striving. Many Christians will miss the Lord&rsquo;s reward because of their complacency.</p>
<p>Second Timothy was Paul&rsquo;s last letter. In the first chapter, he said that all the believers who were in Asia had forsaken him (2 Tim. 1:15). They had forsaken his ministry. Some, such as Hymenaeus and Philetus, had spoken words that were like gangrene to damage and infect the saints (2 Tim. 2:17). Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to Paul (2 Tim. 4:14) to damage his ministry. Even Demas, who had been Paul&rsquo;s co-worker, forsook him (2 Tim. 4:10). These situations are very disappointing, but despite these sufferings Paul had the Lord&rsquo;s appearing and His kingdom in view. In 2 Timothy 4:1 Paul told Timothy, &ldquo;I solemnly charge you before God and Christ Jesus, who is about to judge the living and the dead, and by His appearing and His kingdom.&rdquo; The coming kingdom will either be a reward to us or we will miss it. In 2 Timothy 4:18 Paul declared, &ldquo;The Lord will deliver me from every evil work, and will save me unto His heavenly kingdom, to whom be the glory forever and ever. Amen.&rdquo; This was a triumphant declaration by Paul, yet in the same chapter he told us that he was going to be martyred: &ldquo;For I am already being poured out, and the time of my departure is at hand&rdquo; (v. 6). Paul realized that Caesar Nero might kill him, but that meant nothing to him because the Lord would save him into His kingdom. This is both the exercise and the encouragement related to the kingdom.</p>
<p>On the one hand, the thousand-year kingdom should be an exercise to us, and on the other hand, it should be an encouragement to us. Someday we will be examined and measured concerning whether we will get the reward of the kingdom or miss it and receive some punishment. This is a very serious matter. The heavenly section of the kingdom of a thousand years will be a reward to the overcoming believers and a loss as a punishment to the defeated believers. Matthew 24:46-47 and 25:19-23 show the Lord&rsquo;s reward to His faithful servants. Matthew 24:48-51 and 25:26-30 show how the unfaithful ones, the defeated slaves of Christ, will be punished. When Christ comes back, the defeated ones will be cast out into the outer darkness where there is weeping and gnashing of teeth (25:30).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KINGDOM OF A THOUSAND YEARS<br />
AS THE KINGDOM AGE TO BE USED<br />
FOR THE LORD TO DISCIPLINE AND PERFECT<br />
THE DEFEATED SAINTS</h2>
<p>If we are not the overcoming ones in this age, we will be the defeated ones who will be punished. The punishment to the unbelievers is one of condemnation and perdition. However, to the defeated believers, the punishment is a discipline. The Lord will discipline the defeated ones to perfect them. We may have been Christians for years without being perfected. If we have not been perfected in the present age, we will miss the reward and receive a punishment as a discipline to perfect us in the coming age.</p>
<p>This is similar to a student who desires to graduate, but is not qualified to graduate at the time of graduation. The school may require him to remain for another term in order to graduate. The extra term is a punishment or discipline to him. The discipline helps to perfect him so that he can become a graduate. If we do not graduate in the Christian life in this age, the Lord will require us to learn some hard lessons in the next age. Eventually, we have to graduate. If we graduate earlier, that is, in this age, we will get the reward in the next age. If we graduate later, there will be some suffering, but we will still graduate. All Christians will graduate sooner or later. After the thousand-year kingdom age, all the chosen people of God, both those of the Old Testament and those of the New Testament, will have been perfected by being disciplined and will be qualified to enter the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Actually, the heavenly section of the thousand-year kingdom is also the New Jerusalem in the thousand-year kingdom. This is according to the Lord&rsquo;s promise in Revelation 3:12: &ldquo;He who overcomes, I will make him a pillar in the temple of My God, and he shall by no means go out anymore, and I will write upon him the name of My God and the name of the city of My God, the New Jerusalem, which descends out of heaven from My God, and My new name.&rdquo; The mentioning of the New Jerusalem as a prize to the overcomer indicates that this promise will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom. The New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom will be a prize only to the overcoming saints, whereas the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the common portion of all the redeemed for eternity. Thus, the overcomers will enter into the New Jerusalem a thousand years earlier than the defeated believers. Those who are defeated in this age will delay their entry into the New Jerusalem by a thousand years.</p>
<p>The Bible tells us that God has two creations&mdash;the old creation and the new creation. God uses the old creation as the material to produce the new creation. Before being saved we were all a part of the old creation. When we repented and believed in the Lord Jesus, we were regenerated. This caused us to become a part of the new creation (2 Cor. 5:17), but with us there are still many things related to the old creation. This is why we need to be perfected. To be perfected means to get rid of the old creation and to grow up in the new creation every day.</p>
<p>The church age is wonderful because God is working Himself into us. As God works Himself into us for His new creation, His new creation is increasing. The increasing of the new creation is discharging the part in us that is of the old creation. In our physical life, as we eat and drink, we are continually being supplied with new elements. As these new elements are added into us, the old elements are discharged. In our spiritual life, the new creation increases so that the old creation can be discharged. Sometimes we are not that submissive or obedient, so we need some discipline from the Lord. This is to help us be renewed to be more of the new creation and have the old creation reduced. If during this age we are still not that submissive, the Lord will deal with us in the next age. He will tolerate us until the next age, the thousand-year kingdom, so that He can resume His discipline on us. During that time He will put the unfaithful, defeated believers into a &ldquo;dark room&rdquo; to suffer punishment. But the overcoming believers will be in glory to reign as kings.</p>
<p>The coming age, the age of the thousand-year kingdom, will still be an age that is in the old creation. The first age in the old creation was the age of the patriarchs. This age was used by God to select some patriarchs for His kingdom. Following the age of the patriarchs was the age of the law, in which God perfected many faithful overcomers from among the children of Israel, His redeemed people. If we read the Old Testament carefully, we will realize that some Old Testament saints such as Jacob and David were disciplined by the Lord. Although Jacob was a supplanter, he was transformed into Israel (Gen. 32:28). Israel means &ldquo;prince of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The age of the church, the age of grace, follows the age of the patriarchs and the age of the law. Today in the church we enjoy grace, but we are also under training. If we are not obedient to God, He will have some discipline prepared for us in the next age. Even the Apostle Paul had some suffering that was a discipline to him. His thorn in the flesh was such a suffering to him that he entreated the Lord for it to depart from him (2 Cor. 12:7-8). If we are not submissive in cooperating with God&rsquo;s grace and discipline in this age, God will discipline us in the next age. God uses four ages in the old creation to perfect His chosen people to get them saved, regenerated, transformed, and eventually transfigured to be the overcomers. God has assigned four ages to gain His new creation out from the old creation.</p>
<p>We should not think that the thousand-year kingdom age will be altogether glorious. It will be glorious for the overcomers, but not for the defeated believers. We must consider our situation. Even the Apostle Paul felt that he was not wrong in anything, yet he would not dare to judge himself. He said that the One who judges is the Lord (1 Cor. 4:3-5). He will judge us at His judgment seat (2 Cor. 5:10). The decision will be made there concerning whether we will enter into glory or suffer loss in the thousand years (1 Cor. 3:14-15). The decision will be made concerning whether we will reign with Him or whether we will suffer without Him. What that decision will be depends upon how we have behaved ourselves in the Lord in this age. This is a very sober warning to us, and it is quite unveiling. Everyone who believes in Him has been regenerated. Still, we must run the race to win the prize.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 9:24-25 Paul says, &ldquo;Do you not know that those who run in a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize? So run, that you may lay hold. And everyone who contends exercises self-control in all things; those, therefore, that they may receive a corruptible crown, but we an incorruptible.&rdquo; As we run the race, we must run with the prize in view that we may lay hold of it. It was not until the last moment of the Apostle Paul&rsquo;s running, in 2 Timothy 4:6-8, that he had the assurance that he would be rewarded by the Lord at His appearing. In the light of this prize, Paul charged the Corinthian believers to run the race that they may obtain the reward. This is the apostles&rsquo; teaching.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE NEW JERUSALEM</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 21:1&mdash;22:5, 14-15</h1>
<p>In previous messages we have fellowshipped concerning the rapture of the saints; the seven seals, seven trumpets, and seven bowls in relation to the rapture of the saints and the second coming of Christ; the second coming of Christ; and the kingdom of a thousand years. In this message, we want to see the New Jerusalem as the consummation of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The hardest part of the holy Word to understand is the part concerning the New Jerusalem. We need to remember, however, that it is the conclusion of the apostles&rsquo; teaching and also the conclusion of the entire Bible.</p>
<p>This message will be a short summary of the truth concerning the New Jerusalem. If we want to know more of the crucial details concerning the New Jerusalem, I would suggest reading chapters twenty-six through forty-four in the book entitled <em>God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy</em> published by Living Stream Ministry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FINALIZATION OF THE COMPLETED<br />
DIVINE REVELATION OF THE ENTIRE SCRIPTURE</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem is the finalization of the completed divine revelation of the entire Scripture&mdash;the aggregate of the fulfillment of all the prophecies, types, figures, and foreshadows. It is the conclusion of the entire apostles&rsquo; teaching, beginning from the incarnation of God. The purpose of God&rsquo;s incarnation was to produce the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the enlargement, the expansion, of God. Before creation God merely possessed divinity. But the New Testament reveals that God has been processed and consummated. The New Jerusalem is the consummation of the processed and consummated Triune God. Such a New Jerusalem is the enlargement of God with the divine element, the human element, the death of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, and the ascension of Christ compounded and mingled together with His chosen, redeemed, transformed, and glorified people.</p>
<p>In eternity past, God was single. But at the end of Revelation, He has a bride. Revelation 19 shows us the Lamb&rsquo;s marriage and His marriage dinner (vv. 7-9). God has a corporate wife, and this corporate wife includes men from every tribe and tongue and people and nation (5:9). The aspect of the church as the wife of Christ is ultimately consummated in the New Jerusalem. In her, God will have the fullest satisfaction in love and the utmost rest in expression for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSUMMATION OF GOD&rsquo;S<br />
NEW CREATION WORK THROUGHOUT<br />
THE AGES OF THE OLD CREATION</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem will also be the consummation of God&rsquo;s new creation work throughout the ages of the old creation (2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15; Eph. 2:15; 4:24; Col. 3:10). In the universe God has had two kinds of works: the work of the old creation and the work of the new creation. In Genesis 1 and 2 we see that God has finished His old creation work. Then from Genesis 2 onward to the end of the Bible, there is a new creation to be produced out of the old creation. In 2 Corinthians 5:17, we are told that whoever is in Christ is a new creation. This new creation work goes on through the four ages of the old creation.</p>
<p>The first age of the old creation was the age before the law from Adam until Moses. That age was to produce the forefathers (of the Old Testament saints) as a part of God&rsquo;s new creation, signified by the stars on the head of the universal woman (the aggregate of God&rsquo;s chosen people) in Revelation 12:1. They were a part of the old creation, but they were redeemed and transformed to become a part of God&rsquo;s new creation. The second age of the old creation is the age of the law, from the giving of the law to the coming of Christ as grace. The age of the law was to produce the Old Testament saints as a great part of God&rsquo;s new creation, signified by the moon under the feet of the universal woman in Revelation 12:1. The moon is under the feet of the woman, for the age of the moon was the age of the law, which should not be exalted as the stars. But through that law, the Old Testament saints were produced to become the new creation as a part of God&rsquo;s chosen people. The third age is the age of grace, from the first coming of Christ to His second coming, to produce the New Testament saints as the biggest and the consummating part of God&rsquo;s new creation, signified by the sun around the body of the universal woman in Revelation 12:1.</p>
<p>The woman in Revelation 12 is a universal woman because with her are the stars, the moon, and the sun. All these are heavenly. That woman is the aggregate of God&rsquo;s chosen people, signifying the entire body of God&rsquo;s chosen people in three parts: the forefathers, the Old Testament saints under the law, and the New Testament saints under grace. The forefathers are signified by the stars, the Old Testament saints under the law are signified by the moon, and the New Testament saints are signified by the sun. This picture shows that the Old Testament saints, as the stars and the moon, were in the night, but we New Testament saints, as the sun, are in the day.</p>
<p>The last age of the old creation is the age of the kingdom, from the second coming of Christ to the end of the millennium, to mature the immature saints. We should believe that at least some among us are mature, but the majority of us are not mature. If the Lord Jesus came today, the mature ones would be ready, but what would the immature ones do? These ones are like unripened wheat yet to be harvested. They need to be under the scorching sun to be ripened. The scorching sun matures the wheat. But the scorching is suffering. This scorching will take place during the great tribulation. The common teaching in Christianity says that when the Lord Jesus comes back, all the believers will be happy. Surely the mature ones will be happy. The good students who prepared their lessons adequately will be happy on the day of graduation because they will graduate. But those who do not graduate will have to make up their lessons.</p>
<p>God has prepared four ages in the old creation to produce the forefathers, the Old Testament saints under the law, and the New Testament saints under grace. But many of these saints will not have grown adequately. Without adequate growth, they are not mature. One day either we will die or the Lord will come back. If we are not mature, God has a way to deal with us, to help us to mature. This is logical. To become mature in this age requires us to pay the price. But the price that we pay today compared with the price which we will have to pay in the coming age is much less. We should choose to mature in this age. If we do not mature in this age, we will eventually mature. But we will have to mature at the price of passing through some dealing, some punishment.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus will rapture the ones who mature first before the three and a half years of the tribulation. They will not have to pass through the tribulation. But according to 1 Corinthians 15:52, 1 Thessalonians 4:15-17, and Revelation 14:14-16, the majority of the saints will be raptured at the last trumpet. The last trumpet will be at the end of the great tribulation. This is a strong proof that the majority of the living believers will pass through the time of trial of the three and a half years of the great tribulation. The age of the kingdom will also be used by the Lord to mature the immature saints. This age will still be a part of the old creation, but it will be restored (Acts 3:21; Matt. 19:28).</p><h2 class="head1">THE COMPOSITION IN A SMALLER SCALE<br />
OF ALL THE OVERCOMING AND MATURE SAINTS<br />
AS A REWARD TO THEM IN THE KINGDOM AGE</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem will be the composition in a smaller scale of all the overcoming and mature saints as a reward to them in the kingdom age (Rev. 2:7b). This will include the overcomers in the Old Testament and the overcomers in this age. After the Lord Jesus comes back, these overcomers, who will be justified at the Lord&rsquo;s judgment seat, will be rewarded. Their reward will be the New Jerusalem, which includes them. That stage of the New Jerusalem in the kingdom of one thousand years will be a particular portion as a reward to the overcoming and mature saints. This is strongly proven by Revelation 2:7. In this verse the Lord says, &ldquo;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God.&rdquo; The paradise of God here refers to the New Jerusalem in the kingdom age. Furthermore, Revelation 3:12 indicates that the New Jerusalem will be a prize to the overcomers in the millennial kingdom. The New Jerusalem in the millennial kingdom will be a prize only to the overcoming saints, whereas the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will be the common portion to all the redeemed saints for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BRIDE TO MARRY<br />
THE CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD<br />
AND THEN BECOME THE WIFE OF THE LAMB</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem will be the bride to marry the consummated Triune God and will then become the wife of the Lamb (Rev. 21:2, 9b). The bride in Revelation 21 is the totality of all of God&rsquo;s redeemed people through the four ages of the old creation. By this time all the immature ones will be matured. Everyone will be perfected. All the redeemed people of God will be matured after the kingdom of a thousand years. They all will be the bride. The bride in the new heaven and the new earth will not be as she was in Revelation 19. She was then composed of the overcomers only. But the bride in Revelation 21 will be enlarged to include all of God&rsquo;s people. This bride will be the wife of the Lamb for eternity. We must remember that the New Jerusalem is not a literal, physical city. Actually, that city will be a person&mdash;the wife of the Lamb.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ETERNAL TABERNACLE<br />
AS GOD&rsquo;S HABITATION AMONG MEN</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem will be the eternal tabernacle as God&rsquo;s habitation among men (Rev. 21:3). The New Jerusalem will be a mutual habitation for both God and us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ETERNAL TEMPLE<br />
(THE LORD GOD THE ALMIGHTY<br />
AND THE LAMB THEMSELVES)<br />
FOR GOD&rsquo;S REDEEMED<br />
TO WORSHIP HIM WITHIN IT</h2>
<p>This New Jerusalem will be the eternal temple (the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb Themselves) for God&rsquo;s redeemed to worship Him within it (Rev. 21:22). The tabernacle will be the chosen people of God, and the temple will be the Triune God. We will be the tabernacle for God to dwell in, and the Triune God will be the temple for us to dwell in and worship Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE COMPOSITION OF ALL GOD&rsquo;S CHOSEN<br />
AND REDEEMED PEOPLE</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem will be the composition of all God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people, including all the saved Israelites under God&rsquo;s old covenant and all the believers of God&rsquo;s new covenant, as a common portion to all God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people in eternity (Rev. 21:12-14). As we have pointed out, the New Jerusalem in the millennium is a reward. In the new heaven and new earth, the New Jerusalem will be a common portion to all God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people in eternity. This is proven by verses 12-14 in Revelation 21, which say that the New Jerusalem bears the names of the twelve tribes and the names of the twelve apostles. The twelve tribes represent the Old Testament saints, and the twelve apostles represent the New Testament saints. This presents a clear view that the entire New Jerusalem is a total composition of the Old Testament saints under God&rsquo;s first covenant and all the New Testament saints under God&rsquo;s second covenant, the new covenant.</p><h2 class="head1">BUILT WITH THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem is built with the processed Triune God, typified by gold, pearls, and precious stones (Rev. 21:18-21). These precious materials typify the Triune God in His Trinity. The Father in His nature is as gold. This gold is for the base of the city, and this base rises up as a high mountain. This high mountain holds the entire city that is built upon it. The New Jerusalem is a city built upon a gold mountain, and that gold signifies God&rsquo;s divine nature. Therefore, God&rsquo;s divine nature will be the base as a mountain to hold all God&rsquo;s people built together on it.</p>
<p>The Son in His redemptive and regenerating work is seen in the pearls. Pearls are produced by oysters in the waters of death. When the oyster is wounded by a particle of sand, it secretes its life-juice around the sand and makes it a precious pearl. This depicts Christ as the living One coming into the death waters, being wounded by us, and secreting His life over us to make us precious pearls for the building of God&rsquo;s eternal expression. The twelve gates as the entrance to the holy city are twelve pearls. These gates bear the names of the twelve tribes of Israel, and at the gates are twelve angels. &ldquo;Israel&rdquo; here represents the law of the Old Testament. This signifies that the entry into the city is according to the requirements of the law through the redemption of the Son, under the observation of the angels. There will be twelve angels at the twelve gates watching to insure that everyone who comes in is according to the requirement of the law.</p>
<p>The city is also built with precious stones. The Spirit in His transforming work is typified by precious stones for the city&rsquo;s wall and its foundation, which bears the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb, signifying that the foundation of the city is the consummation of the Spirit&rsquo;s transforming work based upon the Son&rsquo;s redemption. The Spirit works to transform the redeemed and regenerated saints into precious stones for the building of God&rsquo;s eternal habitation that they may express God corporately in His permeating glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Square City</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem is a square city with three gates on each of the four sides, signifying the mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man (Rev. 21:13). Three signifies the Triune God, and four signifies man as the leading one in God&rsquo;s creation. Thus, three times four is the mingling of divinity with humanity, the mingling of the Triune God with the tripartite man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Measurement of the City</h2>
<p>The measurement of the city is twelve thousand stadia in three dimensions, signifying that the entire city is the Holy of Holies as God&rsquo;s habitation (Rev. 21:16). The length, the width, and the height of the city are the same. The dimensions of the Holy of Holies, both in the tabernacle and the temple, were also equal in length, breadth, and height (Exo. 26:2-8; 1 Kings 6:20). This shows that the entire New Jerusalem will be the Holy of Holies.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Glory of God in the Lamb<br />
Being the Light of the City</h2>
<p>The glory of God in the Lamb is the light of the city for its shining, in which the nations shall walk (Rev. 21:11, 23-24a). Christ is the lamp of the holy city, and God within Him is the light as the glory.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Measurement of the Wall of the City</h2>
<p>The measurement of the wall of the city is a hundred and forty-four cubits, twelve times twelve, signifying the absolute perfection and eternal completion of the absolute perfections and eternal completions in God&rsquo;s eternal administration, through the mingling of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man, for the holy separation of the city in resurrection (21:17). The number twelve signifies perfection and completion in God&rsquo;s administration. Therefore, twelve times twelve is the absolute perfection and eternal completion of absolute perfections and eternal completions in God&rsquo;s eternal administration. The mingling of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man is also indicated by the number twelve because twelve is three times four. This mingling is for the holy separation of the city because the wall is a separation, and the separation is a protection. The city being in resurrection is signified by the statement&mdash;&ldquo;a measure of a man, that is, of an angel.&rdquo; This means that the man and the angel are the same. According to the Lord&rsquo;s word in Matthew 22:30, it is in resurrection that man will be like the angels.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Wall of the City Being of Jasper</h2>
<p>The wall of the city being of jasper means that the city has God&rsquo;s appearance. In Revelation 4:3, God is sitting on the throne, and His appearance is like jasper. According to 21:18a, the entire wall surrounding the city is jasper. Therefore, the appearance of the New Jerusalem is just the appearance of God. This means that the New Jerusalem will fully express God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Twelve Colors of the Foundation of the City</h2>
<p>The twelve colors of the foundation of the city appear as a rainbow, signifying God&rsquo;s ever-remaining faithfulness (21:19-20). Thus, the entire city is built upon and secured by God&rsquo;s faithfulness in keeping His covenant (Gen. 9:8-17).</p><h2 class="head1">THE THRONE OF GOD AND THE LAMB<br />
WITH THE RIVER OF WATER OF LIFE<br />
AND THE TREE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem has God&rsquo;s throne with God and the Lamb (the redeeming God) sitting on it on the peak of the city. Out of this throne proceeds a river (the consummated Spirit) of water of life in its unique spiral street (the ministering communication) to water the whole city (for its drink). The tree of life (the life-supplying Christ) as a great vine grows on the two sides of the river to nourish the entire city (for its food). All of this is seen in Revelation 22:1-2.</p>
<p>The river of water of life in the New Jerusalem signifies the consummated Spirit. Eventually, God&rsquo;s Spirit will be a river. This river of water of life is in the city&rsquo;s unique spiral street. In the whole city there is only one street. The street with the river spirals down the mountain to reach every part of the city and all its twelve gates. The street is the communication that ministers something to us. This is the ministering communication to water the whole city for the city&rsquo;s drink. The tree of life, the life-supplying Christ, is a great vine growing on the two sides of the river to nourish the entire city for its food. God&rsquo;s throne is for His government, the river is for our watering, and the tree of life is for our nourishment. The river signifies the consummated Spirit, and the tree signifies the life-supplying Christ. The Triune God governs the entire city, serves the entire city, waters the entire city, and feeds the entire city.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL GOD&rsquo;S REDEEMED AND TRANSFORMED PEOPLE<br />
AS KINGS WITHIN THE CITY AND<br />
THE PURIFIED NATIONS AS THE PEOPLE<br />
OUTSIDE THE CITY</h2>
<p>All God&rsquo;s redeemed and transformed people are kings within the city to reign over the new heaven and new earth as the realm of God&rsquo;s eternal kingdom (22:5b). All the believers will be a big royal family. All of us will be kings, not mere citizens. We will be a governing class. The kingdom is the city, and the new heaven and new earth will be the realm of the kingdom. The restored and purified nations will be the people outside the city (21:24-26).</p>
<p>At the Lord&rsquo;s coming back, the last day of His <em>parousia,</em> His coming to the earth, He will destroy Antichrist, his armies, and the false prophet. They will be the most evil people on earth. God will gather them together into a great winepress, the war at Armageddon, to destroy them.</p>
<p>After Christ destroys all these evil ones, He will set up His throne in today&rsquo;s Jerusalem to gather all the nations who are left and to judge them (Matt. 25:32-46). He will separate them as a shepherd separates the sheep from the goats. They will be judged based upon how they have treated the Lord&rsquo;s brothers during the great tribulation. The sheep are those who have helped the Lord&rsquo;s brothers, the Jews and the Christians, during the three and a half years of the great tribulation. These sheep will inherit the kingdom prepared for them from the foundation of the world. Those of the nations who treated Christ&rsquo;s brothers poorly will be considered as the goats. They will go directly to the lake of fire, just like Antichrist and the false prophet. The nations who are the sheep will be in the new earth as the people of God for eternity. They will be the restored and purified nations as the people outside the city, who are not redeemed and regenerated to have the uncreated life of God, but who are restored in their created life to its original state, preserved forever by the leaves of the tree of life (Rev. 22:2b). The fruit of the tree of life will be our food on which we live. But the leaves of the tree of life will be the healing element to sustain the restored nations forever.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A CITY FULL OF LIVING WATER</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem is a city full of living water as the eternal dwelling of the Triune God with His redeemed people in contrast with a lake full of burning fire as a prison of Satan, the Devil, with his followers for eternity (20:10; 21:8; 22:15). The issue of the entire history of the universe will be a city full of living water and a lake of burning fire outside the city. The city will be God&rsquo;s dwelling. The lake will be Satan&rsquo;s prison. All God&rsquo;s lovers will be with God in the city full of living water. All the followers of Satan will be with Satan in the lake of burning fire.</p></body></html>
