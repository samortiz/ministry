<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>We have seen in volume 4 of Level 3 that in the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of transformation, the believers experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity corporately by entering into the kingdom of God, by living in the church, and by living in the Body of Christ. The believers experience this dispensing also by putting on the new man and by wrestling against the devil and his spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies. In this volume we will consider the believers&rsquo; experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in other aspects and the issue of the experience and enjoyment of the Divine Trinity. This lesson covers the believers&rsquo; experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God in serving and worshipping God.</p>
<p>We need to experience the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in other aspects, including serving and worshipping God, working and laboring for the Lord, not loving the world, overcoming Satan, fighting the good fight, running the course of the race, being profited by all things in our circumstances and environment, having the best attitude toward others, having the highest standard of morality and virtues, and watching and praying. Very few Christians realize that for all these matters we need the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. Furthermore, we need to see that in order to carry out these matters, we need God&rsquo;s divine supply, which is given to us through His divine dispensing.</p>
<p>For all the requirements revealed in the New Testament that are related to the believers, we need to receive the divine supply through the divine dispensing of the processed Triune God. Without this dispensing we cannot receive the supply, and without this supply we cannot fulfill the requirements in the New Testament. Some may think that it is easy and natural to worship God. Actually, we cannot truly worship God, that is, render the worship that satisfies God, that is accepted by Him as a real pleasure to Him, without God being dispensed into us. Through this divine dispensing we can worship God in a way that satisfies Him.</p>
<p>In like manner, apart from the divine dispensing of the processed Triune God, we cannot be humble or meek. The meekness required in the New Testament is much higher than that required by human teachings concerning morality, ethics, and human virtues. In society there are many teachings concerning such matters as humility, meekness, gentleness, and love. But it is impossible to meet the requirements of humility, meekness, gentleness, and love as revealed in the New Testament by our natural being. We need another being&mdash;the being of the processed Triune God dispensed into our being and even constituted into our being. Therefore, it is altogether necessary for us to contact the processed Triune God so that we may receive His supply through His dispensing of Himself into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. SERVING AND WORSHIPPING GOD</h2>
<p>In the New Testament serving God is actually the same as worshipping God. We cannot serve God without worshipping Him. Neither can we worship Him without serving Him. According to Matthew 4, to worship actually means to serve (vv. 9-10). Hence, to worship God is to serve God. First Thessalonians 1:9 says that we serve a living and true God. In this verse <em>serve</em> means &ldquo;to serve as a slave.&rdquo; Hence, our service to God includes everything that we do in our daily living. Furthermore, the fact that we are serving a living God proves that we are in God the Father (v. 1). If we were not in the Father, we would not be able to serve a living God.</p>
<p>To serve the living God is to say that God is living to us and in us; He is living in our speech, in our behavior, and in every aspect of our daily life. Our present living is a testimony that the God whom we serve is living. He is living in us, and He controls us, directs us, and deals with us. In certain matters, even in such small things as our thoughts and motives, He will not let us go; rather, He corrects and adjusts us. This is a proof that He is living. It is also a proof that we are worshipping and serving the living God. We, as proper believers in Christ, must live a life that bears the testimony that the God whom we worship and serve is living in the details of our life. Our reason for not doing or saying certain things should be that God is living in us. The God whom we worship and serve is living not only in the heavens but also in us. No doubt, when God is living to us in our experience, He is also true.</p><h2 class="head2">A. With Their Conscience Purified<br />
from Dead Works</h2>
<p>The conscience is the leading part of the believers&rsquo; spirit. When they come to serve and worship God, they need to have a pure conscience, a conscience purified from dead works or from any kind of offense. To worship in dead religion, in our mind, or to serve any dead thing rather than God does not require our conscience to be purified. However, the God whom we desire to serve is righteous, holy, and living. He comes to our spirit (John 4:24) always by touching our conscience. Thus, our defiled conscience needs to be purified by the blood of Christ so that we may depart from dead works to serve and worship the living God in a living way.</p>
<p>In the eyes of God we were dead (Eph. 2:1; Col. 2:13); thus, whatever we did, bad or good, was dead works in the sight of the living God (Heb. 9:14). Now, in order to touch this living God, we need to exercise our spirit and to have a blood-purified conscience. The blood of Christ was shed for the forgiveness of sins (Matt. 26:28). On the cross Christ offered Himself to God in a human body through the eternal Spirit (Heb. 9:14). Therefore, His blood has an eternal efficacy. Moreover, this blood has accomplished an eternal redemption for us (v. 12; Eph. 1:7; 1 Pet. 1:18-19), washed us from all our sins (1 John 1:7), and purified our conscience so that we may serve and worship the living God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. In Their Spirit in the Gospel of God&rsquo;s Son</h2>
<p>The believers serve and worship God in their spirit in the gospel of His Son (Rom. 1:9). The word <em>serve</em> in this verse means to &ldquo;serve in worship&rdquo; of God, as used in Matthew 4:10, 2 Timothy 1:3, Philippians 3:3, and Luke 2:37. Thus, if we would serve God and worship Him, we must do so in our spirit for the preaching of the gospel of God&rsquo;s Son. New Testament service and worship are carried out in the preaching of the gospel. Therefore, our preaching of the gospel is not merely a work; it is our worship and service to God.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the gospel is the all-inclusive Christ Himself (Acts 5:42). The gospel in the first four books of the New Testament&mdash;Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John&mdash;concerns Christ in the flesh as He lived among His disciples before His death and resurrection, that is, the Christ outside of us. The gospel in Romans concerns Christ as the Spirit, that is, the Christ within us. Now the Spirit of life who indwells us is simply Christ Himself, who is in us (8:2). This Christ is deeper and more subjective than the Christ in the four Gospels. He is the subjective Savior in His believers.</p>
<p>The gospel includes forgiveness and salvation, but these are not the central point. The central point of the gospel is Christ, the Son of God. The gospel is not a doctrine or a teaching or a religion. The gospel is a wonderful person&mdash;Jesus Christ, the Son of God with His divinity and His humanity. God desires to transform sinners in the flesh into sons of God in the spirit by dispensing Himself through Christ into them. If we would serve God in the gospel, we should make this same matter our goal. We preach the gospel not simply that people may be saved or be forgiven of their sins or become spiritual but so that they may become sons of God.</p>
<p>If we would serve God in the proper way, we need to serve Him in the gospel. Therefore, in addition to knowing the central point of the gospel, we need to learn to serve in our spirit. Only in Romans did Paul say that he served God in his spirit, because in Romans he is arguing with religious people who invariably serve in something other than the spirit&mdash;in letters, forms, or doctrines. Whatever we do toward God must be done in our spirit; whatever we are and have must also be in our spirit. Preaching the gospel is absolutely a matter of using our spirit. Paul repeatedly refers to being in spirit. He says that the genuine people of God must be in spirit and that true circumcision is in the spirit (2:29), that we should serve God in newness of spirit (7:6), and that we must be burning in spirit, serving the Lord (12:11).</p>
<p>To serve and worship God in spirit is to learn how to minister the gospel to others, that is, how to function as priests in ministering the gospel of God (15:16). Whenever we contact anyone, whether a believer or an unbeliever, we need to know his need as far as the gospel is concerned so that we can help him to be clear concerning salvation and even joyful in God&rsquo;s salvation. In this way we can serve others properly with the gospel. The crucial point in serving God in our spirit in the gospel of His Son is that we minister Christ to others in the gospel. For this, we need to learn the elements and details of the gospel, we need to experience the full content of the gospel, and we need to exercise our spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">C. By the Spirit of God</h2>
<p>The believers serve God not only in their spirit; they serve Him also by the Spirit of God (Phil. 3:3). All the New Testament believers are priests to God (1 Pet. 2:9; Rev. 1:6). Hence, our ministry to the Lord, in whatever aspect, is a priestly ministry. As priests, we must serve God and worship Him in our spirit and by His Spirit. Whenever we get into our spirit, we also get into the Spirit of God. Likewise, when we worship God by the Spirit of God, we also worship Him in our spirit.</p>
<p>The only acceptable service and worship that we can render to God is not by the flesh but by the Spirit of God. The Spirit is the means for the believers to serve and worship God. Judaic worship and service involve the flesh and the various regulations related to it, such as dietary laws, keeping the Sabbath, and circumcision, all of which cannot be acceptable to God. Whereas the Judaizers serve by ordinances of the law related to the flesh, we as New Testament believers serve and worship God in our spirit by the Spirit of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. In Spirit and Truth</h2>
<p>Also, the believers serve and worship God in spirit and truthfulness (John 4:23-24). According to typology the worship of God should be in the place chosen by God to set His habitation (Deut. 12:5, 11, 13-14, 18) and with the offerings (Lev. 1&mdash;6). The place chosen by God for His habitation typifies the human spirit, where God&rsquo;s habitation is today (Eph. 2:22). The offerings typify Christ. Christ is the fulfillment and reality of all the offerings with which God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament worshipped Him.</p>
<p>Therefore, a crucial matter we need to see is that genuine worship, the worship God the Father is seeking, is not in a certain place but in the human spirit. In the Old Testament Mount Zion, the place of God&rsquo;s habitation and the place of His name, is a type of the human spirit. According to the New Testament, God&rsquo;s habitation is not on any mountain nor in the heavens; God&rsquo;s habitation is in our spirit. If we go anywhere else to worship God, it indicates that we have given up God&rsquo;s name. There is only one place where we can be preserved in God&rsquo;s name&mdash;our spirit. When we come to our spirit, we keep God&rsquo;s name, and we are preserved in His name.</p>
<p>The genuine worship of God the Father is also in truthfulness, reality. In the Old Testament the children of Israel were required to worship God on Mount Zion with the offerings. The offerings typify Christ as reality. Christ is the fulfillment and the reality of all the offerings with which God&rsquo;s people worshipped Him. Christ is the genuine sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering. Today we worship God in our spirit with Christ as the reality of all the offerings. This is the genuine worship of the Father as well as the worship that He desires.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Having No Confidence in Their Flesh</h2>
<p>Finally, in serving and worshipping God, the believers should have no confidence in the flesh (Phil. 3:3). We may think that to trust in the flesh simply means to trust in the fallen human nature. But the flesh actually comprises all that we are and have in our natural being. When Paul was a Judaizer, he trusted in his natural birth and qualifications, such as being circumcised on the eighth day, being of the race of Israel and the tribe of Benjamin, and being a Hebrew born of Hebrews. According to law, he was a Pharisee; according to zeal, he persecuted the church; and according to the righteousness in the law, he was blameless (vv. 4-6). All these things were aspects of Paul&rsquo;s flesh. Hence, we should not trust in such things. Everything that Paul did according to the law and according to zeal was the flesh and was of the flesh; even his righteousness according to the law was flesh. This is because such things are natural and are neither of Christ nor of the Spirit of God. This indicates that the flesh includes not only evil things but also the honorable, lovable, and superior aspects of our natural being.</p>
<p>The Judaizers trusted in their flesh, trusting in what they were by their natural birth. But Paul says strongly that we who believe in Christ serve by the Spirit of God, boast in Christ Jesus, and have no confidence in the flesh. In order to render genuine service and worship to God, everything that we do must be by the Spirit of God, in Christ, and with no trust in the flesh. Although we are not Judaizers, in principle we may actually be the same as the Judaizers. Even though we have been regenerated, we may continue to live in our fallen nature, boast in what we do in the flesh, and have confidence in our natural qualifications. Therefore, we need the Lord&rsquo;s light to shine on us concerning our nature, our deeds, and our confidence in the flesh. If we are enlightened by the Lord, we will see that we still live too much in the flesh, we will confess how unclean our nature is, and we will condemn everything that we do by our fallen nature. Then we will no longer trust in our natural qualifications, ability, or intelligence. After we are enlightened in this way, we will truly serve and worship God in our spirit and by the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the believers experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity not only by entering into the kingdom of God, by living in the church&mdash;the Body of Christ, by putting on the new man, and by wrestling against the devil and his spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies. The believers experience this dispensing also in their service and worship of God.</p>
<p>We cannot truly worship God, that is, render worship that satisfies God, that is accepted by Him as a real pleasure to Him, without God dispensing His divine essence into us. Through this divine dispensing we can worship God in a way that satisfies Him. We need to be reminded repeatedly that we serve and worship God through the dispensing of the processed Triune God. Serving God is actually the same as worshipping God. The God whom we serve and worship is the living and true God. Therefore, God must be living to us and in us in every aspect of our daily life. When God is living to us in our experience, He is also true.</p>
<p>When we come to serve God or worship God, we need to have a pure conscience, a conscience purified from dead works or from any kind of offense. The living God, whom we desire to serve, comes to our spirit always by touching our conscience. The blood of the Lord cleanses our sins and purifies our conscience so that we may serve and worship God. We serve and worship God in our spirit in the gospel of His Son. New Testament service and worship are carried out in the preaching of the gospel by our being in our spirit. This gospel is the all-inclusive Christ, the Son of God. Therefore, the crucial point in serving God in our spirit in the gospel of His Son is that we minister Christ to others in the gospel by exercising our spirit. We serve God not only in our spirit but also by the Spirit of God. The only acceptable service and worship that we can render to God is not by the flesh but by the Spirit of God. We serve and worship God in spirit and truth. The worship that God the Father is seeking is not in a certain place but in the human spirit. Christ is the genuine sin offering, trespass offering, burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering. Today we worship God in our spirit with Christ as the reality of all the offerings. Finally, in serving and worshipping God we should have no confidence in our flesh. As believers in Christ, we should not trust in anything that we have by our natural birth, for everything of our natural birth is part of the flesh. In order to render genuine service and worship to God, everything we do must be by the Spirit of God, in Christ, and with no confidence in the flesh.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>We have seen in the previous lesson that the believers can experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in serving and worshipping God. In this lesson we will see that the believers need to experience this dispensing also in working and laboring for the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. WORKING AND LABORING<br />
FOR THE LORD</h2>
<p>The believers serve and worship God, and they work and labor for the Lord. In 1 Corinthians 15:58 Paul said to the Corinthians, &ldquo;Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord.&rdquo; According to the context of this verse, Paul is dealing with the matter of resurrection (vv. 1-58). This indicates that the truth of resurrection causes us to be filled with hope concerning our future, and it also causes us to be filled with faith in the work of the Lord with the expectation of pleasing the Lord in resurrection at His coming back.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being by the Lord&rsquo;s<br />
Resurrection Life and Power</h2>
<p>The believers work and labor for the Lord by the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection life and power, not by our natural life and ability. Paul worked and labored for the Lord by His resurrection life and power, as indicated in verse 10: &ldquo;By the grace of God I am what I am; and His grace unto me did not turn out to be in vain, but, on the contrary, I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me.&rdquo; Grace, mentioned three times in this verse, is actually the resurrected Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit (v. 45) to bring the processed Triune God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply that we may live in resurrection. It is by this grace that Saul of Tarsus, the foremost of sinners (1 Tim. 1:15-16), became the foremost apostle, laboring more abundantly than all the other apostles. His ministry and living by this grace are an undeniable testimony to Christ&rsquo;s resurrection.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not I but the grace of God&rdquo; equals &ldquo;no longer I...but... Christ&rdquo; in Galatians 2:20. The grace that motivated the apostle and operated in him was not some matter or thing but a living person, the resurrected Christ, the embodiment of God the Father becoming the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit, who dwelt in him as his everything. It was by this grace that Paul could be what he was. Throughout the centuries all the servants of the Lord have had this resurrected Christ living in them. We can testify that He lives in us, enabling us to do what we could never do in ourselves.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Not Being in Vain</h2>
<p>Our labor for the Lord in His resurrection life with His resurrection power will never be in vain (1 Cor. 15:58). Rather, our labor will result in fulfilling God&rsquo;s eternal purpose through preaching Christ to sinners, ministering life to the saints, and building up the church with the experiences of the processed Triune God as gold, silver, and precious stones (3:12). Our labor will also be rewarded by the returning Lord in the day of the resurrection of the righteous (1 Cor. 3:14; Matt. 25:21, 23; Luke 14:14).</p>
<p>First Corinthians 15:58 speaks of something in resurrection and is closely related to resurrection. If we are in resurrection, this verse applies to us. But if we are not in resurrection, we may mistakenly think that this verse encourages us to strive and to be energetic. Based on verses 1 through 57, Paul encourages the believers to be steadfast, immovable, and always abounding in the work of the Lord. According to the natural life, we can be shaken even by a small thing. Only by the resurrection life in us can we be steadfast, immovable, and always abounding in the work of the Lord. Furthermore, resurrection also causes us to know that our labor in the Lord is not in vain. Therefore, resurrection not only encourages us; it also motivates us to do the work of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Preaching Christ as the Gospel to Sinners<br />
by Preaching the Word of God</h2>
<p>After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the apostles did not cease preaching the gospel of Jesus as the Christ (Acts 5:42). They went throughout the land preaching God&rsquo;s word as the gospel, that is, proclaiming the Lord Himself as the gospel (8:4-5). As the believers work and labor for the Lord, they preach Christ as the gospel to sinners by preaching the word of God. Furthermore, they need to preach in season and out of season, that is, whether or not the situation is convenient and whether or not they are welcome (2 Tim. 4:2).</p>
<p>In 2 Timothy 4:2 Paul charged Timothy to proclaim the word. This word includes what Timothy had learned both of Paul and of the Old Testament (3:14-16). Thus, Timothy was not merely to teach a word about salvation but also to speak a completing word regarding God&rsquo;s revelation concerning Christ and the church. Such a healthy word is the truth, the reality of the contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. We should also be charged to be ready to proclaim the word of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy in season and out of season.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Casting Out Demons<br />
in the Lord&rsquo;s Name and Healing the Sick<br />
by Laying Hands on Them</h2>
<p>Those who work and labor for the Lord should cast out demons in the Lord&rsquo;s name and heal the sick by laying hands on them (Mark 16:17-18). We should not think that since we are not in favor of the Pentecostal movement, we do not care for casting out demons and for healing the sick. On the contrary, we care for these things, but we should not practice them as particular items in our work. The particular items of our work are Christ and the church with the Spirit and the divine life. Nevertheless, as we preach the gospel in certain places, we shall encounter cases of demon possession. It is our duty to cast out the demons, to drive away the devilish power. There is no need for us to be asked to cast out a demon. Immediately, without being asked, we should fulfill our duty to cast out demons. If we meet those who are sick, we should wait to be asked before we lay hands on them for healing. If a sick person asks us to heal him by the laying on of hands in the name of the Lord and by prayer, we should do this, leaving the matter of healing to the Lord. Quite often we will see the healing; sometimes, however, we will not see the healing. Therefore, we should leave the matter of the actual healing to the Lord. However, we should be reminded to not allow the two items of casting out demons and healing the sick to surpass the main items of the gospel, which are Christ and the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Ministering Christ as Life<br />
to the Saints with the Nourishing Words<br />
of the New Testament Faith</h2>
<p>The believers also have to be good ministers of Christ Jesus, ministering Christ as life to the saints with the nourishing words of the New Testament faith (1 Tim. 4:6). A minister of Christ does not mainly denote a minister who belongs to Christ, preaches Christ, teaches Christ, or tells others about Christ; instead, it denotes a person who ministers Christ to others, that is, serves others with Christ, ministering Christ as Savior, life, life supply, and every positive thing. Such a person differs from a teacher of the law and of other things (1:7, 3).</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 4:6 Paul does not say &ldquo;being taught&rdquo; but &ldquo;being nourished,&rdquo; indicating that his concept is that of supplying life to others. However, if we would minister Christ to others, we first must be nourished ourselves. Having been nourished with Christ, we will have Christ as food, as the life supply, to minister to others. Therefore, the words <em>being nourished</em> remind us that the work of a good minister of Christ is indeed a matter of life and is for the growth in life. As we minister to others, we need to exercise our spirit not to just pass on knowledge, but while giving forth a certain kind of knowledge, to supply something nourishing to others so that they may gain the rich Christ as food.</p>
<p>If we have a heart to care for others in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we should not give them mere teaching but should exercise our spirit to minister spiritual food so that they may be nourished. With Paul and Timothy we see an excellent pattern. Today we should follow Timothy&rsquo;s example. We first have to digest the Lord&rsquo;s words, assimilate them, and allow them to saturate our inner being. Then we will be able to lay before the brothers the words with which we have been nourished by the Lord through the ministry. In 4:6 Paul specifically speaks of &ldquo;the words of the faith&rdquo; and the words of &ldquo;the good teaching.&rdquo; The words of the faith are the words of the full gospel concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The words of the good teaching are the sweet words that contain and convey the riches of Christ to nourish, edify, and strengthen His believers. Actually, the words of the faith and the words of the good teaching refer to the same thing.</p>
<p>Many lovers and seekers of the Lord Jesus have lost the enjoyment of Christ because they have been deceived and frustrated. We should be deeply burdened by this matter. We must find a way to supply them with food and share with them the spiritual riches that the Lord has provided us. We must take up the burden to be good ministers of Christ, serving others with His riches. We first must be nourished and then minister this nourishment to all the people of God. If we would nourish others, we ourselves must follow closely the words of the faith and the words of the good teaching and be nourished with them. If a mother nourishes herself properly, she will know how to feed her children with healthy food. The nourishing food that the nursing mother eats and digests becomes the milk with which she nourishes her baby. As good ministers of Christ, we first must be nourished with the words of the faith and of the good teaching which we have closely followed, and then we shall be able to nourish others by ministering Christ as life to them. How wonderful the church life will be if we all do this!</p><h2 class="head2">F. Shepherding the Saints as the Flock of God<br />
according to God, That Is, according to<br />
God&rsquo;s Nature, Desire, Way, and Glory</h2>
<p>Through their experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the believers should shepherd the saints as the flock of God according to God, that is, according to God&rsquo;s nature, desire, way, and glory. In Acts 20:28 Paul reminded the elders in Ephesus to shepherd the church of God. The main responsibility of the elders as overseers is not to rule over the flock but to shepherd the flock, to take all-inclusive tender care of the flock, the church of God. Shepherding the flock of God requires suffering for the Body of Christ as Christ suffered (Col. 1:24). This kind of shepherding enables the elders to be rewarded with the unfading crown of glory (1 Pet. 5:4).</p>
<p>Peter also said, &ldquo;Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God&rdquo; (v. 2). To shepherd according to God means to shepherd according to God&rsquo;s nature, desire, way, and glory, not according to man&rsquo;s preference, interest, and purpose. The elders should not shepherd the flock according to their own opinion, concepts, or likes and dislikes. Instead, they should shepherd the saints as the flock of God according to God&rsquo;s choice, desire, intention, and preference.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Building Up the Church<br />
with the Experiences of<br />
the Processed Triune God<br />
as Gold, Silver, and Precious Stones</h2>
<p>The believers need to build up the church with the experiences of the processed Triune God as gold, silver, and precious stones (1 Cor. 14:4, 12; 3:12). In 1 Corinthians 3:12 Paul speaks of building on the foundation with three kinds of precious materials&mdash;gold, silver, and precious stones. This is very meaningful because these materials correspond to the three of the Divine Trinity. As a precious element, gold signifies something that does not change or become corrupt in nature, referring to the first of the Divine Trinity, God the Father. Hence, gold, which always remains the same, signifies the nature of God the Father. Silver signifies Christ the Son, the second of the Divine Trinity, and the redemption accomplished by Him. Precious stones are transformed substances; hence, they refer to the third of the Divine Trinity, the Spirit with His transforming work (2 Cor. 3:18).</p>
<p>The reason there is so little building among Christians today is that few believers experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God in the way of being transformed and conformed. If the believers do not care for the experience of the Triune God, they cannot build up the church. Although a good number of believers are in the denominations and are actually members of the church, they have been usurped and misused to be a part of only a denomination, an organization. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we are not building up any kind of organization; we are building up an organism&mdash;the Body of Christ&mdash;by being constituted with the Triune God, that is, by experiencing Him as gold, silver, and precious stones.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. With Prayer and Fasting</h2>
<p>As the believers work and labor for the Lord, sometimes they must pray and fast in order to deal with the power of darkness by casting out demons that insist on remaining (Matt. 17:21). In order to deal with the power of darkness, there is the need of the exercise of the authority of the heavenly King. As the heavenly King, the Lord Jesus has such authority, but we need to pray, even with fasting, to execute the Lord&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p>Concerning prayer, Acts 1:14 shows that after the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, the disciples &ldquo;all continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer.&rdquo; God needs His chosen people to pray regarding what He has promised to do in His New Testament economy. God in heaven needs men on earth to cooperate with Him for the carrying out of His plan. Prayer is also related to the ministry of the word (6:4). Prayer is not only to entreat the Lord to do things for His move. Prayer is also to cause our spirit to be exercised and strengthened. Hence, prayer should precede the ministry of the word. Without such prayer, the ministry of the word may not be enlivened and empowered.</p>
<p>In Acts 13:2 the prophets and teachers in Antioch were ministering to the Lord and fasting. They were not conferring with men, nor were they forming an organization; rather, they were fasting and ministering to the Lord. They were ministering to the Lord directly. This means that, spiritually speaking, they were not at the altar in the outer court but were at the incense altar in the Holy Place. In the Old Testament the priests ministered at two places. When they served the people of God, they ministered at the altar in the outer court, offering sacrifices to God for the people. But when they served the Lord directly, they were at another place&mdash;the incense altar in the Holy Place&mdash;ministering directly to the Lord through their prayers.</p><h2 class="head2">I. Being Rewarded by the Returning Lord<br />
in the Day of the Resurrection of the Righteous</h2>
<p>The believers who work and labor for the Lord will be rewarded by the returning Lord in the day of the resurrection of the righteous (Luke 14:14; John 5:29; Rev. 20:4-6; 11:18; 1 Cor. 4:5). In 1 Corinthians 3:14 Paul says that if anyone&rsquo;s work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward. The work that remains must be of gold, silver, and precious stones, the product of faithful ministers of Christ. Such a work will be rewarded by the coming and judging Lord.</p>
<p>This reward is fully related to the kingdom. To be rewarded is to be given a rich entrance into the kingdom, that is, to enter into the joy of the Lord and to reign as a co-king with Christ in the enjoyment of eternal life in the coming age. In Matthew 24:45-47 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Who then is the faithful and prudent slave, whom the master has set over his household to give them food at the proper time? Blessed is that slave whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing. Truly I say to you that he will set him over all his possessions.&rdquo; We are blessed if we are faithful toward the Lord and prudent toward the believers. To give them food is to minister, at the proper time, the Word of God with Christ as the life supply to the believers in the church life. Then we will be rewarded with the authority to rule in the manifestation of the kingdom, and we will be set over all the possessions of the Lord. Matthew 25:21 says, &ldquo;His master said to him, Well done, good and faithful slave. You were faithful over a few things; I will set you over many things. Enter into the joy of your master.&rdquo; This indicates that if we are faithful over a few things in this age, the Lord will reward us with ruling authority in the coming kingdom, and we will bear even more responsibilities. We will also participate in the joy of our Master, that is, the enjoyment of the Lord as our inward satisfaction. This is the greatest reward. It is better than the glory and position in the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The believers need to experience the divine dispensing of the Triune God in working and laboring for the Lord. They work and labor for the Lord by His resurrection life and power, not by our natural life and ability. The resurrected Christ has become the life-giving Spirit to bring the processed Triune God in resurrection into us to be our life and life supply so that we may live in resurrection. He lives in us, enabling us to do what we could never do in ourselves. Our labor for the Lord in His resurrection life with His resurrection power will never be in vain. Resurrection not only encourages us; it also motivates us to do the work of the Lord.</p>
<p>As we work and labor for the Lord, we preach Christ as the gospel to sinners by preaching the word of God. We do not merely teach the word of salvation; we speak a completing word regarding God&rsquo;s revelation concerning Christ and the church. Such a healthy word is the truth, the reality of the contents of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. We need to proclaim in season and out of season, that is, whether or not the situation is convenient and whether or not we are welcome. While working and laboring for the Lord, we should also cast out demons in the name of the Lord and heal the sick by laying hands on them. However, we should be reminded to not allow casting out demons and healing the sick to surpass the main items of the gospel, which are Christ and the church.</p>
<p>We also have to minister Christ as life to the saints with the nourishing words of the New Testament faith. If we would minister Christ to others, we first must be nourished ourselves. Being nourished with Christ, we will have Christ as food, as the life supply, to minister to others. Also, we need to exercise our spirit not merely to pass on knowledge but, while giving forth a certain kind of knowledge, to supply something nourishing to the saints. How wonderful the church life will be if we all do this! Furthermore, if the elders shepherd the saints as the flock of God by experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity according to God, that is, according to God&rsquo;s nature, desire, way, and glory, they will be rewarded with the unfading crown of glory.</p>
<p>Paul reminds us to build up the church with the experiences of the processed Triune God as gold, silver, and precious stones. We need to experience the processed Triune God as these precious materials; then we can build up the church as the Body of Christ. As we work and labor for the Lord, sometimes we must pray and fast in order to deal with the power of darkness by casting out demons that insist on remaining. To pray is mainly to cause our spirit to be exercised so that the ministry of the word may be enlivened and strengthened. If we work and labor for the Lord in this way, we will be rewarded by the returning Lord in the day of the resurrection of the righteous. To be rewarded is to be given a rich entrance into the kingdom, that is, to enter into the joy of the Lord and to reign as co-kings with Christ in the enjoyment of the eternal life in the coming age.</p>

<h2 class="head1">III. NOT LOVING THE WORLD&mdash;<br />
THE EVIL SATANIC SYSTEM</h2>
<p>The Greek word translated &ldquo;world,&rdquo; <em>kosmos</em>, has many meanings. In Matthew 25:34, John 17:15, Acts 17:24, Ephesians 1:4, and Revelation 13:8 it denotes the material universe as a system created by God. In John 1:29; 3:16; and Romans 5:12 it denotes the fallen human race, corrupted and usurped by Satan as components for his evil world system. In 1 Peter 3:3 it denotes adorning, ornament. In 1 John 2:15, as in John 15:19; 17:14; and James 4:4, it denotes an order, a set form, an orderly arrangement, hence, an ordered system set up by Satan, the adversary of God. God created man to live on the earth for the fulfillment of His purpose. But His enemy, Satan, in order to usurp the God-created man, has formed an anti-God world system on this earth by systematizing man with religion, culture, education, industry, commerce, and entertainment through man&rsquo;s fallen nature in his lusts, pleasures, pursuits, and even in his indulgence in living necessities, such as food, clothing, housing, and transportation. The whole of such a satanic system lies in the evil one (1 John 5:19).</p>
<p>Satan not only employs the necessities of life to preoccupy man; he also organizes man into numerous individual systems in order to intensify his grip on man. The satanic world system can be compared to a university, in which there are many different departments, such as food, clothing, housing, transportation, marriage, money, entertainment, and fame&mdash;more than can be enumerated. These &ldquo;courses&rdquo; enslave and possess man, causing him to completely forsake and forget God and to go along with the current of the world. People believe that they are handling and enjoying these items, but actually they have fallen into the hands of the evil one and are deceived and controlled by him. Therefore, the world denotes the enemy&rsquo;s scheme, system, and organization to usurp the place of God in man and eventually to gain full possession of man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Keeping the Love of God in Them</h2>
<p>First John 2:15 says, &ldquo;Do not love the world nor the things in the world. If anyone loves the world, love for the Father is not in him.&rdquo; The love for the Father is our love toward Him generated by His love within us. We love the Father with the love with which He has loved us and which is enjoyed by us. If we do not love the world, we can keep the love of God in us, and we will have the ground to overcome the evil one. Loving the world just a little gives the evil one the ground to defeat us and occupy us. If we keep the love of God with which He has loved us, we will not love the world; that is, we will not love anything in place of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Not Loving All That Is in the World&mdash;<br />
the Lust of the Flesh, the Lust of the Eyes,<br />
and the Vainglory of Life</h2>
<p>First John 2:16 says, &ldquo;All that is in the world, the lust of the flesh and the lust of the eyes and the vainglory of life, is not of the Father but is of the world.&rdquo; The world is an evil, satanic, anti-God system that has been constituted from the things created by God. This system comprises the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of the present life. Love of the world is comprehensive, but love of the things that are in the world is a more practical term.</p>
<p>The lust of the flesh is the passionate desire of the body. Adam and Eve partook of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. As a result, an evil, satanic element came into the human physical body. This element now dwells in man&rsquo;s nature. The human body thus became fallen and corrupted, and it became flesh. Since the body encompasses the soul, the soul fell under the influence of the fallen body. As a result, our soul also has been corrupted. Therefore, the soul, our psychological being, has become lustful due to the influence of the fallen body. The lust of the eyes is the passionate desire of the soul through the eyes. The fallen soul and the fallen body now work together. Our body influences our soul, and our soul influences our body. Because of this mutual operation of body and soul, it is difficult to say whether it is the body or the soul that takes the initiative to commit sin. Therefore, on the one hand, we have the lust of the flesh; on the other hand, we have the lust of the eyes. The vainglory of life is the empty pride, boast, confidence, assurance, and display of material things of the present life. The Greek word rendered &ldquo;life&rdquo; in verse 16 is <em>bios,</em> a word that refers to the physical life and also to the present life. Whatever takes place in human society is the present life, with which there is vainglory, including empty pride, boast, confidence, assurance, and display of material things. All these items are not of the Father; hence, we should not love them.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Practicing the Will of God</h2>
<p>The will of God is God coming so that man may contact, touch, Him. Because God is so great, we cannot contact all that He is. Whenever we contact God, we contact only the portion emanating from Him, which we call the will of God. First John 2:17 says, &ldquo;The world is passing away, and its lust, but he who does the will of God abides forever.&rdquo; Just as the world is against God the Father, so the things in the world, which are its lust, are against the will of God. On the positive side, we have the Father and His will. On the negative side, we have the world and all the things in the world. The world and its lust are passing away, but he who does the will of God abides forever. To practice the will of God means to do the will of God habitually and continually, not merely occasionally. God, His will, and those who do His will abide forever.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Not Being Fashioned according to This Age&mdash;the Present Part of the World</h2>
<p>In Romans 12:2 Paul charges the believers not to be &ldquo;fashioned according to this age.&rdquo; This means that we should not be conformed to this age. The Greek word translated &ldquo;age&rdquo; can be rendered &ldquo;modern.&rdquo; The age is the present, practical part of the world that we contact. To be conformed to this age means to adopt modern fashions outwardly. The combination of all people, activities, and things outside of God is called the world. The age designates the part of the world that we contact. The world is the entire organization used by Satan to usurp man, whereas an age is a section, an aspect, the present and modern appearance of the world, which is used by Satan to usurp and occupy people and to keep them away from God and His purpose. Therefore, Ephesians 2:2 refers to &ldquo;the age of this world.&rdquo; We can contact only the age, a part, but not the world, the whole. Usually, we say that the world possesses us. In reality, only the age possesses us, not the whole world.</p>
<p>Everything, everyone, and every matter have been systematized by Satan and made a part of his world system. Where can we go in such a situation? The answer is that we need to go to the Triune God for His dispensing. Only the Triune God has not been systematized by Satan. Along with going to the Triune God, we also need to go to the Word of God. Therefore, since everything, everyone, and every matter have been systematized by Satan, we should not live according to the modern fashions of this age. Instead, we need to flee to the Triune God and His Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. OVERCOMING SATAN, THE DEVIL</h2>
<p>Through the dispensing of the processed Triune God the believers can overcome Satan, the devil. <em>Satan</em> in Greek means &ldquo;adversary.&rdquo; Satan is not only God&rsquo;s enemy outside of God&rsquo;s kingdom but also the adversary within God&rsquo;s kingdom, rebelling against God. The devil, who is Satan, accuses us before God and slanders us before men. If we still love the world, we will have no way to overcome Satan. But if we do not love the world, we will have the position to overcome him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Because of the Blood of the Lamb</h2>
<p>According to Revelation 12:11, the believers can overcome Satan first &ldquo;because of the blood of the Lamb.&rdquo; To overcome Satan because of the blood of the Lamb means to apply the blood of the Lord Jesus as our covering and to take the Lord&rsquo;s blood to counter Satan&rsquo;s accusations and attacks. We are still on earth and in a body of flesh; hence, we cannot help but have some defilement, corruption, weakness, shortcoming, and other undesirable conditions. When we fight with Satan, the first thing he does is to point out all our weaknesses and shortcomings in our conscience, and then he accuses and attacks us. Therefore, whenever we sense the accusation of the devil, we need to take the power and effectiveness of the blood of the Lamb by applying the blood to answer all of Satan&rsquo;s accusations. In this way, we can be strong and of good courage before the enemy and fight against him.</p>
<p>As we wage war against Satan, we must see the blood of the Lamb and declare that we are under its covering. This blood is the prevailing blood, and it speaks and implies a great deal. Only God and, to some extent, the devil know how much the blood implies. Whether or not we know all that the blood implies, as long as we apply it, we will have all that it implies. Therefore, we can overcome Satan because of the blood of the Lamb.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Because of the Word of Their Testimony</h2>
<p>Second, the believers can overcome Satan because of the word of their testimony, which is the word testifying that the devil has been judged by the Lord. Whenever we sense the devil&rsquo;s accusation, we should verbally testify how the Lord has already dealt with him. We must declare with the uttered word the Lord&rsquo;s victory over him. We must declare what the Lord has accomplished, the victory of the cross, the attainment of resurrection, and the position of ascension. This is not a matter of preaching but of testifying.</p>
<p>The blood is the fact, and the word is our testimony. The blood implies the fact that our sins have been forgiven and taken away, that we have been crucified, that Satan has been judged, and that his head has been bruised. When we apply the blood, we apply these facts. After applying the blood, we must declare the facts to Satan. This is the way to overcome the enemy.</p><h2 class="head2">C. Because of Their Not Loving Their Soul-life Even unto Death</h2>
<p>Third, those who overcome the devil do not love &ldquo;their soul-life even unto death.&rdquo; As a result of Adam&rsquo;s fall, Satan joined himself to man&rsquo;s soul-life, man&rsquo;s self (Matt. 16:23-24). Hence, to overcome Satan we should not love our soul-life; rather, we should hate and deny it (Luke 14:26; 9:23). This kind of persons do not love their soul-life unto death. That is, even at the point of being martyred, they still do not love their soul-life. They are persons who are willing to be martyred.</p>
<p>If we want to overcome Satan, we must have no self-love or self-care. Loving ourselves and caring for ourselves cause us to lose the position of warfare and to be unable to fight against the enemy. Therefore, in order to overcome Satan, we must not love our soul-life. As long as we love our soul-life, we are dust, good to be food for Satan. But if we do not love our soul-life, that is, deny our soul-life, Satan will have no ground. This is the way for us, through experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, to overcome Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Withstanding the Devil</h2>
<p>To be subject to God and to be humble toward God (James 4:10; 1 Pet. 5:6) enable the believers to withstand the devil, that is, to stand against the devil. James 4:7 says, &ldquo;Be subject therefore to God; but withstand the devil, and he will flee from you.&rdquo; To be proud toward God is to side with God&rsquo;s enemy, the devil. To be humble toward God is the best strategy to fight God&rsquo;s enemy; it always causes him to flee from us.</p>
<p>The devil is as a roaring lion, howling in hunger, walking about, constantly and aggressively seeking for prey, that is, seeking someone to devour. Therefore, we need to be sober and watchful, being firm in our faith, in order to withstand him (1 Pet. 5:8-9). Peter charges us to withstand our adversary, the devil, because he accuses us day and night. However, to withstand does not mean to resist or to struggle against. Rather, it is to stand firmly as a rock on the ground of our faith before the roaring devil. In 1 Peter 5:9 <em>faith</em> refers to the believers&rsquo; subjective faith, which is their faith in God&rsquo;s protecting power and loving concern.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Not Giving Place to the Devil</h2>
<p>In nothing should we give any place to the devil. In Ephesians 4:26-27 Paul says, &ldquo;Be angry, yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation, neither give place to the devil.&rdquo; According to the context, to continue in anger is to give place to the devil. If we hold on to our anger, we are actually welcoming the devil. However, if we relinquish our anger, we close the door to the devil and give him no place.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Not Being Taken Advantage of by Satan</h2>
<p>Satan is subtle in taking advantage of the believers. Satan, the evil one, is behind the scenes in every scheme, and he works according to his schemes. His schemes are his plans, plots, devices, designs, wiles, intentions, and purposes. In 2 Corinthians 2:11 Paul reminds us not to &ldquo;be taken advantage of by Satan, for we are not ignorant of his schemes.&rdquo; This verse indicates that, even in the church life, Satan may be behind the scenes. Even forgiving a brother may involve not only the church but also the devices of Satan (vv. 6-10), for in such a matter Satan may be crouching, looking for a way to execute his evil plans and devour the weak ones. Therefore, we need to be aware of the subtlety of the enemy.</p>
<p>When Satan came to Eve, he came as a serpent. When he came to the Lord Jesus in Matthew 16, he came through Peter. However, the Lord Jesus was on the alert and realized that Satan was in front of him. For this reason, the Lord said to Peter, &ldquo;Get behind Me, Satan!&rdquo; (v. 23). Just as Satan came to the Lord Jesus through Peter, Satan may come to us through a certain person. Therefore, we need to be on the alert and know the devices of the devil.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Being Guarded by the Faithful Lord<br />
from the Evil One</h2>
<p>The believers can overcome Satan because they are guarded by the faithful Lord from the evil one. In 2 Thessalonians 3:3 Paul says, &ldquo;The Lord is faithful, who will establish you and guard you from the evil one.&rdquo; We are guarded by eternal comfort and good hope (2:16-17). Only the eternal life can guard us from the evil one. The whole world lies in the evil one (1 John 5:19), but we have a part within us that has been regenerated, born of God, and has the life of God. The divine life with which we have been born of God will keep and guard us from the evil one (vv. 18, 4; 3:8-9).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The believers need to experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the matters of not loving the world and of overcoming Satan, the devil. God created man to live on the earth for the fulfillment of His purpose, but His enemy, Satan, in order to usurp the God-created man, has formed an anti-God world system on this earth. Therefore, the world denotes the enemy&rsquo;s scheme, system, and organization to usurp the place of God in man and eventually to gain full possession of man.</p>
<p>The ground for us to overcome the evil one is that we love God, not love the world or the things in the world, including the lust of the flesh, the lust of the eyes, and the vainglory of life. The lust of the flesh is the passionate desire of the body. The lust of the eyes is the passionate desire of the soul through the eyes. The vainglory of life is the empty pride, boast, confidence, assurance, and display of material things of the present life. If we keep the love of God with which He has loved us, we will not love the world or the things in the world. The world is against God the Father, and the things in the world are against the will of God. The world and its lust are passing away, but God, His will, and those who do the will of God abide forever. Paul charges us not to be conformed, fashioned according to this age. Therefore, instead of living according to the modern fashions of this age, we need to flee to the Triune God and His Word.</p>
<p>Through the dispensing of the processed Triune God the believers can overcome Satan, the devil. We can overcome Satan because we apply the blood of the Lord Jesus as our covering by taking the Lord&rsquo;s blood to counter Satan&rsquo;s accusations and attacks. We can overcome Satan because of the word of our testimony, which is our testimony that the devil has already been judged by the Lord. Furthermore, in order to overcome Satan, we should not love our soul-life but rather we should hate it, denying our soul-life, and even be willing to be martyred. James says that to be subject to God, to be humble toward God, is the best strategy to fight God&rsquo;s enemy, because being subject to God always causes the devil to flee from us. Peter says that the devil is as a roaring lion, howling in hunger, walking about and constantly and aggressively seeking for prey, that is, seeking someone to devour. Therefore, we need to stand firm as a rock on the ground of our faith in order to withstand our adversary, the devil. In nothing should we give any place to the devil. The whole world lies in the evil one, but we have a part within us that has been regenerated, born of God, and has the life of God. The divine life with which we have been born of God will keep and guard us from the evil one.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will consider two further aspects of the believers&rsquo; experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity: fighting the good fight and running the course of the race.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. FIGHTING THE GOOD FIGHT</h2>
<p>For the interest of God&rsquo;s kingdom, the believers have to fight the good fight against Satan and his kingdom of darkness. Hence, in 2 Timothy 4:7 Paul says that he had &ldquo;fought the good fight.&rdquo; In 1 Timothy 6:12 he charges the believers to &ldquo;fight the good fight of the faith,&rdquo; that is, to fight for the contents of the complete gospel according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. In this matter we need to experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Receiving the Apostle&rsquo;s Charge</h2>
<p>As believers, we need to fight the good fight by receiving the apostle&rsquo;s charge. First Timothy 1:18 says, &ldquo;This charge I commit to you, my child Timothy, according to the prophecies previously made concerning you, that by them you might war the good warfare.&rdquo; Paul charged Timothy to war the good warfare according to the prophecies. On the positive side, this charge concerns the economy of God, and on the negative side, it concerns the different teachings. Because of different teachings, the church had already become degraded and had deviated from the faith. Paul charged Timothy to fight against this deviation from the faith, which is to fight the good fight of the faith. To fight the good fight is to war against the different teachings of the dissenters and to carry out God&rsquo;s economy (v. 4) according to the apostle&rsquo;s ministry concerning the gospel of grace and eternal life for the glory of the blessed God (vv. 11-16).</p>
<p>Verse 18 says that Timothy should war the good warfare according to the prophecies made concerning him. The prophecies may refer to some kind of prophetic intimations made concerning Timothy when he was admitted into the ministry (Acts 16:1-3). <em>According to the prophecies</em> means to be in the sphere, support, and confirmation of the prophecies. Hence, Timothy was to fight against the deviations of the faith in the sphere, support, and confirmation of the prophecies that were made concerning him.</p>
<p>On the one hand, Timothy was to war against the differing teachings of the dissenters. On the other hand, he was to carry out God&rsquo;s economy according to the apostle&rsquo;s ministry. If we wish to carry out God&rsquo;s economy, we must not do it according to the teachings of traditional Christianity or according to systematic theology but according to the apostle&rsquo;s ministry. All true apostles teach and preach the same thing, even the one thing&mdash;God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. The focus of our preaching and teaching is Christ and the church. To teach and preach God&rsquo;s economy concerning Christ and the church is to fight the good fight.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Laying Hold on the Eternal Life</h2>
<p>Paul charges the believers to fight for the faith, that is, to fight for God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. In particular, this is to fight for Christ as the embodiment of God and for the church as the Body of Christ. Paul also charges us to &ldquo;lay hold on the eternal life&rdquo; (1 Tim. 6:12). The eternal life is the divine life, the uncreated life of the Triune God, which is eternal in nature. In order to fight the good fight of the faith in the Christian life, especially in the Christian ministry, we need to lay hold on this divine life and not trust in our human life. Hence, in 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus the eternal life is stressed again and again (1 Tim. 1:16; 6:19; 2 Tim. 1:1, 10; Titus 1:2; 3:7). Life is a prerequisite in order to carry out God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church in 1 Timothy, to confront the process of the church&rsquo;s decline in 2 Timothy, and to maintain good order in the church life in Titus.</p>
<p>We have been called to the eternal life of God (1 Tim. 6:12). We were born of the human natural life. However, when we were called by God in Christ, we were reborn of the divine eternal life. Being called to eternal life does not mean that we have been called to enjoy blessings in heaven. Eternal life should be our life today. The eternal life is a life for our present daily living. By our first birth, the physical birth, we received the adamic life. But because we have been called to eternal life, we should no longer live by the adamic life, the natural life. On the contrary, we need to live our human life by the eternal life. We have been called to this life, and now we need to live this life.</p>
<p>The subtlety of the enemy to bring in deviation from the faith keeps the believers from the eternal life. Heretical teachings may be used by the enemy to keep us from enjoying the eternal life; even teachings that are scriptural, fundamental, good, ethical, and moral and teachings that are about the improvement of character and about resolving to do good things may be used by the enemy to keep the believers from the experience of the processed Triune God as eternal life. Hence, we must see that all the matters in the New Testament concerning the believers are related to the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us. To experience this dispensing is to enjoy the eternal life. Some may teach according to the Bible without teaching the believers how to contact and receive the dispensing of the processed Triune God, which is the vital factor of our Christian life. Since such teachings may be used by the enemy to keep us from enjoying the eternal life, we need to lay hold on the eternal life. Then, by enjoying the eternal life, we will be able to fight the good fight of the faith.</p><h2 class="head2">C. For the Faith Once for All<br />
Delivered to the Saints</h2>
<p>Jude 3 says that we should &ldquo;contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints.&rdquo; In this verse, as in 1 Timothy 6:12 and 2 Timothy 4:7, the faith refers not to our subjective believing but to our objective belief, that is, to what we believe. The faith denotes the contents of the New Testament as our faith (Acts 6:7; 1 Tim. 1:19; 3:9; 4:1; 5:8; 6:10, 21; 2 Tim. 3:8; Titus 1:13), in which we believe for our common salvation. This faith, not any doctrine, has been delivered once for all to the saints. For this faith we should contend.</p>
<p>The faith&mdash;our belief&mdash;is constituted of certain basic truths. First, we believe that God is one yet triune&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Second, we believe that our God became incarnated in the Son, the Lord Jesus Christ. Third, we believe that Jesus Christ, the Son of God, was incarnated as a man, lived on earth, and died on the cross for our sins to secure our redemption. On the third day He was resurrected from the dead both physically and spiritually to become the life-giving Spirit. Today He is our Savior, our Lord in resurrection, and our life. Because we believe in Him, our sins have been forgiven, He has come into us as our life, and we have been regenerated. Eventually, the Lord Jesus will come back to receive all His believers to Himself. These are basic truths, basic doctrines, that constitute the faith for which we should contend. Because every sound, genuine believer holds these basic truths, these truths are called the common faith (Titus 1:4).</p>
<p>The faith in the objective sense is equal to the contents of God&rsquo;s will given to us in the New Testament. This will includes even the Triune God Himself. However, the contents of this will do not include such matters as head covering, foot-washing, or methods of baptism. Nevertheless, some believers contend for such things, thinking that they are contending for the faith. But this is not the correct understanding of what Jude means by contending for the faith once for all delivered to the saints. In Jude contending for the faith is to contend for the basic and crucial matters of God&rsquo;s new will, His new testament. Someone may say that Jesus died on the cross not for redemption but because He was a martyr and sacrificed Himself for His teachings. This understanding of the death of Christ is heretical; it is contrary to the basic items of the faith. Therefore, we need to contend for the truth concerning Christ&rsquo;s redemption. This is what it means to contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints. The faith, the common faith, has been delivered to the saints once for all, and what we need to do now is to contend for it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. RUNNING THE COURSE OF THE RACE</h2>
<p>The believers also experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God by running the course of the race. The Christian life is a race, and we are runners. Hebrews 12:1 says, &ldquo;Let us also, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, put away every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and run with endurance the race which is set before us.&rdquo; Paul also says in 1 Corinthians 9:24, &ldquo;Do you not know that those who run on a racecourse all run, but one receives the prize? Run in this way, that you may lay hold.&rdquo; These verses indicate that we must not only run, but run successfully in order to obtain the prize, which is a reward as an incentive to us. First Corinthians 9 reveals that the Christian course involves preaching the gospel. To preach the gospel is to dispense Christ into others. By dispensing Christ into those who are receptive to our preaching, we run the Christian course. To run in a racecourse is to labor, but to receive the prize is to have enjoyment. When we preach the gospel, we are running the course. However, to receive a reward, a prize, at the coming of the Lord Jesus is to have a particular enjoyment.</p>
<p>The race we are running is actually Christ Himself. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the way&rdquo; (John 14:6). A race is a way, a course. Christ is the race because He is the way. The way we are walking is the race we are running. Therefore, Christ, who is the way, is also the race we have to run. Although Christ is our way, we should not take this way simply as a way; rather, we should take the way as a race to run. We should not take the time to consider, look around, stand still, or walk slowly. We need to run the race until we can declare, like Paul did in 2 Timothy 4:7, &ldquo;I have finished the course.&rdquo; Paul began to run the course of the heavenly race after he was taken possession of by the Lord, and he continued to run (1 Cor. 9:24-26; Phil. 3:12-14) until he finished the course (Acts 20:24). Then at the end he triumphantly proclaimed, &ldquo;I have finished the course.&rdquo; He also proclaimed that he would receive from the Lord a reward&mdash;the crown of righteousness (2 Tim. 4:8).</p><h2 class="head2">A. Obtaining the Prize&mdash;<br />
the Incorruptible Crown</h2>
<p>The prize that the believers win for running the race is an incorruptible crown (1 Cor. 9:25), which is a reward as an incentive. This reward will be given to us according to our works at the Lord&rsquo;s coming back (Matt. 16:27; Rev. 22:12; 1 Cor. 4:5). It will be decided at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10) and enjoyed in the coming kingdom (Matt. 25:21, 23). This prize is not salvation in a common sense (Eph. 2:8; 1 Cor. 3:15) but a reward in a special sense (Heb. 10:35; 1 Cor. 3:14). Eternal salvation is by faith, having nothing to do with our work (Eph. 2:8-9), whereas the reward is for our work after we are saved (1 Cor. 3:8, 14). As believers in Christ, we have all received His salvation through faith. This has been settled once for all. But whether we will be rewarded by the Lord depends on how we run the race.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 9 Paul was running the race. In Philippians, one of his last Epistles, he was still running (3:14). It was not until the last moment of his running, in 2 Timothy 4:6-8, that Paul had the assurance that he would be rewarded by the Lord at His coming. With this reward in view, Paul charges us to run the race so that we may obtain an incorruptible crown.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Not Running without a Clear Aim, Not in Vain</h2>
<p>We should not run the race without a clear aim; rather, we must have a clear goal. This is according to Paul&rsquo;s word in 1 Corinthians 9:26: &ldquo;I therefore run in this way, not as though without a clear aim.&rdquo; If we run with a clear aim and in reality, our running of the racecourse will not be in vain (Gal. 2:2).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Putting Off Every Encumbrance<br />
and the Entangling Sin</h2>
<p>In order to run the course of the race, we need to put off every encumbrance and the entangling sin (Heb. 12:1). The Greek word translated &ldquo;encumbrance&rdquo; in Hebrews 12:1 may also be rendered &ldquo;weight,&rdquo; &ldquo;burden,&rdquo; or &ldquo;impediment.&rdquo; If we would run the Christian race, we need to put off every unnecessary weight, every encumbering burden, so that we would have no encumbrance or impediment in running the race. In addition, we also need to put off &ldquo;the sin which so easily entangles us.&rdquo; Here the sin refers mainly to the thing that entangles us, hindering us from running the race. The encumbrances are outward, but the sin is inward, both of which frustrate us in running the race. In order to run the course of the Christian life, we need to put off the encumbrances and the entangling sin.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Running with Endurance</h2>
<p>There is much opposition to the Christian race; therefore, in order to run this race, the believers must suffer opposition with endurance and never grow weary or faint in our souls (vv. 1, 3).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Looking unto Jesus,<br />
Who Has Sat Down on the Right Hand<br />
of the Throne of God in the Heavens</h2>
<p>The believers run the course of the race by &ldquo;looking away unto Jesus&rdquo; (v. 2). The Greek word translated as &ldquo;looking away unto&rdquo; means to look with undivided attention by turning away from every other object. The runners in a race should turn away from everything else and look at the goal with undivided attention. We need to turn away from everything other than Jesus and look to Him with undivided attention. The wonderful Jesus, who is enthroned in heaven and crowned with glory and honor (2:9), is the greatest attraction in the universe. He is like an immense magnet, drawing all His seekers to Him. It is by being attracted by His charming beauty that we look away from all things other than Him so that we may run with endurance the race which is set before us. This is the way we run the race.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is &ldquo;the Author and Perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God&rdquo; (12:2). In Hebrews Paul points us particularly to the Christ who is seated in heaven with so many aspects to care for us in every way. By His death and resurrection He accomplished everything that is needed for both God and us. Now in His ascension He is sitting in the heavens as the Son of God (1:5) and the Son of Man (2:6), that is, in the person of God (1:8) and of man (2:6), as the appointed Heir of all things (1:2), the anointed One of God (v. 9), the Author of our salvation (2:10), the Sanctifier (v. 11), the constant Succor (v. 16), the instant Helper (4:16), the Apostle from God (3:1), the High Priest (2:17; 4:14; 7:26), the Minister of the true tabernacle (8:2) with a more excellent ministry (v. 6), the surety and the Mediator of a better covenant (7:22; 8:6; 12:24), the Executor of the new testament (9:16-17), the Forerunner (6:20), the Author and Perfecter of faith (12:2), and the great Shepherd of the sheep (13:20). If we look unto Him as such a wonderful and all-inclusive One, He will transfuse and infuse us with all that He is by ministering heaven, life, and strength to us, to enable us to run the heavenly race and to live the heavenly life on earth. In this way, He will carry us through our lifelong pathway and lead and bring us into glory (2:10).</p><h2 class="head2">F. Obeying the Truth&mdash;<br />
the Reality in Christ Preached by the Apostle</h2>
<p>Galatians 5:7 says, &ldquo;You were running well. Who hindered you that you would not believe and obey the truth?&rdquo; <em>Truth</em> in this verse does not refer to doctrine but to the reality in Christ, as preached to the Galatians by Paul. Therefore, we need to run the race by obeying the truth, which is the reality in Christ preached by the apostle.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. To the End</h2>
<p>The believers need to run the course of the race to the end. This is indicated by Paul&rsquo;s word in 2 Timothy 4:7: &ldquo;I have finished the course.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The believers further experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the matters of fighting the good fight and running the course of the race. To fight the good fight of the faith is to fight for the contents of the complete gospel according to God&rsquo;s New Testament economy and to fight against the different teachings of the dissenters, so as to accomplish God&rsquo;s economy according to the apostle&rsquo;s ministry concerning the gospel of grace and eternal life for the glory of the blessed God. The focus of our preaching and teaching is Christ and the church. Hence, to teach and preach God&rsquo;s economy concerning Christ and the church is to fight the good fight. In order to fight the good fight of the faith, we need to lay hold on God&rsquo;s life and not trust in our human life. We have been called to the eternal life of God. Now by living this life, enjoying and laying hold on the eternal life, we will be able to fight the good fight of the faith. We also need to contend for the faith once for all delivered to the saints. This is to contend for the contents of God&rsquo;s will given to us in the New Testament.</p>
<p>The believers should experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God also by running the course of the race. As believers, we are runners in a race. The Christian life is a race. We must run, and run successfully, in order to obtain the prize, the incorruptible crown, which is a reward as an incentive. We must run the race with a clear aim so that our running may not be in vain. We also need to put off every outward encumbrance and the inward entangling sin, suffer opposition with endurance, and never grow weary or faint in our souls. We should also look away from everything other than Jesus, looking with undivided attention unto Him who has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God in the heavens. He is the greatest attraction in the universe, like an immense magnet drawing us to Him. He is the Author and Perfecter of our faith, who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God. Today He is sitting in the heavens with so many aspects to care for us in every way. He is ministering heaven, life, and strength to us, transfusing and infusing us with all that He is, to enable us to run the heavenly race and to live the heavenly life on earth. In this way He carries us through our lifelong pathway and leads us into glory. We need to run in this way until we finish the race.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of transformation, by the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, that is, by the infusing and transfusing of the riches of the processed Triune God, the believers serve and worship God, work and labor for the Lord, do not love the world, overcome Satan the devil, fight the good fight, and run the course of the race. It is possible for us to teach and endeavor to practice these matters without touching the source of the strength, energy, and capability to carry them out. The source is the enjoyment of the dispensing of the processed Triune God into our being. For this reason, we need to contact the Divine Trinity. We need to stay in His presence, fellowship with Him, and even pray with fasting in order to receive more dispensing of the divine essence.</p>
<p>Serving and worshipping God, working and laboring for the Lord, not loving the world, overcoming Satan, fighting the good fight, and running the course of the race all belong to one category of the believers&rsquo; experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. In this lesson we come to a second category&mdash;being profited by all things in our circumstances and environments. Day by day we encounter many environments and face many persons, matters, and things. According to God&rsquo;s design and arrangement, all these persons, matters, and things are used by Him for our good. Therefore, we are profited by all things in our circumstances and environments.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. BEING PROFITED BY ALL THINGS<br />
IN THEIR CIRCUMSTANCES AND ENVIRONMENTS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. All Things Working Together for Good<br />
to Those Who Love God</h2>
<p>Romans 8:28 says, &ldquo;We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose.&rdquo; <em>All things</em> refers to all matters, persons, and things. Our Father knows what we need. In His sovereignty He causes all things, all matters, and all persons to work together for good to those who love Him, to those who have been called by Him to the end that He may fulfill His purpose.</p>
<p>The believers have been called by God according to His purpose. God&rsquo;s purpose is His plan, and His plan is that we be conformed to the image of His Son so that He would be the Firstborn among many brothers (v. 29). God has put us into Christ, who is the prototype, the model, the mold, and the pattern, so that we may be molded into the image of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. In this way, we become the mass production of God&rsquo;s firstborn Son. This is our destiny. However, this destiny cannot be fulfilled without the divine arrangement causing all things to work together for our good. We are not yet fully in the image of the firstborn Son of God. Hence, God the Father is causing all things to work together for our good so that His purpose of having many sons conformed to the image of the firstborn Son may be fulfilled.</p>
<p>In order to be brought into full sonship we need to grow. No doubt, growth comes from inward nourishment, but this nourishment needs the coordination of the outward environment. Hence, there is the need of God&rsquo;s sovereignty to arrange our environment so that all things may work together for our good according to His purpose. However, we still need to cooperate with Him by loving Him. If we do not love God, all things will not work together for our good, even though we have been called by Him. Whether or not all persons, matters, and things in our environment work to our good depends on whether or not we love God. If we love Him, He will cause all things to work together for our good.</p><h2 class="head2">B. No Persons, Matters, or Things<br />
Being Able to Separate Them from the Love of God</h2>
<p>Once God loves us, He loves us forever with an eternal love. Nothing can separate us from the love of God. We are His beloved, and sooner or later we all will be sanctified, transformed, conformed, and glorified. Hence, Paul said, &ldquo;Who shall separate us from the love of Christ? Shall tribulation or anguish or persecution or famine or nakedness or peril or sword?...For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord&rdquo; (vv. 35, 38-39). Paul wrote <em>in Christ Jesus our Lord</em> because he knew that there would be a problem if the love of God was separated from Christ Jesus. Apart from Christ Jesus, even a little sin would separate us from the love of God. However, because the love of God is in Christ Jesus, everything is insured; we are assured that nothing can separate us from the love of God.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s love is the fountain, the root, and the source. God&rsquo;s love is the source of His eternal salvation, which includes redemption, justification, reconciliation, sanctification, transformation, conformation, and glorification. Love is the source of all that God does for us. Moreover, the love of God is also the security of our salvation. Our security is not only God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory. Our security is His love. Righteousness is the way of God, holiness is the nature of God, glory is the expression of God, and love is the heart of God and the issue of His heart. Before God exercised His righteousness, holiness, and glory, He loved us. Therefore, in Romans, after speaking of God&rsquo;s righteousness, holiness, and glory, Paul brings us into God&rsquo;s heart of love. Today like Paul, we can be persuaded that nothing can separate us from the love of God, for this love is not derived from us nor does it depend on us; this love depends on God and was initiated by God in eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. More Than Conquering<br />
through Him Who Loved Them</h2>
<p>Instead of being defeated by the environment, the believers more than conquer in all things because God loves them (v. 37). Our conquering is altogether a matter of God&rsquo;s love. Through our loving One we can be conquerors, conquering all negative things, even death.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. In Nothing Being Put to Shame,<br />
but Christ Being Magnified in Their Body<br />
Whether through Life or through Death</h2>
<p>Paul expected that in nothing he would be put to shame; that is, he would not be defeated by his environment, whether through life or through death, but rather that Christ would be magnified in him (Phil. 1:20). No matter what he faced&mdash;to continue living or to be martyred&mdash;Paul expected to magnify Christ. Paul magnified Christ in his living; this is to magnify Christ through life. He also magnified Christ as he was expecting to be martyred; this is to magnify Christ through death. Thus, whether through life or through death, Christ was magnified in Paul&rsquo;s body.</p>
<p>For Christ to be magnified is for Him to be shown or declared great without limitation, for Him to be exalted, and extolled. Therefore, to magnify Christ is to express Christ without limitation, to make known to others that the Christ who lives in us is unlimited. As we express, exhibit, exalt, and extol Christ, we become a living witness of Christ, testifying of His immeasurable ability, power, patience, love, and wisdom. We should all be a magnifying glass of Christ so that others may see Christ magnified through us. Our ability to magnify Christ depends on the experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God. The dispensing of the Divine Trinity always causes Christ to be magnified in our body.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Blessed by Being Persecuted<br />
for the Sake of Righteousness,<br />
for Theirs Is the Kingdom of the Heavens</h2>
<p>As believers we are persecuted for the sake of righteousness. Matthew 5:10 says, &ldquo;Blessed are those who are persecuted for the sake of righteousness, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; The whole world lies in the evil one and is filled with unrighteousness (1 John 5:19). Every aspect of the world is unrighteous, but the kingdom is absolutely a matter of righteousness. If we do not remain in righteousness, we are outside the kingdom of the heavens; but if we stay in righteousness, we are in the kingdom of the heavens. When we are righteous, we will be condemned, opposed, and persecuted. If we hunger and thirst after righteousness, we need to pay a price, for the righteousness that we seek is the kingdom of the heavens. Suffering for the sake of righteousness is a condition for participating in the kingdom of the heavens. If we seek righteousness at a cost, the kingdom of the heavens becomes ours. We are in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens now, and we will be rewarded with its manifestation in the coming age. In order to be in the kingdom of the heavens, we need surpassing righteousness, the righteousness on the highest plane (Matt. 5:20). Therefore, we need to hunger and thirst after righteousness and to suffer persecution for the sake of righteousness.</p><h2 class="head2">F. Blessed by Being<br />
Reproached, Persecuted, and Evil Spoken of<br />
for Christ&rsquo;s Sake, for Their Reward<br />
Is Great in the Heavens</h2>
<p>When the believers live a life for the kingdom of the heavens, in its spiritual nature and according to its heavenly principles, they will be reproached, persecuted, and evil spoken of, mostly by religious people who hold to their traditional religious concepts. The Jewish religionists did all these things to the apostles in the early days of the kingdom of the heavens (Acts 5:41; 13:45, 50; 2 Cor. 6:8; Rom. 3:8). This is also true today. If we seek Christ and follow Him, many in religion will rise up against us. In Matthew 5:11 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me.&rdquo; Verse 12 is an encouraging word to those who are persecuted for His sake: &ldquo;Rejoice and exult, for your reward is great in the heavens; for so they persecuted the prophets who were before you.&rdquo; Our reward is great, and it is in the heavens. It is a heavenly reward, not an earthly one.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Blessed by Being Reproached<br />
in the Name of Christ, Because the Spirit of Glory and of God Rests upon Them</h2>
<p>First Peter 4:14 says, &ldquo;If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you.&rdquo; As believers, we have believed into Christ (John 3:15) and have been baptized into His name (Acts 19:5), that is, into Christ (Gal. 3:27). Therefore, we are in Christ (1 Cor. 1:30) and are one with Him (6:17). When we are reproached in His name, we are reproached with Him, sharing His sufferings (1 Pet. 4:13), in the fellowship of His sufferings (Phil. 3:10).</p>
<p>According to Peter&rsquo;s word we should not think that it is a curse to be reproached in the name of Christ. On the contrary, this is to be blessed because the Spirit of glory, that is, the Spirit of God, will rest upon us. In His resurrection, Christ was glorified through the Spirit of glory (Rom. 1:4). This very Spirit of glory, being the Spirit of God, rests upon the suffering believers in their persecution for the glorification of the resurrected and exalted Christ, who is now in glory. The more we suffer and are persecuted, the more glory there will be upon us. Therefore, we should rejoice when we are reproached in the name of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Rejoicing That They Are<br />
Counted Worthy to Be Dishonored<br />
on Behalf of the Name of Jesus</h2>
<p>When we experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we will rejoice that we are counted worthy to be dishonored on behalf of the name of Jesus. In Acts the apostles were beaten and charged not to speak in the name of Jesus (5:40). But &ldquo;they went from the presence of the Sanhedrin, rejoicing that they were counted worthy to be dishonored on behalf of the Name&rdquo; (v. 41). This shows that it is a real honor to be dishonored on behalf of the name of the man-dishonored but God-honored Jesus. Hence, we can rejoice that we are counted worthy of being dishonored on behalf of the name of Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. Boasting in Tribulations</h2>
<p>Through the experience of the divine dispensing of the Triune God, we can also &ldquo;boast in our tribulations&rdquo; (Rom. 5:3). Our natural being needs to be sanctified, transformed, and conformed; consequently, God brings in certain tribulations and sufferings for our good (8:28-29). We may appreciate peace, grace, and glory but not tribulation. Tribulation is actually the incarnation of grace with all the riches of Christ. This is similar to the incarnation of God in Jesus. Apparently, He was simply the man Jesus; actually, He was God. Apparently, our environment is tribulation; actually, it is grace. This means that to reject tribulation is to reject grace. Grace&mdash;God as our portion for our enjoyment&mdash;often visits us in the form of tribulation. If we realize this and experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God, we will boast in our tribulations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Bearing Sorrows,<br />
Suffering Injustice, and Enduring Suffering<br />
for Doing Good</h2>
<p>As believers, we are those who have been called by God. God&rsquo;s calling includes not only enjoyment but also suffering. Our destiny in God&rsquo;s calling includes both the enjoyment of Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God and also the suffering of Christ. First Peter 2:19-21 says, &ldquo;This is grace, if anyone, because of a consciousness of God, bears sorrows by suffering unjustly. For what glory is it if, while sinning and being buffeted, you endure? But if, while doing good and suffering, you endure, this is grace with God. For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model so that you may follow in His steps.&rdquo; We have been called to suffer with Christ, to suffer what He suffered, so that in suffering we may have the enjoyment of God as grace and express Him. Whatever the circumstances may be, God is our grace, our inner enjoyment. This enjoyment motivates us and then becomes our outward expression, an expression that is visible to others. Those who observe this grace, which is expressed from within us, will be able to see something attractive on our face, in our attitude, or in the atmosphere around us. Our living will become gracious and acceptable in the sight of both God and man.</p><h2 class="head2">K. Being Appointed for Afflictions</h2>
<p>As believers, we have been appointed for afflictions. To suffer afflictions is our destiny because this is God&rsquo;s ordination. In 1 Thessalonians 3:3 Paul encourages the believers not to be &ldquo;shaken by these afflictions; for you yourselves know that we are appointed for this.&rdquo; If we are established in the faith, afflictions will do good for us according to God&rsquo;s purpose in His appointment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">L. Not Fearing Those Who Kill the Body<br />
but Are Unable to Kill the Soul,<br />
Because They Are of More Value<br />
Than Many Sparrows, and Even Their Hairs<br />
Are All Numbered by Their Father</h2>
<p>In Matthew 10:28 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Do not fear those who kill the body, but are not able to kill the soul; but rather fear Him who is able to destroy both soul and body in Gehenna.&rdquo; God is the only One who is able to destroy both the soul and the body in Gehenna. If we are sent by the Lord and fail to endure persecution, we will be disciplined by God. This will take place at the Lord&rsquo;s return (2 Cor. 5:10; Rev. 22:12). We should not fear man&rsquo;s persecution. Matthew 10:29-31 says that not one sparrow will fall to the earth without our Father&rsquo;s permission, but even the hairs of our head are all numbered by our Father; therefore, we should not fear, because we are of more value than many sparrows.</p>
<h2 class="head2">M. In Affliction Enjoying the Peace of Christ,<br />
Who Has Overcome the World</h2>
<p>By experiencing the dispensing of the processed Triune God, the believers in affliction enjoy the peace of Christ who has overcome the world. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;These things I have spoken to you that in Me you may have peace. In the world you have affliction, but take courage; I have overcome the world&rdquo; (John 16:33). In this world there are only trouble and persecution. But the Lord died and resurrected so that we can have peace in Him. No matter how much this world troubles and persecutes us, we do not need to worry, nor do we need to fear, because the Lord has overcome the world. The Lord is the peace that we enjoy in affliction.</p>
<h2 class="head2">N. Suffering Ushering Them into<br />
Perfection and Glory</h2>
<p>Peter says that the suffering we experience will usher us into perfection today and into glory in the future. &ldquo;The God of all grace, He who has called you into His eternal glory in Christ Jesus, after you have suffered a little while, will Himself perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground you&rdquo; (1 Pet. 5:10). We like to have perfection and receive glory without suffering. However, God knows how much suffering we need. Therefore, He arranges everything sovereignly so that we may suffer in order to be perfected in this age and glorified in the coming age.</p>
<p>God is the God of all grace. In His economy and according to the many steps of the divine operation on us and within us, He ministers to us the riches of the bountiful supply of the divine life in many aspects. The initial step is to call us, and the consummate step is to glorify us. Between these two steps are God&rsquo;s loving care while He is disciplining us and His perfecting, establishing, strengthening, and grounding work within us. If we are persecuted, the God of grace will perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us after we suffer a little while. Therefore, in the persecution we should be encouraged by this fact, because our God is the God of all grace. He has called us into eternal glory, a glory that is unlimited in both space and time. Furthermore, in this verse Peter also says that our sufferings are only for a little while, but God&rsquo;s glory is eternal. Through suffering persecution, we are perfected, and we will eventually be ushered into glory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>As believers, day by day we encounter many environments and face many persons, matters, and things. According to God&rsquo;s design and arrangement, all these persons, matters, and things are used by God to work together for good to those who love Him, that is, to those who have been called by Him so that He may fulfill His purpose, which is to conform us to the image of His Son that He may be the Firstborn among many brothers. No person, matter, or thing can separate us from the love of God&mdash;the love of Christ. God&rsquo;s love is the fountain, the root, and the source. Hence, God&rsquo;s love is the security of our salvation. In all things we more than conquer through Him who loved us. We should not be put to shame in anything; rather, Christ should be magnified in our body, whether through life or through death. When we experience the dispensing of the processed Triune God, Christ will be magnified in our body.</p>
<p>The Lord said that those who are being persecuted for the sake of righteousness are blessed, for theirs is the kingdom of the heavens. Those who are reproached, persecuted, and evil spoken of are blessed because their reward is great in the heavens. If we are reproached in the name of Christ, we are blessed because the Spirit of glory, that is, the Spirit of God, rests upon us. We rejoice that we are counted worthy to be dishonored on behalf of the name of Jesus. It is a real honor to be dishonored on behalf of the name of the man-dishonored but God-honored Jesus. Through the experience of the divine dispensing of the Triune God, we can also boast in tribulations because grace often visits us in the form of tribulation. If because of a consciousness of God we bear sorrows by suffering unjustly, this is grace. If we endure sufferings for doing good, this is grace with God. We were called to suffer because Christ also suffered on our behalf, leaving us a model so that we may follow in His steps. As believers, we have been appointed for afflictions. Therefore, we should not fear those who kill the body but are not able to kill the soul, because we are of more value than many sparrows and our hairs are all numbered by our Father. By experiencing the dispensing of the processed Triune God, we can enjoy the peace of Christ in sufferings because He has overcome the world. Moreover, the sufferings we experience will usher us into perfection today and into glory in the future.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will continue from the previous lesson to see other aspects of the believers&rsquo; being profited by all things in their circumstances by their experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">O. Counting It All Joy<br />
When They Fall into Various Trials</h2>
<p>Once a person turns to God, Satan will instigate others to persecute him. Since Satan opposes God continually in every possible way, and since the entire world lies in him (1 John 5:19), Paul says that the believers in Christ are appointed to suffer persecution (Phil. 1:29). When James speaks of the practical Christian perfection in his Epistle, there is an aspect concerning the enduring of trials (1:2-3).</p>
<p>Persecutions are a suffering. However, trials are not merely a suffering, for trials are a suffering that serves the purpose of trying and proving. Just as examinations are good for students, so the various trials that we face as Christians profit us. Our heavenly Father allows such trials for the purpose of trying, testing, and proving us. Trials not only help us in the matters of our spiritual education and the experience of life; they also help us with our character and our behavior in our daily living. It is only through trials that God can perfect us in a practical way in our Christian life. If we realize this, we will thank God for perfecting us through trials.</p>
<p>James encourages us, saying, &ldquo;Count it all joy, my brothers, whenever you fall into various trials&rdquo; (v. 2). We can count it a joy when we fall into trials, because we see that the trials will perfect us. James speaks of various trials, indicating that we should not count just certain trials a joy but should count all trials a joy. Perhaps we do not like trials, opposition, and persecution, but we should count it all joy when we experience them, because God, through the divine dispensing, uses them to perfect us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">P. Being Pressed on Every Side,<br />
but Not Constricted;<br />
Their Outer Man Being Consumed,<br />
yet Their Inner Man Being Renewed;<br />
Their Momentary Lightness of Affliction<br />
Working Out for Them an Eternal Weight of Glory</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 4:8-18 Paul speaks of how the ministers of the new covenant lived and how they experienced the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in their living. By such a dispensing they were capable of living a crucified life in resurrection and of living out the resurrection life under the killing of the cross for the carrying out of their ministry. Paul says, &ldquo;We are pressed on every side but not constricted; unable to find a way out but not utterly without a way out; persecuted but not abandoned; cast down but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body&rdquo; (vv. 8-10). For us to experience the putting to death is to experience the working of the cross, which the Lord Jesus suffered and endured. When the Lord was on earth, He was daily under the killing. We also should experience this. As we experience this killing work, the life of Jesus will be manifested in our body. This daily killing is to release the divine life in resurrection, and it results in the manifestation of the resurrection life.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore we do not lose heart; but though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day&rdquo; (v. 16). The outer man is our body and our soul, with the body as its organ and the soul as its life and person. The inner man is our regenerated spirit with our renewed soul. The regenerated spirit is the life and person of the inner man, and the renewed soul is its organ. As our mortal body, our outer man, is being consumed by the killing work of death, our inner man, that is, our regenerated spirit with the inward parts of our being (Jer. 31:33; Heb. 8:10; Rom. 7:22, 25), is being metabolically renewed day by day with the supply of resurrection life. We are able to live a life of not losing heart, because we believe that our momentary lightness of affliction will work out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory (2 Cor. 4:17).</p><h2 class="head2">Q. Accepting with Joy the Plundering<br />
of Their Possessions, Knowing That They Have<br />
a Better and Abiding Possession</h2>
<p>By experiencing the dispensing of the processed Triune God, the believers can accept with joy the plundering of their possessions, knowing that they have a better possession and an abiding one (Heb. 10:34). Under the old covenant the Jewish people inherited earthly things as their possession, but under the new covenant the believers inherit the heavenly riches as their possession. This better and abiding possession is &ldquo;the eternal inheritance&rdquo; (9:15) and the &ldquo;inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you&rdquo; (1 Pet. 1:4). This better and abiding possession is a great incentive for us to suffer the loss of earthly things and even to accept this loss with joy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">R. Sharing the Kingdom of Jesus<br />
in His Tribulation and Endurance<br />
for the Word of God and the Testimony of Jesus</h2>
<p>Through the divine dispensing, the believers also share the kingdom of Jesus in His tribulation and endurance for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus (Rev. 1:9). Being fellow partakers in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus means that we suffer and are persecuted as we follow Jesus the Nazarene. According to the facts of the Lord&rsquo;s life on earth, His name, <em>Jesus,</em> denotes a suffering person, a man of sorrows (Isa. 53:3).</p>
<p>If we are fellow partakers in the tribulation in Jesus, then we are fellow partakers in the kingdom. To be in the kingdom in Jesus today is not a glory, because the kingdom in Jesus is a kingdom of suffering. The more we are in the kingdom, and the more we are for the kingdom of the heavens, the more we shall suffer and be persecuted (Matt. 5:10-12). Being in the suffering of Jesus is a strong sign that we are in the kingdom. Moreover, we are also fellow partakers in the endurance in Jesus. For both the tribulation and the kingdom we need endurance. As we are in Christ, we partake not only of His life and holiness but also of His endurance. If we are partakers in the tribulation, kingdom, and endurance in Jesus, eventually, in the coming age, we will be rewarded by sharing the Lord&rsquo;s kingdom in glory and enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">S. Enduring Trials to Receive the Crown of Life</h2>
<p>If we love the Lord, we will be under trials. Trials come from the environment and are for God to prove our faith (James 1:2-3) through suffering (vv. 9-11). James 1:12 says, &ldquo;Blessed is the man who endures trial, because when he has become approved by testing, he will receive the crown of life, which He promised to those who love Him.&rdquo; The crown of life is the glory, the expression, of life. We endure trials by the divine life, and this will become our glory and expression, our crown of life, as a reward given to us by the Lord at His appearing for our enjoyment in the coming kingdom (2:5). This crown of life is promised to those who love the Lord. To believe in the Lord is to receive the divine life for our salvation. To love the Lord is to grow in the divine life unto maturity so that we may be qualified for a reward&mdash;the crown of life&mdash;to enjoy the glory of the divine life in the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head2">T. Not Thinking That the Fiery Ordeal Is Strange<br />
but Rejoicing in Sharing the Sufferings of Christ</h2>
<p>Peter considered the trials that the believers suffer to be a fiery ordeal (1 Pet. 4:12), just like the burning of a smelting furnace for the purification of gold and silver (Prov. 27:21; Psa. 66:10). The burning furnace used by God to purify our life is God&rsquo;s way to deal with us in the judgment of His governmental administration. The Lord uses persecutions and trials to serve a positive purpose&mdash;the purification of our life. We believers can be compared to gold and silver. However, we need to be purified because we still have some amount of dross. Gold and silver are purified through burning, and we also need to be purified in this way.</p>
<p>Therefore, Peter tells us not to regard the fiery ordeal as strange. We need to realize that fiery ordeals are common. Persecutions and trials are the common experience of Christians, for we have been appointed to such ordeals. The world rises up against us because we believe in Christ, love Christ, live Christ, and bear testimony to Christ, witnessing of Him in this age. This age is under the hand of the evil one, and for this reason, unbelieving ones persecute those who believe in Christ and witness of Him. In the sight of God this kind of suffering is regarded as the sufferings of Christ. Christ lived a life of suffering. Now we are His partners (Heb. 3:14), living the same kind of life. Whatever Christ suffered, we also suffer. We cooperate with Him in living a life of suffering and follow Him along the way of suffering. By experiencing such a fiery ordeal, God considers us to be sharing, participating in, the sufferings of Christ. Such trials are due to the fact that we are Christians, men of Christ.</p>
<p>As Christians, followers of Christ, we should be those who undergo the sufferings of Christ. We need to participate not only in the riches of Christ but also in the sufferings of Christ. If we take this view, we will be encouraged whenever we suffer for Christ. Peter even says that we should rejoice as we share in the sufferings of Christ so that we may rejoice exultingly at the revelation of His glory (1 Pet. 4:13). This means that we will not only rejoice inwardly, but we will sound out our joy. At the time of the revelation, the unveiling of the Lord&rsquo;s glory, we will exult. We will be excited to the uttermost, beside ourselves with joy.</p><h2 class="head2">U. Not Being Ashamed of Suffering as a Christian<br />
but Glorifying God in This Name</h2>
<p>According to Acts 11:26, the believers &ldquo;were first called Christians in Antioch.&rdquo; The Greek word rendered &ldquo;Christian&rdquo; is <em>Christianos,</em> a word of Latin formation. The ending <em>-ianos,</em> denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire. This name denoted that Christians were adherents of Christ and was used by the outsiders as a nickname, a term of reproach. For this reason, Peter says that if a believer suffers &ldquo;as a Christian, let him not be ashamed, but let him glorify God in this name&rdquo; (1 Pet. 4:16). This means that if we suffer from persecutors who contemptuously call us a Christian, we should not feel ashamed, but rather, we should glorify God in this name.</p>
<p>Today the term <em>Christian</em> bears a positive significance, that is, a man of Christ, a person who is one with Christ. We not only belong to Him but also have His life and nature in an organic union with Him and live by Him, even living Him, in our daily life. If we suffer for being such a person, we should not feel ashamed, because when we suffer in the name of Christ and as Christians, the Spirit of God, who is the Spirit of glory, rests upon us. Instead, we should magnify Christ in our confession by our holy and excellent manner of life to glorify, express, God in this name.</p>
<h2 class="head2">V. Suffering according to the Will of God<br />
So That They Might Not<br />
Suffer the End of the Ungodly</h2>
<p>First Peter shows the government of God especially in His dealings with His chosen people. The sufferings that the believers undergo in fiery persecutions are used by Him as a means to judge them so that they may be disciplined, purified, and separated from unbelievers so as not to have the same destiny as unbelievers. Hence, 4:17 says, &ldquo;It is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God; and if first from us, what will be the end of those who disobey the gospel of God?&rdquo; In this verse the <em>house</em> refers to the church, composed of the believers (2:5; Heb. 3:6; 1 Tim. 3:15; Eph. 2:19). For the establishment of His kingdom, God begins His governmental administration from His own house by His disciplinary judgment over His own children so that He may have a strong ground to judge, in His universal kingdom, those who are disobedient to His gospel and rebellious to His government.</p>
<p>Hence, in this sense, persecutions and sufferings are a kind of judgment. This judgment, however, is not for condemnation to eternal perdition. It is a dispensational discipline to purify our life by removing any dross. The reason believers suffer is that God does not want His own children, His own house, His family, to suffer the end of the ungodly. The unbelievers, who disobey the gospel of God, will undergo a more severe judgment. Temporarily God may let them go, but eventually He will deal with them. Therefore, Peter says, &ldquo;Let those also who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in well-doing to a faithful Creator&rdquo; (1 Pet. 4:19). God has appointed us according to His will to suffer for Christ&rsquo;s sake (3:17; 2:15; 1 Thes. 3:3). We must see that persecution is a suffering in the old creation. God as our Creator can preserve our soul, which He created for us. He has even numbered our hairs (Matt. 10:30). He is loving and faithful. His loving and faithful care accompanies His justice in His governmental administration (1 Pet. 5:7). While He is judging us as His household in His government, in His love He cares for us faithfully. In suffering His just disciplinary judgment in our body, we should commit our souls to Him and to His faithful care.</p>
<h2 class="head2">W. Suffering with Christ<br />
So That They May Be Glorified with Him</h2>
<p>Romans 8 reveals that suffering with Christ is the condition for being heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ. We may not like to suffer, but it is necessary. If we suffer with the Lord, we shall be glorified with Him (vv. 17-18). Suffering is also related to the growth of life. The genuine growth of any kind of life depends on hardship and suffering. Without hardship or suffering it is difficult for any life to grow. We should not expect our life to be free of suffering. The more we suffer, the more we grow and the faster we mature. Therefore, if we expect to grow in life, we should not reject suffering, because suffering helps our growth.</p>
<p>The degree of our suffering determines the degree of our glory. The more suffering we pass through, the more our glory will be intensified. We want to be glorified, but we do not want to experience suffering. However, suffering increases glory. Paul says in 1 Corinthians 15:41 that &ldquo;star differs from star in glory,&rdquo; indicating that some stars shine more brightly than others. We all will shine, and we all will be glorified, but the intensity of our glory will depend on the amount of suffering that we are willing to take. It is certain that the apostle Paul will shine more brightly than all of us. We will be glorified, but the intensity of our glory will differ according to our suffering. Therefore, Paul says that the present suffering means nothing compared with the coming glory.</p><h2 class="head2">X. Reigning in the Coming Age with Christ<br />
through Endurance in This Age</h2>
<p>By the experience of the divine dispensing, we will reign in the coming age with Christ through endurance in this age. In 2 Timothy 2:12 Paul says, &ldquo;If we endure, we will also reign with Him.&rdquo; Enduring is related to life in this age, and reigning with Christ is related to the coming age. Endurance is the entrance into the coming reign with Christ. If we would reign as co-kings of Christ, we need to endure sufferings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Y. Being Given the Crown of Life<br />
for Their Sufferings, Trials, and Tribulations</h2>
<p>Under God&rsquo;s sovereign arrangement, many trials, troubles, tribulations, and sufferings have been assigned to the believers. They may wonder why trials come one after another like waves in the ocean. However, in principle, everything that happens to them is assigned from their Father for their good. Therefore, it is a basic principle that we should not try to escape sufferings, trials, and tribulations. We must believe in God&rsquo;s sovereignty. However, we should not be foolish in dealing with people and in handling matters. On the contrary, we should be wise. Nevertheless, no matter how wise we may be, we still need to believe that our Father in the heavens is sovereign. Just as certain trees grow through the hardship of cold weather, Christians grow through hardship. Our Father manages everything, and He assigns tribulations to us for our maturity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, sufferings afford us the best opportunity to enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. God assigns to us the sufferings needed for our growth. However, this growth will take place only as we remain under the divine dispensing. Therefore, we need to contact the processed Triune God all the time. Our contact with Him should be a continuous matter. We need to keep ourselves always in the divine fellowship. Our fellowship with the Lord should be as continuous as our breathing and as the circulation of blood in our bodies. When we fellowship with Him deep within us, we will receive and absorb the dispensing of the processed Triune God in a fine way. This dispensing comes from the heavens. By the nourishment that we receive through this dispensing, we will grow.</p>
<p>Eventually, the crown of life will be given to the believers for their sufferings, trials, and tribulations. Revelation 2:10 says, &ldquo;Do not fear the things that you are about to suffer. Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison that you may be tried, and you will have tribulation for ten days. Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life.&rdquo; To the church in Ephesus, the Lord promised to give the overcomers to eat of Himself as the tree of life (v. 7). To the church in Smyrna, He promised to give the overcomers the crown of life. The eating of the tree of life is inward for supply, and the crown of life is outward for glory. Both promises are wrapped up with the divine life. This life first must be our food, and then it will be our expression and our glorification as the crown of life.</p>
<p>A basic lesson that we all need to learn is that everything in our circumstances and environments depends not on us but on the sovereign Lord. Therefore, we should be at peace and not worry or be anxious. Our worry and anxiety do not help us at all. If we worry or are anxious, we simply waste our energy. We are not only in the Lord&rsquo;s hand; actually, we are also in the Lord. He is the place in which we should remain, and He is also our destiny. Day by day we should simply remain in His dispensing to have a direct enjoyment of the divine supply of the processed Triune God in His embodiment, which is Christ, and through His ultimate consummation, which is the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>The believers in Christ are appointed to suffer persecution. Hence, we should count it all joy when we fall into various trials, because God, through the divine dispensing, uses them to perfect us. We are pressed on every side but not constricted. We do not lose heart, for though our outer man is decaying, our inner man is being renewed day by day. The momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory. By experiencing the dispensing of the processed Triune God, we can also accept with joy the plundering of our possessions, knowing that we have a better and abiding possession. Through the divine dispensing we can share the kingdom of Jesus in His tribulation and endurance for the word of God and the testimony of Jesus. If we love the Lord, we will be under trials. We are blessed if we endure trials, because when we have been approved by testing, we will receive the crown of life, which the Lord promised to those who love Him.</p>
<p>We should not regard the fiery ordeals that we experience as strange but rather rejoice in sharing the sufferings of Christ. The Lord uses persecutions and trials to serve a positive purpose&mdash;the purification of our life. As Christians, followers of Christ, we should be those who undergo the sufferings of Christ. If we suffer from persecutors who contemptuously call us Christians, we should not feel ashamed but should glorify God in this name. The sufferings His chosen ones undergo in fiery persecution are used by Him as a means to judge them so that they may be disciplined, purified, and separated from unbelievers so as not to have the same destiny as unbelievers. While He is judging us as His household in His government, in His love He cares for us faithfully. As heirs of God and joint heirs with Christ, we will suffer with Christ. If we suffer with the Lord, we will be glorified with Him. The present sufferings mean nothing compared with the coming glory. By the experience of the divine dispensing, we will reign in the coming age with Christ through endurance in this age. God has assigned to us many trials, troubles, tribulations, and sufferings for our maturity. Sufferings also afford us the best opportunity to receive and absorb the dispensing of the processed Triune God in a fine way through our fellowship with Him. Eventually, the crown of life will be given to us.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>It is crucial that believers have the best attitude toward others. We are in the church, but the church is among human society. We cannot live a life outside human society. Hence, there is the need for us to know what kind of attitude we should hold toward unbelievers. In this message we will see that the believers experience the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in having the best attitude toward others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. HAVING THE BEST ATTITUDE TOWARD OTHERS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">A. Being Subject to the Government</h2>
<p>In having the best attitude toward others, the believers first need to be subject to the government. This is strongly charged in Romans 13:1-7. In verse 1 Paul says, &ldquo;Let every person be subject to the authorities over him.&rdquo; A natural character is a rebellious character, and man&rsquo;s natural response to authority is to rebel. But a transformed character is submissive. Hence, subjecting ourselves to the government requires a certain amount of transformation. Our being submissive to God&rsquo;s appointed authorities in the government is an indicator that we have a certain amount of transformation. Such transformation is the issue of the growth in life through the experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Recognizing That the Authorities<br />
Are from God, Appointed by God,<br />
as Servants of God</h2>
<p>The authorities are from God, appointed by God, as servants of God to the believers for their good. We need to recognize this. Paul says that the authority &ldquo;is a servant of God to you for good. But if you do what is evil, fear; he does not bear the sword in vain; for he is a servant of God, an avenger for wrath to him who practices evil&rdquo; (v. 4). The New Testament clearly teaches that all authorities are from God. Human government with its authority was established by God during Noah&rsquo;s time. After the flood God gave man authority to rule over others (Gen. 9:6). It was by this ruling authority among men that the nations were set up. Therefore, as Christians, we must recognize that the authorities are from God and respect them. Authorities have been appointed to the believers for their good. This means that through the authorities God allows us to live on the earth in peace to be His testimony. We surely need a peaceful situation while we are living on earth. In order to maintain a peaceful situation there is the need of a government with authority to rule over the people. Through this ruling, a good environment and a peaceful situation can be maintained. This is for our good.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Not Resisting Them</h2>
<p>Since authorities are from God, we should not resist them. &ldquo;He who resists the authority opposes God&rsquo;s ordination, and those who oppose will receive judgment to themselves. For the rulers are not a terror to the good work, but to the evil&rdquo; (Rom. 13:2-3). If we resist authority, either judgment will descend upon us from the authority, or it will come to us directly from God.</p>
<p>Paul also says, &ldquo;It is necessary to be subject, not only because of wrath but also because of conscience&rdquo; (v. 5). This indicates that our subjection should not only be out of fear of punishment; even more it should be for the sake of our conscience. Because of our conscience, we need to learn, by being transformed through the divine dispensing, to be subject to authorities.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Paying Taxes and Customs to Them<br />
as God&rsquo;s Officers</h2>
<p>In being subject to the government, believers should pay taxes and customs to the authorities as God&rsquo;s officers (vv. 6-7). On the one hand, we are in a good condition, enjoying a good country with a good government; on the other hand, we need to pay for this by paying taxes and customs to the authorities as God&rsquo;s officers. To pay taxes and customs indicates that we are subject to authority. In relation to the government we must be honest and pay whatever taxes are due.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Fearing and Honoring Them</h2>
<p>All believers need to learn how to subject themselves to authorities. Rendering fear and honor to whom they are due indicates that we are subject to the government (v. 7).</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Being Ready to Do Every Good Work</h2>
<p>According to the healthy teaching in the New Testament, believers must keep a good relationship with the government and be ready to do every good work (Titus 3:1-8). Paul said to Titus, &ldquo;Remind them to be subject to rulers, to authorities, to be obedient, to be ready unto every good work&rdquo; (v. 1). To be subject to rulers is to recognize God&rsquo;s authority and to respect His government over men. To be ready unto every good work means to live a testimony for God.</p>
<p>Before Paul could teach the saints to respect the government, he had to experience a certain amount of transformation. When he was Saul of Tarsus, he was a patriotic Jew and wanted to be free from the yoke of the Roman imperialists. However, in Titus 3:1 Paul instructs the saints to subject themselves to rulers and authorities, being ready unto every good work. According to Paul&rsquo;s word in Romans 13, governmental officials are appointed by God. Paul recognized that even the officials appointed by Caesar were rulers appointed by God; they were His deputy authority. If Paul had not been transformed from a natural person into a spiritual person with a spiritual understanding, it would have been difficult for him to give such instructions. In like manner, we need to be transformed through the divine dispensing in order to be subject to rulers and to be ready unto every good work. We have a proper relationship with the government not by ethical teachings, by philosophical instruction, or by our natural life and ability but through our experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God. We have a heavenly, divine, and spiritual supply that enables us to be subject to the government.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Being Subject for the Lord&rsquo;s Sake<br />
according to the Will of God</h2>
<p>First Peter 2:13-15 says, &ldquo;Be subject to every human institution for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, whether to a king as being supreme, or to governors as being sent by him for vengeance on evildoers and praise of those who do good. For so is the will of God, that by doing good you would muzzle the ignorance of foolish men.&rdquo; The phrase <em>every human institution</em> includes &ldquo;a king as being supreme&rdquo; and also &ldquo;governors as being sent by him.&rdquo; To be subject to institutions means to be subject to the regulations, ordinances, and laws enacted by the legislature. In these verses Peter is telling us that for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, that is, for the expression and glorification of God (v. 12), we should be subject to all human institutions according to the will of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Loving Their Enemies</h2>
<p>For the believers to have the best attitude toward others, they should love their enemies. This is the topmost attitude that they should hold toward others. The Lord Jesus said to His disciples, &ldquo;You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.&rsquo; But I say to you, Love your enemies&rdquo; (Matt. 5:43-44). This requirement to love our enemies deeply touches our being and is a test to prove whether we live by ourselves or by Christ. We love our good neighbors because they suit our natural choice, and we hate our enemies because they do not match our natural choice. If the Lord arranged for us to have only good neighbors and no enemies, we would not be put to the test. The Lord uses our enemies to expose what is within us. If we read Matthew 5 through 7, we will see that the constitution of the kingdom of the heavens does not give any room to our natural being; instead, it kills all the &ldquo;germs&rdquo; within us. Through the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity we are able to love our enemies.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Doing Well to Those Who Hate Them</h2>
<p>As believers, we not only should love our enemies but also do well to those who hate us. Luke 6:27 says, &ldquo;Love your enemies; do well to those who hate you.&rdquo; This is the highest standard of morality. Verse 35 says, &ldquo;Love your enemies, and do good and lend, expecting nothing in return, and your reward will be great, and you will be sons of the Most High; for He is kind to the unthankful and evil.&rdquo; This verse contains the secret to loving our enemies and doing good to those who hate us. The secret is the life of God. If we would fulfill these requirements, we must have the life of God. We must be born of the Most High, born of God, and thereby become sons of the Most High. Therefore, in order to love our enemies, we must be born of God to be a God-man, a person saturated with God and mingled with Him.</p>
<p>God loved us even when we were His enemies (Rom. 5:8, 10). This One who is the Most High is kind to those who are unthankful and evil. His love has been dispensed into us. Therefore, the love with which we love others, especially our enemies, is the love of God our Father. The New Testament says that God is love (1 John 4:8). As Spirit is the nature of God&rsquo;s person, and light is the nature of God&rsquo;s expression, so love is the nature of God&rsquo;s being. Hence, if we have been born of God, we surely have been born of the nature of God&rsquo;s being, which is the divine love. As those born of God, we have His life and nature. Now we are spontaneously able to love our enemies even as God our Father loves them. The reason the Lord told us to love our enemies is so that we may be the sons of the Most High.</p><h2 class="head3">2. Feeding Them<br />
and Giving Them a Drink</h2>
<p>In Romans 12:20 Paul says, &ldquo;If your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head.&rdquo; This is loving our enemies. Our love to them will be coals of fire heaped upon their heads to turn them to the Lord. It may be that by feeding our enemies and giving them a drink, we may, at least to some extent, move and turn their hearts and gain them for the Lord&rsquo;s sake.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Not Being Conquered by Evil,<br />
but Conquering Evil with Good</h2>
<p>Romans 12:21 says, &ldquo;Do not be conquered by evil, but conquer evil with good.&rdquo; To be conquered by evil is to repay evil with evil (v. 17). Suppose someone treats us evilly, and we treat him evilly in return. This indicates that we have been conquered by evil. We should not be like this. Instead, we should conquer evil with good. This means that if someone treats us evilly, we should treat him well in return. This is to conquer evil with good.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Praying for Their Persecutors</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus charged us to pray for those who persecute us (Matt. 5:44). This is a wonderful attitude to hold toward our persecutors. Stephen had such an attitude. When he was being stoned, even unto death, he knelt down and cried with a loud voice, &ldquo;Lord, do not hold this sin against them&rdquo; (Acts 7:60). Stephen prayed for his persecutors in the same way as his Lord, whom he loved and lived (Luke 23:34).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Blessing Them</h2>
<p>Not only should we pray for our persecutors; we should also bless them (Rom. 12:14). It is even more difficult to bless a persecutor than to pray for him. Nevertheless, through the divine dispensing this was Paul&rsquo;s experience. Therefore, he could say, &ldquo;Reviled we bless&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:12). First Peter 3:9 says, &ldquo;Not rendering evil for evil or reviling for reviling, but on the contrary blessing one another, because you were called to this, that you might inherit blessing.&rdquo; We have been called to bless others; hence, as a blessed people, we should always bless others so that we might inherit blessing. What we bless others with, we will inherit ourselves (Matt. 10:13; 7:2).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Not Cursing Them</h2>
<p>After charging us to bless those who persecute us, Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Bless and do not curse&rdquo; (Rom. 12:14). It is very difficult for us not to curse a person who is persecuting us. Even if we would not curse him with our mouth, we may be cursing him deep within us. Therefore, in order to bless our persecutors and not curse them, we need to be saturated with the processed Triune God through His dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Pursuing Peace with All Men</h2>
<h2 class="head3">1. Living in Peace with All Men</h2>
<p>We also need to pursue peace with all men. Hebrews 12:14 says, &ldquo;Pursue peace with all men.&rdquo; <em>To pursue</em> in this verse means &ldquo;to chase, even to chase vigorously.&rdquo; In having the best attitude toward others, we need to pursue peace, to chase peace vigorously. We should not fight with anyone. Rather, we should pursue peace with all men. This means that we endeavor to keep a peaceful situation with everyone by living in peace with all men.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. As Far as It Depends on Them</h2>
<p>Romans 12:18 says, &ldquo;If possible, as far as it depends on you, live in peace with all men.&rdquo; We need to live in peace with others, as far as it depends on us to do so. Sometimes it is not possible to live in peace with all men, because others are not willing to have a life of peace. There is nothing we can do in such a situation. This is the reason Paul says that we should live in peace with all men &ldquo;if possible.&rdquo; As far as it depends on us, we should do our best to live in peace with everyone.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>We are in the church, but the church is among human society. Hence, it is crucial that we have the best attitude toward others. We first need to be subject to the government through the dispensing of the processed Triune God. Authority is from God, and those in authority are appointed by God as servants of God to the believers for their good. We need to recognize this fact and not resist them. We should pay taxes and customs to them since they are God&rsquo;s officers. We should also learn to subject ourselves to authorities, fear and honor them, and maintain a good relationship with the government. We do not do these things by ethical teachings, by philosophical instructions, or by our natural life and ability but through our experience of the dispensing of the processed Triune God. We should also learn, for the Lord&rsquo;s sake, that is, for the expression and glorification of God, to be subject to all human institutions according to the will of God. Furthermore, we should love our enemies and do good to those who hate us. This is the highest standard of morality. If we would fulfill these requirements, we must be born of God to be a God-man, a person saturated with God and mingled with Him. As those born of God, we have His life and nature. Hence, we are spontaneously able to love our enemies even as God our Father loves them. Since His love has been dispensed into us, the love with which we love our enemies is the love of God our Father. We love our enemies by feeding them and giving them a drink, thus turning them to the Lord. If someone treats us evilly, we should treat him well in return. This is to conquer evil with good.</p>
<p>In addition, we have to pray for those who persecute us. Stephen had such an attitude. He was the same as the Lord, whom he loved and lived. Not only so, we should also bless our persecutors. We have been called to bless others, so we, as a blessed people, should always bless others so that we might inherit blessing. It is very difficult for us not to curse a person who is persecuting us. Therefore, we need to be saturated with the processed Triune God through His dispensing. We also need to pursue peace with all men, endeavoring to keep a peaceful situation with everyone by living in peace with all men. Sometimes it is not possible for us to live in peace with all men, because others are not willing to have a life of peace. However, as far as it depends on us, we should do our best to live in peace with everyone.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson and the next we will see that through the experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the believers have the highest standard of morality and virtues.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING THE HIGHEST STANDARD<br />
OF MORALITY AND VIRTUES</h2>
<p>In the New Testament salvation is based on the principle of faith; it has nothing to do with the law. The believers have been saved through faith, not through the keeping of the law. However, after they are saved, they must live a life that has a standard of morality higher than that of the old law. They should not think that, just because God does not deal with them according to the principle of the law but according to the principle of faith, they should not care for the moral commandments of the law. On the contrary, their standard of morality must be far higher than that of the requirements of the law.</p>
<p>When we speak of the highest standard of morality, we are not using the word <em>morality</em> in a traditional way. Rather, we are referring to the highest standard of morality and virtues achieved through the dispensing of the processed Triune God. The highest standard of morality is the standard of life required by God. It is the living of the Lord Jesus Christ, whose life was a composition of God with the divine attributes and man with the human virtues. He lived such a life on earth in which the attributes of God were expressed in the virtues of man. God&rsquo;s intention in His New Testament economy is that all the believers in Christ would become a reproduction of Christ, the God-man, in order to express Him in all the human virtues created by God for man. With the divine attributes of the God-man these virtues are strengthened, enriched, uplifted, and filled.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Having Been Created in Christ Jesus<br />
for Good Works, Which God Prepared Beforehand<br />
in Order That They Would Walk in Them</h2>
<p>In God&rsquo;s eyes the church, the masterpiece of God&rsquo;s work, is the highest poetry (Eph. 2:10), expressing God&rsquo;s infinite wisdom and divine design. This masterpiece is an absolutely new item in the universe; it is something newly originated by God. As the believers, we compose God&rsquo;s masterpiece and are absolutely new because we are the mingling of God and man. As God&rsquo;s masterpiece, we have been created &ldquo;for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them&rdquo; (v. 10). However, the good works for which God created us are not the good things according to our general natural concept but the definite good things that God preplanned and ordained for us to walk in. These good things include doing His will, living the church life, and bearing the testimony of Jesus.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Having Been Redeemed from All Lawlessness<br />
and Purified to Christ a Particular People<br />
as His Unique Possession, Zealous of Good Works</h2>
<p>In Titus 2:14 Paul says that Christ &ldquo;gave Himself for us that He might redeem us from all lawlessness and purify to Himself a particular people as His unique possession, zealous of good works.&rdquo; This means that Christ gave Himself not only that He might redeem us from all lawlessness (1 Cor. 6:20; 1 Pet. 1:18-19; 1 Tim. 2:6) but also that He might purify to Himself a particular people (Deut. 7:6; 14:2; 26:18) as His unique possession and personal treasure (1 Pet. 2:9; Exo. 19:5). As such a people, we should be zealous of good works. We, the believers in Christ, have been created in Christ for good works and redeemed by Christ to be His people, zealous of good works.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Being Regulated by the Governing Principles</h2>
<p>In order to have the highest standard of morality and virtues, we need to be regulated by four governing principles.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Concerning Things: All Things Are Lawful,<br />
but Not All Things Are Profitable</h2>
<p>The first governing principle is in 1 Corinthians 6:12: &ldquo;All things are lawful to me, but not all things are profitable.&rdquo; According to the context of the entire book of 1 Corinthians, Paul&rsquo;s thought is that all things are lawful to us, but not all things are good, profitable, convenient, or economical for us to live the Christian life, the church life, and the Body life.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Concerning Themselves:<br />
All Things Are Lawful, but They Must Not<br />
Be Brought under the Power of Anything</h2>
<p>The second governing principle is also in 1 Corinthians 6:12: &ldquo;All things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.&rdquo; The Greek words rendered &ldquo;be brought under the power of&rdquo; literally mean to &ldquo;be brought under the authority of.&rdquo; Paul is saying that we should not be brought under the authority of anything. This is subjective. Paul&rsquo;s thought is that all things are under our authority, but we must not be brought under the authority of anything. Hence, he says that all things are permissible, allowable, and lawful to us, but we must not be ruled, enslaved, or brought under the authority, the control, of anything. When we consider whether or not to do a certain thing, we should ask ourselves if we are under the power or control of that thing. If a particular thing controls us or has power over us, we should not do it. We must fully deal with anything that has power over us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Concerning Others: All Things Are Lawful,<br />
but Not All Things Build Up</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 10:23 speaks of the third governing principle: &ldquo;All things are lawful, but not all things build up.&rdquo; Not being brought under the power of anything concerns ourselves and is personal, subjective; building up concerns others and is corporate. First Corinthians emphasizes the matter of building up (3:9-10, 12; 8:1). When Paul uses the words <em>build up</em> in verse 23 of chapter 10, he is referring not only to the edification of individual believers but also to the building up of the corporate Body of Christ (14:4-5, 12; Eph. 4:16). In all that we do we must take care of things, ourselves, and others. Concerning things, everything we do must be profitable. Concerning ourselves, everything we do should not be a bondage, a slavery, to us. Concerning others, everything we do must build up others.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Concerning God: Whatever They Do,<br />
Do All to the Glory of God</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 10:31 speaks of the fourth governing principle: &ldquo;Whether you eat or drink, or whatever you do, do all to the glory of God.&rdquo; To do all to the glory of God means to do all in order to express God. According to the context of 1 Corinthians 6:13 through 11:1, to glorify God means in particular that we need to glorify God in our body (6:20). Hence, to glorify God is to let God, who dwells in us (1 John 4:13), occupy and saturate our body and express Himself through our body as His temple, especially in the two matters of eating and marriage. For this, we need to exercise severe and strict control over our body, bringing it into subjection (1 Cor. 9:27) and presenting it to God as a living sacrifice (Rom. 12:1).</p>
<p>First Corinthians 6:12; 10:23; and 10:31 have four basic principles for regulating the conduct of New Testament believers. First, all things are lawful to the believers, but all things must also be profitable, that is, not causing the suffering of any loss. Second, the believers must not be brought under the power, the control, the authority, of anything. Third, everything the believers do must build up others. Fourth, whatever the believers do, must be done to the glory of God. If a certain matter does not pass the test of these four principles, we should not do it.</p>
<p>As believers in Christ, we are not under the law. Nevertheless, we still need to be regulated by these four governing principles. However, in practice we may find it very difficult to live according to these principles. This is why we need the dispensing of the processed Triune God. To live according to these principles is to take the narrow way that leads to life (Matt. 7:14). In order to take this narrow way we need to apply Christ to every situation, because it is difficult for us to be released from our habits. We need the Triune God and His dispensing.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Practicing Surpassing Righteousness</h2>
<p>In Matthew 5:20 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Unless your righteousness surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees, you shall by no means enter into the kingdom of the heavens.&rdquo; Surpassing righteousness is the condition for entering into the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens in the millennium. This righteousness refers not only to the redeeming Christ, who becomes our objective righteousness when we believe in Him and receive Him so that we were justified before God (1 Cor. 1:30; Rom. 3:26), but much more to the indwelling Christ, who lives out of us as our subjective righteousness so that we may live in the reality of the kingdom today and enter into its manifestation in the future. This subjective righteousness is obtained through fulfilling the new law for the kingdom of the heavens given by the Lord Jesus in Matthew 5:17-48. The righteousness of the believers according to the new law of the kingdom surpasses that of the scribes and Pharisees according to the old law. It is impossible for our natural life to gain this surpassing righteousness. Such righteousness can be produced only by a higher life, the resurrection life of Christ. By keeping the highest law to the highest standard of morality, we fulfill the condition for entering into the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Not Getting Angry Surpassing Not Murdering</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You have heard that it was said to the ancients, &lsquo;You shall not murder, and whoever murders shall be liable to the judgment.&rsquo; But I say to you that everyone who is angry with his brother shall be liable to the judgment. And whoever says to his brother, Raca, shall be liable to the judgment of the Sanhedrin; and whoever says, Moreh, shall be liable to the Gehenna of fire&rdquo; (vv. 21-22). The word <em>Raca</em> is an expression of contempt, meaning &ldquo;stupid, good-for-nothing.&rdquo; The word <em>Moreh,</em> which is more serious than the expression of contempt, <em>Raca,</em> means &ldquo;fool,&rdquo; indicating a rebel (Num. 20:10). The law of the old dispensation deals with the act of murder, but the new law of the kingdom deals with anger, the motive of murder. Hence, the demand of the new law of the kingdom is deeper than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation. How difficult it is to fulfill the requirement of the Lord Jesus and control our anger and temper! It is also difficult not to condemn a brother nor hold him in contempt. Therefore, we should have no confidence in our natural life but enjoy Christ&rsquo;s overcoming life through the divine dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Not Lusting after a Woman by Looking at Her<br />
and Committing Adultery in the Heart<br />
Surpassing Not Committing Adultery</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:27 and 28 say, &ldquo;You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;You shall not commit adultery.&rsquo; But I say to you that everyone who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.&rdquo; The law of the old dispensation deals with the outward act of adultery (Exo. 20:14; Deut. 5:18), whereas the new law of the kingdom deals with the inward motive of the heart. Our temper and our lust constantly damage and trouble us. In order to live up to a moral standard that is higher than that of the old law, we must overcome our temper and our lust. In order to do this, we need Christ, and we need another life&mdash;the divine life. How we need to stay with Christ! We must contact Him not only day by day but even hour by hour. Because of the anger and lust within us, we need to remain in constant fellowship with the Lord, continually experiencing the dispensing of the processed Triune God. The divine life can fulfill the highest standard and can overcome our anger and lust.</p>
<p>We need to be clear that we are not keeping the law. Rather, we are walking according to the spirit. Romans 7 clearly reveals that the more we try to keep the law, the more we break it. But if we walk according to the spirit, we will spontaneously fulfill all the requirements of the law (8:4). Today we are neither under the law nor obliged to keep the law. We are walking according to the spirit. Within our spirit there is Christ, who is the resurrection life. If we walk according to the spirit, we will fulfill the highest requirements of the law, overcoming our anger and our lust, and live out the highest standard of morality.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Not Divorcing Surpassing Divorcing One&rsquo;s Wife with a Certificate of Divorce</h2>
<p>Matthew 5:31 and 32 say, &ldquo;It was said, Whoever divorces his wife, let him give her a certificate of divorce. But I say to you that everyone who divorces his wife, except for the cause of fornication, causes her to commit adultery, and whoever marries her who has been divorced commits adultery.&rdquo; In His original design for marriage, God ordained one wife for one husband. The marriage tie can be broken only by death (Rom. 7:3) or fornication. Hence, to have a divorce for any other reason is to commit adultery (Matt. 19:9). Due to the weakness and hardness of heart of the children of Israel, when the law was given, Moses gave a man permission to divorce his wife with a certificate of divorce. However, this was the law of the old dispensation concerning divorce; it was not according to God&rsquo;s design in the beginning (vv. 7-8). What the Lord Jesus proclaimed concerning marriage in the new law of the kingdom changed the way of the old dispensation. The Lord&rsquo;s new decree changed the law concerning divorce and recovered marriage back to God&rsquo;s original intention (vv. 4-6). Hence, only two things can break the marriage tie: the death of one of the parties or fornication. Therefore, concerning the highest standard of morality in the Christian life, not divorcing surpasses divorcing one&rsquo;s wife with a certificate of divorce.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Not Swearing Surpassing Not Breaking an Oath</h2>
<p>The old law regarding swearing was that we should not break an oath. The new law forbids the believers to swear in any manner: &ldquo;Again, you have heard that it was said to the ancients, &lsquo;You shall not break an oath, but you shall render to the Lord your oaths.&rsquo; But I tell you not to swear at all; neither by heaven, because it is the throne of God; nor by the earth, because it is the footstool of His feet; nor unto Jerusalem, because it is the city of the great King; neither shall you swear by your head, because you cannot make one hair white or black&rdquo; (5:33-36). We are not to swear by heaven, by the earth, unto Jerusalem, or by our head, because heaven, the earth, Jerusalem, and our head are not under our control but under God&rsquo;s control.</p>
<p>Apart from that, the highest standard of morality also requires that our word be simple and true. &ldquo;Let your word be, Yes, yes; No, no; for anything more than these is of the evil one&rdquo; (v. 37). Instead of trying to convince others with many words, we should be brief and clear in our speaking. We should be able to say, &ldquo;Yes, yes; No, no.&rdquo; We need to see a crucial matter, which is that the evil one seeks an opportunity to express himself through our excessive talking. Therefore, we should not say more than is necessary to avoid letting the evil one be expressed.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Not Resisting an Evil One,<br />
but Turning to Him the Left Cheek Plus the Right,<br />
Letting Him Have Their Cloak Plus Their Tunic,<br />
and Going Two Miles instead of One Mile<br />
When Compelled Surpassing Practicing<br />
an Eye for an Eye and a Tooth for a Tooth</h2>
<p>Although &ldquo;an eye for an eye, a tooth for a tooth&rdquo; (Exo. 21:24) of the old law is fair, just, and righteous, it is too low and is not the highest standard of morality. The Lord said, &ldquo;You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;An eye for an eye, and a tooth for a tooth.&rsquo; But I tell you not to resist him who is evil; rather whoever slaps you on your right cheek, turn to him the other also&rdquo; (Matt. 5:38-39). The new law given by the Lord tells the believers not to resist one who is evil. If someone slaps us on our right cheek, we should turn to him the other also; if someone wishes to take our tunic, we should yield to him our cloak also; and if someone compels us to go one mile, we should go two miles with him (vv. 39-41). To resist by claiming an eye for an eye means that we are releasing our temper. Through the divine dispensing we, the believers in Christ, can be above our temper, not resisting an evil one. We have the power to suffer and to be meek instead of resisting, and we have the power to walk not in the flesh nor in the soul for our own interest but in the spirit for the kingdom, practicing a living with the highest standard of morality.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. As Sons of the Heavenly Father,<br />
Loving Their Enemies and<br />
Praying for Their Persecutors Surpassing<br />
Loving Their Neighbor and Hating Their Enemy</h2>
<p>Legally speaking, the old law&mdash;to love our neighbor and hate our enemy&mdash;is fair and righteous, for a neighbor deserves our love and an enemy deserves our hatred. However, the Lord requires us to love our enemies and pray for our persecutors: &ldquo;You have heard that it was said, &lsquo;You shall love your neighbor and hate your enemy.&rsquo; But I say to you, Love your enemies, and pray for those who persecute you, so that you may become sons of your Father who is in the heavens, because He causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust&rdquo; (vv. 43-45). Such an exhortation touches our natural being and reveals how much the divine life within us can do for us.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said that if we love our enemies and pray for those who persecute us, we behave as sons of the heavenly Father. As sons of our Father, we should deal with the evil and the unjust as we deal with the good and the just (v. 45), love not only those who love us but also love those who do not love us (v. 46), and greet not only our brothers but also greet others (v. 47). To live in such a way is to be virtuous sons of our heavenly Father. Through the divine dispensing, we need to practice this high standard of morality and virtue and thereby live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Being Perfect<br />
as Their Heavenly Father Is Perfect</h2>
<p>The demand of the new law of the kingdom is much higher than the requirement of the law of the old dispensation. This higher demand can be met only by the Father&rsquo;s life, not by our natural life. We are the Father&rsquo;s children, having His divine life and divine nature. Hence, we can be perfect as our Father is perfect. For this reason, Matthew 5:48 says, &ldquo;You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The kingdom of the heavens is the highest demand, and the life of the Father is the highest supply to meet that demand. The divine life within us not only enables us to fulfill all the requirements of the law in Matthew 5 through 7; it can even make us perfect just as our heavenly Father is perfect. Since we are the Father&rsquo;s children, we do not need to copy or imitate Him. We just need to grow in His life, and we will be the same as He is. Our only need is to be exposed so that we give up all hope in ourselves. When we are exposed, we realize that our natural life is hopeless. Then we renounce our natural life, turn to the life of our Father, and stay with the divine nature. Spontaneously, this life will grow in us and fulfill the requirements of this highest law.</p>
<p>In His eternal economy God has ordained that His many sons should be like Christ, His firstborn Son. Because we have been born of God the Father, there is no reason or excuse for us not to be like our Father. The Father has begotten us, He has imparted His life into us, and He has given us His nature for our enjoyment. Now He is waiting for us to enjoy Him. The divine life brings us into His fellowship, and in this fellowship we enjoy the Father in His life and nature. Therefore, it is actually easy and normal for us, as sons of the Father, to be perfect as He is perfect. The way to be perfect is to remain in the divine fellowship so as to receive and enjoy continually the dispensing of the processed Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Through the experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the believers can have the highest standard of morality and virtues. Although they have been saved through faith and not through keeping the law, now that they are saved, they must live a life with a standard of morality that is higher than that of the old law. We have been created for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we should walk in them. Christ gave Himself for us to redeem us from all lawlessness and to purify to Himself a particular people as His unique possession. As such a people, we should be zealous of good works.</p>
<p>In order to live out the highest standard of morality and virtues, we need to be regulated by four governing principles. Concerning things, all things are lawful to us, but not all things are profitable. Concerning ourselves, all things are lawful to us, but we should not be brought under the power of anything. Concerning others, all things are lawful, but not all things build up. Concerning God, whatever we do, we do all to the glory of God. In practice, we may find it very difficult to live according to these principles. Hence, we need the dispensing of the processed Triune God.</p>
<p>By keeping the highest law to the highest standard of morality, the believers fulfill the condition for entering into the coming manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. The law of the old dispensation deals with the act of murder and adultery, but the new law of the kingdom deals with anger and the inward motive of the heart. Within our spirit there is Christ, who is the resurrection life. Therefore, if we walk according to the spirit, we will fulfill the highest requirements of the law, overcoming our anger and our lust, and we will live out the highest standard of morality. In addition, the highest standard of morality includes not divorcing and not swearing. Through experiencing the divine dispensing, we are able to turn the left cheek plus the right to the evil one, to let him have our cloak plus our tunic, and to go two miles instead of one mile when compelled. Not resisting an evil one surpasses practicing an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. As sons of the heavenly Father, we love our enemies and pray for our persecutors, which surpasses loving our neighbor and hating our enemy. We have been born of our Father, so the divine life brings us into His fellowship, and in this fellowship we enjoy the Father&rsquo;s life and nature. Therefore, as sons of the Father, we can be perfect as He is perfect.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will continue the previous lesson and look at further matters concerning the believers&rsquo; having the highest standard of morality and virtues through experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity. We will also consider the believers&rsquo; experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the matter of watching and praying.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. Being Established<br />
in Every Good Work and Word</h2>
<p>Second Thessalonians 2:16 and 17 say, &ldquo;Now our Lord Jesus Christ Himself and God our Father, who has loved us and given us eternal comfort and good hope in grace, comfort your hearts and establish you in every good work and word.&rdquo; These verses indicate that by experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity we can have a good testimony in what we do and say; we are established in every good work and word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. Proving All Things and<br />
Holding Fast to What Is Good</h2>
<p>In 1 Thessalonians 5:20 and 21 Paul says, &ldquo;Do not despise prophecies, but prove all things. Hold fast to what is good.&rdquo; In these verses Paul reminds us not to despise prophecies but instead to prove all things. To prove all things includes to discern prophecies (1 Cor. 14:29), to discern the spirits (12:10), to prove the spirits (1 John 4:1), to prove what the will of God is (Rom 12:2), and to prove what is well pleasing to the Lord (Eph. 5:10). On the one hand, we should not despise prophecies; on the other hand, we should not follow blindly. We should have the habit of proving everything that we intend to do, of testing everything, and then of holding fast to what is good.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. Abstaining from Every Kind of Evil</h2>
<p>First Thessalonians 5:22 says, &ldquo;Abstain from every kind of evil.&rdquo; This indicates that the believers who live in the divine dispensing should abstain from evil in any form and of any kind.</p>
<h2 class="head2">I. Enduring Suffering for Doing Good</h2>
<p>The fact that the believers have the highest standard of morality and virtues is also seen in their enduring suffering for doing good. First Peter 2:20 says, &ldquo;For what glory is it if, while sinning and being buffeted, you endure? But if, while doing good and suffering, you endure, this is grace with God.&rdquo; In this verse <em>grace</em> refers to the motivation of the divine life within us and its expression in our life, becoming in our behavior gracious and acceptable in the sight of both man and God. We are able to express endurance in our living by the working of God&rsquo;s grace within us and through us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">J. Taking Account of What Things Are True,<br />
What Things Are Dignified,<br />
What Things Are Righteous, What Things Are Pure, What Things Are Lovely,<br />
What Things Are Well spoken of,<br />
If There Is Any Virtue and If Any Praise</h2>
<p>In Philippians 4:8 Paul says, &ldquo;What things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, what things are well spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things.&rdquo; In this verse we first see the expression of six virtues, which are six governing aspects, in a life that lives Christ. Next, we see the summing up of the six virtues expressed in the Christian life.</p><h2 class="head3">1. The Six Virtues,<br />
Which Are Also Six Governing Aspects,<br />
of a Life That Lives Christ</h2>
<p>The first virtue of these six governing aspects is &ldquo;what things are true.&rdquo; The word <em>true</em> means &ldquo;truthful ethically,&rdquo; not merely true in matter of fact. In the expression of the life that lives Christ there can be no falsehood, no lying. Everything that we do or say must be truthful. No one who lives Christ should practice falsehood of any kind. A life that is the expression of Christ is a truthful one. The second virtue is &ldquo;what things are dignified.&rdquo; This indicates that if we live Christ, we must be dignified, noble, grave, solid, weighty, and honorable before man. When others see us bearing such dignity, they will be inspired and have a profound respect for us. The third virtue is &ldquo;what things are righteous.&rdquo; This refers to what is right, not just, before God and man. A person who lives Christ always maintains a proper relationship with God and with man. The fourth virtue is &ldquo;what things are pure.&rdquo; The word <em>pure</em> means &ldquo;single in intention and action, without pretense and without any mixture.&rdquo; The fifth virtue is &ldquo;what things are lovely.&rdquo; The word <em>lovely</em> means &ldquo;lovable, agreeable, and endearing.&rdquo; The last virtue is &ldquo;what things are well spoken of.&rdquo; This indicates that as Christians we should do whatever is of good repute, renowned, attractive, winning, and gracious. If we live Christ, we will surely have a life that is an expression of all these virtues.</p>
<p>On the basis of Paul&rsquo;s word, &ldquo;To me, to live is Christ&rdquo; (1:21), we can rightly say that the virtues in verse 8 of chapter 4 are not things apart from Christ. These are not merely human virtues; the reality of these virtues is Christ Himself. Not only so, if we carefully consider these virtues, we will realize that in ourselves it is impossible for us to have such a life and to have such an expression. Therefore, we must experience what Paul speaks of in verse 13, &ldquo;I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me.&rdquo; Now that Christ dwells in us (Col. 1:27), He empowers us, makes us dynamic, from within. By such inward empowering, Paul could do all things in Christ; that is, he could express Christ in all these virtues.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. The Summing Up of the Six Virtues<br />
of the Christian Life</h2>
<p>Toward the end of Philippians 4:8 Paul changes his expression and says, &ldquo;If there is any virtue and if any praise, take account of these things.&rdquo; <em>Virtue</em> means &ldquo;excellence,&rdquo; that is, ethical energy exhibited in vigorous action. <em>Praise</em> here refers to things worthy of praise, as the companion of virtue. Virtue and praise, categorized as &ldquo;if any,&rdquo; are not two additional items but values of the six items already covered. Virtue and praise sum up the six items into two categories. This is to say that every item of the six foregoing virtues is excellent and has something worthy of praise. Paul says that we should &ldquo;take account of these things&rdquo;; that is, we should think on them, ponder them, consider them.</p>
<p>How excellent is the expression of the life that lives Christ! In each of these excellent aspects there is some virtue and something worthy of praise. The picture portrayed by these items is much more virtuous than that portrayed in the Ten Commandments. These virtues produce excellence and praise. The praise is not only to God but also to us; others will praise us for all these excellent virtues. In our experience of Christ we must attain to the point that whatever we do is true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely, and well spoken of. These virtues will be an excellency in our behavior and will cause others to praise God and also to praise us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">X. WATCHING AND PRAYING</h2>
<p>In our enjoying the dispensing of the Divine Trinity we must learn to watch and pray. We should not remain in any kind of sleeping condition. Rather, we need to watch over the situation concerning ourselves, the brothers and sisters, the church in which we are, and even the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. We should also watch and pray concerning the Lord&rsquo;s interest, His present move, the world situation, and the condition regarding the unsaved. As believers, we should be concerned for these things, learning to watch over and to pray concerning them.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. Not Entering into Temptation</h2>
<p>Matthew 26:41 says, &ldquo;Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation. The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak.&rdquo; The Lord&rsquo;s word here indicates that in spiritual things our spirit is often ready, but our flesh is weak. It is possible for us to be tempted in anything, at any place, and at any time; therefore, the Lord reminds us to watch and pray so that we do not enter into temptation.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being Watchful at Every Time<br />
and Beseeching to Escape All the Things<br />
of the Great Tribulation Coming as a Snare</h2>
<p>In Luke 21:34 and 35 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Take heed to yourselves lest perhaps your hearts be weighed down with debauchery and drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day come upon you suddenly as a snare. For it will come in upon all those dwelling on the face of all the earth.&rdquo; This generation can be compared to Noah&rsquo;s generation. In the days of Noah people were eating, drinking, marrying, and being given in marriage (17:27). They were in debauchery and drunkenness, being stupefied by enjoyment and anxiety. Today people are living in the same way. Therefore, when the Lord comes unexpectedly, &ldquo;that day&rdquo; will come upon them as a snare, as a net cast over all those dwelling on the face of all the earth.</p>
<p>However, the Lord said, &ldquo;Be watchful at every time, beseeching that you would prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and stand before the Son of Man&rdquo; (21:36). To prevail is to have the strength and ability to escape the great tribulation. This indicates that those who prevail will be taken, raptured (17:34-36), before the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21). The great tribulation will be a severe trial upon the whole inhabited earth (Rev. 3:10). By their watchfulness and beseeching, those who prevail will have the ability to escape and to be kept out of the hour of trial, which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth. As Christians living on this earth, we should not be caught in the trend of today&rsquo;s world nor be stupefied by enjoyment and anxieties. We should be vigilant. At every time we need to beseech. We need to pray not in a general way but in a particular way so that we may prevail, have the strength and ability, to escape the things of the great tribulation which are about to take place.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Standing before the Son of Man<br />
at His Throne in the Heavens</h2>
<p>The believers should watch and pray not only to escape the great tribulation but also to &ldquo;stand before the Son of Man&rdquo; (Luke 21:36). Before the great tribulation the Lord Jesus will probably still be on the throne. The Lord&rsquo;s parousia (presence) will begin from the throne. This parousia will continue with His coming to the air and will end with His coming to the earth. At the beginning of His parousia, certain believers, such as the one hundred forty-four thousand firstfruits in Revelation 14, will be raptured to the throne of God and stand with the Savior on the heavenly Mount Zion. This is according to the Lord&rsquo;s word in Luke 21:36: if we are watching and praying, we will not only prevail to escape the great tribulation but also be those who prevail to stand before the Savior on the heavenly Mount Zion before the great tribulation.</p>
<p>The downward trend on earth is very strong. This trend has become a tide that carries everything and everyone along with it. It is extremely difficult for believers in Christ to stand in the midst of this tide. Therefore, we need to be watchful and pray daily in a particular way so that we may receive the strength that comes from the resurrection life within us and not be caught by the trend of this age but stand against the trend, the tide, of the world. If we pray, we will be filled with Christ as the divine air, and we will be buoyant. Eventually, we will be taken away to meet Christ on the throne. Whether we will become those who prevail to be raptured before the great tribulation does not depend on the Lord. It depends on our watchfulness and on our praying in a particular way. We need to be watchful and pray at every time so that we can prevail to escape the great tribulation and stand before the Son of Man.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Not Knowing the Day and the Hour<br />
of the Lord&rsquo;s Coming</h2>
<p>We need to watch and pray because we do not know the day and the hour of the Lord&rsquo;s coming (Matt. 24:42; 25:13). As the believers who are still living, we must be ready to be raptured. &ldquo;If the householder had known in which watch the thief was coming, he would have watched and would not have allowed his house to be broken into&rdquo; (24:43). The Lord will come secretly as a thief to those who love Him and will take them away as His treasures. Hence, we should watch. The Lord said, &ldquo;For this reason you also be ready, because at an hour when you do not expect it, the Son of Man is coming&rdquo; (v. 44). It is a serious mistake for any believer to think that he can know the exact day and hour of the Lord&rsquo;s coming. According to the prophecies in the Scriptures, we may know approximately the time of the Lord&rsquo;s coming. However, the prophecies do not tell us clearly and exactly the day and hour of the Lord&rsquo;s coming. If we think that we know the day and the time, we are cheating ourselves. In an unexpected hour the Lord will come secretly to the overcoming believers. This is a very serious matter. Hence, we need to be watchful.</p>
<p>According to the context of Matthew 25:13, to be watchful is to be filled with the Holy Spirit. If we want to be prudent virgins, our spirit needs to be burning every day, and our soul, our being, needs to be filled with the extra portion of the Holy Spirit every day (v. 4). The Spirit within us is the saturating Spirit, whom we must allow to saturate our entire being; He needs to spread from within our spirit to reach and penetrate our soul. This is what it means to be a watchful person, one who is ready for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back.</p><h2 class="head1">XI. A CONCLUDING WORD CONCERNING<br />
THE BELIEVERS&rsquo; EXPERIENCE IN THE PROGRESSING STAGE OF GOD&rsquo;S FULL SALVATION</h2>
<p>From Level 2, volume 3 of <em>Truth Lessons</em> up to this lesson, we have gradually and carefully looked into the believers&rsquo; experience in the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of transformation. This stage includes five major items: (1) experiencing and enjoying the processed Triune God in His Triune dispensing; (2) experiencing God&rsquo;s redemption continually; (3) enjoying the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the divine transformation for the divine conformation; (4) experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity corporately by entering into the kingdom of God, by living in the church, and by living in the Body of Christ; and (5) experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in other aspects. These five items constitute the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation. In this stage of transformation we are saved from the power of sin, the law of sin and of death, our old man, our flesh with its lusts, our self, our soul (natural life), our individualism, Satan, the world with its present age and its religious aspect, the law of letters with its ordinances, and the degradation of the church with all its mixtures. We are being saved from these things by the dispensing of the processed Triune God into us. The issue of our experience of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity brings us into two glorious results: first, becoming, as the bride, one with the Spirit; second, expecting and waiting for the Lord Jesus&rsquo; second coming to usher us into our future.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>Through experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the believers can have the highest standard of morality and virtues. By experiencing the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we are being established in every good work and word. Therefore, we need to have the habit of proving everything that we intend to do, to test everything, and then to hold fast to what is good. We also need to abstain from every kind of evil. The highest standard of morality and virtues is also seen in our endurance, which is the working of God&rsquo;s grace within us. We need to take account of what things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, what things are well spoken of, if there is any virtue and if any praise. The six virtues of being true, dignified, righteous, pure, lovely and well spoken of are the expression of a life that lives Christ; virtue and praise are the values of these six virtues and also the summing up of these six excellent virtues. These virtues will be an excellency in our behavior and will cause others to praise God and also to praise us.</p>
<p>In our enjoying of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we must learn to watch and pray so that we may not enter into temptation. The Lord reminds us to watch and pray because it is possible for us to be tempted in anything, at any place, and at any time. While living in this age, we need to take heed to ourselves lest perhaps our hearts be weighed down with debauchery and drunkenness and the anxieties of life, and that day come upon us suddenly as a snare, for that day will come upon all those dwelling on the face of the earth. If we are watchful and praying at every time, we will prevail to escape all these things which are about to happen and to stand before the Son of Man at His throne in the heavens. Furthermore, we need to watch and pray because we do not know the day and the hour of the Lord&rsquo;s coming. We must be ready to be raptured by being filled with the Holy Spirit all day long. We need to allow Him to saturate our entire being, spreading from within our spirit to reach and even to penetrate our soul. This is the life of a watchful person, a person who is ready for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back.</p>

<h2 class="head1">TEXT</h2>
<p>In this lesson we will cover two matters: first, as the bride, the believers becoming one with the Spirit; second, their looking to and waiting for the Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming back to usher them into their future. These two matters are the issue of the believers&rsquo; enjoying the dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. BECOMING, AS THE BRIDE, ONE WITH THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the stage of transformation, as we experience and enjoy the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, the first issue is that we, as the bride, become one with the Spirit. The consummation of the divine dispensing of the processed Triune God will be a universal marriage (Rev. 19:7-9; 21:2, 9). The Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God will be the Bridegroom, and God&rsquo;s redeemed people as the consummation of the redeemed, regenerated, and transformed humanity will be the bride. This will be the consummation spoken of by John the Baptist: &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom&rdquo; (John 3:29). The New Testament eventually reveals that the Spirit, as the consummation of the processed Triune God, and the bride, as the consummation of the transformed tripartite man, will be one and will speak as one. Revelation 22:17 says, &ldquo;The Spirit and the bride say, Come!&rdquo; This indicates that the church&rsquo;s experience of the Spirit has progressed to the extent that she has become one with the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Spirit, as the Consummation<br />
of the Processed and Dispensed Triune God,<br />
Becoming One with the Bride&mdash;the Aggregate<br />
of All the Regenerated and Transformed<br />
Tripartite Men</h2>
<p>The Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the sovereign Lord who created the universe and all things, that is, the Triune God who has passed through the process of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. Having passed through this process, the Triune God is now the consummated Spirit. Hence, the Spirit is now the compound, all-inclusive, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold intensified, consummated Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God to be the eternal portion of His chosen, redeemed, regenerated, sanctified, transformed, and glorified tripartite people as their life, life supply, and everything.</p>
<p>Therefore, there are two consummations in Revelation 22:17, which speaks of the Spirit becoming one with the bride. First, the Triune God has gone through a process&mdash;through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension&mdash;to become the Spirit, the totality, the consummation, of the Triune God to be the Bridegroom. Second, the believers also have gone through a process&mdash;redemption, regeneration, and transformation&mdash;to become the consummation of God&rsquo;s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people to be the bride. The Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the Triune God has been and is being dispensed into us. Eventually, the Spirit becomes one with the bride, the aggregate of all the regenerated and transformed tripartite believers. This means that the Triune God, after being consummated as the Spirit, will &ldquo;marry&rdquo; the believers as the bride. The consummation of the processed Triune God and the consummation of God&rsquo;s chosen, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people will become one in a universal marriage. Therefore, the processed tripartite man will match the processed Triune God forever for His full expression and satisfaction.</p><h2 class="head2">B. Forming a Universal Couple&mdash;<br />
the Mingling of the Processed Triune God<br />
with the Regenerated and Transformed<br />
Tripartite Man</h2>
<p>According to the entire Bible, there is a divine romance between God the Creator, the Redeemer, who is the male, and His redeemed people, who are the female. In the Old Testament God told His redeemed people Israel that He was their Husband and that they were His wife (Isa. 54:5; Jer. 3:14; 31:32; Hosea 2:19). When the Lord Jesus came, John the Baptist told his disciples that Christ was the Bridegroom coming to take the bride, who is the church (John 3:29). In Ephesians 5 Paul says that the church is typified by the wife, and Christ is typified by the husband. Therefore, Christ is the Husband, and the church is the wife. Paul also says that he betrothed us as a virgin to one Husband, who is Christ (2 Cor. 11:2). Furthermore, Revelation 19:7 says, &ldquo;The marriage of the Lamb has come, and His wife has made herself ready.&rdquo; This wife is the aggregate of all the overcoming saints from the time of Abel until the Lord comes back. Finally, the New Jerusalem will be the consummation of God&rsquo;s counterpart, the aggregate of all His redeemed and perfected people. The ultimate consummation of the divine romance revealed in the Bible is a couple. This couple is the mingling of the processed and dispensed Triune God with the regenerated and transformed tripartite man. Revelation 22:17 reveals that this universal couple, as the ultimate consummation of the divine romance revealed in the Bible, is the mingling of the processed and dispensed Triune God with the regenerated and transformed tripartite man.</p>
<p>The Bible begins with the marriage of Adam and Eve in Genesis and ends with the marriage of the Spirit and God&rsquo;s redeemed people in Revelation. This final marriage is the marriage of the processed, consummated, and dispensed Triune God as the Husband with His regenerated and transformed people as the bride. For eternity this universal couple will be the full manifestation of the Triune God expressed in all His glory. This is the conclusion of the New Testament and also of the entire Bible. At the conclusion of the Bible there is an eternal, universal couple expressing the Triune God for eternity.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. Expressing a Desire for the Lord&rsquo;s Coming</h2>
<p>In Revelation 22:7 the Lord says, &ldquo;Behold, I come quickly,&rdquo; and in verse 12 He says, &ldquo;Behold, I come quickly, and My reward is with Me to render to each one as his work is.&rdquo; Then in verse 17 the Spirit and the bride say, &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; is the response of the Spirit and the bride to the Lord&rsquo;s word concerning His coming. Those who love the Lord&rsquo;s appearing (2 Tim. 4:8) and hear the word concerning His coming, should express a joint desire for the Lord&rsquo;s coming with a response, by saying, &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; The Spirit and the bride speak together and respond to the Lord&rsquo;s word. The fact that they speak as one indicates that they have become one. At the end of Revelation we are no longer merely the receivers of the divine oracle. We have become one with the divine Speaker and express with Him the desire for the Lord&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Calling the Thirsty Ones to Come<br />
and Drink the Water of Life&mdash;the Flow of<br />
the Processed and Dispensing Triune God</h2>
<p>The Spirit and the bride call the thirsty ones to come and drink the water of life&mdash;the flow of the processed and dispensing Triune God. &ldquo;The Spirit and the bride say, Come! And let him who hears say, Come! And let him who is thirsty come; let him who wills take the water of life freely&rdquo; (Rev 22:17). The word <em>come</em> is found three times in this verse. The first occurrence refers to the coming back of the Lord and is uttered by the Spirit and the bride. Then the one who hears the Spirit and the bride joins in, saying, &ldquo;Come!&rdquo; The Spirit and the bride, on the one hand, desire that the Lord Jesus will come and, on the other hand, yearn that the thirsty sinner will also come to take the water of life for his satisfaction. When we have a sincere desire for the Lord&rsquo;s desire, we also have an earnest expectation for the sinner&rsquo;s salvation. Therefore, the third <em>come</em> in this verse refers to the coming of the repenting sinners. Hence, this verse covers three matters: the response of the Spirit and the bride; the word of the one who hears the declaration of the Spirit and the bride; and the desire for the thirsty sinner, the unsaved one, to come and drink of the water of life.</p>
<p>If we have a desire for the Lord Jesus to come back, this desire will stir up within us a concern for the salvation of others. As we are saying, &ldquo;Come, Lord,&rdquo; a burden will rise up within us for our family, neighbors, friends, and colleagues. We should say to the Lord, &ldquo;Come,&rdquo; and then turn to the unbelievers and say, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus is coming. Will you not come also? Come and be saved. Come to receive your salvation that you may be prepared to meet the coming Savior.&rdquo; We will sound out a call to the thirsty ones to come to drink the water of life, the flow of the processed and dispensing Triune God, so that they also may have a part in the aggregate of God&rsquo;s redeemed people and be His bride.</p><h2 class="head3">1. Participating in God&rsquo;s Central Goal</h2>
<p>Anyone who answers the call to come and drink of the water of life will participate in the central goal of God&rsquo;s economy. This means that he will share in the dispensing of the processed Triune God and be a part of the bride of the Lamb for the satisfaction and expression of the processed and dispensing Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Fulfilling the Eternal Purpose<br />
of the Divine Economy of the Triune God</h2>
<p>This is to fulfill the eternal purpose of the divine economy of the Triune God according to His heart&rsquo;s desire for His pleasure (Eph. 1:9-11; 3:9-11) in eternity future.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. LOOKING TO AND WAITING FOR<br />
THE LORD JESUS&rsquo; COMING BACK<br />
TO USHER THEM INTO THEIR FUTURE</h2>
<p>In the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, the believers&rsquo; experience and enjoyment of the dispensing of the processed Triune God will also issue in their looking to and waiting for the Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming back to usher them into their future. Our future is an eternal married life with the Triune God. Now we are looking to that glorious day. We are waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back.</p>
<p>The living of worldly people gives the impression that their future is on the earth and that their hope, destiny, and destination are thoroughly related to the present age. But this is not our situation. We are waiting for the Son of God to come from the heavens; hence, our future is focused on Him. To await the appearing of the Lord is a normal sign of true believers. According to 1 Thessalonians 1:9 and 10, we have turned to God from idols not only &ldquo;to serve a living and true God&rdquo; but also to &ldquo;await His Son from the heavens, whom He raised from the dead, Jesus, who delivers us from the wrath which is coming.&rdquo; First Corinthians 1:7 says that we are &ldquo;eagerly awaiting the revelation of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; These two portions of the Word indicate an important characteristic of our Christian life: awaiting the Lord&rsquo;s coming.</p>
<p>As Christians, we must live a life of awaiting God&rsquo;s Son from the heavens, a life that declares to others that our hope is not on this earth or in this age. Rather, our hope is in the coming Lord, and our future is in Him. On this earth we do not have any destiny, destination, or future. Our future, our destiny, and our destination are altogether focused on the Lord who is coming. He is our hope, our future, and our destination. &ldquo;Our commonwealth exists in the heavens, from which also we eagerly await a Savior, the Lord Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Phil. 3:20). Our national life is not in any earthly country; it is in the heavens. Our real citizenship, our true commonwealth or associations of life, is not on this earth; it is in the heavens. We need to remember, therefore, that we are a heavenly people sojourning on earth, awaiting the Savior, &ldquo;who will transfigure the body of our humiliation to be conformed to the body of His glory, according to His operation by which He is able even to subject all things to Himself&rdquo; (v. 21).</p>
<p>While experiencing the stage of transformation in God&rsquo;s full salvation by the dispensing of the processed Triune God and after reading various portions of the Scriptures regarding the Lord&rsquo;s coming, we should, like John, express the desire from our deepest part as a prayer to hasten the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Our prayer should be &ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo; which is also the last prayer in the Bible (Rev. 22:20).</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUMMARY</h2>
<p>In the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, our enjoyment of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity issues in our becoming, as the bride, one with the Spirit and also in our looking to and waiting for the Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming back to usher us into our future. The consummation of the divine dispensing of the processed Triune God will be a universal marriage. The Spirit with the bride become one to form a universal couple. This couple is the mingling of the processed Triune God with the regenerated and transformed tripartite man and is the ultimate consummation of the divine romance as revealed in the Bible. According to the entire Bible, there is a divine romance between God the Creator, the Redeemer, who is the male, and His redeemed people, who are the female. The Bible begins with the marriage of Adam and Eve in Genesis and ends with the marriage of the Spirit and God&rsquo;s redeemed people in Revelation. At the end of the Bible, the Spirit and the bride call the thirsty ones to come and drink the water of life&mdash;the flow of the processed and dispensing Triune God. We also should sound out a call to the thirsty ones to drink the water of life, the flow of the processed and dispensing Triune God, so that thirsty sinners also may have a part in the aggregate of God&rsquo;s redeemed people to be His bride. Anyone who would answer this call will participate in God&rsquo;s central goal for the fulfilling of the eternal purpose of the divine economy of the Triune God.</p>
<p>In the progressing stage of God&rsquo;s full salvation, our experience and enjoyment of the dispensing of the processed Triune God will also issue in our looking to and waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming back to usher us into our future. We are looking to that glorious day; we are waiting for the Lord&rsquo;s coming. This is an important characteristic of our Christian life. As Christians, we must live a life that declares to others that our hope is not on this earth or in this age. Our hope is in the coming Lord. Our national life, our real citizenship, is not on this earth; it is in the heavens. While experiencing the stage of transformation in God&rsquo;s full salvation by the dispensing of the processed Triune God and after reading various portions of the Scriptures regarding the Lord&rsquo;s coming, we should, like John, express the desire from our deepest part as a prayer to hasten the Lord&rsquo;s coming. Our prayer should be &ldquo;Come, Lord Jesus!&rdquo;</p>
