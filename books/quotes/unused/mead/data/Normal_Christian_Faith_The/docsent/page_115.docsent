   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO OTHER NAME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A church can only be named after its locality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It cannot have any other name.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is also quite clear from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The church should not be prefixed by the name of any person, system, country, origin, or doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It must only contain the name of the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, you cannot have a church of Rome in Shanghai or the Church of England in Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even the Church of Christ in China is something not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Wherever you are, you are the church in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you want to change churches, you have to move to another locality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>BORN INTO THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After a man has believed in Jesus Christ through the mercy of God, he must realize that God has put him into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He is born into it in the same way that a member is born a part of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is no need to join the church, for he is already a part of it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, for the sake of knowing and fellowshipping with other brothers and sisters, he should find a church that stands on the ground of locality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He should go to them and say, "I am a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let us have fellowship together."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way he will be able to function with other members in the Body of Christ and will be able to run a straight course and experience fast progress in his Christian life.</S>
