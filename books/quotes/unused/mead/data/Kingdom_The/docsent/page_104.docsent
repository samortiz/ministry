   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO PRINCIPLES OF THE KINGDOM 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 10:16-22, 34-39; 11:11-12, 18-19, 25-27, 28-30</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Beginning with Matthew 8, there are several cases which illustrate principles related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have covered three cases already, and they are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first case shows that we were lepers, but our leprosy has been cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The second case reveals that we enter the kingdom by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The third case tells us that now we need to enjoy our Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The leprosy is gone, and faith has come for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the kingdom life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A leper represents man corrupted by Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The man God created was clean and pure.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After God saw everything that He had made, including man, He said, "Very good" Gen 1:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, by the time God came in the flesh John 1:14 to establish His kingdom, man had become a leper.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Leprosy signifies the total corruption of man caused by the rebellious one, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Matthew reveals the kingdom, giving us an all-inclusive picture of the wonderful One who is the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He is God incarnated as a man to deal with His enemy and establish His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God's intention is to set up His kingdom with humanity, and He created man for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God created man in His own image so that man could exercise dominion over all the earth, especially over all the creeping things Gen 1:26-28 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Satan, the serpent, is counted among the creeping things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is God's desire that man subdue the earth, conquer the enemy, and recover God's authority in order that God could establish His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Satan, however, corrupted the man God had created, making him a leper.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the Old Testament types, no person is more defiled, more corrupted and ruined, than a leper.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A leper represents the totality of Satan's work of corruption upon humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Keep in mind this meaning of a leper.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When God came in the flesh, the man created by God had become fully corrupted and was a leper.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But regardless of how much Satan had corrupted and ruined man, God can cleanse the lepers and recover them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is exactly what the Lord did.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you read Leviticus 14, you can see how the blood and the water were used to cleanse the leper.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, blood and water came out of His side John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The blood signifies redemption, and the water signifies life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With His blood and His life He has recovered us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is an exceedingly marvelous revelation!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through His redemption our leprosy has vanished.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our ruin and corruption are gone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The corruption is gone, and faith has come.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By our natural birth, we are Gentiles and thus disqualified from participating in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But we can have faith which comes from realizing a wonderful object.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Without an object to realize, faith is vain.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Faith needs an object.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The object of our faith is the wonderful Lord Jesus who has all authority and who, in Himself, is the highest authority.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we realize such a wonderful One by faith, we spontaneously enter the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The corruption caused by the enemy has been cleared away, and the wonderful and mysterious faith has come into us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Once we have this faith, we should sit down and feast with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is our feast.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Also, He is our Bridegroom, the most pleasant Person, and He is our new garment and our new wine, the qualification and the energy for enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is even our church life, the new wineskin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We simply need to enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to recall the difference between the cases selected by John and the cases selected by Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In John the cases are related to life; in Matthew the cases illustrate different aspects of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The kingdom life means that the leprosy has been cleansed and that faith has come for the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Bible is very profound.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No human mind could compose such a book.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Its composition is very simple, but the revelation it contains is profound.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord Jesus even revealed the matter of resurrection from the title of God the God of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This simple title of God implies the resurrection of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although the stories recorded in the Bible seem simple, the implications of the revelations contained in them are profound.</S>
