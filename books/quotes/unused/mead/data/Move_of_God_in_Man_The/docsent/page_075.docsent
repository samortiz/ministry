   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This growth comes from God's growing in us.</S>

   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before the three and a half years of the great tribulation, many firstfruits will be raptured to the heavenly Mount Zion, the center of the heavenly Jerusalem Rev 14:1-4 .</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then at the end of the tribulation, the Lord will harvest the majority of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because they did not become mature, the Lord will leave them on earth to become ripe under the suffering of the great tribulation, which will be like the parching sun.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This growing and operating is God's moving and God's work through the generations.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All of this work is God's history.</S>
