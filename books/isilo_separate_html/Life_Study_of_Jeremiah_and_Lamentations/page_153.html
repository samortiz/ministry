Once we see the spiritual sequence in the Bible, we will realize that Jeremiah was written according to this sequence.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRITUAL SEQUENCE IN THE BIBLE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God Being the Source in Every Way</H2><P>The Bible shows us first that God is the source in every way. After He created man, God presented Himself to man as the real and sole object for man to seek after, that is, the tree of life (Gen. 2:9).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fall of Man and a History of Sins</H2><P>Although God placed man in front of the tree of life, wanting him to partake of that tree, man was seduced and attracted to the other tree&#151;the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (2:17; 3:1-6, 11). By eating of the fruit of this tree, man became fallen, and sin entered into him. After that, the history of mankind was nothing but a history of sins, with all the nations sinning continually in every way. Then God selected the children of Abraham to be a chosen people, but eventually they became the same as the nations. This continued until the end of the Old Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Coming of Christ, the Righteous Shoot</H2><P>Jesus Christ came as the righteous Shoot. Wherever He went in His ministry He encountered sin, death, demons, and evil spirits. Just as God presented Himself as the tree of life in Genesis 2, so Christ also presented Himself as life in the Gospel of John. He presented Himself to people as the bread of life (John 6:35, 48), that is, as the tree of life, and He told them that He came that they might have life (10:10). Then He went to the cross to die for man in order to accomplish redemption for man. Through this, God has a standing to forgive man and to justify man. Eventually, this Jesus Christ became man's redemption and man's righteousness for man to receive justification from God (1 Cor. 1:30). Based upon this, Christ as the embodiment of God has entered into us to be our life, even to be our inner law of life.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_152.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_154.html">Next</a> </body></html>
