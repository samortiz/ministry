   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He also poured out the Spirit upon His sons and daughters that they may become the corporate and enlarged Christ 2:1-4, 16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I. SITTING AT THE RIGHT HAND OF JEHOVAH</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Psalm 110:1 is a prophecy concerning the resurrected Christ being seated at the right hand of God in ascension: Jehovah declares to my Lord, / Sit at My right hand / Until I make Your enemies / Your footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This verse is quoted numerous times in the New Testament Matt 22:44; Mark 12:36; Luke 20:42-43; Acts 2:34-35; Heb 1:13 , indicating that the writers of the New Testament testified unanimously that Christ s ascension fulfilled the prophecy in Psalm 110:1.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In His ascension Christ entered into the Father s being and sat down there.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ s ascension and His sitting on the right hand of God also stress the fact that Christ has accomplished everything for God and us, leaving nothing for us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His sitting at the right hand of God signifies that His work has been accomplished and that He is resting there, waiting for only one thing for God to set His enemies as His footstool so that He may have complete rest.</S>

   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The first man, Adam, who was created by God in Genesis 1, failed to accomplish God s purpose for man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Psalm 8 then alludes in the way of prophecy to another man who will replace the first man to fulfill God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hebrews 2 says that this other man, the second man, who is Jesus, has come and has accomplished so much for the fulfilling of God s desire in man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is revealed in Genesis 1:26 and 28 and is alluded to in Psalm 8:4-8.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first man, Adam, failed, but the second man, Christ, succeeded by replacing the first man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hebrews 2:9 says, We see Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Glory is the splendor related to Jesus person; honor is the preciousness related to Jesus worth, value, and dignity, which is related to His position 2 Pet 1:17; cf.</S>

This is similar to what God did with Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Adam lost the authority that God had given him, but according to the prophecy in Psalm 8, Christ recovered what Adam lost.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The same dominion has now been given to Christ as the second man.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He has been crowned with glory and honor and entrusted with the divine dominion, which was lost by the first man, to rule over the entire universe created by God s hands.</S>
