   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As substitute editor, I have not done anything with the "Questions and Answers" column during this period of substitution.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This column is on practical questions related to the work, the workers, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These questions should be answered by experienced and enlightened brothers among the co-workers.</S>

   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I hope that the co-workers and the responsible ones everywhere will list the questions they have after studying Rethinking Our Work, including the difficulties they encountered in the work and in the local churches in practicing the light of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Send these questions to this publication so that Brother Nee or other co-workers can selectively answer them within the possible confines of this publication.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, the questions raised must be ones that have been thoroughly studied, and the difficulties mentioned must not be theoretical in nature.</S>
