   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Look at the apostles in the New Testament, from Peter to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Can we find one lazy bone in them?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They did not have any trace of laziness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They had no thought of wasting their time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All of them labored diligently and sought for every opportunity to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul said, "Proclaim the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort with all long-suffering and teaching" 2 Tim 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The proclamation of the word must be done in season and out of season.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One has to labor diligently, whether in season or out of season.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A worker of the Lord has to work in season and out of season.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that he has to be very diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the apostles were extremely diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Think of the colossal amount of work Paul accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may be eighty years old before we have done one tenth of what he did.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must realize that all servants of the Lord are diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In considering Paul's work, we can see that he was truly diligent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There was no laziness in him whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was either traveling from place to place, preaching the gospel wherever he went, or reasoning intently with individuals and teaching them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even when he was in prison he was still writing his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Epistles which touched the peak of spiritual revelations were all written in his prison cell.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although he was bound within the cell walls, God's word was not bound.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul was truly a diligent man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was like his Master, who was never slothful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the original language of the New Testament, there are three Greek words for slothfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first is argos, the second is nothros, and the third is okneros.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All three words mean slothfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are translated differently in the New Testament 1 Tim 5:13; Rom 12:11; Heb 5:11; 6:12; Matt 12:36; 20:3, 6; 2 Pet 1:8; Phil 3:1; Titus 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether the words are translated as idle, slothful, sluggish, irksome, or dull, they all mean a refusal or reluctance to work or do things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To be slothful means to ignore the work or to reduce the work until it becomes no work.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is a joke about a doorkeeper whose responsibility was to open the door whenever visitors rang the bell.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One day the bell rang, but he did not open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When asked why he did not open it, he answered, "I am hoping the bell will stop ringing!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Visitors were waiting to come in, yet he was hoping the bell would stop ringing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Brothers and sisters, what kind of person is this?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Unfortunately, this is the way many behave in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They hope that things will go away.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even when things do not go away, they hope that they will not become a burden to them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In their mind they are saying, "How I would thank the Lord if these things went away and I did not have to deal with them!"</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is slothfulness!</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What is slothfulness?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is to procrastinate, to drag on for as long as possible, and to take time in doing something.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Perhaps a work can be finished in one day, yet the person drags it out for ten days.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Or it can be finished in a month, yet the person drags it out for three months.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He takes his time to finish the work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is slothfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In some instances the word is translated "idle" Matt 20:3, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>An idle person is one who mills around aimlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is tossed between acting and not acting, and his mind is never set on what should be done.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Philippians 3:1, it is translated "irksome."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul said, "To write the same things to you, for me it is not irksome, but for you it is safe."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As soon as you put something on the shoulders of some brothers and sisters, they are reluctant to take it up.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is irksome to them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They sigh and grumble.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It seems as if they are being asked to take up an impossible task and that a very heavy burden has been placed upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But this is not the way Paul acted.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He was in prison when he wrote his Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It would indeed be a challenge for anyone to write in a situation as dire as his.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet in writing to the Philippians, Paul exhorted them to rejoice.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>"Rejoice in the Lord always" 4:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As far as his circumstances went, he was in grave hardship.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yet he said, "To write the same things to you, for me it is not irksome."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He was not slothful.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He did not consider it irksome; rather, he considered it a joyous thing.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He did not know the meaning of laziness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In him we find a zeal which is prominent among all servants of God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They are not slothful and do not consider it irksome to take challenges upon themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many brothers and sisters have become useless in God's service because they are afraid to take on any responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They are irked by everything.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>They constantly hope for less work.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They would rather choose less responsibility than more responsibility, and they would be happy to settle for no responsibility at all.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>They do not have a diligent character.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we are lazy, we are disqualified not only from God's service, but from man's service as well.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Many brothers and sisters cannot be servants of the Lord because they are lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Some so-called servants of God sit high on a pedestal.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It seems as if no one has control over them; no brother or sister can touch them, and no one can say anything to them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>They regard themselves as servants of God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If their master was changed for a brief moment, they would be shown to be total failures.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>No human master would allow them to be as sloppy as they are.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Our disposition and walk must be so exercised that we would never shrink back from troubles, but would instead prefer service and sacrifice for God's people, both materially and physically.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should prefer to labor and work with our own hands.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If this is not our way, we are not qualified to be called God's servants!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Paul said, "You yourselves know that these hands have ministered to my needs and to those who are with me" Acts 20:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He had two good hands; they were not slothful at all.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They worked during the day and during the night.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Such a person is truly a servant of God.</S>
