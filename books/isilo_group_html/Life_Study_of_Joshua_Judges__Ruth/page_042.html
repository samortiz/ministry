<h2 class="head2">A. Israel Again Doing That Which Was Evil<br />
in the Sight of Jehovah</h2>
<p>Once again the children of Israel did that which was evil in the sight of Jehovah (6:1a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. Jehovah Delivering Israel<br />
into the Hand of Midian for Seven Years</h2>
<p>Jehovah delivered Israel into the hand of Midian for seven years (vv. 1b-6a). The children of Israel made for themselves dens, caves, and strongholds in the mountains (v. 2). Whenever Israel sowed, Midian rose up with Amalek and the children of the east against Israel and came with their cattle and their tents like swarming locusts to destroy the produce of the land (vv. 3-5). Thus, &ldquo;Israel was greatly impoverished because of Midian&rdquo; (v. 6a).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Children of Israel<br />
Crying Out to Jehovah because of Midian</h2>
<p>The children of Israel cried out to Jehovah because of Midian (vv. 6b-7).</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Jehovah Sending a Prophet<br />
to Reprove the Children of Israel</h2>
<p>Jehovah sent a man who was a prophet to reprove the children of Israel (v. 8a).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Reminding Them<br />
of Jehovah&rsquo;s Delivering Them from Egypt<br />
and His Giving to Them the Land of Canaan</h2>
<p>Through this prophet Jehovah reminded the children of Israel of His delivering them from the hand of the Egyptians and out of the hand of all who oppressed them. He also reminded them that He had driven out the Canaanites before them and had given to them the land of Canaan (vv. 8b-9).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Charging Them Not to Fear<br />
the Gods of the Amorites</h2>
<p>Jehovah charged the children of Israel not to fear the gods of the Amorites, but they did not listen to His voice (v. 10).</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. The Angel of Jehovah (Christ)<br />
Calling Gideon</h2>
<p>In verses 11 through 24 we have an account of the Angel of Jehovah (Christ) calling Gideon.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Appearing to Him</h2>
<p>In verses 11 through 13 we are told that the Angel of Jehovah appeared to Gideon. The Angel of Jehovah came and sat under the terebinth that was in Ophrah while Gideon was beating out the wheat in the winepress in order to hide it from the Midianites. In this way the Angel of Jehovah appeared to Gideon and said to him, &ldquo;Jehovah is with you, valiant warrior&rdquo; (v. 12).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Charging Him to Save Israel<br />
from the Hand of Midian</h2>
<p>The Angel of Jehovah charged Gideon to save Israel from the hand of the Midianites (vv. 14-16). He turned to Gideon and said, &ldquo;Go in this strength of yours, and save Israel from the hand of Midian. Have I not sent you?&rdquo; (v. 14). When Gideon asked by what way he could save Israel, the Angel of Jehovah said to him, &ldquo;Surely I will be with you, and you will strike the Midianites as one man&rdquo; (v. 16).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Performing a Sign for Him<br />
by Receiving His Offering</h2>
<p>Gideon asked the Angel of Jehovah to perform a sign for him that it was He who was speaking with him (vv. 17-24). The Angel of Jehovah performed a sign by receiving Gideon&rsquo;s offering. &ldquo;The Angel of Jehovah put forth the end of the staff that was in His hand and touched the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And fire came up from the rock and consumed the flesh and the unleavened cakes. And the Angel of Jehovah went from his sight&rdquo; (v. 21). This sign resulted in Gideon&rsquo;s building up of an altar to Jehovah, calling it Jehovah-shalom, which means &ldquo;Jehovah is peace&rdquo; or &ldquo;Jehovah of peace&rdquo; (v. 24).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Joshua, Judges & Ruth &nbsp; pg 42</div><br></body></html>
