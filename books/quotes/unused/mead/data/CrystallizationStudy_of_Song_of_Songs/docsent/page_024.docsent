   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CALL TO LIVE IN ASCENSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At this juncture her Beloved calls her to live in His ascension, as He had called her to remain in His cross.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2:14 He called her to be with Him in the clefts of the rock and in the covert of the precipice.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now He calls her again to be with Him in His ascension instead of remaining on the mountain of myrrh and on the hill of frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To Look from His Ascension</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Song of Songs 4:8 says, Come with me from Lebanon, my bride; / With me from Lebanon come.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>/ Look from the top of Amana, / From the top of Senir and Hermon, / From the lions dens, / From the leopards mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lebanon signifies ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Christ s ascension there are the positive peaks of reality, victory, and the destruction of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Amana means truth, reality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the truth, the reality, of the consummated Triune God, the all-inclusive Christ with His complete redemption, and the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving, sevenfold intensified Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>These realities are the three of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Senir means soft armor, signifying that the war is over and victory has been gained.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not need to wear the hard armor to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Satan is the defeated foe.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not need to fight, because he has been defeated already Heb 2:14; Col 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are now wearing the soft armor to enjoy our victory in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hermon means destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In ascension the enemy is destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To Look from the Heavenlies,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Signified by the Lions Dens and</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>the Leopards Mountains</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>With Christ Satan is a defeated foe, but with us he is still a troublesome one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, Ephesians 6 tells us that we need to wrestle with the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ calls us to look from the heavenlies v. 12 , signified by the lions dens and the leopards mountains S.S. 4:8b . Here are Satan and his subordinates Eph 6:12; 2:2 . Here the believers fight with Satan and his power of darkness 6:12 by being empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength v. 10 , by putting on the whole armor of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>11a, 13a , by standing against the stratagems of the devil v. 11b , by receiving the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, the word of God v. 17 , and by praying always in spirit v. 18a for the building up of the Body of Christ and the spreading of the gospel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>18b-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the reality of living in the ascension of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>KNOWING CHRIST IN HIS DEATH, RESURRECTION, ASCENSION, AND SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For us to experience Christ, we must see that the death, resurrection, ascension, and Spirit of Christ are one group.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I was a young Christian, I read some books which said that I had to be crucified with Christ, but I did not know how I could crucify myself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One day Brother Nee said that death by crucifixion can never be carried out by ourselves as suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There must be others who do the crucifying.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Romans 8:13 says, If by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to this verse, we put to death the activities of the body, not by ourselves but by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Thus, it is by the Spirit that we crucify ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today, according to the New Testament the Spirit is in our spirit Rom 8:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To know Christ in His death, His resurrection, His ascension, and His bountiful Spirit, we need to see that these four things are one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Death is a condition in which Christ died for us and with us, and resurrection is a condition in which Christ was resurrected by God from the dead to release the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we have Christ in these conditions, we enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is the same with ascension and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We cannot separate Christ from His ascension or from the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If He were separate from the life-giving Spirit, He would no longer be pneumatic.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can live in ascension by living in the pneumatic Christ, the Christ who is the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the Lord s recovery our reading and studying of the Bible are unique.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we come to the Bible, we exercise our spirit to contact the Lord Himself in His Word by both reading and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We pray-read the Bible to receive life, light, and revelation from the Spirit in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is our way of studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we practice this way of studying, every verse will become meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Because of this, what we have learned of the Lord over these many years is altogether new.</S>
