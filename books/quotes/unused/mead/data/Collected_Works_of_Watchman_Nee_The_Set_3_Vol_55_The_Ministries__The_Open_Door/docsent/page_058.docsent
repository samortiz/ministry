   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>1950-1951 ISSUE NO.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>20 June 30, 1950 THE GROUND OF THE CHURCH:</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A TRANSCRIPT OF A TALK</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Question:The brothers and sisters who have been meeting with us for more than ten years all seem to know our ground and how it is different from that of others.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The brothers and sisters saved during the past seven or eight years especially those saved during the most recent six or seven years , however, do not know what our ground is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, I would like to ask what the actual ground of the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Importance of This Question</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Answer: I think this matter is very important, because the Lord has shown us explicitly in the Bible that the church has a definite ground.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I presume we all recognize that the blessing of God, the Holy Spirit of God, the light of God, and even the very life of the Lord Jesus Himself are all in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although we ordinarily stress the Lord's life in individuals, the fact is that His life is in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whether or not a so-called "church" is really the church is very important, because God has committed so many spiritual things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If God had given many spiritual things to us as individuals, the problem would not be so great.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But God has shown us in the Bible that He has placed all spiritual things in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, it is a very serious matter whether or not the group of which we are is a church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we fellowship with many brothers and sisters who are not the church, it will be a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Let us give an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some of the sisters who work in hospital laboratories use glass slides for bacterial examinations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For such a purpose, a glass slide is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if a brother or a sister comes to visit, the same kind of glass slide that you use every day cannot be used to serve him a beverage.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The glass slide has an important use in the laboratory, but it is useless for serving a brother or a sister a cup of water.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The brother is not a grasshopper or a sparrow; he cannot be satisfied with water on a slide.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He must be served with a glass.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many problems can never be solved with just a slide.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>At least you need a glass made up of many slides before you can solve the problem of thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A flat surface can hold much less than a three-dimensional object.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are not seeking to nullify the spiritual attainment of a person before God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>An individual may enjoy many spiritual things and sometimes attain great spiritual heights, but God has committed more spiritual things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, when a person seeks them as an individual, he cannot obtain them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This does not mean that an individual has no blessing, but it does mean that he cannot obtain it by individual seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's riches today are in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church is three-dimensional, just like a drinking glass.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As an individual, one must become a part of this "glass" before he can touch the living water.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only the church can contain many spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must clearly see before God that many spiritual things are in the church, not with individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord's word, "Upon this rock I will build My church," is very clear and wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The result is that "the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it" Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This promise is for the church, not for individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many times it is very difficult for individuals to resist the enemy, but as soon as the church appears, Satan is defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In these years we do see individuals experiencing blessings, but their blessings are limited.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is only in the church that the blessings are limitless and rich.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, as soon as a person departs from the way of the church, his blessing is limited and God's presence with him is limited.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I do not say "nonexistent," but I do say "limited."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Furthermore, he is not able to touch many things before God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Please excuse me for speaking very frankly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Especially during the past ten years, I have been watching to see if people know what the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Strangely enough, many brothers who have known the Lord for twenty or thirty years do not know God's church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What they have already obtained has gradually declined, and what they think they have cannot be preserved intact.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the same time, there are other brothers and sisters who know God's church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The riches of the Head have become their riches, and they are able to go forward continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, I wish that all the young brothers and sisters would note that a Christian must be concerned with not only his own gain but also whether or not the brothers and sisters with whom he fellowships are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Remember that each person is but an individual.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Two may be the church, or they may only be two individuals and not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not presume that five hundred people gathered together are the church, or a thousand people gathered together are the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This may not be true.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thank God, one thousand people can become the church, but one thousand people may just be one thousand individuals; thus they are only individuals and still not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is a great difference here.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God's children today realize that one person cannot be the church, but they may not acknowledge that one thousand people can be one thousand individuals only and thus still not be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even ten thousand people can remain as ten thousand individuals and not be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The church before God has other requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, we as children of God must pay special attention to the ground of the church.</S>
