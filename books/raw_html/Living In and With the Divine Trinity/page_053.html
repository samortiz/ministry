<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Having God Abiding in Us</H2><P>First John 3:24a speaks of God abiding in us. The word, the Spirit, and God are one. Both the word and the Spirit are the reality of the Triune God. The word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is God. These three are one for our enjoyment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Having the Son and the Father Coming to Us<br>and Making an Abode with Us</H2><P>To have Christ abiding in us is to have the Son and the Father coming to us and making an abode with us (John 14:23). When we have the words of Christ, the Spirit of reality, and the very God abiding in us, we surely have the Son and the Father abiding in us. We have both the Son and the Father coming to us and making an abode with us. This abode is a mutual abode. He becomes our abode, and we become His abode.</P><P>The New Jerusalem is a mutual abode. The Triune God in eternity will abide in His chosen people, and His chosen people will abide in Him. His chosen people will be His abode, and He Himself will be their abode. This is why the New Jerusalem, the holy city, is on the one hand, a temple, and on the other hand, a tabernacle. It is a tabernacle for God's dwelling and a temple for our dwelling, in which we live to serve God. The New Jerusalem will be a tabernacle to God and a temple to us.</P><P>The Son and the Father come to us and make an abode with us because of our loving the Son. The Son and the Father's making an abode with us depends upon whether or not we love the Lord Jesus. When we tell the Lord Jesus that we love Him, we will sense His coming to us and making His abode with us. If we neglect our love toward Him, we will lose His manifestation, His appearing. When Peter and the other disciples went fishing, as recorded in John 21, they thought that they were absent from the Lord. They did not know that the Lord was still with them. He was with them, but at the time of their fishing they did not have His manifestation, His appearing. If we say, "Lord Jesus, I love You," we will not only have Him with us but also have Him appearing to us, manifesting Himself to us. His coming to us and making an abode with us is His appearing, His manifestation.</P><P>In John 14:23 the Lord said, "If anyone loves Me...My Father will love him." When we love the Son, the Father will love us. Then the Son will follow His Father to love us (v. 21). The Father and the Son both will love us because we love the Son. This issues in our enjoyment of the Son's manifestation (vv. 21-22). Our enjoyment of the Son's manifestation depends upon our loving Him. This is altogether not a doctrine but an experience. The Divine Trinity is not for doctrine but altogether for our experience. When we love the Son, both the Father and the Son love us, and at the same time, the Son manifests Himself to us. We enjoy His appearing. In other words, we enjoy His presence.</P>
