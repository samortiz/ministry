   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A number of questions may be asked in the group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some will be concerning the truth, and others will be concerning life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this way there will be the mutual teaching of the truth and the experience of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This does not mean that we do not need books to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We still need the help from books such as Truth Lessons and Life Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In our fellowship with the new ones, we can tell them that it is best to have books like these in our homes so that we can study a part of a lesson when we want to learn something concerning the truth or life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then when we are in the group meeting, we can refer to these books when we answer something.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can tell the new ones that they can read more concerning a certain truth at home in their spare time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we take this way, the answers to the questions in the group meeting will become very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This way gives the opportunities to every attendant to use their knowledge and their experience to answer questions.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If a new believer is brought into a group meeting, and he attends over forty-five group meetings a year, he will learn much truth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All of us start the meeting in our homes, and everyone in the meeting is a leader and a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The scriptural basis for the group meetings is in Hebrews 10:24 and 25.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When Paul wrote this, he was talking to the Hebrew brothers and telling them not to forsake their own meeting, their Christian meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is because some of the Jewish brothers had left their Christian meeting and had gone back to their Judaistic gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In our present situation, we need to have a meeting that is our own meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not forsake our own meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must help all the saints to realize that the group meeting is their own meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The group meeting is a meeting of mutuality in which all the saints participate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everyone can start the meeting in his home, everyone can fellowship, everyone can intercede, and everyone can render the mutual care and the shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this way everyone in the group will be exercised to shepherd one another.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is impossible for a few elders to shepherd all the saints in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if the church is divided into group meetings, all the saints will shepherd one another.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The group meetings are so easy and so delightful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no hardship or any heavy burden on anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If someone were charged to be the leader of a group meeting, he would have to prepare a teaching to give, and he would be overburdened.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But in the organic way, no one is overburdened.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everyone is ecstatic.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a question is raised, we can all answer, listen, and learn.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hebrews 10:24 says that we should incite one another to love and good works.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is by this "free way," the organic way, of having group meetings that we can incite one another.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this way there is no limitation, no assignment, and no designation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The meeting is left open to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the riches of the attending members will come out in the group meetings, and these are the riches of the Body of Christ.</S>
