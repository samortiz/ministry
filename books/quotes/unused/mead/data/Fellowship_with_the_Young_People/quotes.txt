[1]  CONTENTS Fleeing Youthful Lusts and Pursuing Christ with Some Companions The Vision of the Lord's Recovery Practical Fellowship
[2]  CHAPTER ONE FLEEING YOUTHFUL LUSTS AND PURSUING CHRIST WITH SOME COMPANIONS Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 2:22; 3:1-5; Dan 1:1-2, 5, 8
[3]  In this book we shall see a number of crucial matters related to the young people in the Lord's recovery.
[4]  In this chapter we shall see their need to flee youthful lusts and pursue Christ together.
[5]  The Lord comes to the young people for His move because the older people are, the more they are likely to be spoiled and preoccupied.
[6]  CHAPTER TWO THE VISION OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: Matt 16:15-18; Eph 5:32; Phil 3:10a; Rev 1:10-13a
[7]  In the previous chapter we saw that the young people need to purpose in their heart not to be defiled by the things of this age.
[8]  They need to flee youthful lusts and pursue Christ with their companions, "those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart" 2 Tim 2:22 .
[9]  Although these terms may be familiar to us, I would still encourage the young people to spend much time with their companions in groups of five to thoroughly research the truths concerning Christ and the church.
[10]  The second item in God's commission was the incarnation.
[11]  In incarnation He brought God into man, that is, into His creation.
[12]  Peter answered the Lord, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" Matt 16:16 .
[13]  The Christ is the Lord's title in His commission, while the Son of the living God is the title of the Lord's person, indicating who He is.
[14]  John 5:18 says, "For this therefore the Jews sought all the more to kill Him, because He not only broke the Sabbath, but also called God His own Father, making Himself equal with God."
[15]  The ancient Jews understood that to be called the Son of God was to be equal to God.
[16]  They considered it blasphemy for Jesus, a man from Nazareth, to say that He was the Son of God, making Himself equal with God.
[17]  Even though Jesus is God, He is still called the Son of God.
[18]  The Spirit of whom we are born is not only God Himself, but also the Son of the living God as life to us, the Word and the Spirit.
[19]  When Peter recognized and acknowledged that the Lord Jesus was the Christ and the Son of the living God, Jesus answered, "And I also say to you that you are Peter, and on this rock I will build My church" Matt 16:18 .
[20]  Creation was for the church, incarnation was for the church, crucifixion was for the church, resurrection was for the church, and ascension was for the church.
[21]  Just as Christ has two aspects, His person and His ministry, the church also has two aspects, the universal aspect and the local aspect.
[22]  In the previous chapters we saw that the young people in the Lord's recovery must flee youthful lusts and pursue Christ with their companions.
[23]  In this chapter we shall fellowship concerning four strategic points regarding the young people: the need to know the life experiences, the practical way to carry out the Lord's recovery, the need to read the Word and the messages, and the matter of giving in God's economy.
[24]  In the previous chapter, we saw that the young people should join together in groups of five for the purpose of researching the things concerning Christ and the church.
[25]  THE PRACTICAL WAY TO CARRY OUT THE LORD'S RECOVERY IN AND BY THE MINGLED SPIRIT
[26]  In the previous chapter, we saw that the Lord's recovery is the recovery of the Christ and the church.
[27]  God is Spirit John 4:24 , Christ our Redeemer has become a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , and the third of the Godhead for God to reach us is the Holy Spirit Matt 28:19 .
[28]  Moreover, there is no other way for us to contact God, to contact Christ, to contact the Spirit, but by our human spirit John 4:24 .
