   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It says, "Not forsaking."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that this verse is not a new sentence.</S>

   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Timothy was to commit these healthy words to faithful men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The word "commit" does not only mean to give something to someone but also implies much training.</S>
