   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>F. Recreation Matching One s Fitness</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sixth, all recreation must match a person s fitness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first consideration in recreation is physical fitness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Everyone must remember this while engaging in recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We expect our body to reap profit, not suffer loss through our recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If our body suffers through our recreation, we are violating the principle of recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are here to improve our body.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a certain kind of recreation damages our body, something is wrong with that recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose a man is sick with tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If he wants to have any recreation at all, his recreation must not bring his health down.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A sister who has a heart disease may need some recreation at times, but her recreation must serve to relieve her fatigue rather than to aggravate her heart disease.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I was young, I had a friend who was a very evil person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After he believed in the Lord, he turned and became a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before his conversion, he loved basketball.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After he was saved, he felt a little guilty about playing it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He decided to play it one more time and then quit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After that last game, he vomited blood and died.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was not recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It did not match his physical fitness at all.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He thought that he could preach the gospel after he had enjoyed his game.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He did not expect that he would die after that game.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What a waste that was!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I hope we will realize that our body is the Lord s. Our diversion is for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our not having a diversion is also for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not do anything for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we engage in some kind of diversion, we must remember that it is for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Also, if we forfeit diversion, we must remember that we are doing it for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whether or not one has diversion, the principle is to not do harm to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is always unwise to harm the body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is not only wrong to harm our body with improper activities, but also wrong to harm our body with proper activities.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The bodies of God s children do not belong to them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In any kind of diversion, we must ask ourselves whether or not it will profit our body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do it only if it is profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do not do it just because you like to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose a sister has a heart disease.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If she sees a brother playing ball in the field and wants to join him, she may end up with more trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not wrong for the brother to be in the ball game, but it is wrong for the sister who has the heart disease to be in the game.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We hope that God s children will pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everything we do should be done for the service of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Even if we have a little diversion today, our goal in having it should be to better serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I do not want to see believers dying at a young age.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have always hoped that there would be more elderly brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please remember that being elderly in the world is different from being elderly in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the world, the older one becomes, the more senile he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The younger ones are the more progressive ones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>However, in the church the older one becomes, the more advanced he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the world the younger ones cannot move forward unless the older ones die first, because the older ones are always a hindrance to the younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, it does not happen this way in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The older one becomes, the fresher he becomes, and the higher and deeper are the things he touches.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A church is poor and defeated if it does not have any elderly brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I do not like to see brothers and sisters in the church passing away at a young age through the neglect of their own body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Instead of becoming a supply to the church, the lessons that the Lord has given them are wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church should not incur such a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It cannot afford such a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we have sports and games, we cannot strive to break records as if we were athletes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Professional athletes are not motivated by the games themselves but by the desire to break records.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must play it as a game and play it to the benefit our body.</S>
