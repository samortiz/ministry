<p>In the last message, we saw the genuine oneness in a simple and concise way. Based on this view of the genuine oneness, we mentioned that to practice the oneness, there must be the one accord. Now, we have to go one step further to consider the Body of Christ. Before we consider this matter, I want to give an additional word concerning the last message.<h2 class=head1>THE FOUNDATION OF THE ONENESS GIVEN BY THE LORD</h2><p>The light which the Lord gave us concerning the oneness of the believers can be considered the most thorough and deep. Our knowledge in the past concerning the oneness was relatively shallow and common, and did not touch the genuine oneness which was prayed for by the Lord and mentioned for the first time in the New Testament. Although our Recovery Version has listed this oneness in a clear way in its outline, it has not emphasized it as much as we did this time. In the Lord’s prayer, He spoke of the oneness of the believers in three levels. Each level of the oneness is deeper than the previous one. The last level is the deepest and highest. All three levels of oneness have everything related to the Father as their foundation. The foundation of the first level of the oneness is the Father’s name and His eternal life. The foundation of the second level is the Father’s word. In the Father’s word, there is the Father’s reality, which is just the Father Himself. The foundation of the third level of the oneness is the Father’s glory, which is the divine expression of the Father.<p>Moreover, the foundations of the three levels of the oneness are all expressed by the Lord in the way of giving. The Lord said, “I have manifested Your name to the men whom You gave Me out of the world” (John 17:6). The Father’s name is the Father Himself. In giving us the Father’s name, the Lord is giving us the Father Himself. At the same time, He has also given us the Father’s life. John 17:2 says, “Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him.” In verse 14 the Lord says again, “I have given them Your word.” Verse 17 says, “Sanctify them in the truth; Your word is truth.” The Lord has given us the Father’s word, which together with God Himself as the reality, the truth, is sanctifying us and delivering us from the mixed-up world to separate us unto God. The Lord has not only given us the Father’s name, the Father’s life, and the Father’s word, but has also given us the Father’s glory. In verse 22 the Lord said, “And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them.” Hence, the Lord has given us four things: the Father’s name, the Father’s life, the Father’s word, and the Father’s glory.<h2 class=head1>ONENESS BEING THE FULL MINGLING OF THE TRIUNE GOD WITH THE SAINTS</h2><p>This shows us clearly that each of the three levels of oneness has a basis. Each level is based upon the Triune God. This is the foundation of the oneness of the saints. In other words, the factor or element of our oneness is just the Triune God. In verse 11 the Lord said, “That they may be one even as We are.” Here “they” refers to the saints, and “We” refers to the Triune God. The divine Trinity makes us one even as the Father and the Son are one. In verse 21 the Lord says further, “That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.” This matter of being in one another mutually is a kind of mingling. The Triune God and we are mingled together. This is the biblical oneness of the believers. The source of this oneness is the Triune God. Its element is the Triune God; its process is the Triune God; and its ultimate consummation is the Triune God.<p>Seemingly, the oneness which the Lord prayed for in John 17 and the oneness of the Spirit which Paul described in Ephesians 4 are not alike. But when we dive into these two passages of the Scripture, we can see that as far as the intrinsic element is concerned, they are the same. What the Lord prayed for in John 17 was for the saints to be mingled with the Triune God. Then in Ephesians 4, Paul said that there is a kind of oneness called the oneness of the Spirit. It is the inheritance and the possession of the saints. We do not need to strive for it. All we need to do is to keep this oneness. Following this Paul pointed out seven items as the basis of this oneness. Among them there is the one God and Father of all, the one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body. The Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the factors of this oneness. They also become the elements of this oneness, mingling with the saints to produce a fourth factor, which is the one Body. To put it simply, oneness is the result of the Triune God being mingled with His redeemed, regenerated, and transformed people. This oneness is the Body, which is the universal new man.<p>Hence, the oneness revealed in the New Testament is not a oneness where we come together, give up our prejudices, and convince each other to agree to be together. This is a oneness produced by the world. The oneness we are talking about is the full mingling of the Triune God with us. If we do not see this matter to such an extent, I am afraid that the oneness we are talking about is only human-manufactured oneness; it is not the oneness of the Body. The Body of Christ is not an organization, but an organism in which the Triune God is everything. The Triune God has accomplished redemption and has been consummated to be the Spirit, entering into us believers, quickening our spirit, and making our spirit life. Then He spreads outward from our spirit to the mind in our soul, renewing and transforming our mind and resulting in our mind becoming life. Furthermore, when we walk by the Spirit and always put to death the practices of the body, the indwelling Spirit will transfuse the life of God into our body and will give life to our mortal body. In this way, our whole being—spirit, soul, and body—will be fully mingled with the Triune God.
