   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CENTER OF THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING GOD S THRONE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Revelation 22 shows the throne of God as the center of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Out of this throne proceeds the river of water of life with the function of watering, refreshing, and thirst quenching.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The river of water of life flowing out of the throne signifies the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This means that where God s throne is, there is the flow of life; where God s authority is, there is the flow of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When the river of water of life flows, it issues in the watering, refreshing, and thirst quenching of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On this side and on that side of the river was the tree of life, producing twelve fruits, yielding its fruit each month v. 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From this we can see that every local church should be a place where people are fed, nourished, watered, and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, this is not the situation in many local churches, because of the absence of God s throne in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When God s throne is established in a church, life flows.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As soon as life flows, there is watering, refreshing, and thirst quenching.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When people touch such a church, they touch living water and life, and they are spontaneously satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The tree of life grows on both sides of the river of water of life, producing twelve fruits each year as its fullness and abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The fullness and abundance in a church depend on God s throne and His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only when God is enthroned and rules in a local church can the fullness of God be brought in; enthusiasm and diligence cannot bring in the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God s authority brings in life, and life brings in the fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If God s throne is absent, the river of water of life will be absent as well.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Without the river of water of life, the tree of life is absent, and the abundance of life is also absent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When a local church is full of the fruits of life, producing new fruit every month, the abundance of life will be fully manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The abundance of life flows out from the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, there is only one river and one street in the entire New Jerusalem; both river and street are singular.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This unique street, this unique way, runs through the twelve gates, spiraling upward to reach the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a symbol of the oneness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If there are twelve elders in a local church who do not have the throne of God in their elders meeting, they will have twelve thrones, twelve opinions, and twelve ways.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This will be very difficult for the church and will create confusion among the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although there are twelve gates in the New Jerusalem, there is only one street because there is only one throne.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The street not only reaches the throne, but it actually comes out from the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Based on this principle, there should be only one throne in a church.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the elders should submit to God s throne and move as one man, one elder.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There should not be any personal ideas, opinions, or views, and no one should care for his own idea.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, there should be only one way and one authority, God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such elders do not need to exercise tolerance or to swallow their pride and try to accommodate others, because they are under God s throne and authority, allowing the Holy Spirit to rule among them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These elders can say that all of their decisions are made under the authority of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, everyone in that locality will have a clear way; no one will ever be lost and feel uncertain as to what he should do.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no need to lead others on this street because the street is the leading.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As long as we are on this street, we are under God s throne.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The street and the river of water of life are blended as one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the middle of the street is the river of water of life, and the tree of life is on both sides of the river vv.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here we have the way to walk, the river of water of life to drink, and the fruit of the tree of life to eat; these three are very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This should be the normal condition of a church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>People who do not have a way to walk find the way and the leading when they come into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>People find living water on this street, richly enjoy the fruit of the tree of life, are refreshed and satisfied, and their thirst is quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, all of man s supply and living depend on God s throne.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this reason, we should ask ourselves, Is God s throne among us and among the responsible brothers?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Are we under God s authority?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Is there a street with a river of life and a tree of life among God s people?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A local church that does not have this condition is not in the principle of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There is a throne in the New Jerusalem, and a street proceeds out of this throne; in the middle of the street is a river, and the tree of life grows on both sides of the river, producing twelve fruits.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a beautiful picture.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, the key to the church life depends entirely on God s throne, God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although there are many brothers and sisters serving among us, there is only one throne.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not that you submit to my authority, or that I submit to your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not that I obey you or that you obey me; rather, the throne, the authority of God, is among us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If there is no throne among the brothers and sisters, it is the same as not having a center.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Without a center, everything loses its support and balance, and everything disintegrates and collapses.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The expression of the holy city depends on the throne, the street, the river, and the growth of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The condition of the New Jerusalem depends on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If the throne is lost, the entire New Jerusalem will be obliterated.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The manifestation of the New Jerusalem has God s throne within and God s glory without.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This means that God s authority and God s image are being expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Revelation 4 we see God s throne and God s image; the One sitting on the throne is like a jasper stone in appearance v. 3 . Only when there is the throne can there be the image, and only then can God exercise His authority and be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All blessings are with the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Since the throne is in the New Jerusalem, there will be no more night, only brightness; there will be no more death, only life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The saints will reign in the city forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We should all realize that the normal condition of a church depends on God s authority.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It does not depend on our methods or ideas nor on our enthusiasm or diligence; rather, it depends entirely on God s throne, His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>May we have God s throne with God s authority among us.</S>
