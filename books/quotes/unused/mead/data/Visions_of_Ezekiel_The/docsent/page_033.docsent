   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING A RAINBOW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As a result of having a clear sky with the throne and of experiencing a man who looks like electrum and like a consuming fire, we will have the appearance of a rainbow 1:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A rainbow is the brightness around the man who is sitting on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This brightness signifies the splendor and glory around the Lord on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In order to understand the significance of the rainbow, we need to remember the rainbow at the time of Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During Noah's time a flood destroyed the whole earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Only eight people were spared from that judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After the flood, all the human beings were afraid of being destroyed by another flood.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>So God made a covenant with them and said that whenever there were clouds in the heavens there would also be a rainbow with them, signifying that there would be no more flood to destroy the earth Gen 9:11-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The rainbow was a sign of God's faithfulness and promise not to destroy the fallen human race.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In His judgment and destruction of the fallen race, God spared some by His faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do you realize that we all have been spared by God?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are all fallen and deserve to be destroyed, but God spared us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are spared by His faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have a rainbow as the sign of His faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although God is a holy God and a consuming God and none can exist in His presence, by His faithfulness we are spared.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In a rainbow, there are six or seven different colors, but the basic colors are only three: red, yellow, and blue.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When these three colors are shining and blending they produce other colors.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By being mixed together, they give orange, green, and violet.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is very significant that the three main colors are red, yellow, and blue because they correspond to what we have already seen in Ezekiel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have seen that the throne looks like a blue sapphire stone, the electrum is yellow, and the fire is red.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>By their refracting and shining, these three colors combine to make a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is the meaning of these three colors?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Blue signifies the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to Psalm 89:14, righteousness is the foundation of God's throne.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, the blue throne signifies the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Red signifies the sanctifying, separating, and consuming fire and refers to God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Yellow signifies God's glory in the glowing electrum.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thus we have three things: holiness, glory, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These are the three things that keep sinners away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord Jesus came, died on the cross, was resurrected, and is now our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is also now our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In ourselves we are short of God's glory; we are under God's righteous judgment; and we are kept away by God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But, today we are in Christ, and He becomes our righteousness, our holiness, and our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today, we even bear these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We bear Christ as our righteousness, our holiness, and our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do you realize that in God's eyes we look like righteousness, holiness, and glory?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is because we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This must not be simply a kind of teaching and doctrine to us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must experience the Lord in such a way that when others contact us, they can sense the righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They should be able to sense that we have a clear sky, that we have a throne, and that we are righteous and proper we are no longer sloppy and loose.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should also have the electrum with us, glowing, shining, and weighty.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We all must bear the righteousness, the holiness, and the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we will have the appearance of a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the demons, the angels, and Satan will have to come and see this rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The rainbow is the sign of God's faithfulness in sparing His fallen ones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the fallen ones have become a testimony of this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus every local church should bear the testimony of such a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even the New Jerusalem has the appearance of a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The foundation stones of the New Jerusalem are of twelve layers, each layer being a different color Rev 21:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I read an article which stated that the twelve layers of the foundation stones had the appearance of a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>So even the holy city, New Jerusalem, looks like a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We will be that holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We are God's spared ones.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>By His holiness, His righteousness, and His glory, we will have the appearance of a rainbow declaring to the whole universe God's saving faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The experience of the Christian life and the experience of the church life will consummate in such a rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>At the end of the whole Bible is a city whose foundation has the appearance of a rainbow and surrounds the eternal God as His strong testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Again I say, this must not be merely a teaching to us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This has to be wrought into us so that, as God's spared ones, we will be in the appearance of a rainbow, bearing God's testimony and declaring God's faithfulness to the whole universe.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We will bear God's righteousness, God's holiness, and God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Ezekiel said that this was the appearance of the glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When he saw this, he bowed down to the earth and heard a voice speaking to him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we want to hear the word of the Lord in the following chapters of Ezekiel, we all must be at this point under a clear sky in front of the throne with a Man sitting on it and bearing the flashing, reflecting, and shining rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the place where we can hear the voice from above.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This positions us to hear the voice speaking from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I hope that every one of us as individuals will be at this point, and I hope that all of the local churches will also be here.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then the Lord will have a way to speak to us.</S>
