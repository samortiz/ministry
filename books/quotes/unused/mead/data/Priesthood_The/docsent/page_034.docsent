   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TESTIMONY OF THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But this is still not all.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is also the ark in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The ark originally contained only one thing: the law which was the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Most Christians have a poor concept of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They consider the law as ten items we must obey or else we will be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But this is wrong, for the law is the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that the law is the very definition and explanation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The law gives us a picture of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Without the law, no one can know what kind of God we have.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is by the law that we have a complete picture of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The law shows us that God is a God of holiness, a God of righteousness, a God of love, and a God of light.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Ten Commandments reveal to us that God is such a God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The law is the picture that portrays such a holy and righteous God of love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No one has ever seen God, but the law describes and defines Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, the law is the testimony of God, and as the testimony and definition of God, it is put into the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means all that God is was put in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Suppose I take a photograph of you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a kind of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If someone asks me about your appearance, I will show them your picture.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The picture is your testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must realize that the law is God s testimony, which means that it is God s definition, God s explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>So when the law is put into the ark, it signifies that all that God is, is now in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The ark is Christ because it was made of two things: wood overlaid with gold .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Wood signifies the human nature of Christ, and gold signifies His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is a man, and He is also the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is the God-man as the ark made of gold and wood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this golden, living One there is the testimony of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is typified by the law as the testimony being placed into the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, in the ark is the fullness of God, and in the tabernacle is the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The ark is the content of the tabernacle, and the fullness of God is the content of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that God is the content of Christ, and Christ is the content of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is the content of the local church where you are?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Is it Christ, or something else?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The content of the church life must be Christ, not anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>And the content of Christ is the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE CHERUBIM OF GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Within the ark is the law which is the description of God, and upon the ark are the two cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These two cherubim are called the cherubim of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we read the Bible carefully, we will see that glory is God expressed, God manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When God is manifested, it is glory.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is like the light of electricity that is expressed when it shines out.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without the shining, electricity is just electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But by shining, electricity becomes the light, and the light is the glory, that is, the expression and the manifestation of the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, glory is God manifested and God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Within the ark is all that God is, and upon the ark God is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Within, God is contained; without, God is expressed as the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Have you ever looked at Jesus as He is portrayed in the four Gospels?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is the real ark.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Within Him is the content of God and all that God is, and upon Him God is expressed and manifested as the glory.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Within Jesus is all that God is, and upon Jesus is the manifested God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, within Him there is the law, and upon Him there are the two cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This does not mean two kinds of glory, but a testimony of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Two is the number meaning testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The two cherubim testify to the expression of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Romans 3:23 says that all have sinned and come short of the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We are sinful, so we are short of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The glory of God is so high.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may have some goodness, but compared with God s glory our goodness is short.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There may be nothing sinful in our goodness, and we may feel that we are right.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even if this is true, we are still short of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We may say that we have never hated others, but we are short.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may say that we love others, but we do not love others as much as God does.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Our love is short of God s love.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In China there were many disciples of Confucius who claimed to be the best beings on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, when some of them read the four Gospels their eyes were opened to see who Jesus is.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Then they prostrated themselves on the floor and confessed, Lord, I am so short; I am good, but my goodness is so short of Yours.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The living of Jesus manifested God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The daily walk of Jesus was the very expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is the glory God manifested and God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All human beings are short of this glory.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We are good, but can we compare with Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We love others, but can we compare our love with that of Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When we do, we see how short we are.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>And this shortage is sin, because man was made in the image of God for the purpose of expressing God.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Man was made for God s glory; that is, man was made to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To be short of God s glory and manifestation means that we are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I am afraid that, if before reading this chapter someone were to ask us if we were sinful, we would say that we were not so sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We are not hateful, and we are not wrong in so many things.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But if we have light to see how short of God s glory we are, we will see how sinful we are.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When we see the daily living of Jesus as recorded in the four Gospels, we see what glory is, and how short of it we fall.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Jesus is the ark and upon Him are the cherubim whose glory condemns us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This glory testifies of all that God is, but it condemns us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Even if we are good and loving, we are still condemned because our love is short of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The glory must be expressed in the church all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The church must be God manifested and God expressed this is the measurement.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The standard of morality is not the measurement of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The measurement of the church life is God manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Yes, we may love, but we love by ourselves, in ourselves, with ourselves, and for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Everything is for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This kind of love is short of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>God can never be manifested in this kind of love.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Maybe we are so humble, but we are humble by ourselves, in ourselves, and for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This kind of humility can never express God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The church life needs a divine love that expresses God, not a human love.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It must be the kind of love that has God in it.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>The church must have the two cherubim as the manifestation of God s glory, and this glory is continually watching and finding the shortages.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Most of us do not have much conviction that we are sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>But suppose the Lord were to come to us and manifest His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>All of us would fall to the floor and ask for something to cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We would have the sense that we are so short of His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Compared with others, we may be better.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>They are humble, but we are more humble.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>If they love, we can love more.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>But we cannot compare with God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When God s glory is present, there is no comparison.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Our shortage will come to the surface, and we will sense how sinful we are.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We are sinful, not because we are evil or dirty, but because we are short of God s glory.</S>
