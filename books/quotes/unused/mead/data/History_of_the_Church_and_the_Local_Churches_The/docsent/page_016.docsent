   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECOVERY OF THE INITIAL STAGE OF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHURCH LIFE IN THE UNITY OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>WITH ZINZENDORF AND THE MORAVIAN BRETHREN</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>History shows us that there was a desire within many seeking ones for the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They could not express this inward desire, but actually there was something in them seeking or hunting the proper church life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the eighteenth century, the Lord moved among the Moravian brethren under the leadership of Count Zinzendorf to recover something of the practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These Moravian brethren suffered the persecution not only of the Roman Catholic Church but also of the state churches.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They were persecuted because they stood for the truth, and they fled to Zinzendorf's estate in Saxony for refuge.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of Count Zinzendorf's love for the Lord, he received many of these seekers who came from different backgrounds.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These brothers began to disagree over their doctrinal differences.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One day Zinzendorf called a conference, and he convinced them to drop their doctrinal disagreements.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They signed an agreement to keep the unity among them and to lay aside their differences in doctrine and in their religious backgrounds.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Afterwards, while they were having the Lord's table, they experienced the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Among them there was the strongest revival in church history up to that time, and they became one of the most prevailing Christian groups on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Even John Wesley was saved through them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He stayed with these brethren for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He said that if it were not for his burden for England, he would have stayed with the Moravian brethren for his entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To our knowledge, since the time of the early apostles, the Moravian brothers might be considered as the first group of Christians to realize the church life in a somewhat proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, God's blessing was poured out upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although they enjoyed the practice of the church life to a certain degree, they were still not clear about many aspects of the truth concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE RECOVERED CHURCH LIFE WITH THE BRETHREN</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the nineteenth century, from 1825 to 1828, the Lord raised up the so-called Brethren under the leadership of John Nelson Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>D.M. Panton said that the movement of the Brethren and its significance was far greater than the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Reformation was somewhat worldly because of its association with human government, but the move among the Brethren was really something spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They did not like to have any advertisements in their work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is even difficult for one to find a picture of J.N. Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many of the Brethren felt that taking pictures was a worldly practice.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Regretfully, the golden time of the Brethren lasted for only a short period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eventually, there was a split among them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The first division was between J.N. Darby and Benjamin Newton.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their dispute was concerning the rapture of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Darby was strong concerning pre-tribulation rapture, whereas Newton was strong concerning post-tribulation rapture.</S>
