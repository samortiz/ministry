<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BECOMING OUR REDEMPTION</h2><p>Christ is not only our Redeemer; He has become our redemption. Not only has He become our sanctification in our inward constitution, He has become our redemption in our outward body. If the Lord Jesus was only our Redeemer, He and we would still be separate. Thank the Lord that He is not only our Redeemer; He has become our redemption. Hence, our redemption is not just a thing, but a person who is joined to us. First Corinthians tells us that the Lord will appear one day. At that time all those who believe in Him will receive God's redemption; that is, the dead will be raised and those who are living will be changed (15:52). On the day of redemption we will be manifested as the sons of God and will reign with Him. None of this is the result of any doing of our own. Just as we were not saved by works, we also should not live according to our works. Our assurance, whether it is related to our salvation, walk, or rapture, is based on Christ.</p><p>When two Christians died once, I said to some, "When a Christian dies, he is not buried; he is sown." First Corinthians 15:42-44 does not speak of "burying," but of "sowing." We know that there is a difference between sowing something and burying something. Anything that is sown will eventually grow up. But anything that is buried is buried; it will not grow. As Christians we do not have cemeteries; we only have gardens. What we sow will one day grow up. Christ is within us, and He is also in our body. This Christ is not bound by death. Death cannot hold Him. On that day, neither death, nor the grave, nor Hades, nor Satan will stop us from rising, because the resurrected Christ has become our redemption.</p><p>The end of an unbeliever is burial. His death is an entrance into an eternal grave. Although there will be the second resurrection, this resurrection is different from those participating in the first resurrection. Unbelievers will be judged at the second resurrection; they will enter the second death, which is the greater death (Rev. 20:14-15).</p><p>A child once asked me, "Does it take much effort for Christians to be raptured?" To the child the rapture requires a great deal of effort. If we see that Christ is our redemption, this kind of question will not arise. A Christian is raptured because he has Christ within him. Going to the throne is an effortless matter. May the Lord open our eyes to see that there are not many things or objects in Christianity. Everything is Christ. This is not a theory, but a reality. Christianity is not a religion of works. It is not a matter of works, but a matter of life. The first step in our salvation is regeneration: "You must be born anew" (John 3:7). The last step is the redemption of the body. From beginning to end, everything is based on "Christ our life" (Col. 3:4). Christ is not here to be outward things to us. He has come into us to become our life.</p><p>Many people say that love is a thing, that gentleness is a disposition, and that humility is an attitude. But we must see that all these things do not depend on what we do, but on our knowledge of Christ. What we know concerning Christ is what truly matters. The Bible tells us that Christ is the "I AM" (John 8:24-28). His name is the "I AM." These verses do not tell us what He is. This means that He is whatever we need. In one circumstance He is love. In another circumstance He is humility. This love and humility are not merely love and humility per se, they are a living person. Christ becomes our love. Christ becomes our humility. Some of us have already realized this. I hope that all the brothers and sisters can have such a realization.</p><p>Prayer: Lord, besides You, we have no greater reward. You are the great things, and You are the small things. By Your mercy and blessing, may these incomplete and imperfect words remove our veils and shine within us so that we can truly know You as the "I AM." In Your name we pray, amen.</p>
