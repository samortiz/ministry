   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Flesh of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thank God that through the redemption of Christ, our sins have been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, settling the problem of sin was only the first step in God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we see what God accomplished in eternity, we will realize that the removal of sin is only a remedial action; there is still a long way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After we are redeemed by the blood, we must still eat the flesh of the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We must cross the Red Sea, leave Egypt, pass the wilderness, and enter the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In typology, this means that we should leave the world behind, pass through this world, and enter the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to the picture of the Passover, there are two steps to God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First, there is the salvation of the blood this is objective and outward.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Second, there is the salvation of the flesh this is subjective and inward.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Three to six hours after we eat some food, it becomes a part of us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This means that after we eat the flesh of Christ, God lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The flesh of Christ typifies the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must not only receive the redemption of the blood of Christ for our forgiveness, but must eat the flesh of Christ in order to have His life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There are two clear lines in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The first is the line of the blood, and the second is the line of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The blood typifies the redemptive aspect of Christ's death, whereas the flesh typifies the non-redemptive aspect of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>A great problem among Christians today is that they do not have the strength to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Do you have the strength to overcome sin?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do you have the strength to live a perfect Christian life?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am afraid that most people will say no. Every Christian has one or two sins that they frequently commit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some sins have been with a person for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These sins are the private sins that he commits.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, some Christians are stubborn in their attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Others are unrighteous, unclean, proud, or impure in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some people are fastidious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These people have indeed been washed in the blood, but they have not eaten the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The gospel of the blood enables a person to stand before God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The gospel of the flesh enables a person to live in the world in the same way that the Son of God lived on earth in His days.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This living means much more than the forgiveness of the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE FUNCTION OF CHRIST'S FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us now consider the function of the Lord's flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In John 6:51 through 58, the Lord did not emphasize His blood, but instead, His flesh, because His flesh accomplished what the tree of life did not accomplish.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord said that His flesh was given for the life of the world v. 51 . The blood is only the means; it is not God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>An important word is "world."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead of "sinners," the verse uses "world."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When the Jews heard this, they could not understand and said, "This word is hard; who can hear it?" v. 60 . Some who are sitting here tonight have surely asked this same question.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was asked two thousand years ago already.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you are asking the same question today, you can find the answer in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord came down from heaven to be the bread of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In verse 53, "flesh" is mentioned first and the "blood" second.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This shows that God's emphasis is not the blood but the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The blood is not given the first place.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this passage, "flesh" is mentioned six times, while "blood" is mentioned four times.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whenever the "blood" is mentioned, it is mentioned after the "flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From this we see that the blood is secondary rather than primary.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What gives life is the flesh, not the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In verse 54, the Lord said, "He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood has eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When I was in Chuenchow, I met a preacher who did not believe in eating blood and who taught that man should not eat blood.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I told him, "You should not only preach the Lord's blood, you should preach the Lord's flesh as well."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is impossible to take His blood while rejecting His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Verses 57 and 58 require some explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Eating the Lord is eating His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The flesh is for eating while the blood is for drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His flesh is true food.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This means that the Lord Jesus has taken on a form that can be received and eaten by us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In verse 58 we see another eating.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We can only reach God's goal and become His children by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Eating the flesh of Christ is receiving His life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What we have received in Christ far exceeds what we have received in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Adam fell and became a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Today we have not only been recovered to our first position no longer being sinners , but we have become the sons of God through eating Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In this way, we can accomplish God's goal, which Adam had failed to achieve.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>At the Lord's table meeting, we see the cup and the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>God's intention is with the bread and not the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The cup is only remedial.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God does not say that we should come together to drink the cup, but that we should come together to break the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God's purpose is not for Christ to be crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>His purpose is for His Son to dispense His flesh to men.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>His Son's crucifixion on the cross is merely a remedial act.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Our breaking of bread not only reminds us that man has sinned, but that man lacks life.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Hebrews 2:14-15 says that everyone in the world is a slave of sin through the fear of death, but that the Son of God destroyed the devil, who has the might of death, through His own death.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>"Since therefore the children have shared in blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner partook of the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil" v. 14 . First there is the flesh, and then there is the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The flesh is the goal, while the blood is the means.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>For ten years after I was saved, I did not understand the meaning of the bread.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I thought that the blood should come first.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Every time I came to the bread- breaking meeting, I praised Him for the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But when I saw the flesh, I could not see the significance of it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Later I realized that the flesh was the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is why the flesh is mentioned first in the book of Genesis; the blood is not spoken of until Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The flesh signifies the life released through death, whereas the blood signifies the redemptive death.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The blood removes the barriers between us and God, whereas the flesh provides us God's life and enables us to become His sons, thus fulfilling God's purpose in creating man.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When the Lord instituted His supper, He took the bread and said: "Take, eat; this is My body" Matt 26:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord told us that this is His body; this is not His corpse.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>A corpse means that life is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Lord gives to man the flesh of His body.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This means that the Lord is dispensing to us His very organic life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We can see that God's purpose has always been for man to receive His Son's life so that they can become His many sons.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We must realize that God's ultimate goal is for us to receive His life.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Because of Adam's fall, God had to do two things: first, remove sins, and second, dispense His life to man.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In other words, He had to first shed His blood before He could dispense His flesh to man.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>During the first few meetings of this conference, we will consider the objective truths.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>In the final meetings, we will consider our subjective experience.</S>
