[1]  CONTENTS The Vision of Christ in Colossians The Subjective Experience of Christ in Galatians The Secret of Experiencing Christ in Philippians The Issue of the Experience of Christ in Ephesians
[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE VISION OF CHRIST IN COLOSSIANS Scripture Reading: Col 1:9, 12-20, 25-29; 2:2-3, 6-19; 3:1-4, 10-11, 15-16
[3]  In this message we will see the vision of Christ in the book of Colossians.
[4]  Verse 27 says, "To whom God willed to make known what are the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles, which is Christ in you, the hope of glory."
[5]  This mystery is Christ, not Christ alone, but Christ in you, the hope of glory.
[6]  THE VISION OF CHRIST IN GALATIANS, EPHESIANS, PHILIPPIANS, AND COLOSSIANS
[7]  For a long time I have felt that we must come together to see the vision of Christ in four short books: Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians.
[8]  Then we need to help people to love this Christ, know this Christ, experience this Christ, and be built up as the church to express this Christ.
[9]  Four Short Books Providing Us with the Full Vision of Christ
[10]  Second, they tell us how this Christ must be very subjective to us, that is, how Christ has to be worked into us to be the inward, indwelling Christ.
[11]  God's will is to work Christ into us, in His economy God intends to dispense Christ to us, Christ is the mystery of God, and Christ is the portion God gives us.
[12]  Whatever we do in Christ, with Christ, and for Christ is the will of God, because God's will is simply Christ and nothing else.
[13]  Colossians first tells us that Christ our portion is the image, the expression, of the invisible God 1:15a .
[14]  Redemption is in Christ, and Christ accomplished redemption v. 14 . In this redemption He dealt with our sins and the world, He abolished the ordinances, and He dusted off the evil forces 2:14-15 . The whole universe is full of "dirt." When Christ put on the flesh, He took all this dirt upon Himself.
[15]  WHAT CHRIST IS AS THE BODY OF ALL SHADOWS
[16]  Whenever we meet Christ, touch Christ, and experience Christ, we have the sense that we have a new start.
[17]  CHAPTER TWO THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST IN GALATIANS Scripture Reading: Gal 1:13-16; 2:19-20; 3:1-3, 14, 24-28; 4:6, 19; 5:1-2, 4, 16-17, 22-25; 6:1, 8, 14-18
[18]  In the previous message, we saw Christ in a full way in Colossians.
[19]  It shows Christ in His relationship with God, creation, redemption, and the church as the new creation, and it reveals that He is the reality of all the positive physical, material things, which are only shadows of Christ.
[20]  Christ has been put into us, and we have also been put into Christ.
[21]  In Colossians, as in other books, there is the little word in. Verse 27 of chapter one says, "Christ in you, the hope of glory." In 2:10 we also have the phrase in Him: "You have been made full in Him." This shows that not only is Christ in us, but we are also in Him, as verse 7 says, "Having been rooted and being built up in Him." He is in us, and we are in Him.
[22]  From Colossians we must remember eight points: seven related to Christ and one related to our experience of Christ, that is, that Christ is in us and we are in Him.
[23]  We need food, clothing, housing, and many material things in order to live, so that we may exist for the purpose of Christ being wrought into us to make us the very expression, the vessel, to contain Him.
[24]  It is pitiful that the material things have been utilized by the enemy to distract the Gentiles from Christ, the religious things have been utilized to distract the Jews from Christ, and even the spiritual things have been utilized to distract Christians from Christ.
[25]  CHRIST LIVING IN US AND WE BEING IN HIM
[26]  The purpose of the book of Galatians is to reveal that we need to experience Christ in the presence of God.
[27]  The main items in Galatians are that Christ is revealed in us, Christ lives in us, we put on Christ, and Christ is formed in us.
[28]  In principle, this means that we know Christ and live by Him in our spirit.
[29]  THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST BEING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT IN OUR SPIRIT
[30]  Then we will enjoy Christ, and all the more we will love Him, pray to Him, turn to Him, fellowship with Him, and know not doctrine but Christ Himself.
[31]  CHAPTER THREE THE SECRET OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST IN PHILIPPIANS Scripture Reading: Phil 1:19-21a; 2:5, 13; 3:3, 7-14; 4:12-13
[32]  Philippians 1:19 through 21a says, "For I know that for me this will turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, according to my earnest expectation and hope that in nothing I will be put to shame, but with all boldness, as always, even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death.
[33]  But moreover I also count all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them as refuse that I may gain Christ and be found in Him, not having my own righteousness which is out of the law, but that which is through faith in Christ, the righteousness which is out of God and based on faith, to know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death, if perhaps I may attain to the out-resurrection from the dead.
[34]  In Philippians 2 the apostle sets up Christ as our pattern, our example.
[35]  God ordained the Jewish religion for the purpose of keeping people for Christ and bringing people to Christ, but the enemy of God utilized this God-ordained religion to distract the religious people from Christ.
[36]  TO KNOW CHRIST AND THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION
[37]  Yes, on the one hand, we all have known Christ, but on the other hand, we still do not know Him in an adequate way.
[38]  We all know that the Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of God, but the apostle Paul spoke here not of the Spirit of God but of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[39]  Christ today is so real to us as the Spirit.
[40]  If Christ were not such a current to us, how could we experience Him as our life?
[41]  CHAPTER FOUR THE ISSUE OF THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST IN EPHESIANS Scripture Reading: Eph 1:10, 13, 17-23; 2:5-6, 10, 15-16, 18, 20-22; 3:4-6, 8-11, 14-21; 4:3-6, 11-16, 22-24; 5:18, 25-27, 30, 32; 6:10-19
[42]  Verse 10 of chapter one says, "Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him."
[43]  Verses 18 to 23 continue, "The eyes of your heart having been enlightened, that you may know what is the hope of His calling, and what are the riches of the glory of His inheritance in the saints, and what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all."
[44]  In chapter two, verses 5 and 6 say, "Even when we were dead in offenses, made us alive together with Christ by grace you have been saved and raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus."
[45]  Verse 8 says, "To me, less than the least of all saints, was this grace given to announce to the Gentiles the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel."
[46]  Paul did not preach doctrine, prophecy, or gifts; he preached the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[47]  Verses 9 through 11 continue, "And to enlighten all that they may see what the economy of the mystery is, which throughout the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things, in order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies the multifarious wisdom of God might be made known through the church, according to the eternal purpose which He made in Christ Jesus our Lord."
[48]  We have seen in Colossians that Christ is everything, but we do not see much of the work of Christ in that book.
[49]  The biggest point in Ephesians is the experience of Christ.
[50]  Five of the items are: being strengthened into the inner man 3:16 , being renewed in the spirit of the mind 4:23 , growth v. 16 , building by the growth 2:20-22 , and fighting the battle 6:12 . These five items strengthening, renewing, growing, building, and fighting are the different aspects of the experience of Christ, but before we experience these, we must realize two additional items.
[51]  All the experiences of Christ are based on the fact that we are in Christ, that is, incorporated with Christ and one with Christ.
[52]  We are "buying" and "selling" Christ, "dealing" with Christ, "making concessions" with Christ, and "trading" with Christ.
[53]  The result of being strengthened is that Christ makes His home in us.
[54]  By the growth we will be built up to produce a building v. 16b . We all have to be built up, not with ourselves as the material but with Christ as the material.
[55]  The more we grow, the more we have Christ, the material for our building up.
[56]  In addition, the faith that shields us is also Christ, the Author and Perfecter of faith v. 16 . If we have Christ, we have the living faith; if we do not have Christ, we do not have faith.
