   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO USE LIFE LESSONS AND TRUTH LESSONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to learn to use Life Lessons, but not in a rigid way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are twelve lessons in each volume.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is not necessary for us to read one lesson every time we meet.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may cover one lesson in two sessions, or we may cover two lessons at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our way does not need to be rigid.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is sufficient simply to see the main points; we do not need to bring up other points until later.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After using Life Lessons, we also should learn to use Truth Lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Truth Lessons is written in a coherent and systematic way and can be considered as the essence of the basic teaching for a new believer.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It has not only outlines and main points but also the content to explain the outlines and main points in a concise and clear way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, it is very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>LEARNING TO ANSWER QUESTIONS</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>WHEN USING TRUTH LESSONS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we go to the home meetings, we will always encounter the practical problems of the new ones, which we cannot ignore.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order to take care of their problems, we may not be able to use Truth Lessons step by step, lesson by lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sometimes we may have to put it aside for the time being and concentrate on dealing with the problems.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, we must take care that when we answer the questions of new believers, regardless of what they ask, giving simpler answers is always better.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do not expect them to understand everything.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Everyone who has children knows that no matter what kind of questions children ask, the questions are endless.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even three days and nights are not enough to answer all their questions.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more we answer them, the more they like to ask.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As a result, the questions can go on endlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should deal with the new believers in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, someone may ask whether or not they should worship their ancestors.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can answer them in this way: The way to care for your ancestors is simply to honor and remember them, and the best and highest way to honor and remember them is to behave well and live a proper human life, even as the ancient Chinese sages said, To live a proper human life is to honor your ancestors.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is best to answer this question only to this extent.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the new believer asks further, Should we worship the ancestors?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>, then we should say, If your parents do, then do not argue with them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Regarding other questions you may have, we can talk about them later.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sometimes they may ask positive questions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When they pray, for example, they may sense some hindrances within them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To ask about this is to ask a good question.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should take this opportunity to speak a little to them to let them know that to pray is to come near to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the same time, to pray is also to exercise the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The spirit is the organ for us to contact the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our living we may talk and act in a light way without caring for the sense in our spirit, and we may not sense the obstacles and hindrances in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, when we quiet ourselves and pray with our spirit, the spirit gains ground in us, and we then become very clear about the feeling of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then whenever something is wrong in our spirit, we sense the barrier.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Most of the time this barrier is our sins or our disobedience in some matter before God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we have to confess our sins immediately, one after another, until there are no more barriers within.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To answer a question in this way will make a very good home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the new ones have no questions, we can read Truth Lessons with them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a very convenient and flexible way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The best way to teach Truth Lessons, simply speaking, is not to read the lessons together with them but to read the outlines at the beginning of every lesson, giving some explanation while reading.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Before reading with them, we have to read it ourselves and understand the general idea and the main points of the chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then we can help them when we read with them.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I believe that after they read the message, they will find it very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Truth Lessons will be published in four levels, with four volumes in each level.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Its content is very rich.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If the new ones can receive some solid education in Life Lessons and Truth Lessons, they will surely be remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE SECRET FOR THE SUCCESS OF THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The success of the new way hinges on two key points.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first one is getting people saved and baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The second is the home meetings to keep the saved ones in the church life so that they can be remaining fruit and be perfected to be useful vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If a local church truly takes the new way, it will begin with a fourfold increase in number each year.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Where there is originally one hundred saints, after one year there should be four hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Three hundred out of this number will be newly added to the church life, and one-fourth of these three hundred should be remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, there should be two hundred who meet regularly by the end of the year.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Simply speaking, at least one-fourth of all who are baptized by us should remain and have home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Last year we baptized eight thousand people in addition to the four thousand baptized at the start of our full-time training.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This totals twelve thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Of these twelve thousand, there should still be three thousand who remain.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>According to past experience, among these three thousand remaining ones there should be five or six hundred homes in which they break bread.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If five or six meet in each home to break bread, about five hundred homes are needed for this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These are only the newly saved ones; this does not include those who already meet in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, the key for the home meetings is first to keep one-fourth of the newly baptized ones.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Second, five percent of these remaining ones should serve full time.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Apart from this, twenty-five percent should be going out for door-knocking every week.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The home meetings are considered successful only if these three things are fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If not, we cannot reach our estimates for the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We cannot look only at the outward situation of the number of people who are baptized and the good condition of the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must realize that this is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have to keep our eyes on our estimates and our goal.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Full-timers need to be produced, and one-fourth of the saints must be raised up to go door-knocking every week.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This requires all of us to endeavor together.</S>
