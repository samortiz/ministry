   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION TWO THE CALL FOR DELIVERANCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FROM THE SELF</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>2:8 3:5 I. THE CALL FOR DELIVERANCE FROM THE SELF 2:8-15</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this section there is no mention of the maiden's sins or failures.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead we see the necessary stages that a person goes through on a spiritual journey.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The maiden has her shortcomings, and in this section we see what she should have gained, but has not gained.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A. The Power of Resurrection 2:8-9</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Verse 8 says, "The voice of my beloved! behold, he cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She rejoices at the voice of her beloved, and she loves the joy of his presence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Yet she has not followed the voice of her beloved, and there is no actual obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 9 says, "My beloved is like a roe or a young hart: behold, he standeth behind our wall, he looketh forth at the windows, showing himself through the lattice."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Both Darby's translation and the margin of the American Standard Version render "roe" as "gazelle," but the King James Version and the text of the American Standard Version render it as "roe."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Three versions the King James Version, the American Standard Version, and Darby's New Translation use "a young hart."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The only place where the Lord is associated with a hart is in the heading to Psalm 22, where there is the expression "the hind of the dawn" RSV or "the hind of the morning" ASV, margin .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All Bible scholars agree that this refers to the morning of the first day of the week, when Christ resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Morning is the beginning of another day, while resurrection is the beginning of a new day.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the starting point of a person's spiritual life, and it is signified by a new day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Both verses 8 and 9 speak of the vitality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Bible, both the mountains and the hills refer to difficulties and barriers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>"He cometh leaping upon the mountains, skipping upon the hills."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that nothing is too high or too great to stop Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord is the Lord of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ has resurrected; He has overcome all difficulties and barriers.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Difficulties and barriers are things of yesterday.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is living in the next day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All difficulties are beneath His feet.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The minute He leaps, all the barriers are behind Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this section, the Lord manifests His resurrection power, and He is speaking to the maiden in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She did not know of such things in her experience in the previous chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>She ran before, but she did not know what it was like to leap upon the mountains and skip upon the hills.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to teach her the lesson, the Lord calls her.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Since she already has an intimate relationship with the Lord, it is easy for her to recognize His voice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But there is an obvious problem a wall exists between her and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The wall encloses her, and it keeps the Lord out.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet she does not see anything wrong with the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, she does not say "my wall," but "our wall," meaning that the wall belongs to both her and to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She intends for that wall to enclose herself and the Lord and to keep the world and everything else out.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then she would have fellowship with the Lord and rest in Him and live happily within the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She would be able to find the Lord within her heart all the time, and she could ignore circumstances, persons, the brothers and sisters, daily duties, and many trials.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She could turn inward to the Lord and forget about the world.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She only knows the sweetness of fellowship, but does not know the power of work and the fierceness of warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is only the thought of making three tents on the mountain, and no thought is given to the mass of sinners at the base of the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Demons can be with the sinners at the base of the mountain, as long as the Lord is within her heart on the mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It may be true that she has the Lord's presence, but the life within the "tents" has deprived sinners from experiencing deliverance from the demons.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In other words, she is always turning inward to seek the joy of the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is her wall.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is a danger believers face after they have realized that Christ lives within them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Spiritually speaking, this does not mean that the Lord can leave our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Being behind the wall means two things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>First, the Lord is standing, not sitting.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Previously, He was sitting at the table.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now He is ready to make a move.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Standing is the first step a person takes before moving.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Just as sitting leads to rest, standing leads to work.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Second, it means that the Lord is outside.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The power of resurrection is able to leap over the mountains and skip over the hills.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, we should not keep Him within the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The maiden needs to learn to let go of the Lord within and allow Him to lead her out.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>She should not try to hold on to the Lord with her own strength, but she should allow the Lord to lead her on.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>She should learn to trust in the Lord's word and to follow Him by exercising her faith to leap over the mountains and skip over the hills.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>She should learn to live by something other than just the feeling of the Lord's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thank the Lord, even though man can put up a wall, God can set apart some windows for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If there are not any large windows, there will at least be some small lattices.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God can always find a way to enlighten the heart of those who have consecrated themselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This wall is the wall of our introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It causes us to miss the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But God has set apart windows and lattices for Himself for us to see through.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>A wall means an attempt to keep the Lord within.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When this happens, the world is kept out.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord is trying to deliver the maiden out of this condition.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He is teaching her to realize that His presence can be found under any circumstance; there is no need to look for Him only within herself.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>She should learn to know Christ more from the environment than from within.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The Lord is omnipresent.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Andrew Murray once said that the Lord's presence should be felt not only in our prayer, but in our factory as well.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>What is the Lord doing outside the wall?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is standing and waiting to make a move.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, a person who is constantly looking inward and who concentrates on his own feeling of joy cannot understand anything even after he has learned the Lord's thought.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although he may hear the Lord's voice, he will not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord has to speak again before he can understand anything clearly.</S>
