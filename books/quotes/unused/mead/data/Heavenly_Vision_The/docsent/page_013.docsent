   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CAPTURED BY THE VISION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND PAYING THE PRICE FOR IT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to be caught, captured, by these points concerning the vision of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By the Lord's mercy I can testify that since I was caught by this vision more than thirty years ago, I have never changed my tune.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From the first day until now, my tune has been the same.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But those who are not willing to take the way of the ground of the church often change their tune.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, several years ago I was told by a particular group that they were the same as we are a local expression of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In their writings they even used the words "local church."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But now they oppose the matter of the church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Another example concerns a brother who, in response to our question of whether his meeting was on the ground of the church, said, "I cannot say that the meeting here is on the church ground, but we are working toward this goal."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now this person, who has been exposed as being two-faced, is absolutely opposed to the church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is not the way for the children of God to conduct themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our yes should be yes, and our no should be no.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Regarding the church, we need to have a clear vision, and then we must be ready to pay the price for it, even the price of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then from the beginning to the end we will not change our tune.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are willing to take the proper way concerning the church, our tune will always be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But those who are not willing to take this way will change their tune.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They may talk about the church, but eventually they will give up the church and may even oppose it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE GROUND AND THE BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we want to have a particular building, we must also have the lot on which the building stands, for the lot is the ground of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, some may feel that the lot is earthly and has many problems and is too troublesome; therefore, they want the building without the lot.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you say that you like the building but will not take the lot, the ground, how can you have the building?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In such a case, it would be impossible to have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This illustrates the attitude of some believers toward the ground of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They want to have the church, but they do not want to have the church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The result is that they do not have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who want a building without the lot cannot have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In like manner, those who want the church without the ground of the church cannot have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>ASKING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>FOR A CLEAR VISION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to pray that we may see clearly the four matters that we have emphasized in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to see that the desire of God's heart is to have a church for His Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We need to see that the church is practical, that the church is not a matter in theory or merely in teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We also need to see that the church is local and that the church must have the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I would urge you to pray in a definite way about these four points.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Otherwise, there will be no way for us to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Concerning these matters, you need to be simple.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not be complicated, but in simplicity ask the Lord to show you a clear vision of these four points.</S>
