Although Paul was &ldquo;a Hebrew of Hebrews&rdquo; and &ldquo;as to the law, a Pharisee&rdquo; (v. 5), he could testify, &ldquo;What things were gains to me, these I have counted loss on account of Christ. But surely I count also all things to be loss on account of the excellency of the knowledge of Christ Jesus my Lord, on account of whom I have suffered the loss of all things and count them refuse that I may gain Christ&rdquo; (vv. 7-8). Paul realized that in the sight of God and in the New Testament economy all the things of Judaism were refuse. Paul&rsquo;s word in Philippians 3 indicates the kind of vision that was within him. However, although Paul counted the things of Judaism to be refuse, James, to his shame, continued to promote them.</p><h2 class="head1">THE NEW MAN</h2><p>In Colossians 3:10 and 11 Paul speaks of the new man: &ldquo;And having put on the new man, which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him; where there cannot be Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian, Scythian, slave, freeman, but Christ is all and in all.&rdquo; Here we see that in the new man there is room only for Christ. In verse 11 &ldquo;all&rdquo; refers to all the members who compose the new man. Christ is all the members of the new man and in all the members. He is everything in the new man. What a tremendous revelation this is! According to Paul&rsquo;s word in Colossians 3:10 and 11, not the slightest ground remains for Judaism.</p><h2 class="head1">THE UNIQUE OFFERING</h2><p>The book of Hebrews reveals that Christ is everything. Christ is both God and man, and He is superior to Moses, Joshua, and Aaron. As our High Priest, Christ has replaced all the Old Testament offerings with Himself as the unique offering. Christ is the only offering God cares for, and all the Old Testament offerings were simply types of this unique offering. Now that Christ has come, all the other offerings should be terminated, and in fact they have been replaced and terminated. Concerning this, Hebrews 10:14 says, &ldquo;By one offering He has perfected forever those who are sanctified,&rdquo; and verse 18 goes on to say, &ldquo;Now where forgiveness of these is, there is no longer an offering for sin.&rdquo; Furthermore, the old covenant has been replaced by the new covenant. Therefore, the things of the Old Testament are over.</p><p>I would ask you to compare the revelation in Ephesians, Philippians, Colossians, and Hebrews with James&rsquo; word in Acts 21. In 21:20 James said to Paul, &ldquo;You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed, and all are zealous for the law.&rdquo; Then James went on to ask Paul to pay the expenses of four men who had taken the vow of the Nazarite: &ldquo;Four men are with us who have a vow on themselves; take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses that they may shave their heads; and all will know that there is nothing to the things of which they have been instructed concerning you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law&rdquo; (vv. 23-24). What a contrast there is between James&rsquo; word and Paul&rsquo;s revelation concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy! This comparison should enable us to have a clear view of Paul&rsquo;s situation in these chapters of Acts.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_204.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_206.html">Next</a> </body></html>
