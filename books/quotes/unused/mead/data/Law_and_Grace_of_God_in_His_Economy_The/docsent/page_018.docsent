   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Such a Processed and Consummated Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being the Grace Enjoyed by All the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>in God s New Testament Economy,</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even for Eternity</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such a processed and consummated Triune God is the grace enjoyed by all the believers in God s New Testament economy, even for eternity Rev 22:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Gospel of John there is neither right and wrong nor good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the garden of Eden, before man had eaten of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, man had no concept of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Man had only one concept to receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The man created by God had God s inward image and outward likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In creating man, God gave man a thought, that is, to have God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is man s unique concept.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is not a matter of doing good or doing evil, but a matter of having God or not having God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, Satan came in and tempted man to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, which is anything other than the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As soon as man ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the concept of good and evil entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>From that time to this day, fallen human beings, including Christians and even those who are in the Lord s recovery, are often concerned about good or evil and right or wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We like to ask, Is it right?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Is it right for the elders to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Is it right for the deacons to do that?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Whether it is right or wrong, it does not matter; it is just a photo.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Pentateuch is full of what is right, what is wrong, what is good, and what is evil, but the Gospel of John is not.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Gospel of John tells us that the Word, who was in the beginning, became flesh in time that divinity and humanity may be united and mingled together into a God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This God-man does not care about right or wrong, nor about good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All He cares about is that you receive the grace that He brought.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Today it is not enough to say, as the inner-life people do, that what God wants is neither good nor evil but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This kind of speaking is very good, but it does not touch the main point.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Actually, God does not want you to live; He wants you to take Him as life and live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that now I live, but it is not I living alone, not I living by myself; it is Christ and I living in union.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I now live, but it is no longer I, yet I still live; and the life which I now live is the life I live in union with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Concerning this matter, even the inner-life people do not have a clear vision.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is not that we do not move; we still move and therefore we can live Christ and magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we are no more, how can we magnify Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not that we are no more; we still live.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, we do not take the initiative; we take Him as our initiative.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is in this way that we live Christ and magnify Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Christian life is Christ living and I also living, yet it is not I bringing Him along to live with me, but His bringing me along to live with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I am living along with Him, taking Him as my life and person.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Dear brothers and sisters, if you take Him as your life and person, that is, He lives and you live along with Him, can you still lose your temper?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Will you still try to do good?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Will you still try to love others?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All these concepts will vanish.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You will have only one concept He moves, and you move along with Him; He is your life and your person; you take Him as your life and your person; He is your inward life and your outward living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is no concept of whether or not to honor your parents, nor any concept of whether or not to steal.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You are altogether in another world.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a world in which the Triune God is your life and your person, a world in which you live by Him He is taking the lead and you are going along and a world in which He lives and you live with Him, not living by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I hope that we all can see this.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the older ones, the younger ones, the elders, the deacons, and the co-workers in the church all can see this, there will be no more arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The arguments in the church all come from being right or wrong, from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can find out concerning what is right and what is wrong in the Pentateuch but not in the Gospel of John; all that the Gospel of John has is life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ is my life and my person He lives and I also live; He moves and I also move; it is not I but He who takes the initiative.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I am His counterpart; I am a part of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What is right or what is not right is not the concern of the Body of Christ.</S>
