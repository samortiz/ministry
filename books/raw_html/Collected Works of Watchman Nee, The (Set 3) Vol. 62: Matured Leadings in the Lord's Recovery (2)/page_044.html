<h2 class="head1">BEING DELIVERED FROM HUMAN ARTIFICIAL SERVICE</h2><p>Watchman Nee: During the past few days Brother Lee has been urging me to speak, but I do not know what kind of thoughts are within him. Today I feel to say something. Please forgive me for saying a frank word to you. For the past ten days at least, I have been in a quandary. This is not a matter of whether or not the brothers and sisters have handed themselves over. I feel that a basic problem is still unresolved in all those who have handed themselves over. We can even pinpoint the problem: Too much of our service is human and artificial; it does not have its source in the life within us.</p><p>I have been speaking for the Lord for about thirty years. I know that no sinner can be saved without confessing his sins. Similarly, I can say that no Christian can know the reality of the church without making confession for his artificial and human service in the church. There were three brothers (a co-worker, a brother, and a leading one) who were dissatisfied with the church in Hong Kong. They often criticized many things in front of me. I am not saying that the critical ones are right. But if we do not let go of one or two things and if we would not deal with them, our service and coordination are equally wrong. Unless we deal with these basic issues, our coordination and service will be nothing but an outward show.</p><p>Suppose I make a model of a bee out of wax. It may look exactly like a real bee, but even a child can tell that it is not a real bee. A real bee has life. In the coming days, what we need is not to make a bigger wax bee but to have some real bees. We should not think that we can justify ourselves once we have handed ourselves over. It is true that our sins are to be condemned, but our righteousness is equally ragged before God. George Whitefield said once that even our tears of repentance need the washing of the blood. It is not just our evils that must be condemned and dealt with. What little bit of good that we possess must be destroyed also. We should not think that we have the real thing as long as we have the proper, outward appearance.</p><p>I beg you to believe that we know what is artificial service and what is genuine service of the Holy Spirit. I had no thought of saying such a word, but during the past few months, I have felt that many of the services in the church are artificial and manmade; they are void of any spiritual touch. Many people are paying too much attention to activities. They do not have a basic understanding of service, yet they come to serve. It seems as if all of us have become wax bee makers. I am not saying that we have a problem with our behavior. This is a matter of nature. The issue is whether something is human or spiritual.</p><p>I have been waiting for one kind of prayer, but I have not heard it during these days. We must all admit that many of the past messages were wax-like, and the services were wax-like. Many of the services and the coordination were false. In the world we can be false about anything because the flesh has a place in the world. But in the church there should not be any falsehood. We can be false in a very honest way. During the past few days, I have felt extremely terrible about many things. I read your consecration slips over ten times. On top of the pile are those from the co-workers and the responsible ones. Following these are the slips from all the brothers and sisters. Every time I look at them, I ask myself whether or not they handed themselves over because of the urging of the Spirit or because they were going along with some outward activities. No dealing in the course of the remission of sin is glorious. Similarly, no service of the flesh is to be boasted of. Let me repeat: This is not a matter of changing any methods but a matter of the very nature of things. I ask that the brothers and sisters not care so much for their "face"; they should go to the Lord for shining and dealing. On the one hand, I am very happy that the brothers and sisters have handed themselves over. On the other hand, I feel sad that they are not able to differentiate real things from false things. I hope that in these days you will learn to have the genuine service, that is, service that issues from the Holy Spirit within.</p><h2 class="head1">A PRAYER</h2><p>Weigh Kwang-hsi: Lord, we admit that we are not qualified to take the lead among the brothers and sisters. We cannot meet their needs, much less Your demands. In the past we had many thoughts and concepts which we deemed right and good. We ask that You forgive us. We admit that our consecration is behind that of many brothers and sisters, and the dealings that we have received are much less than what they have learned. We need Your special mercy. Lord, we are no better than the other brothers and sisters. We admit that we have made the ground useless (Luke 13:7). It is a small thing that we have offended You personally, but, Lord, we have offended the church, the Body of Christ. This is too serious. We have been appointed as the responsible ones. The burden is too heavy. We truly need Your sufficient grace and Your empowering.</p><p>Lord, we do not know where our confession should begin. We ask Your light to shine on what we have confessed and on what we are too slow to understand and confess. Forgive us for all these things. We ask that You accept anything in our service that is from You. We are willing to tear down all wood, grass, and stubble in our services. We want to have services that are gold, silver, and precious stones. We admit that there was no release of the spirit and of life in our services in the past. We admit that we did many things, but we forgot that we were serving You. We have done much, but we have not learned the lessons of service. Gracious Lord, be merciful to us!</p><p>Lord, we believe that since You have begun this good work, You will finish it. Today You have spoken through Your two servants. This is Your grace and great mercy to the church in Hong Kong. It is also Your mercy and grace that You have given us a spirit of repentance tonight. Your servants have not held back one thing that they should speak. It is Your great grace that they have not withheld their speaking from us. If Your servants were to become silent, we would be like dead persons. Since You have spoken, fulfill Your word. May our prayer tonight count towards Your plan of the ages. Grant us a fresh turn, a new beginning in the church in Hong Kong tonight.</p><p>May You work on us anew. We all give ourselves to You in a fresh way as a living sacrifice. Lord, although we are the overseers, we need Your mercy more than the other brothers and sisters. Your servants have spoken strong words, and this is a sign of Your love to Your church. Lord, even our repentance needs the cleansing of Your blood. We need more revelation and shining to expose our corruption and natural constitution. May our service and coordination in the church issue from the spirit, and may they bear the element of life. May You be fully satisfied. Amen!</p>
