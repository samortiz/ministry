   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BASE OF GOD S BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Gold signifies the divine nature of God for the base of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This divine nature is the golden base within us for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The more we partake of the divine nature, the more we have the base for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I do not care for people s humility or for people s pride.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Human pride and human humility are the same.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Both human pride and human humility are useless for God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I only care how much God you have, how much divine nature you have partaken of, and how much divine nature you are partaking of day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is possible to be a very good wife and a very nice husband and still not have much of God s divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all need to ask how much God we possess.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is the base for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to my realization, the Lord has done much in these last twenty-three years in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many of the saints have really partaken of the divine nature and have a substantial amount of the divine nature within them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the base for God s building and this is the base in which I put my trust for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man s humility can never be the base for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only God s nature, God Himself, can be such a base.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Neither a proud nor a humble person is good for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only those who are partaking of the divine nature daily are good for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The basic thing in the Lord s recovery is not a great number of people, but how much divine nature is here as a base for the building up of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must realize that we are not simply allegorizing the Bible, but pointing out the real things in the Biblical allegories.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The entire New Jerusalem is an allegory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even in human language there is the need of allegory because some things cannot be expressed or described by mere plain and direct words.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because this building up of God s eternal dwelling place is altogether mysterious, spiritual, heavenly, and divine, there is the need of an allegory to express and describe it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Gold, pearls, and precious stones are all part of this allegory to express and describe the divine reality.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>From the time I was a young believer I realized that I was regenerated, born again.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, I never realized that within me there was something divine.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It was not until a number of years after I had received the Lord that I began to realize in a small way that through regeneration God had come into me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As a human being regenerated by God, you not only have the human nature but also the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Nature always denotes a certain kind of essence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Any element or substance has its essence.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is the divine gold as the element, and in this element is the essence with its nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today we believers have this divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all have to fight the battle, showing people that the Bible unveils to us that we believers have God within us as the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We are not merely studying the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are here to dig out all the divine truths that we may realize what we are today, where we are today, where we are heading, and what we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We have to realize that we are the people who have the divine nature, the divine element, the divine substance, and the divine essence, in our being.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As a believer you are a golden man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You are not a muddy man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the sisters need to realize that they are not muddy women but golden women.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because we are so golden, we cannot go dancing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do you think a golden man would quarrel with his wife?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Gold never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Despite what you do to it, it remains the same.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We the believers in Christ today are golden!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are divine!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have the divine nature!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We all have to declare that we are not muddy but golden.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Gold is the base for the building up of the dwelling place of God for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Lord Jesus told Peter that he was a stone John 1:42 and reminded him in Matthew 16 that he was a stone v. 18 . He also said that He would build His church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today the Lord is doing a building work.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From the day of Pentecost the Lord began to build the church with you and me as stones based upon God s divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The stones are built upon the golden base, which is the site.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>All the materials are built upon this site and the site is the base.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The base for the Lord s building today is God s divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not your knowledge, your education, your good character, your kindness, your humility, or even your love.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The base is the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I have the assurance and the confidence to say that in the Lord s recovery there is a strong base of the divine nature within so many of us who are loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What we have seen in this chapter is according to the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The base for God s eternal building and for His present building work is His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We all should say, Lord Jesus, thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Through Your redemption I have the position, the standing, and the right to take my God as my divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thank You, Lord, that I have taken and am still taking and enjoying You as my divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The basic elements of the structure of the New Jerusalem are the gold as the base of God s building Rev 21:18b, 21b , the pearls which signify the produce of Christ in His redemptive work with His secreting life for the entry Rev 21:21a into God s building 1 Cor 3:12a; John 3:5 , and the precious stones Rev 21:11, 18a, 19-20 signifying the produce of the Spirit in His transforming work 2 Cor 3:18 with His divine element for the building up of God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All these three precious materials are built together and built up to be a universal wife, the wife of the Lamb Rev 21:2, 9 , the redeeming God, which corresponds with and reflects the wife in Genesis 2, who was a type of this universal wife of the redeeming God.</S>
