   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO SAVED AND CALLED THROUGH DORA YU'S PREACHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Among the evangelists which the Lord raised up in China was a young sister whose English name was Dora Yu and whose Chinese name was Yu Tzu-tu.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She had been saved at an early age and later was sent to England by her family to study medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the way to England her ship docked at Marseilles in southern France.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At that point she became greatly burdened and told the captain that she could not continue the voyage and that she must return to China to preach the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The captain was perplexed but could do nothing except send her home.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Her parents were extremely disappointed by her return, and though they attempted to change her mind regarding the preaching of the gospel, their efforts were unavailing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eventually they gave up.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>She soon left home, wandering about preaching the Lord Jesus on the streets.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>No one hired her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>She simply trusted in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Through means supplied by the Lord, she rented a storefront in a suburb of Shanghai for preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From then on she was invited by denominations to hold many gospel preaching meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>She traveled extensively through many provinces doing gospel work and became a prevailing witness for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She continued to preach for the rest of her life, leading hundreds to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In February of 1920 Dora Yu was invited to Foochow, the capital of Fukien province, where she preached the gospel in the Methodist auditorium.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Her preaching was so convincing and full of power that following every meeting rows of tears could be seen on the floor from the weeping of the audience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Among the converts was a well-educated Chinese lady, Watchman Nee's mother.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She and her husband were Methodists but without the experience of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After being saved, she returned home and made a thorough confession to her husband and children.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Her oldest son, Shu-tsu, was greatly surprised and inspired by her confession.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He felt that he must go to Dora Yu's meeting and see what it was that had brought about such a change in his mother.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The next day he went, and the Lord caught him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later the same night he saw a vision of the Lord Jesus hanging on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Through this experience the Lord called him to be His servant.</S>
