Although the number is smaller, all have come for the Lord. All who attend the Lord's table meeting are brothers and sisters who were baptized among us. I feel that I will allow the brothers to touch the affairs of the church only after they have been brought through the narrow gate of purging the leaven, and consecration to the Lord.</p><p>Our expenses for March were thirteen million yuan (the principal expense being payment on three months' rent for a brother). Although this is not a great amount, several brothers have given their all. (My salary for March was only 2,800,000 yuan.)</p><p>Last Lord's Day (April 18), four brothers and sisters were baptized. May the Lord bless you and be with you.</p><p>Respectfully,<br />Pao-sheng<br />April 22, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: 20 Jie-Shih Road, Siying, Zhan-Jiang, Kwangtung province</p><h2 class="head1">A BEGINNING IN KULING MOUNTAIN</h2><p>According to the most recent letters from Foochow, more than twenty brothers and sisters have arrived there. P'ing-Yang sent the most brothers and sisters, Swatow was second.</p><p>The brothers and sisters began going up the mountain in different groups on June 4. After they arrived on the mountain, they met every morning from 8:00 to 10:00. After a break, they continued meeting until 12:00. In the afternoon there was rest until 3:00 and then work by assignments. There were also meetings in the evenings.</p><p>Editor</p><h2 class="head1">WAITING IN LAN-CHOU</h2><p>..I have not written since coming to the Northwest. I have recently felt led by the Lord to simply discuss my past, present, and future with you brothers. I hope you will pray for me.</p><p>When I was in Tsingtao, it seemed that I received a calling for the remote regions. In the seven years that I waited before leaving Tsingtao, I became more and more aware of my spiritual poverty and weakness. I felt that I may not have had a calling, and so my purpose in going west was to do business and serve a little in the matter of hospitality.</p><p>I came to Lan-chou and used up almost all of my capital. The Lord made provision for me to come to Kansu College as an accountant. In that year God seemed to remind me of His calling through 1 Timothy 6:11-12 and 2 Timothy 1:6-8. However, when I considered the problem of my lack of gift, knowledge, and eloquence, I was held back by an invisible force.</p><p>On the morning of January 14, 1945, the Lord seemed to give me a clear revelation. It seemed as if a voice spoke to me, "Your name is not Shi-xin, which translated means `new,' nor is it `decrease'; it should be `John,' who said, `He must increase, but I must decrease.'" After I changed my name, I had a deep realization that the work before me did not require my gift or knowledge for the building of the church. Instead, I should rely on the Lord's grace to pioneer and prepare His way.</p><p>Since I received the brothers' confirmation and sending, I boldly ignored my own feelings and took my family on the road to Yungchang for two years. Then I went to Wuwei. Brother Lee Yin-xin arrived in Lan-chou in winter and sent us an invitation to come to him for fellowship.</p><p>Thank God! He brought me into His light in one of the meetings. Little by little I saw that my previous work was like the situation in Judges, where everyone did what was right in his own eyes. If one has not been connected with the source, how can one speak of work and service!</p><p>Therefore, I had to put those activities aside, despite calls from Yungchang and Wuwei and their attempts to persuade me to return quickly. I am peaceful remaining in Lan-chou to learn to serve God with the brothers here. I can only wait for His clearer revelation and leading with regard to my future.</p><p>I really hope the brothers will take time to teach me about God's up-to-date desire and the way He wants to take. May the Lord be with you.</p><p>Your brother,<br />John Lee<br />April 12, 1948</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_012.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_014.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 55: The Ministries & The Open Door &nbsp; pg 13</div><br></body></html>
