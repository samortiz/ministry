   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Let us turn to Paul's letter to the Philippians to see his attitude in receiving offerings from the saints there.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Philippians 4:15-17 says, "You yourselves also know, Philippians, that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went out from Macedonia, no church had fellowship with me in the account of giving and receiving except you only; for even in Thessalonica you sent both once and again to my need.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit which increases to your account."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This was Paul's attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It seems as if the Philippians were the only ones who supplied him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When he was in Corinth and Thessalonica, it was the Philippians who supplied him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Yet to the Philippians he said, "Not that I seek the gift, but I seek the fruit which increases to your account."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He knew that God would make entries in the Philippians' account for the money they had spent.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God would take note of the Philippians' money.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is why he did not ask for their money.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Here was a man who had such an attitude towards the only ones who were supplying him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not seek the gift, but the fruit which increased to their account.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Macedonians had given again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But Paul's eyes were not on the money.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We may not accept some gifts, but even when we do accept, we should speak like Paul did to the Philippians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We should pray for their fruit to increase to their account.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is altogether wrong for God's servants to be bound by money.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must be delivered from money.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Let us go on to see what Paul said in verse 18: "But I have received in full all things and abound; I have been filled."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was no ordinary financial report.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>An ordinary report usually highlights a lack so that others will be motivated to give.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But to the only church that was supporting him, our brother Paul said, "I have received in full all things and abound; I have been filled."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul's words were seldom repetitious, but here he said, "I have received in full all things and abound; I have been filled."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brothers and sisters, please pay attention to our brother's attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He told the only church that was supporting him that he was full, that he was abounding, and that he was filled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He had enough; his only hope was that their gift would become "a sweet-smelling savor, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God" v. 18 . Here is a person with a beautiful spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He did not have any consciousness of money.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Money did not touch him in any way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Let us go on to verse 19, which is a very precious verse: "And my God will fill your every need according to His riches, in glory, in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was grateful for their support, but he did not lose his dignity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They offered up the money as a sacrifice to God; it was not for Paul personally, and it had nothing to do with him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>At the same time, he blessed them: "My God will fill your every need according to His riches, in glory, in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We cannot help but say, "To our God and Father be the glory forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Amen."</S>
