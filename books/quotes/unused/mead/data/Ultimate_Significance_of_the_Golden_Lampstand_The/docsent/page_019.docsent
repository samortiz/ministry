   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Knowing the Mystery of the Golden Lampstand</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>by the Lord s Mercy</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Spiritual things cannot be thoroughly explained even with a thousand words.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In these chapters, we have seen the golden lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The golden lampstand is Jehovah, Jehovah is the Lamb, the Lamb is the stone, and the stone is God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I believe that we all now know these new terms.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Nevertheless, if we speak them to people, they will think that we are crazy because they do not understand what we are talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To be sure, even some of the professors of the Bible in the seminaries do not understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though they have the Bible in their hands, they do not know these things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, today we know them by the Lord s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We know that the golden lampstand is Jehovah, and Jehovah, the God who has a relationship with us, is our Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We also know that this Lamb is the stone which was engraved by God, and that in one day this engraving removed all the iniquity of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This stone, eventually, is just God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These things could not be more clear even if we listened to ten thousand more words.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church is the golden lampstand, the golden lampstand is Jehovah, Jehovah is the Lamb, the Lamb is the stone, and the stone is God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We cannot use human words to explain the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is too mysterious, but we can state it in this way: The church is the reproduction of the Spirit with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today if we ask those in the seminary what it means that the church is the reproduction of the Spirit with Christ, they may say, We do not have such a thing in our systematic theology.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We only have the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We do not say that the church is the reproduction of the Spirit with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We don t understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, we all can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even the youngest among us can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is the reproduction, the manifestation, of the Spirit with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God s Move with Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The golden lampstand is first a matter of the enlightening of the seven lamps and then of the burning of the lamps of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The burning is for the move, and with the move is the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Whenever God moves, He judges.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God never does a dragging, hesitant work.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He never carries any grass bags ; He is always clear-cut.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whatever is according to His will, He receives; whatever is not, He rejects.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Judges 7 tells us that when God wanted Gideon to smite the Midianites, Gideon had over thirty thousand men with him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God came into this situation in order to move, and His moving was His judging.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God told Gideon, The people are still too many.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Bring them down to the water, and I will test them for you there v. 4 . The test of drinking the water was a judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When they drank the water, they were tested.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only three hundred could follow Gideon in his action, and the rest had to return home.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God s move is His burning, and His burning is the judgment for His move.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE SEVEN EYES OF GOD FOR TRANSFUSING</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the seven lamps of fire burn in us, they become seven eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is wonderful that the shining lamps become the lamps of fire, and the lamps of fire become the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We all know that the eyes are the most lovely part of a person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a person closes his eyes, we cannot see what is lovely in him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A person s loveliness is in his eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thank the Lord that the shining and burning lamps eventually become the lovely eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I can testify that anyone who has gone through God s burning, judging, and purifying, and whose grass bags have been burned away by God, can say, O God!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I thank You that the burning lamps of fire are the lovely eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These seven lamps are the seven eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Perhaps some may say that the seven eyes are fearful, because angry eyes are frightening.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God, the seven eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Are these seven eyes fearful or lovely?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One may say that they are sometimes fearful and sometimes lovely, but whether the eyes are fearful or lovely depends not on Him but on us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we behave as the proper children of God, His eyes are lovely, but if we are naughty, His eyes are fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nevertheless, whether they are fearful or lovely, at least they are not just lamps of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We thank and praise Him that they are still His eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I can testify, and I believe that many can also testify, that these seven are the seven eyes to us and not only the seven lamps of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Eyes are not only for seeing but also for transfusing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What does transfusing mean?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is to transmit a person s inner being into the one he is looking at.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When a brother whom I delight in comes to me and I look at him, the joy and sweetness within me is transfused into him through my eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, if I see a brother who is very naughty and say within my heart, Oh!</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It s him, these thoughts within me are likewise transfused into him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To transfuse is to infuse.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whether the transfusion is of love or of fear, God has been transfused into us.</S>
