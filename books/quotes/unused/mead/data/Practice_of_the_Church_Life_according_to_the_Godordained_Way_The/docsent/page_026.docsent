   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>X. THE QUALIFICATIONS FOR PROPHESYING A. Taking the Precious from the Vile</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The first qualification for prophesying is to take the precious things from the vile, or worthless Jer 15:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God said to Jeremiah, "And if you bring out the precious from the worthless,/You will be as My mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to speak the word of God, we have to separate all the vile, worthless things from the precious things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have received many precious things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do not keep the precious things separate from the vile things, we will lose the position to be the mouthpiece of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>B. Loving the Lord, Being Close to Him,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>and Being One with Him</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To love the Lord, to be close to Him, and to be one with Him is another qualification for those who would prophesy Jer 1:8-9; Psa 73:28a .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All of the prophets loved the Lord, were very close to the Lord, and were one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must have the same experience; otherwise, we cannot be prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>C. The Intimate Counsel of Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Belonging to Those Who Fear Him, and</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His Covenant Being Made Known to Them</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The intimate counsel of Jehovah belongs to those who fear Him, and His covenant He will make known to them Psa 25:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order to prophesy, we must have an intimacy with God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Furthermore, we should not think that because we are intimate with God, we can be loose.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the contrary, we must also have a fear that matches our intimacy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this way we are qualified to be God's mouthpiece.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>D. Until I Went into the Sanctuary of God,</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>and Considered...</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Psalm 73 the psalmist was bothered at the prosperity of the wicked v. 3 . Then in verse 17 he said, "Until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end." He could not understand until he went into the sanctuary of God, that is, until he contacted God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This shows that he did not want to solve any problem apart from God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He went into the presence of God to get his problem solved; then he received the word from God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>E. Praying for the Ministry of the Word</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Acts 6:4 Peter said, "But we will continue steadfastly in prayer and in the ministry of the word."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to prophesy, we must pray for the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Without prayer, the ministry of the word will not be enlivened and empowered.</S>
