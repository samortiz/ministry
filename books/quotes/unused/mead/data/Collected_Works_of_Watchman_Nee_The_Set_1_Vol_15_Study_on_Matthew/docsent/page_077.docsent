   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verses 31-32:"Which of the two did the will of the father?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>They said, The first.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jesus said to them, Truly I say to you that the tax collectors and the harlots are going into the kingdom of God before you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For John came to you in the way of righteousness, and you did not believe him, but the tax collectors and the harlots believed him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And you, when you saw it, did not later regret it to believe him."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"The way of righteousness" here means the way of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although John encouraged them once, and the faith of the tax collectors and harlots encouraged them once again, they still would not believe.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"The kingdom of God."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why not say "the kingdom of the heavens"?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If "the kingdom of the heavens" had been used, the real significance would be lost here.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The kingdom of God mentioned here refers to the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Without regeneration one cannot enter into the kingdom of God John 3:3, 5 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"Before you."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a Greek expression; it does not mean that the Pharisees would eventually enter the kingdom of God after the tax collectors.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, it means that the tax collectors would enter while these Pharisees would not.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verses 33-40:"Hear another parable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There was a man, a householder, who planted a vineyard and put a hedge around it, and dug a winepress in it, and built a tower; and he leased it out to vinedressers and went abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>And when the time to harvest the fruit drew near, he sent his slaves to the vinedressers to get his fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And the vinedressers took his slaves and beat one, and killed another, and stoned another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Again, he sent some other slaves, more than the first, and they did likewise to them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then later he sent to them his son, saying, They will respect my son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But the vinedressers, when they saw the son, said among themselves, This is the heir.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Come, let us kill him and take possession of his inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And they took him and cast him out of the vineyard and killed him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore when the master of the vineyard comes, what will he do to those vinedressers?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This parable is concerning "a man, a householder."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, it cannot be interpreted on the human level, because 1 God never goes away to a foreign country, and 2 God foreknew that the Jews would kill the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The householder refers to God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The vineyard signifies the realm of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The hedge signifies protection Job 1:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Winepress."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Wine refers to that which makes man happy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The tower is a watchtower, by which one acquires knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>"Leased it out."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is not for sale, and it is absolutely not given away.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To lease it out means that God has the ownership and that He asked the Jews only to manage it for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If interpreted on the human level, the fact that He "went abroad" is unexplainable.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"And when the time to harvest the fruit drew near."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This shows the earnestness of God's desire.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Before the Lord came, God already had such a desire.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The "slaves" signify the prophets who came before the Lord, who were all persecuted and even killed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"His son" refers to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>"They will respect my son."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was spoken according to human logic.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As far as God is concerned, the Lord did not stumble into death at the hands of fate; instead, He came purposely to die, to humble Himself, and to take the form of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"This is the heir."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Again this is true only as far as the human aspect of the parable is concerned, because the scribes and the Pharisees basically denied Him as the heir.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The vinedressers signify the Pharisees, the scribes, the chief priests, etc.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 41:"They said to Him, He will miserably destroy those evil men and will lease the vineyard to other vinedressers, who will give the fruit to him in their seasons."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They drew this conclusion by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This was fulfilled at the time Titus destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, only a part was fulfilled; the major part will be fulfilled during the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They said, "His blood be upon us A.D. 70 and upon our children the great tribulation !" Matt 27:25 . The "other vinedressers" v. 41 are the Jews in the kingdom and not the Jews at the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Verse 42:"Jesus said to them, Have you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the head of the corner.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes'?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>"The builders" signify the scribes, the Pharisees, and the chief priests.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"The stone...the head of the corner" signifies the Lord Jesus see Psa 118:22-23; Acts 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"Marvelous."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Jews, who have a blood relationship with the Lord, do not believe, yet we, the Gentiles, believe.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The cornerstone also refers to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"Have you never read?"</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They could ask themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Verse 43:"Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing its fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The kingdom of God here refers to the spiritual reality.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One can take away only another's spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 44:"And he who falls on this stone shall be broken to pieces; but on whomever it falls, it shall crush him to powder and scatter him like chaff."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To the Jews the Lord was the rock of stumbling.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Jews were stumbled because the Lord was not splendorous and did not have a kingly demeanor see Isa 8:14-15; Rom 9:32-33; 1 Cor 1:23; 1 Pet 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>To the church the Lord is the rock and the cornerstone 1 Cor 3:11; Eph 2:20-22; 1 Pet 2:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To the Gentiles the Lord is the smiting stone Dan 2:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The first part of verse 44 refers to the Jews, and the second part refers to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Concerning the Gentiles they must wait for the coming of the kingdom Dan 2:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today the Jews say that He is the carpenter's son, a deceiver, and they are stumbled.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Verses 45-46:"And when the chief priests and the Pharisees heard His parables, they perceived that He was speaking concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>And though they sought to seize Him, they feared the crowds because they held Him as a prophet."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Unbelievers are fearful of everything.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Christians are bold; they are not afraid of being despised and ridiculed.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Fearful people dare not believe in the Lord; they reap for themselves eternal perdition.</S>
