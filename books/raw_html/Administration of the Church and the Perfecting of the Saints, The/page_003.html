        <h2 class="head1">OUR URGENT NEED BEING TO LIVE IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>While we take this way and stand on this ground, the Lord has released His riches to us again and again. We worship the Lord, because we have the proper way, the proper ground, and the riches of the truth and of life. However, our urgent need is to live in our spirit. Our spirit needs to be strengthened, and the testimony of life needs to be shining. The saints in every locality must have a shining testimony so that the lampstand can shine among the people. In order for the lampstand to shine, our spirit must be strengthened. If our spirit is strengthened and we grow in life, the light of life will spontaneously shine.</p>
<p>Our way is right, the ground is proper, and the Lord has released His riches to us. But we must ask whether our spirit is strong and whether we are growing in life. The church life began in 1922. For the past fifty-seven years, more than half a century, we have passed through many tests and trials in China, Southeast Asia, Europe, America, and Africa. The tests, trials, attacks, and oppositions have proved that this way is right and proper, that this way cannot be defeated and cannot be denied, and that this way is under the Lord&rsquo;s blessing. Hence, the Lord is still releasing His rich word every year. However, our present need is for the elders, co-workers, and leading brothers and sisters to be strengthened in the spirit and to exercise their spirit to apply these riches so that these riches may be assimilated into the churches for the saints to grow in life.</p>
<p>We must do a particular work. We must not turn our attention to other things but should focus on being strengthened in our spirit and on the growth of the divine life in the local churches. The truth and light in the Life-studies will continue to be released, and the riches will continue to be ministered. In practice, however, the churches must turn to the spirit. The saints must be strong in spirit and grow in life. This is what we lack. It is not a matter of the way being wrong or of the ground not being proper, nor is it that we do not have the riches. Rather, it is a matter of how much the leading ones apply these riches. In order to apply these riches, we must turn to the spirit. We need to be strong in our spirit and grow in life so that we will be rich in life.</p>
<p>Some people may have the wrong understanding that the strengthening of the spirit refers to speaking and praying with a loud voice in the meetings. Loudly proclaiming is not the meaning of being strong in our spirit. To be strengthened in our spirit means that we live and walk according to the spirit in everything, both great and small, at every time and in every place. If we are not in our spirit, we should not act or move. We must act and move by our spirit. This is what pleases the Lord.</p>
<p>If we want to live in our spirit, we must love the Lord. We must always tell Him, &ldquo;Lord, I love You. Because I love You, I care for Your heart and take You as my life. Lord, You are the Spirit living in my spirit. I am willing to live and walk in the mingled spirit to satisfy the desire of Your heart.&rdquo; This is what pleases the Lord, but it is also what we are lacking.</p>
<p>Being in the spirit is a matter of life, a matter of our living. Daily we need to learn to live in the spirit of prayer and to touch the spirit whenever we pray. However, we often do not touch the spirit when we pray, because we do not have the habit of praying in our spirit. Instead of praying in our spirit, we pray in our mind, according to our memory, and with the excitement of our emotions. Thankfully, however, although we often do not begin praying in the spirit, we eventually pray ourselves into the spirit to touch the Lord and enjoy Him, and we are joined to Him as one spirit. This is the way for us to live in an atmosphere of prayer. We should live in an atmosphere of prayer while we are praying, and we should also live in an atmosphere of prayer in our daily life, even if we are not praying outwardly. In other words, we need to pray all day long. To pray unceasingly does not mean that we pray for many things from morning to evening but that our whole being is in the spirit of prayer. Whether we are giving a message, fellowshipping with the saints, taking care of business matters, working, or handling various affairs, we should live and walk by touching the Lord in our spirit. However, this is our lack. This is what the Lord has desired to gain for over two thousand years. It is not easy to attain to such a living, because there are too many things that replace our living in the spirit.</p>
<p>It is natural for us to live in the replacements, because we are born in the replacements, raised up in the replacements, and are accustomed to living in the replacements. We have been nurtured, educated, cultivated, and influenced in a way that enables us to live without God. We can live as proper and good persons apart from God and apart from the Spirit. However, to live apart from God is the greatest sin and is even an act of rebellion. It is a sin for unsaved persons not to believe in the Lord. It is also a sin for saved persons not to live the Lord and not to live by the Lord. God has given the unbelievers a commandment: &ldquo;Believe on the Lord Jesus&rdquo; (Acts 16:31). This is the only commandment to unbelievers. God has also given believers a commandment: &ldquo;Walk...according to the spirit&rdquo; (Rom. 8:4). To live and walk according to the spirit is to live Christ and to live out Christ. Regrettably, we violate this commandment every day, because we still do not live and walk according to the spirit in all things, at every time, and in every place. We understand this truth, we agree with it, and we have been touched by it. However, we still have all kinds of &ldquo;replacements&rdquo; for the spirit in our practical living.</p>
<p>If we would live and walk according to our spirit, the problems, defects, and shortcomings of our natural constitution would be resolved, because the problems, defects, and shortcomings of our natural constitution are in our self, not in our spirit.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
