   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The apostolic meeting is not an intrinsic part of the church life; it is merely a piece of work, and it ceases with the departure of the worker.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But the church meetings go on uninterrupted, whether the worker is present or absent.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is because the difference has not been realized between meetings for the church and for the work, that it has ever occurred to the brethren to cease to assemble themselves when the worker goes.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One of the fruitful sources of spiritual failure today is that the children of God consider the church to be a part of the work; so when there is a sermon to hear, they constitute a willing audience, but if there is no preacher, the meetings automatically cease, and there is no thought of simply gathering together to help one another.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But how can the local believers be equipped to minister one to the other?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the apostolic days it was taken for granted that the Spirit would come upon all believers as soon as they turned to the Lord, and with the on-coming of the Spirit, spiritual gifts were imparted, through the exercise of which the churches were edified.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The usual method which God has ordained for building up the churches is the ordinary church gatherings, not the meetings conducted by the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The reason the churches are so weak these days is that workers seek to build them up, through the meetings under their care, instead of leaving it to their own responsibility to edify each other through proper church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why has it come about that the church meetings of 1 Corinthians 14 are no longer a part of church life?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because so many of God's people lack the experience of the Spirit's on-coming, without which a meeting conducted along the lines of 1 Corinthians 14 is a mere empty form.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Unless all those we lead to the Lord have a definite experience of the Holy Spirit coming upon them, it will be of little use instructing them how to conduct their church meetings, for such meetings will be powerless and ineffective.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the Holy Spirit is upon the believers, as in the days of the early Church, He will give gifts to men, and such men will be able to strengthen the saints and to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We see from Paul's first Corinthian Epistle that God so equipped believers with spiritual gifts that they were able to carry on the work of building up the churches quite independently of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This does not imply that they needed no further apostolic help.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They decidedly did.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Alas! that nowadays many of God's people set more store by God's servants than by His Holy Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They are content to be ministered to by the gifts of a worker, instead of seeking for themselves the gifts of the Spirit; so true church meetings have given place to meetings under the auspices of the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 1 Corinthians 14, where a church meeting is in view, apostles have been left out of account altogether!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no place for them in the meetings of a local church!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the members of a church assemble and the spiritual gifts are in use, prophecy and other gifts are exercised, but there is no mention of apostles for the simple reason that apostles are appointed no place in the meetings of the local church; they are appointed to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the local church meets, it is the gifts that are brought into use; office has no place here, not even that of an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But this does not preclude a visiting apostle from speaking at all in a church meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is illustrated by the fact that Paul took part in the Troas meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the point to be noted is that Paul was only passing through Troas, so his speaking there was merely a temporary arrangement in order that the local saints might benefit by his spiritual gifts and knowledge of the Lord; it was not a permanent institution.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Apostles, as apostles, represent an office in the work, and not any particular gift; therefore, here they are ignored altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not a mention is made of them in this local church gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the organization of the church they have no place at all, because their ministry, as apostles, was not for the churches but for the work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we have already observed, apostles had no say in the management of the business affairs of any church; but from the fact that no part is allotted them even in the local gatherings for mutual edification, it is clear that God did not even intend that they should bear the responsibility of the spiritual ministry in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God gave gifts to the local brethren so that they could be prophets, evangelists, shepherds and teachers, and, thus equipped, could carry the burden of spiritual ministry in the locality.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Apostles do not bear responsibility either for the spiritual or material side of affairs in any church; the elders are responsible for the local management, and the prophets and other ministers for the local ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then have apostles nothing to do with the local church?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Surely!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is still plenty of scope for them to help the churches, but not in the capacity of apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>On the business side of things they can help indirectly by giving counsel to the elders, who deal directly with the church affairs; and on the spiritual side in the church meetings they can minister with any spiritual gifts they may possess, such as prophecy or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their apostolic office is of no account in a church meeting for the exercise of spiritual gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As apostles they cannot exercise any apostolic gift, but as brothers they can minister to their fellow believers by the use of any gift with which the Spirit may have endowed them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not only apostles, but even elders as such, have no part in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In this chapter 1 Cor 14 , elders have no place at all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are not even mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have already pointed out that elders are for office, not for ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They are appointed for church government, and not for ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Office is for government, and gifts are for ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the meetings which are for ministry, it is those who have been gifted by God that count, not those who hold office; so in the church meetings it is the prophets, teachers, and evangelists who take the lead, not the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They are the gifted ones of the church.1</S>
