   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PRIESTHOOD BRINGING IN THE KINGSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last chapter, we saw that Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob were all priests.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we read the whole Bible, we will see that these godly persons were priests who fulfilled the purpose of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have mentioned that the leading ministry in God s economy is the priesthood and that the kingship was brought into function through the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>David was anointed by Samuel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Samuel was more than a prophet; he was a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Samuel was brought up and even educated in the house of God as a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was through him that the kingship was brought into function.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The first positive king in God s sight was David.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One day when they brought back the ark of God, David was so excited that he put on a priestly robe, the ephod.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What did that signify?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It simply meant that the king needed the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was the priesthood that brought in the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Spiritually speaking, it is the life that is filled with God Himself that brings in the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The kingship coming out of the priesthood means that God s reigning power comes out of God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we have this kind of life, we will then have the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christians are not only holy priests, but also royal or kingly priests 1 Pet 2:5, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In other words, we are the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>First, God created man in His own image and then committed His own authority to man Gen 1:27, 28 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The image is related to the priesthood, and the authority is related to the kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The authority of kingship comes out of the life of God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must be so one with God that we become His very expression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then out of the life of God s image we will have the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, the authority of the kingship is brought in by the image of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE PRIESTHOOD BRINGING IN THE PROPHETHOOD</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only was the kingship brought in by the priesthood, but, by careful reading of the Bible, we will see that the prophethood was also brought in by the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although Isaiah was a prophet, he was really a man in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, he was not a priest, but spiritually, he was a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Also, Elijah and Elisha were not legally priests, but in reality both of them were priests, because they spent their time and their life in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before we can be a prophet, we must be a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have heard many people talk about 1 Corinthians, saying that we must desire the gift of prophecy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, only the priesthood can actually bring in the real prophethood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am especially interested in those prophets who were in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nearly all the main prophets in the recovery were priests.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Zechariah were priests.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These three priests were the main prophets for the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>And if we read the book of Daniel, we will see that he was spiritually a priest, even though he was not one legally.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He spent his time and his life in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Eventually, he was a person who was really one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many people pay attention to the prophecies of Daniel, but neglect the priesthood of Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Daniel was a priest because he was first mingled with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have seen that the kingly authority comes from the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we see that the real spirit of prophecy also comes from the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Look again at Elijah, Elisha, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, Daniel, and Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without exception, their prophethood came absolutely out of the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whether you are a priest, a king, or a prophet, you must first have the priesthood.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The priests need the priesthood, the kings need the priesthood, and the prophets also need the priesthood!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Look again into the Psalms.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although most of the Psalmists were not priests, all of them were spiritually in the priesthood!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For example, One thing have I desired of the LORD, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the LORD all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the LORD, and to inquire in his temple Psa 27:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>David wrote this Psalm.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If he were not a priest, how could he dwell in the house of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To dwell in the house of the Lord indicates the life of a priest!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One Psalmist says that to dwell in the courts of the Lord is better than a thousand days!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is the best way to redeem the time, because it can be redeemed one thousand times!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must not be satisfied to stay in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must learn to stay in the very presence of the Lord; for there, an hour is better than one thousand hours!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the priesthood which brings in the kingship and the prophethood.</S>
