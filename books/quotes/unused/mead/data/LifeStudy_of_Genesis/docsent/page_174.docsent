   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a. To Walk with God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Do you expect to be raptured?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If you do, you need to walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not only call upon the name of the Lord, but should also walk with God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The calling must be followed by the walking.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To walk with God is not to override God, not to be presumptuous, not to do things according to our own concept and desire, nor to do anything without God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To walk with God is to take Him as our center and everything, to do things according to His revelation and leading, and to do everything with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not only to live for God and to do things for God, but to live and to do things according to God and with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Enoch walked with God in such a way, living and doing things according to God and with God, not according to his own desire or concept, nor according to the current of the age in which he lived.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not easy to walk with another person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I have walked with the brothers or with the members of my family, they all have said that I walk too fast and that they cannot keep up with me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They have asked me to walk slower.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, I have a question to address to the brothers and to my family: Are you going to walk with me or am I going to walk with you?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Let us firstly determine who is going to walk with whom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are going to walk with me, you must keep up with me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not blame me for walking too fast.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you complain that I walk too fast, forget about me and walk with someone who is as slow as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But, if your intention is to walk with me, you must come up to my standard.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If my intention is to walk with you, I should slow down to your pace and be as slow as you are.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Please tell me, is God walking with you, or are you walking with God?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Was God walking with Enoch or was Enoch walking with God?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible does not say that God walked with Enoch; it says that Enoch walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is difficult to find a place in the Bible that tells us that God walked with people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We do find an instance of this in Luke 24.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>On the day of resurrection the Lord Jesus walked with the two disciples who were going from Jerusalem to Emmaus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The disciples did not walk with the Lord Jesus; the Lord Jesus walked with them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whenever the Lord walks with you, it means that you are going downward.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You are descending from Jerusalem to Emmaus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, whenever you walk with the Lord, you are going upward, coming back to Jerusalem from Emmaus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Are you walking with the Lord or is He walking with you?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In other words, are you going downward or upward?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you are going downward to the movies, for example, the Lord Jesus will walk there with you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times the Lord has walked downward with the saints in such a way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A number of saints have told the Lord, "Lord, I cannot stay with You.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I want to go to a movie."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then the Lord has said, "Are you going to a movie?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I will go there with you; I will walk downward with you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Why will I walk with you there?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because I am going to bring you back.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You shouldn't go downward to Emmaus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>My intention is that you all remain in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Since you are going down, I have to go with you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I must walk with you in order to bring you back."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Enoch walked upward with God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do not think that Enoch's being taken away by God happened suddenly.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do not think that one moment he was on earth and that the next he was in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Enoch did not walk up and down with God; neither did he walk in a zigzag pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He continually walked upward until he touched heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the age of three hundred sixty-five, as he was nearly touching heaven, God said to him, "Dear child, I am here.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Come with Me."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>And Enoch was taken away.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do you believe that Enoch's walk with God was up and down?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do you believe that Enoch walked with God inconsistently and that God said to him, "Poor child, come up quickly"?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I do not believe that that was God's way of taking Enoch up.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Enoch walked with God day and night for three centuries, for more than a hundred thousand days.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Enoch walked with God day by day, a little closer to God each day than the day before.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Enoch looked at the situation, the environment, the people and their deeds, and saw that everything was ungodly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet he kept on walking with God in a godly and holy way, walking with Him in this way for three hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In order to walk with God we must be with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must be one with Him in our thinking, loving, and choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As I have already pointed out, it is not easy for one person to walk with another.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Suppose, while I am walking with you, I have a different concept from you and say, "Brother, I love you and I want to walk with you, but don't go that way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Turn this way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I don't want to go that way."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If I say this, I am not walking with you, I am arguing with you.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, this is exactly what so many lovers of Jesus do.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They say, "Lord, I love You and I like to follow You.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I want to go with You."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, when the actual time comes, many do not walk with Him, but argue with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>For you to walk with the Lord implies a great deal: the denial of yourself, the denial of your thinking and your loving, the denial of everything that is of you.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It implies that you have given yourself to Him, that you will give in to Him and let Him take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To walk with the Lord is not a small thing.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Walking with Him will kill you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>My wife suffers whenever she walks with me.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Nevertheless, if you are going to walk with me, you have to deny yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>On the other hand, if I am going to walk with you, I must forget myself, condemn myself, and renounce myself that I may be one with you.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If I am unwilling to do this, I cannot walk with you or with anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is not simply a matter of calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is wonderful and enjoyable to call, "O Lord Jesus," but what follows the calling?</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When the Lord says, "Follow Me," will you follow Him?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Will you walk with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Never forget that calling is found in Genesis 4 and that walking is revealed in Genesis 5.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If walking does not follow our calling, our calling will not be very genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In a future message we shall see that after the walking we have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Enosh called, Enoch walked, and Noah walked and built.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must go on from Genesis 4, progressing from calling to walking.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Calling may supply you, but it will not kill you.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Calling makes you living.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>However, walking always kills you.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>But it will also resurrect you.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Walking firstly kills you, then it resurrects you to make you so living in enjoying the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You will be living to the uttermost, not in a natural way, but in a resurrected way.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Oh, how we all must walk with God!</S>
