	 <h2 class="head1">SOME ILLUSTRATIONS</h2>
<p>If this question concerning being organic and being organizational is not resolved, we will have no way to go on and no way to make decisions. Therefore, we need to spend some time to first fellowship concerning this matter. We should not be anxious if we are unable to resolve this matter immediately, because God is very patient. His patience is much greater than ours. To Him a thousand years are as one day. He can wait for a thousand years as if they were one day.</p>
<p>We all have many theories concerning being organic and being organizational, but we are not clear in our practice. We learn theories when we go to school, but when we go to work, we must put theories into practice. The people who do not put the theories that they learned into practice are not very successful in society. Some say that to be organizational is to put on airs and issue orders. This definition is close but crude. Some say that to be organic is not to put on airs but to be flexible, pliable, and humble. Can we say that a table is organic because it cannot put on airs? Rubber bands are very flexible, but does this mean they are organic? The shoes we wear are always pressed under our feet, so they are very humble, but are they organic? Some sisters say that anything that is automatic and spontaneous is organic. However, many unbelievers do things automatically and spontaneously.</p>
<p>In theory we know that to serve full time is to live before the Lord and to let the Lord&rsquo;s life live out of us. We also know that the Body of Christ is living, that all the members must function, and that every part must be living. However, we do not necessarily put this into practice. Here are some examples.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Elders</h2>
<p>When a brother has a desire to serve full time, he should have the approval of the elders in his locality. This kind of approval cannot come from a centralized group; instead, it should be a matter of local fellowship. However, if the elders simply stand in their position as elders to decide whether or not a brother should serve full time, their decision will be organizational. To be organic, the elders should not have the sense that they are elders, nor should they stand on their position as elders to make decisions. They have received a commission from the Lord concerning the church, and they should therefore act according to their fellowship with the Lord and according to the sense of life, the anointing, and the inward moving of the Spirit. They should not have the slightest thought that their decisions are supported merely by the fact that they are elders.</p>
<p>Once we act, speak, and handle matters according to the position, name, and status of being elders, we fall into organization. We cannot serve the church based merely on the position and status of being elders; rather, we must serve by being in spirit and obeying the inner sense.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Young Sisters</h2>
<p>A young sister who desires to serve the Lord full time might think that she should submit to elderly saints because she is a young sister. If her decision to submit is based on her youth and her gender, her submission is organizational. This sister should say, &ldquo;Even though I am a sister, I am living in fellowship with the Lord. In this fellowship the Lord leads me step by step, and I am touching the anointing and acting according to the moving of the Spirit.&rdquo; In this fellowship, there will be an organic submission that is not based on her age and gender but on the sense of life and the operation of the Spirit. This kind of obedience is not organizational; it is living and organic.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Cultivating Chinese Morality</h2>
<p>Women in Chinese families were taught in former times to obey their fathers before marriage, to obey their husbands during marriage, and to obey their sons as widows. They were also taught the virtues of fidelity, charm, propriety in speech, and efficiency in needlework. These teachings relate to the organization of a family. These matters are good, and those who do not have the Lord Jesus are helped by them. We all need to maintain order in the country, to behave ourselves properly in society, and to be a decent and upright member in our family; however, these things are organizational. Therefore, in the church we do not talk about cultivating the self, putting the family in order, ruling the country, or living peacefully in the world. Instead, our focus is on exercising our spirit to walk according to the Spirit. Instead of being organizational, we should be organic. Those who are unsaved do not have the Lord, the Triune God, the divine dispensing, or the inward moving and anointing of the Spirit. Those who are saved have these items. We are different from the unbelievers in that we have the Triune God, who is the dispensing God, the anointing God, the operating God, and the sealing God. We have such a mysterious God in us.</p>
<p>The church is not an organization but a Body, an organism. Having the Triune God as our life is what makes this organism distinct. This is true in the church meetings, in our daily life, and in our family situations. When we love our wives, submit to our husbands, or take care of our children, it seems as if we are only cultivating ourselves and putting our family in order, but in fact, having received mercy from the Lord, we are following the inward operation of the Triune God. When a husband speaks to his wife, he should not have the thought, &ldquo;Since I am the head, you must listen to me.&rdquo; Such a thought is organizational. A husband should only have the feeling that the Triune God is in him and that he has to speak according to the operation of the Triune God. This is organic.</p>
<p>When we speak, every part of our body is active. This is organic. If we are organizational, our activities will be organized, and we will be an organization, an organized entity. We must learn to be organic in our service.</p>
