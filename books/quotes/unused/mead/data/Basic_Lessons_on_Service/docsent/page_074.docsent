   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE INCENSE SHOULD BE BURNED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEFORE THE LORD WITH THE FIRE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>FROM THE ALTAR OF BURNT OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Leviticus 16:12 tells us that the incense should be burned before the Lord with the fire from the altar of burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is by this fire that the two altars, the incense altar and the burnt offering altar, are linked together.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The burnt offering altar was for the sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The incense altar was for the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the fire linked these two altars together.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to the Pentateuch, this fire that burned all the offerings on the brass altar came from the heavens Lev 9:24; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1 Chron 21:26; 2 Chron 7:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was not a fire started by man; it was the fire that came from God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And that fire, from the time that it came, never ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fire burned all the time, day after day, from evening until morning Lev 6:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That fire was holy fire, not strange fire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>THE FIRE ON THE ALTAR OF BURNT OFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BURNS OUT ALL THE NATURAL</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AND NEGATIVE THINGS BEFORE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fire on the altar of burnt offering burns out all the natural and negative things before God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It burns everything into ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Anything that can ascend to God must first be burned at the altar with the divine fire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whatever has been burned on the altar with the divine fire will be accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus, to burn the incense before God at the incense altar, the fire that comes down from God is needed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This divine fire, which burns out all the natural and negative things, is needed for our service.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE STRANGE FIRE SIGNIFIES</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE NATURAL ENTHUSIASM</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The strange fire signifies the natural enthusiasm Lev 10:1 not dealt with by the cross and not in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we have to stress and develop what it means for us to be dealt with by the cross in our enthusiasm so that we can serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to be in resurrection, we have to pass through the dealing of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not bring in our natural hotness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whether it is good or bad, pure or impure, it is still natural.</S>
