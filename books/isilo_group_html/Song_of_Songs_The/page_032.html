Hair&#151;Signifying Consecration and Obedience</H2><P>Hair is only briefly mentioned in the Bible. With Samson, hair signifies consecration. Keeping his hair signified that he reserved all that he had for God's use. This is why he was powerful (Judg. 16:17). Our consecration before God determines our power before men. The amount of consecration we have before God and the degree of the perfection and purity of the consecration determines the amount of power we will have before men. A sanctifying consecration is the basis of all strength. Another significance of hair in the Bible is covering. A woman's hair and the Nazarite's hair convey this sense. It means standing in the position of obedience, covering up that which is of man, that which is natural and fleshly, and allowing God to be expressed.</P><P>"Thy hair is as a flock of goats, that appear from mount Gilead." Most goats are white. Mount Gilead is a place with many goats and much grass (Jer. 50:19; Micah 7:14). Goats are used in the Bible as sin offerings. The hair of the maiden is as a flock of goats beside Mount Gilead. This is a symbol; it means that she is well fed and ready to be offered up as an offering. Where is our consecration and obedience manifested? It is manifested at the place where we receive God's feeding and food. Both the feeding and the food are for the purpose of consecration. This is where our power lies, and this is where our obedience lies.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Teeth&#151;Signifying the Power of Receiving</H2><P>The teeth are for chewing food. This is not a matter of food itself, but a matter of receiving food. God has shown us in the Bible that He has given us different kinds of food. This verse shows us the power of receiving different kinds of food. Symbolically speaking, the power of receiving does not belong to babes, but to grown-ups, because only grown-ups have teeth.</P><P>"Thy teeth are like a flock of sheep that are even shorn, which came up from the washing; whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them." Why does it say "a flock of sheep"? It is because only sheep eat grass. There is something within a person that is of Christ; therefore, one is able to receive God's food. Only that which matches the Christ within will take in that which comes out of Christ.</P><P>In the Bible sheep's wool denotes the fleshly life, or the fleshly zeal. When a priest entered the Holy of Holies, he was not allowed to wear anything that was made of wool (Ezek. 44:17). In the Bible the righteousness that Christ gives to us through the Holy Spirit is symbolized by white linen. The natural life of the saints has been removed by the cross. Therefore, this verse says that the maiden's teeth are like a flock that has been shorn. It means that her power of reception is no longer motivated by natural strength. In pursuing after the Lord, in receiving His grace, and in our study of the Bible, we must not exercise fleshly zeal. Exercising our own strength and following our own ways is having teeth that are disapproved of by the Lord. The shorn flock is also washed; it is clean and orderly. The washing signifies that the goal of the maiden's pursuit is the cleansing.</P><P>"Whereof every one bear twins, and none is barren among them." This means orderliness. It means that the power of reception is uniform throughout. One does not reject some things and receive other things. One does not possess faith in spiritual things, but no faith in material things. If one only receives certain truths, or if he cannot have faith in material things, his teeth do not bear twins, and some of them are barren. Bearing twins and not being barren is receiving in a full way. Our natural teeth are always in pairs. The maiden's teeth bearing twins means that her receiving power is even and uniform throughout.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_031.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_033.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Song of Songs &nbsp; pg 32</div><br></body></html>
