   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BABEL, ORDINANCES, AND DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The primary source of the divisions among Christians throughout the centuries has been ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may trace these ordinances all the way back to the time of Babel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God s intention in His creation of man was for mankind to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was the reason that He created just one man, not a multitude of men.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s desire was to have one corporate man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, as a result of Babel, mankind was divided into nations, into a number of different peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Between these nations, these peoples, there are many differences.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Not only are there differences in a general way between the Jews and the Gentiles, but there are also differences among the various nationalities, for example, between the Chinese and the Japanese, and between the Germans and the French.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>These differences have created divisions, and divisions are related to ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>From the time of Babel, mankind has been divided by ordinances concerning the ways of living and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The source of this dividing work is the subtlety of the enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through ordinances Satan has spoiled the oneness of the humanity created by God for the fulfillment of His purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Humanly speaking, it is not possible for the oneness of divided mankind to be restored.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although there is such an international organization as the United Nations, it is a fact that the nations are far from united.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>On the contrary, they are divided by ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One of the main elements of ordinances is language.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As we all know, the division of the peoples at Babel was related to differences of language.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, a primary element of ordinances is language.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we can overcome the difficulty presented by language, a great part of our problem with ordinances will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>On the day of Pentecost God Himself did something very significant concerning language.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Peoples of different languages were saved and brought into oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On that day the divisions caused by language were overcome, and the church as the one new man came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For the church to be the new man means that the church is a new mankind, a new humanity, a new human race.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The old humanity God had created for Himself had become divided by ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But on the day of Pentecost the church came into being as the new man, the new humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE MAIN CAUSE OF DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, throughout the centuries ordinances have crept in to divide Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Especially from the time of the Reformation Christians have been divided by ordinances concerning practices.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some Christians have made baptism by immersion an ordinance.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>With this ordinance as their basis, they have formed the Baptist denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Others have done the same thing with respect to their belief about presbytery or eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With an ordinance related to eldership as their basis, they have formed the Presbyterian denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kind of thing has occurred again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The main reason Christians are divided is the ordinances concerning different religious practices.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is possible to have an ordinance about any practice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, we may have an ordinance about pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although we find pray-reading helpful, we should not make an ordinance concerning it or insist that others practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Either to impose pray-reading on others or to oppose the practice of pray-reading is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No matter how much life supply you receive through pray-reading, do not make an ordinance about pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, do not allow your local church to become a pray-reading church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In other words, do not insist that all who attend the meetings practice pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>To insist on pray-reading in this way is to be divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is the tendency of Christians to create ordinances related to those practices which they personally find helpful.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For this reason, there are ordinances about practices such as foot-washing and about speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Those who advocate speaking in tongues may have an ordinance imposing it, but those who oppose speaking in tongues may have an ordinance forbidding it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is by ordinances like these that Christians have been divided.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, it is of vital importance that we receive all genuine Christians and not become divided over ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Christian groups sometimes adopt rather unusual practices.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>One Christian group in Taiwan has the peculiar practice of chair-shaking.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In their meetings they often kneel down, take hold of the legs of chairs, and then shake the chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They think that this is the best way to be freed from the natural mind and to be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Simply because we may not agree with this practice does not give us the ground to criticize those who do.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many of the Christians in this chair-shaking group are noted for their prevailing preaching of the gospel among the mountain people in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Furthermore, a number of professional people have been attracted to this group and then have received spiritual help.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I certainly do not oppose this chair-shaking, but I do oppose any ordinances that may be formed regarding it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>On the one hand, we may see the error of denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the other hand, we may see the truth of the ground of oneness the truth of one church in one city.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We may also have come together to meet as the church on the proper ground.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, although we may have seen the truth of the church ground and may be for this truth in a definite and practical way, we may still have our ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we do not drop these ordinances, we shall eventually have a problem concerning the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must exercise ourselves not to have any ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must admit, however, that it is not easy for us to drop them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some believers have ordinances about musical instruments.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I know of a certain Brethren assembly that was divided over the use of a piano.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Eventually, two groups came into existence, one favoring the piano and the other opposing it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Both groups were formed because of ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In the early days of the church life in Los Angeles, some saints had a problem over the playing of tambourines in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some had an ordinance in favor of tambourines, whereas others had an ordinance in opposition to it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I found myself having to fight against both kinds of ordinances in the attempt to preserve the proper oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>To one brother who strongly opposed the use of tambourines I said, Please tell me, what is the difference in the eyes of God between playing a tambourine and playing a piano?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This brother admitted that in the eyes of God there was no difference.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>But he was quick to point out that as far as he was concerned, there was a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When I said that this difference was due to his background, he agreed, but still went on to oppose the use of tambourines.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Eventually, the ordinances concerning tambourines kept a number of saints from participating in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is only one of the many illustrations we could give to prove that ordinances can ruin the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For the sake of the church life, we should not have any ordinances concerning the way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Simply be one with the church in your locality, regardless of their way of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Be one with the church simply because it is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Do not oppose any particular practice, and do not impose any practice.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Either to impose or to oppose is to bring in ordinances.</S>
