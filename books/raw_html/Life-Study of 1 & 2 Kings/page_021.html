<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. According to His Father King David's Charge</H2><P>Solomon built the temple according to his father King David's charge (1 Chron. 22:6-11). This indicates that Solomon did nothing in a light way but did everything according to his father's instructions.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. With the Materials<br>Prepared by His Father David</H2><P>Solomon built the temple with the materials prepared by his father David (1 Chron. 22:14-16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. According to the Design Given by God to David</H2><P>Solomon did not build the temple according to his wise mind. Rather, he built it according to God's own design given to David (1 Chron. 28:11-19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Materials for the Building of God's Temple<br>and All Its Furniture<br>and Their Significances in Typology</H2><P>All the materials for the building of God's temple and all its furniture have their significance in typology.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Gold</H2><P>Gold signifies God's divine nature, divinity (1 Kings 6:20-22).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Wood</H2><P>The different kinds of wood signify different aspects of Christ's humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Cedar</H2><P>Cedar signifies Christ's humanity in resurrection, the resurrected Christ (vv. 9, 10b, 15a, 16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Cypress</H2><P>Cypress signifies Christ's humanity in His death, the crucified Jesus (vv. 15b, 34).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Olive Wood</H2><P>Olive wood signifies Christ's humanity in the Spirit of God, the anointed Christ (vv. 23, 31-33).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Costly Stones</H2><P>Costly stones signify Christ's humanity in transformation, the transformed Christ (vv. 7, 36; 5:17). Not only do we need transformation; Christ also needed transformation. As God, Christ in His incarnation put on man's flesh. The Word became flesh (John 1:14). Having become a man in the flesh, Christ was in the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3). He therefore needed transformation in His human part.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Bronze</H2><P>Bronze signifies Christ under God's judgment, the judged Christ (1 Kings 7:15-16, 27, 30).</P>
