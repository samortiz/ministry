   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JOHN MESSAGE THIRTY-FIVE THE ORGANISM OF THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE DIVINE DISPENSATION 3 II.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE BRANCHES LOVING ONE ANOTHER</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>TO EXPRESS THE DIVINE LIFE IN FRUIT-BEARING</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have covered the first part of John 15, verses 1 through 11, which shows the relationship between us and the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second part, verses 12 through 17, shows our relationship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this part of the chapter we see that the branches should love one another to express the divine life in fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These verses reveal that fruit-bearing has very much to do with our loving one another.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We must keep a right relationship with one another in life, that is, in love by life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must keep our relationship in love and love one another by the life that is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This life is the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Loving one another is the church life, the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Body life is a life of love and a life in love.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should not love one another with a human love but in the divine life and with the divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We are not branches of many separate trees; we are all branches of the same tree.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So we need to maintain a good fellowship with all the other branches as well as with the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is why in this chapter the Lord also tells us to love one another vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>12, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we do not love one another, it will be very difficult to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not love one another, it means that our fellowship with the vine tree has been cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, there is no way for us to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In order to bear fruit we must love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The life within all of us is one life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The life in you is exactly the same as the life in me.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This resembles the circulation of the blood in our physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The blood in our body circulates through every member of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In like manner, the inner life of all the branches is one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This life should continually circulate through all the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then all the branches will be so living and filled with the riches of life in order to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A. The Branches Being One</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although the branches are many, they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are one with the vine and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the branches together with the vine are one entity, one organism.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>B. The Branches Being in an Intimate</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Relationship with the Vine</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The branches are in an intimate relationship with the vine vv.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The branches are not the Lord s slaves; they are His friends.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because they are the Lord s friends, the branches can know the Father s desire that He be expressed in a corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>C. The Branches Being Chosen and Appointed</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>to Bear Remaining Fruit</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The branches have been chosen and appointed to bear remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In verse 16 the Lord said, You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain; that whatever you ask the Father in My name, He may give you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The King James Version uses the word ordained instead of appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I like the term ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all have been ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To be ordained means to be appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Ordained is an old-fashioned word for the modern word appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All of the sisters, including the younger sisters, must realize that they have been ordained.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Do you know that we all have been ordained?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have been ordained to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Do not say that you are too young for this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Regardless of how young you may be, you have been chosen and ordained to bear remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In this chapter there are four ways of referring to the fruit: bearing fruit v. 2 , much fruit v. 8 , more fruit v. 2 , and remaining fruit v. 16 . How long the fruit remains depends on how much life we impart into it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It all depends upon the amount of life we impart into the new converts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This determines how long they will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Often in bringing people to the Lord we impart into them only a small amount of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, they scarcely remain.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is difficult for them to remain for a longer time.</S>
