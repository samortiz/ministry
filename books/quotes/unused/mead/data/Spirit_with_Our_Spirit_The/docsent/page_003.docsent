   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In this series of messages, we are still on the general subject of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order for us to experience the Christian life, we surely need to know God, the Lord, Christ, as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Also, we have to know that for us to enjoy this Spirit, we have a spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>From my youth I have loved the Bible, and I have studied it for years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I have found that we can study the Bible in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>One way is to study it according to the letter and another way is to study it in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Paul said, "The letter kills, but the Spirit gives life" 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We want to know the Lord's word, not just by the letter but by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The unique writer of the Bible is the Spirit 2 Pet 1:21; 2 Sam 23:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Throughout the years we have released many messages on the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But we have the burden once again to see the Christian life from its very foundation, and the foundation of the Christian life is the Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The general subject of this series of messages is not "The Spirit and Our Spirit" but "The Spirit with Our Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not use the conjunction and but the preposition with.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 8:16 says, "The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>With is a preposition, and it is instrumental.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we say the Spirit and our spirit, this is a compound subject.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our spirit is not the subject and should not be the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our spirit is the helper.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If I do things with you, you are not the subject but the instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You are my helper.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our spirit is not the subject.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The subject must be the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I. THE MEANING OF THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>SPIRIT IN THE BIBLE A. The Hebrew Equivalent</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>of the Word Spirit Is Ruach,</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Denoting Spirit, Breath, or Wind</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Ezekiel 37 the Hebrew word ruach is used to refer to the Spirit v. 1 , breath v. 5 , and wind v. 9 . The way in which ruach is translated depends on the context of the sentence or paragraph.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. The Greek Equivalent of the Word Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Is Pneuma, Denoting Spirit, Breath, or Wind</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the New Testament, the Greek word pneuma may be translated also as Spirit John 3:5-6 , breath Rev 11:11 , or wind John 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We know that pneuma is the wind in John 3:8 because "the wind blows."</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The word breath here is also the Greek word pneuma.</S>
