   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED FORTY-ONE THE SANCTIFICATION OF AARON AND HIS SONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE THE PRIESTS 9 Scripture Reading: Exo 29:29-46</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have seen a clear picture of the steps by which Aaron and his sons were sanctified to serve God as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First they were washed, then they were clothed, and after that they were satisfied by having their emptiness filled.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They were washed with water, they were clothed with the priestly garments, and they were satisfied with holy food.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These three categories of things the water, the garments, and the food, the offerings are all types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After Aaron and his sons had been washed, clothed, and satisfied, they were ready to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In other words, they were ready to minister food to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We may say that the priests were waiters bringing food to God and serving it to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They did not serve God anything other than the proper food for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>MINISTERING FOOD TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually the sanctification described in Exodus 29 includes four steps.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The first three steps, being washed, being clothed, and being satisfied, took care of the need of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The fourth step, ministering Christ to God as food for God s satisfaction, was related to God s need.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To be a priest is to serve God, to minister Christ to Him for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, being a priest involves three steps related to the priests themselves and another step related to God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that even after Aaron and his sons had been washed, clothed, and satisfied, they were not yet qualified to serve as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They still needed the offerings with which to serve God, offerings to be ministered to God as food.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only when this step had been accomplished was their sanctification completed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As God s people, we all have been redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, being redeemed is not sufficient to qualify us to serve God as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At most, redemption gives us the right and the position to be sanctified to serve God as priests.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, after redemption, we need sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This sanctification comprises four steps: being washed, being clothed, being satisfied, and serving God with food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this message we shall consider the fourth and last step.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In chapter twenty-nine of Exodus the most difficult matter to grasp is that of the priests serving God with food for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In contrast, it is rather easy to understand the priests being washed, clothed, and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we have pointed out, the left breast and the left shoulder of the second ram were given to the priests as their portion for their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Along with these parts of the second ram, the priests were also given bread from the basket which also contained bread for God s food.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, the priests could enjoy both meat and bread.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This can be compared to the Lord Jesus using five loaves and two fishes to feed the multitude.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In both cases the people were fed with meat and bread.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The priests diet, therefore, was quite simple.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When we come to ministering food to God, it is much more complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because God is not simple, serving food to Him is likewise not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, it is rather easy for a mother to prepare a meal for her child.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, the preparation would be much more complicated if the governor of the state were coming to her home for dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>She certainly could not feed him in the same way that she would feed a small child.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the same principle, feeding God is much more complicated than feeding the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>GOD S FOOD</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to be impressed with the courses, the dishes served to God as His food.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The first course was a bull for a sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was followed by two lambs a year old, fresh, young, vigorous, and full of strength.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then there was a tenth of an ephah of fine flour mingled with oil.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The quantity of oil was a fourth of a hin, that is, approximately a quart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The flour and oil were mingled to become the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Furthermore, there was a fourth of a hin of wine for a drink offering v. 40 . The quantity of wine was the same as that of the oil, a fourth of a hin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here we have three items of the animal life a bull and two lambs and three items of the plant life fine flour, oil, and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These six items may be divided into two groups: the first group consisting of the bull and the two lambs, and the second group, of the flour, the oil, and the wine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All these items were the groceries used in cooking a meal for God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order to feed Him, we need a bull, two lambs, and flour, oil, and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Years ago, I had difficulty remembering all these items, all these groceries.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I could not understand why Moses composed this section of the Word in such a puzzling way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You may need to read this chapter a number of times before all this becomes clear to you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>According to this chapter, God s food included a bull, two lambs, flour, oil, and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The amount of fine flour was a tenth of an ephah.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>An ephah equals ten omers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, a tenth of an ephah was one omer.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>According to Exodus 16, the amount of daily manna for each person was an omer.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, in quantity God s food was one bull, two lambs, a tenth of an ephah of fine flour, and the fourth of a hin each of oil and wine.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The bull was for a sin offering, and the two lambs offered with the flour, the oil, and the wine were for a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In typology, the burnt offering is God s food.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This offering is for God s satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, in order for God to eat the burnt offering we present to Him, we must first offer the sin offering.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The sin offering is not God s food, even though the inward parts and the fat were burned for His satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Therefore, we cannot say definitely that this offering was counted in the sight of God as food, but we do know that parts of the sin offering were for God s satisfaction.</S>
