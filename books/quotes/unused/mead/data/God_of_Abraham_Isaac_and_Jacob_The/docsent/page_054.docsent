   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Joy is not when we are happy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Joy is Christ living within us and being expressed as joy.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God has put His Son within us so that Christ Himself will live spontaneously out of us in all circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we are tempted by anxiety, this life will manifest itself as patience.</S>
