 <h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH SINS THOROUGHLY</h2>
<p>We also must be ones who deal with our sins thoroughly (1 John 1:9). We must be sin dealing people. We should not tolerate sin in any way. During the day our hands get dirty, and they pick up many germs spontaneously, so we have to wash them many times. If we washed our hands many times throughout the day, we would be kept from many sicknesses. In like manner, we pick up the germs of sins, of trespasses, throughout the day, so we have to learn to wash ourselves by confessing all of our faults, shortcomings, wrongdoings, and trespasses. Many times we overstep our limit. A runner in a race must keep himself within the two white lines of his lane. Otherwise, he will be disqualified. We are a trespassing people. It is so easy for us to overstep in matters, to trespass. A certain punishment in the Old Testament was not to exceed forty stripes (Deut. 25:3). It was quite possible for the person who was exacting the punishment to make an error in counting the number of stripes and overstep the limit by giving forty-one stripes. When exacting such a punishment, it was a safeguard to limit it to thirty-nine stripes, or forty stripes less one (2 Cor. 11:24). It is easy for us to overstep the limit in many matters. When we are laughing about something, we should not laugh too much. If we laugh too much, we are overstepping. When we come back to contact the Lord, our conscience will condemn us for this. If we talk too much on the telephone, this is a trespass for which we need Christ as the trespass offering. We need Christ as our trespass offering all the time.</p>
<p>Before cleaning a room, we may not realize how dirty it is. The more thoroughly that we clean it, the more dirt we will find. We must allow the Lord to search us and cleanse us thoroughly. We must deal with our sins and faults, making a thorough confession to the Lord in His light. When we confess our sins, the Lord forgives us and His blood cleanses us continually (1 John 1:7, 9). The tense of the verb &ldquo;cleanses&rdquo; in Greek in 1 John 1:7 is present and continuous. This indicates that the blood of Jesus the Son of God cleanses us all the time, continuously and constantly. The blood of Jesus is always ready for us to apply and it cleanses us all day long. Our confessing should be a daily and hourly matter. As we continually confess our sins, His blood continually cleanses us.</p>
<p>In 1935 a small number of us stayed with Brother Nee while he expounded the Song of Songs. During that time I was dealing with my mistakes, wrongdoings, and trespasses to the uttermost. A certain co-worker and I were assigned to stay together. Because of our limited facilities, we had to bring water in a basin from another place to our rooms so that we could wash ourselves. When I walked past this brother&rsquo;s bed, some drops of water from the basin I was carrying frequently fell on it. Then I had to go to him to confess and ask for forgiveness. For the first few days, he was not that disturbed by my mistakes. But later when I apologized to him again, he said, &ldquo;The worst thing is to sin and not confess. The best is to not sin. To make mistakes and apologize is in between the worst and the best.&rdquo; I was disappointed when the brother said this to me. I told the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I can never be the best. At the most I can only be in the middle. I can only make mistakes and confess.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I had been careless, I could have spilled a little water on the brother&rsquo;s bed without being bothered. But that kind of careless living or behavior kills our fellowship with the Lord. Then it is hard for us to pray a prevailing prayer. The prevailing prayer comes from our constant fellowship with the Lord, and our constant fellowship with the Lord depends upon our dealing with our sins. First John 1 tells us that &ldquo;God is light&rdquo; (v. 5). As long as we are in fellowship with Him, we are in fellowship with the light and are in the light. When we are in the light, our real situation gets exposed, and we see all of our failures. We have to confess them one by one to the Lord, asking forgiveness for item after item. Then we can have a thorough fellowship with the Lord, and we are qualified and ready to pray in a prevailing way.</p>
<p>We must have such a clearance within us if we are going to speak in the meetings or even if we are going to speak the gospel to anyone. Otherwise, our speaking will not be adequate or prevailing. When we do not have a clearance within our conscience in our fellowship with the Lord, our speaking will be reluctant. We will not have the full boldness because our conscience has been polluted. This kind of conscience is what the New Testament calls a conscience of offense. Paul said, &ldquo;I...exercise myself, to have always a conscience without offense toward God and men&rdquo; (Acts 24:16). We must keep our conscience from all kinds of offenses until we have a conscience without offense. A conscience without offense is a conscience of clearance. When we have such a conscience, we can speak not only to the Lord but also to the unbelieving sinners with boldness. We should not think that we do not need a cleared conscience to speak to sinners. Regardless of whom we speak to, as long as we are speaking the word of God, Christ, or the gospel, we need a cleared conscience. In order for us to learn to speak in the meetings, we must get ourselves cleared up and preserved in a clear condition. We must deal with our sins thoroughly.</p>
