   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MEDICINE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Self-love naturally produces self-effort.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because believers love themselves so much and do not deal with God in a basic way, they seek after the healing of earthly medicine when they are sick.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At this point we will not pass judgment on whether or not medicine should be used.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not have the time here to debate that question.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nevertheless, since the Lord Jesus prepared salvation for us on the cross, and since our body can receive His healing, it seems that if we still turn to the world to seek for medicinal assistance, it is out of ignorance, if not unbelief.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many people debate whether or not one should use medicine as if once this question is settled, all questions will be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Little do they realize that the principle of spiritual life is not a matter of whether or not something can be done, but whether or not there is God's leading and whether or not something is out of one's own activity.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, our question is: when a believer is driven by self-love to fervently seek healing and a cure in medicine, are his activities out of his own self, or are they done under the guidance of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Naturally speaking, with regard to God's salvation, man always wants to be saved through his own work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only after many dealings from God is man willing to be saved through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But is this not also true in regards to the healing of the body?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I am afraid that in the latter case, the struggle is more serious than the struggle for the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A person knows that aside from depending on the salvation of the Lord Jesus, there is no way to gain access to heaven's door.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, there are still many medical techniques that can be used for healing the body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>So why should he depend on the salvation of the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The point we want to emphasize is not whether medicine can be used, but whether our application of medicine is out of our "own" activity and whether it sets aside God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Does not the world also claim to have many ways of delivering men from sin?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Does it not have numerous philosophies, psychologies, ethics, morals, regulations, and education to advance men upward and deliver men from sin?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Do we trust in these methods for our perfection?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Are we after the salvation accomplished by the Lord Jesus on the cross, or are we after these worldly methods?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the same manner, the world also has numerous medicines to help deliver people from sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the cross, the Lord Jesus accomplished the salvation that delivers people from sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do we want to obtain healing according to human ways, or do we want to trust in the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We admit that sometimes God also manifests His power and glory through some media.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, according to biblical teaching and the experience of the believers, man's feelings have taken over all of his living since the fall, so he spontaneously trusts more in some of God's media than in God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, when a believer is sick, he pays more heed to medicine than to God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Although his mouth says that he trusts God's power, his heart is totally turned to medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It seems that without medicine, God's power will not be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this condition, there is unrest, vexation, anxiety, and panic.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He seeks for the best available source of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He does not have the peace that comes from trusting God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because medicine occupies his heart so much, he loses God's presence and turns to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Consequently, the sickness which was meant to turn him to a closer relationship with God turns him away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Perhaps some people can use medicine without being harmed by it.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But I am afraid that such people are rare.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The majority of believers cannot use medicine without damaging their spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They always consider the media more important than God's power.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is an enormous difference between being healed by medicine and being healed by trusting in God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The power of medicine is simply natural, while the power of God is divine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The ways to obtain these two kinds of healings are also totally different.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The healing that comes from medicine depends on man's intelligence, while the healing that comes from trusting in God depends on the merit and life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even when a doctor, who is a believer, asks God to grant him wisdom and bless the drugs that he uses, he still cannot give the healed ones a spiritual blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Unconsciously, the patient allows his heart to turn to medicine more than to the Lord's power.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even though his body may be healed, his spiritual life is greatly damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a believer trusts in God, he does not need medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He needs only to commit himself to God's love and power.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He should examine the source of his own sickness before God and see where he has displeased God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Consequently, when he is eventually healed, he will not only derive benefit for his body but also receive blessing in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Most believers regard medicine as something given by God and therefore believe that they can use it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, we want to pay attention to whether one uses the medicine according to God's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We will not debate whether or not medicine is given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We only want to ask: is not the Lord Jesus explicitly given by God to the believers as the Savior of their sicknesses?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Should we follow unbelievers in the world or believers who are weak in faith to seek after medicine or healing by natural means, or should we receive the Lord Jesus whom God has prepared and fully trust in His name?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Trusting in medicine and accepting the life of the Lord Jesus are two completely different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We admit that medicine can cure people.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The sciences of medicine and pharmacology have invented many ways and items to heal people's sicknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, this kind of healing is only natural, and it is not the best that God has prepared for His children.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>A believer can ask God to bless the drug and still be healed; after he is healed, he can still thank God for it and consider that God has healed him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, this way of healing is not through receiving the life of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is a sign of a believer who has left the battle of faith for convenience' sake.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If the whole goal of our struggle with Satan in sickness is to obtain a cure, any kind of healing is sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if we are trying to accomplish something more important than mere healing, we have no choice but to remain quietly before God and wait for His way and His time.</S>
