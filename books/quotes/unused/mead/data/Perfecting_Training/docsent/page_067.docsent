   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord, we believe that You are with us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You are really one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Lord, we are here waiting on You.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We don t like to do anything apart from You.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Lord, do touch every heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Oh, do sober every mind and do open up every spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Lord, we believe that we are one in You.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We are one in You in one goal with one direction.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Lord, here You do have the best oracle on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thank You, Lord, You have so many saints as an oracle for You to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Oh, Lord, speak to us Your heart, and bring us all into Your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Lord, we need such a heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lord, we don t like to stay here on this earth; we like to be with You in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Oh, bring us all into the heavenlies, into Your heart, even, Lord, into Your desire.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Oh, show us the way and grace us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How much we need Your grace!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Lord, we pray again that You would cover us with Your prevailing blood against any attacks of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>And hide us in You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord, You know this is a battle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We trust in You, and we look unto You, and we believe that You are coming down to visit every one.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Lord, thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>No meeting is in vain, and no word spoken is in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do strengthen us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Strengthen our fellowship; strengthen our conversation; strengthen our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In Your precious name, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Bible is too all-inclusive, too deep, and too profound.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Romans is the first book among all the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We know that there are only five books out of twenty-seven in the New Testament which are not Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All of the twenty-two books from Romans through Revelation are Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even Revelation is an Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Romans is the first of all these Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once again I would like to give you a little sketch of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of the twenty-seven books of the New Testament, five are at the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Actually, these five are just a kind of biography of one Person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Even the book of Acts is a part of this biography.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Matthew is a part; Mark is a part; both Luke and John are parts of the biography of the Son of God, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And Acts is a continuation of this biography.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This biography is not finished at the end of the Gospel of John because that section of the four Gospels only gives us the first section of this universal man s biography the section on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But this man now is not on this earth; He is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Yet this heavenly man is still continuing to work on this earth through a channel.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Later, we will see what this channel is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For now, you need to pick up the word channel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This heavenly man was walking, living, and working on the earth for thirty-three and a half years as a little man, a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then He ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then He began to move from the heavens on this earth continually in a channel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What is the channel on the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The first five books are a complete biography of the all-inclusive man, Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The channel, which is His Body, through which He continues His ministry from the heavens on the earth, needs twenty-two books to define it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>All of the twenty-two Epistles are definitions of this channel.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>THE FOCUS OF ROMANS</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Most Christian teachers teach that the book of Romans is a sketch of the Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yes, it is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But I m sorry to say that perhaps not one of so many teachers has ever said what is the ultimate focus of the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Most of the Bible students and teachers would consider that the main subject of the book of Romans is justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Martin Luther stressed this book to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Martin Luther was very strong on justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But at least there is one book with one verse which says that justification is not only by faith, but also by works James 2:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This offended Martin Luther because he was so strong for justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>So he said the book of James should be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I don t blame him because he was so burdened at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He concentrated his entire being on this one thing justification by faith, not by works.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>While he was quite strong concerning justification by faith, I would say that he didn t stress much concerning the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Body is more clearly revealed in the book of Romans than in many other books.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Whether Martin Luther saw the Body in Romans or not I don t know, but I do know he did not stress it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>All the Christians know that Martin Luther was a strong teacher and minister of justification by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He may have seen something concerning the Body, but that was not his stress.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Now, however, we all have to see that justification by faith is just the first station of this book of Romans.</S>
