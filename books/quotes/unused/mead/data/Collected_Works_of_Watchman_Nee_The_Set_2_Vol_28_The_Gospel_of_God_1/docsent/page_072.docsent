   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FUNCTION OF FAITH SUBSTANTIATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Perhaps you may ask, "Why would the Holy Spirit communicate to us all of God's work in His Word when we believe in this Word?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The words in 1 John that we just read tell us what faith is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That is the work of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But what is the function of faith?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The function of faith is the substantiation of the Lord's work in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is what Hebrews 11 shows us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hebrews 11:1 says, "Now faith is the substantiation of things hoped for."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The King James Version translates this word as the noun "substance," but in the original language it is not a noun but a gerund, a verbal noun.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Darby's translation renders it "substantiating."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is not a noun but a gerund from a verb.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This kind of gerund is used often.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For example, in the church there is the "overseeing" by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This overseeing is not a noun but a gerund.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"Substantiating" is also used in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Faith is a substantiating.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not underestimate this translation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I have been looking for ten years without finding a suitable word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then, when I discovered Darby's use of "substantiating," I think I came across the best translation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Everything in the world, whether animals, plants, or minerals, has to be substantiated by us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>While we live on the earth, we are constantly substantiating things around us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>My eyes substantiate every sight and color.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>While I am speaking here, some brothers and sisters who are hard of hearing do not know what I am talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They only see my mouth moving.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have the words, but they lack the substantiating.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have the substance, but they do not have the power of substantiating it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They cannot substantiate my word in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If there were a singer or some wonderful music here, I could substantiate it with my ears.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When our hands touch something, we know that it is smooth or coarse.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our nose can identify a good or a bad smell.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our tongue can identify a sweet or a salty taste.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All these are substantiations.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the organs in the human body are doing the work of substantiating.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Faith is not making something out of nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Faith is substantiating what is there.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Faith is not daydreaming or the speaking of a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Faith is to manifest what is there already.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is why Hebrews says that faith is the substantiating of things hoped for.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The word "things" should be translated "substance."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Although they cannot be seen, it does not mean that they are not there.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The greatest problem of man today is that he does not have the substantiating ability.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As a result, he doubts the reality of the things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If you tell a person who has lost his taste buds to take a sweet drink, he will say that it tastes like some soy sauce he just drank.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is to have the substance without the substantiation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the spiritual things are there.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God has placed all His works in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you have faith, you will substantiate them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We who are preaching the gospel are not preaching nonexistent things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The problem today is that many will not substantiate them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Christ I am full of substance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But many would not substantiate these things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Tonight we have two brothers here who cannot see.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I can say that this book is black and that book is brown.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When they touch these books, the two are the same to them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You can tell that one is black and another is brown because you can see, but to them there is no distinction between black and brown.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If they ask me what black is, I can only say that black is black.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I cannot explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is no way to explain it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What is the difficulty?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The difficulty lies in their lack of the substantiating ability.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is the same way with us before God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many are like deaf or blind people.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When you talk to them about spiritual things, they say that they do not feel this or that.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They have no way to substantiate those things.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, what is faith?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The apostle told us clearly that the function of faith is to substantiate the spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Something was not there with you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Now it is there.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today we are living in a physical world, but God has put all the spiritual things in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Word of God is full of the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Do not take the Word of God that lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Even eternity is in the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>What is the function of faith?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The function of faith is to manifest spiritual things in the same way that eyes manifest shapes and colors, ears manifest sounds, and the nose manifests smells.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Faith manifests spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is why God wants us to have faith.</S>
