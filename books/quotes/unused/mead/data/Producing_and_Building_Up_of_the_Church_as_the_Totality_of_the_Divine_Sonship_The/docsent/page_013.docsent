   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Through His Indwelling,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ Applying to Us All</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>That He Has Accomplished through</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>His Death, Resurrection, and Ascension</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now this Christ has come to indwell our being to be our life Col 3:4 , and by His indwelling He applies to us all that He accomplished through His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may compare the application of Christ s death, resurrection, ascension, and indwelling to typesetting and printing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In order to print something, we first need to set the type and make a plate.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Once this is done, we can apply the type to many sheets of paper through the process of printing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The image on every printed page is the same as that on the plate.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ has accomplished the typesetting by His death, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now He has come into us to print, to impress into us, all that He has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this way He fully, thoroughly, and wholly makes us copies of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is accomplished by the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We do not need religious or ethical teachings that use verses from the Bible in a wrong and natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To teach husbands to love their wives seems to be according to Ephesians 5:25, but this verse is used mostly in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The context of this verse includes verse 18, which says that we need to be filled with the Triune God in our spirit; then we will have an overflow of the inner life, which will include the proper love for our wife.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 22 says, Wives, be subject to your own husbands.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This verse seems to teach a onefold submission.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Confucius taught a threefold submission, in which an unmarried woman submits to her father, a married woman submits to her husband, and a widow submits to her son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nevertheless, that is still human submission.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not gold ; it is man-made brick formed from clay.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The submission of the wives and the love of the husbands that are revealed in the Bible are not merely human.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are not the ethical submission and love taught by Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, they come from the overflow of the infilling of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This demonstrates that the traditional teachings in Christianity are according to the human, religious, ethical concept.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such teachings utilize the Bible in a wrong way without a proper vision.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we see the vision that the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ is dwelling in us, He will be not only the supplying Christ but also the killing Christ to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we are unhappy with our wife, the killing Christ who lives in us will cut off our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We do not need anyone to remind us to behave properly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The indwelling Christ bothers us within.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This indwelling Christ is not the eternal Word before passing through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather, He is the Word who became flesh, tasted human life, passed through death and resurrection, and is now in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, He is constituted with divinity as the nature of God, humanity as the nature of man, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, including the headship over all things, and many other items.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All these are included in Him to become His constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may compare this to an all-inclusive dose of medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One dose of Christ takes care of our every need.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Everything is included in the indwelling Christ as the all-inclusive dose.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Indwelling Christ Being the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The indwelling Christ today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some are offended by this teaching and consider it heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They say that Christ is the Son, the second person of the Godhead, and therefore we should not say that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, the Bible says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b , and the Lord is the Spirit 2 Cor 3:17a .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Both the last Adam and the Lord are Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection, the Lord became the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As the eternal Word, Christ became flesh to be the Lamb of God John 1:29 , and He died on the cross to solve all the problems in the universe and to deal with all the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then He, as the one grain of wheat, resurrected to produce the many grains, and He ascended to the heavens to bring all His members with Him and to afford, furnish, and equip them for their functions in His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Now as such a One, He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We do not care for the traditional doctrines concerning the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We care only for the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>OUR BEING JOINED TO THE LORD AS ONE SPIRIT Being Joined to the Lord and</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Being Filled in Spirit by Drinking the Lord</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are a regenerated spirit, and our Redeemer, Savior, and Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Moreover, 1 Corinthians 6:17 says, He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We all must see that the two spirits, our regenerated human spirit and the Lord as the life-giving Spirit, are joined as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our spirit has been regenerated and has become our person; hence, we are now a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our Redeemer Christ has become a life-giving Spirit, and now we and He, He and we, are joined as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, we may still not be filled in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Because we may still have too little of Christ, Ephesians 5:18 tells us, Do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Wine is for the physical body, but the Lord as the heavenly wine is for our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to be filled in our spirit with the heavenly wine by drinking the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We do not need religious, moral, or ethical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need the proper teachings that are full of revelation, revealing to us who Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This revelation is apprehended by us in our regenerated spirit 1:17; 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Being Strengthened into Our Inner Man</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>by the Indwelling Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>That Christ May Make His Home in Our Heart</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Ephesians 3:16 says, That He would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We all need to be strengthened into our inner man; that is, we need to be filled in our inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We may compare our inner man to a tire.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If a tire is flat, it needs to be filled up.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Moreover, a flat tire is weak, but when it is filled, it becomes strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Our regenerated spirit, our inner man, needs to be filled, and this filling is the strengthening.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>To be strengthened into our inner man results in Christ making His home in our heart, which is the composition of all the parts of the soul the mind, the will, and the emotion plus the first part of the spirit, the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When our inner man, our regenerated spirit, is strengthened by being filled with Christ, Christ makes His home in our mind, emotion, will, and conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This means that Christ spreads from our spirit into our inward parts.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Christ settles in our inner being, causing it to be possessed by and saturated with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is the indwelling, the printing, of the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Eventually, this indwelling, this inward printing, will make us exactly the same as He is.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Our mind, will, emotion, and conscience will be the same as Christ s. Our whole being will be possessed, taken over, by Christ and saturated, permeated, and infused with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We are now in the process of being transformed by the indwelling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We all need to pray, Lord, show me this vision, and help me to enter into the realization of such a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Lord, strengthen me into my inner man that You may make Your home in every part, every corner, and every avenue of my inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We should forget our old, religious prayers and pray in this way for a heavenly vision and a genuine realization of the indwelling of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then daily we will gradually be taken over, possessed, permeated, and infused with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is an inner transformation through the working of the indwelling Christ as the Spirit to make us an exact copy of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The entire New Testament is filled with the revelation of this indwelling Christ.</S>
