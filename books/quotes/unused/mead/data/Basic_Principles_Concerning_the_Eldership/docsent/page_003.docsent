   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROBLEMS WITH HUMAN KINGSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to change our concept concerning human kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Samuel 8:4-9 says,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the elders of Israel gathered together and came to Samuel at Ramah.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>And they said to him, You are now old, and your sons do not follow in your ways.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Appoint now for us a king to judge us like all the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But the matter displeased Samuel when they said, Give us a king to judge us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then Samuel prayed to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And Jehovah said to Samuel, Listen to the voice of the people according to all that they have said to you; for it is not you whom they have rejected, but they have rejected Me from being King over them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Like all the deeds that they have done since the day that I brought them up out of Egypt to this very day by forsaking Me and serving other gods, so they do also to you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now therefore listen to their voice, but you shall solemnly warn them and declare to them the practice of the king who will reign over them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verses 19 and 20 say, But the people refused to listen to the voice of Samuel, and they said, No; but there will be a king over us, that we also may be like all the nations, and that our king may judge us and go out before us and fight our battles.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The thought to have a king to judge us and go out before us and fight our battles has existed among God s people for many centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God does not want to have a human king among His people, because once a king comes in, the headship of God is usurped.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God wants to have only the apostles, prophets, and elders as His sent ones, His spokesmen, and the leading ones among His people, for these do not usurp His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, according to their fallen nature, God s people desired to have a king like the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even today we like to have a king because it is convenient.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If there is a king, we do not need to do anything since the king does everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In one sense, no one likes to have a king, because we do not like to be ruled by anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, in another sense, we all like to have a king to do things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A leading brother from another country recently asked me whether he should stay in the United States for a training or return to his locality to take care of an upcoming conference there.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By asking me this, he was making me his king.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He wanted me to make the decision so that he would not be bothered and could rest.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I refuse to be such a king.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I prayed for the brother and told him, You must go to the Lord and pray until you are clear about what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is people s laziness, or indolence, that causes them to be willing to have a king.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The elders of the children of Israel did not want to be bothered with their responsibilities of judging and fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They saw that the nations had kings who did everything for them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In past turmoils many saints in the local churches were deceived mainly because they were lazy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many did not exercise their spirit, which is the gift of God, but preferred to rest and rely on someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This kind of idleness gives an ambitious person the opportunity to become a king who promises to do everything and make all the decisions.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may accept such a one because we prefer to rest and leave the responsibility to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the principle of having a human king.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When elders ask me to come to their locality or send someone to help them, I often decline their request.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Such elders are like mothers who ask others to come to their home to help them cook.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Each mother must cook for her own family.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If she does not prepare the food well, her family can still eat it, and she will learn from her mistakes so that her cooking will improve.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must drop our concept of needing someone to come and help us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If the leading ones in a local church always ask for help from others, that local church will not be strong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The churches do not need a king; the elders are good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God has no intention to have a human king among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE ELDERS BEING THE BASIC FACTOR</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>OF GOD S ADMINISTRATION AMONG HIS PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The basic category of persons in God s administration is the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can see this concept in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The elders of the children of Israel already existed before Moses was raised up as the first apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should not rely entirely on the apostles and prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The apostles are sent by God to accomplish something, and the prophets speak for God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, those who administrate directly among God s people are the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, the elders are the basic factor of God s administration among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The elders of Israel became lazy and idle, preferring the convenience of the kingship according to the custom of the nations vv.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Christian denominations today follow this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For the sake of convenience, the members of a denomination donate money to hire a pastor as a king to do everything for them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This offends God s headship.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The elders in the local churches may be capable and strong, but they must be careful not to become kings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The eldership does not offend God s headship, but if anyone becomes a king, this offends God s headship.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The thought of a human king is altogether offensive to God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In 1 Samuel 8 the elders request for a king greatly displeased God, who told Samuel, It is not you whom they have rejected, but they have rejected Me from being King over them v. 7 . This indicates that although the apostles, prophets, and elders are part of God s administration, the kingship should be kept for God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The apostles, prophets, and elders do not interfere with, offend, or usurp the kingship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, when God s people bring in a king, this is a direct offense against God s kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The apostles, prophets, and elders must be careful to keep the kingship for God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The principle of keeping the kingship and headship uniquely for God is consistent throughout the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the reason the Lord told His disciples, Do not be called Rabbi, for One is your Teacher, and you are all brothers Matt 23:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Christ alone is our Teacher, Master, Leader, and King.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Peter exhorts the elders, Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not under compulsion but willingly, according to God;...nor as lording it over your allotments but by becoming patterns of the flock 1 Pet 5:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The elders should shepherd and oversee the flock, but they should not be lords.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To be a lord interferes with God s kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We must see that in God s economy for His administration, He desires to keep the kingship uniquely for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we prefer to be idle and have someone else do everything for us for the sake of convenience, this will open the door for a king to come in, just as Saul came in as a king among the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The elders especially should not be idle or take the way of convenience.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They need to be diligent and willing to bear the burdens.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In order to receive God s blessing, we must not open the door for a king to come in, nor should we desire to be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The Bible clearly reveals that God does not want to have a human king in His administration, because He does not want anyone to replace Him by usurping His headship and kingship.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The headship and kingship must be left to God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God sends His apostles and establishes His prophets and the elders among His people, but He has no desire for there to be a king.</S>
