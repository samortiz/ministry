<P>The first month is the time of Christ's working, and the second month is the time of the Spirit's working. After this there is a gap, a period with no feasts. Then in the seventh month there are feasts again. All the things of redemption begin with the Feast of the Passover. Closely following the Feast of the Passover is the Feast of Unleavened Bread. No one can keep the Passover without putting away the leaven. Three days after the Feast of the Passover is the Feast of the Firstfruits. What is offered in this feast? A sheaf (not a single stalk) of the firstfruits is to be waved before God (Lev. 23:10-11). Therefore, in Jerusalem many believers came out of the tombs after the Lord's resurrection (Matt. 27:53). At the death of Christ, many bodies of the saints who had fallen asleep were raised (v. 52) because the Lord had overcome the power of death. After the Lord's resurrection, they came out of the tombs. This is the "spoil" mentioned in Isaiah 53:12, indicating the glory of victory. The Feast of Pentecost refers to the descending of the Holy Spirit. It is what the two loaves of bread baked with leaven and offered as a wave offering typify. One of the two loaves refers to the Jews and the other to the Gentiles. The Feast of Pentecost has already begun, and we are enjoying the accomplishment of Pentecost. The Feast of Pentecost has not ended yet; it will go on until the Feast of Propitiation. This is like the case of the new covenant. In the future God will make a new covenant with the children of Israel, but today we are already enjoying the blessing of the new covenant. The Feast of the Blowing of Trumpets, on the one hand, is applied to the Jews, and on the other hand, is related to us. This is in the future. The Feast of Propitiation is also in the future. However, today we have a foretaste of it (Heb. 6:5). The Feast of Tabernacles refers to leaving the houses and rejoicing and points to the millennium. It is still temporary, not eternal.</P><P>Concerning the wheat, there are four steps mentioned in Leviticus 23. First, there are the firstfruits, referring to the Lord's resurrection. (In the Bible many were resurrected, but the Lord was ordained to be the Firstborn from among the dead.) "Firstfruits" implies that others are not ripened yet. Hence, firstfruits are reaped first. Second, in the Feast of Pentecost the loaves of bread as firstfruits refer to those who are raptured first, that is, before the great tribulation. Third, there is the general harvest; this is the rapture after the great tribulation. Fourth, there is the gathering of the gleanings after the harvest; this refers to the rapture of the fragments.</P><P>Matthew 13 records a comparison between wheat and tares, showing that their ends are different. Revelation 14 and Leviticus 23 record a comparison between different kinds of wheat, showing that their ends also are different. Although all are wheat, they are harvested at different times. Some say that all will be raptured together before the great tribulation. They are merely trying to comfort themselves. Otherwise, the Lord should have said, "Blessed are you because you are the wheat. You do not have to watch or endure." If the requirement for rapture is not the maturity in life, then all the warnings are meaningless.</P><P>Wheat needs to be dried; it is different from grapes, which need water. Therefore, it needs sunshine. At the time of harvest, the standard for harvest is the amount of water. When the stalks and roots are all dried up, then they can be reaped. We are all wheat, so we must be dried up; that is, we must not love the pleasures of this earth. Mr. Panton once said that wheat dries toward the earth as it ripens toward heaven. Sunshine signifies the grace of tribulation, while the dew signifies the grace of blessing. Sunshine helps the wheat to grow and ripen; it causes the wheat to be dried and not to love the world. Furthermore, wheat is an annual plant. The earth is not our permanent dwelling place; it is our temporary place of sojourn. The wheat are ripened group after group. One martyr said, "I can give my life for another to die." Wheat has no safeguard on the earth. It does not have the thorns of roses, and it is not as strong or firm as the fig trees or as high as the vine trees. It is most tender and easily bent by the wind. God is wise in using wheat to represent the saints, the sons of the kingdom of the heavens. The Lord will see whether or not we are ripened, and then He will reap. The rapture of the believers is determined by the believers themselves.</P><P>Before the Lord's coming, the first rapture will take place, in which very few saints (the hundred and forty-four thousand mentioned in Revelation 14) will be taken before the throne, which is in heaven. These also are the loaves offered in the Holy Place at the Feast of Pentecost. Revelation 14:6-13 concerns the gospel and the warning during the great tribulation. Verses 14-16 cover the harvest. The Son of Man being on the cloud is the situation described in 1 Thessalonians 4. In Revelation 14:15, ripe in the original language means "cooked by roasting." Since the sunshine is ineffective, the Lord has to use fire—persecution and tribulation—which is more severe than sunshine to roast them until they are done, that is, ripe. Therefore, eventually the believers have to give up the world and become dried, either by the scorching of the sun or by the roasting of fire. One day you may love the world, but the world may not love you. The difference between the five foolish virgins and the five prudent virgins is merely a matter of those who are early and those who are late; in other words, which believers are ripened first? In Revelation 14:17-20 the sickle is related to the angels, and the "grapes" are the evil men (not a type of the Israelites, whose type today is the fig tree). These grapes are the slain mentioned in chapter nineteen who fall at the battle of Armageddon. What follows that is the Feast of Tabernacles (Deut. 16:13-15). The gathering of the gleanings takes place after the harvest; it signifies the rapture of the fragments. Those who are raptured first are the firstfruits; the general harvest is the rapture after the great tribulation (1 Thes. 4; 1 Cor. 15). All the wheat will be harvested; it is just that some will be reaped first and others later.</P><P>The day of the Lord's coming is near. In the last days the believers need to endeavor in three great matters: (1) the eternal life, (2) the rapture, and (3) the reward. Concerning the first thing, we thank God that He has already done it for us. He has chosen us before the foundation of the world that we might have eternal life through Christ's death. The other two things require our own preparation. Rapture is related to our living—our watchfulness, endurance, and holiness. Reward is related to our work. But this distinction is not absolute, for both are mutually related. For instance, Philip was raptured (in type) while he was working (Acts 8:39).</P>
