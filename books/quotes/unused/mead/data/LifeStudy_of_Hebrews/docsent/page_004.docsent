   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is the Christ now, the Christ today, and the Christ on the throne who is our daily salvation and moment by moment supply.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the Christ revealed in Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I love this description of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I would do my best to influence you, impress you, and even compel you to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here is a little illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Consider the chicken eggs we have for breakfast.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The outside of the egg is a shell, and inside is the reality of a chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You do not eat the shell but the reality of the chicken within the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Often a baby chicken will hatch out of the egg, leaving the eggshell behind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In such a case, no one would eat the eggshell.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You will forget about the eggshell and cast it into the trash can.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is an illustration of Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Before Christ came, Judaism was an egg.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day, the chicken came out of the egg, meaning that Christ came out of that eggshell.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Formerly, the chicken and the shell were one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At that time it was worthwhile to treasure the egg because the chicken was in the egg.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>One day Jesus was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The chicken came out of the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now the chicken is not just walking on earth or soaring in the air; he is sitting in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The chicken is there in heaven, and the shell is here on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not be so foolish as to wonder whether you must go to the chicken or remain with the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Certainly you must go to the chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not stay with the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Let me say a word to the Jewish friends who still attend the synagogue.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What you are treasuring is just the empty, broken shell.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Forget about that, cast it into the trash can, and come to the chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The chicken is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As the chicken, Christ is the life element, the life essence, and the life substance.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why were the Old Testament and Judaism so precious?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because until Christ came out of the shell, He was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now, since He has come out of the shell, you must go to the chicken and not stay with the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This principle may be applied to any religious thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Baptism is good whenever Christ is in it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But once Christ has been removed from baptism, baptism becomes a shell.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Any religious thing without Christ is a shell.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have the Lord s table every Sunday, but if it is merely a table without the Lord in it, it is a shell.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even your Bible or your Bible reading may be a shell if you do not have Christ in it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Your ministry, your preaching, and Christian work might all be shells if they are merely religious activity without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Anything that is fundamental, scriptural, religious and anything that is for God, yet which does not have Christ as its reality is a shell.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Sisters, your head covering should have Christ in it, for without Christ, your head covering is merely an empty shell.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Do not think that I am condemning just one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I condemn everything that does not have Christ in it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even my message is a shell if it does not have Christ in it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even this entire Life-study is a shell if it does not minister Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We all must see how easy it is to have the shell without the chicken.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is very easy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What is religion?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Religion is serving God, worshipping God, and behaving yourself to please God without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Worshipping God, serving God, behaving ourselves before God, all are good, but if they are void of Christ they are merely a religion.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Such worship, service, or behavior becomes religion.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only Christ is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whatever we do and whatever we are might just be a shell.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Some of these things are not even a shell, but even if they are a shell, they are nothing without Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must have Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Do you like being an elder?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>That is fine, but Christ must be in that eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you do not have Christ in your eldership, your eldership is a shell.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Whenever you are treasuring a shell, you have to cross the river and bury yourself out of that shell.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is the message of the book to the Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hebrews is a book that is one hundred percent of and for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This Christ is not a doctrinal Christ; He is a Christ today for our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hebrews 1:1-3 tells as that Christ has accomplished everything and that He is now sitting on the right hand of the Majesty on high.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Hebrews 4:14 says that He is the High Priest who has passed through the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He has not only crossed over the river, but has passed through the heavens, entering into the third heaven where the holiest of all is within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>He is there now.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Hebrews 6:20 says that He is the Forerunner.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>He has run the race, becoming the first to reach the goal.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>He was the first to enter within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Hebrews 7:26 says that He is such a High Priest because He has become higher than the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He is at the height of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Hebrews 8:1, 9:24, and 10:12 all tell us that the Christ who died is now in the heavens; yet He is present.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Oh, how we must come to contact Him!</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Forsake the shell!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Forget the shell!</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We all must touch this heavenly Christ, this present Christ, this Christ today.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He is so real, so living.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He is now supplying us with all the heavenly life, authority, and power that we might live a heavenly life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>He is not only our daily salvation but also our moment by moment supply.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He is such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We all must know and experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Forget religion!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We have the chicken!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We no longer have forms or rituals just reality.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is the content of the book of Hebrews.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>As we continue in our Life-study, we shall see the depths, the profoundness, and the richness of this book.</S>
