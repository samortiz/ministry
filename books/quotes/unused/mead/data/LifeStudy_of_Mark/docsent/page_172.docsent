   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF MARK MESSAGE FIFTY-NINE A LIFE FULLY ACCORDING TO AND FOR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY 8 Scripture Reading: Mark 8:27-31; 9:30-31; 10:32-34; John 20:31; 2 Cor 1:21-22; Gal 2:20</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Gospel of Mark is a biography of a Person who lived according to God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to understand this biography, we need to realize that every event recorded in it is meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We thank the Lord that the remainder of the New Testament, especially the Epistles of Paul, helps us to interpret the details of the Lord s biography in Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The messages given in the Life-studies of Paul s Epistles will also help us understand the significance of the Gospel of Mark as a biography of a life fully according to and for God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a previous message we pointed out that in chapter eight of Mark we have a revelation of Christ, His death, and His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Epistles of Paul also emphasize Christ with His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In fact, one verse, Philippians 3:10, covers all three: To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we see Christ the Person and also His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In recent messages we have covered the first four chapters of Mark s Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have seen that when the Lord Jesus was baptized, the Spirit of God descended upon Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>From that time onward, as recorded in chapters one and two, the Lord Jesus lived a life of preaching the gospel, teaching the truth, casting out demons, healing the sick, and cleansing the lepers.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He brought forgiveness to people, and He also brought them into the enjoyment of Himself as righteousness outwardly and life inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In addition, He brought them into His satisfaction and into liberation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Furthermore, the Lord Jesus lived in a way to be one with God, to bind God s enemy, and to deny the natural relationship and remain in the relationship of the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In chapter four the Lord reveals the significance of His living in the three foregoing chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The significance of the Lord s living is that He is the Sower sowing Himself as a seed into people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord sowed Himself into those who were touched by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By His sowing Himself as a seed into others, a kingdom was brought into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This kingdom will grow, develop, and ripen into a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>FOUR CASES OF HEALING</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In chapters one through three of the Gospel of Mark there are four cases of healing: the healing of Simon s mother-in-law, who was sick with a fever 1:30-31 ; the cleansing of the leper 1:40-45 ; the healing of the paralytic who was carried to the Lord 2:1-12 ; and the healing of the man with a withered hand 3:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These four cases describe our spiritual condition before we were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We were those who were sick of a fever, those whose temperature was abnormally high.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today every fallen human being is sick with a fever.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before we were saved, we also were lepers; we were unclean, defiled, and contaminated to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, as unsaved persons, we were paralytics.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>With respect to God, we were altogether paralyzed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because we were absolutely paralyzed, we were not able to do anything for God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As paralyzed ones, we could not walk.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also were those with a withered hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, we were sick with a fever, we were contaminated lepers, we were paralytics unable to walk, and we were those with a withered hand, unable to work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although these are separate cases in the Gospel of Mark, spiritually speaking, they describe the condition of every human being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, these cases portray the situation of a particular person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>PETER AS OUR REPRESENTATIVE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Have you ever realized that in the Gospel of Mark there is one who is our representative?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The one who represents us is Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the record in Mark, Peter was the first to be called by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After he was called, he was always taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He even took the lead to deny the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may even say that, in a sense, Peter was crucified before the Lord Jesus was.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then after the Lord s resurrection Peter s name was mentioned by the angel: But go, tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you into Galilee 16:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because in the Gospel of Mark Peter is our representative, all the cases described in this book may be taken as an aggregate and given the name of Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is significant that the first case of healing in this Gospel was the healing of Peter s mother-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In a spiritual sense, all the cases in this book are related to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This means that Peter was sick of a fever and that Peter was the blind Bartimaeus at the gate of Jericho.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Peter needed to be healed of his fever and of his blindness.</S>
