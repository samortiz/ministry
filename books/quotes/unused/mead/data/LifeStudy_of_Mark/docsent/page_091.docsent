   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RICHES AND THE COMING KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The teaching concerning riches in 10:17-31 is also related to the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, in verse 24 the Lord says, Children, how difficult it is to enter into the kingdom of God!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then in verse 25 the Lord goes on to say, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These verses indicate that what we have in 10:17-31 is not merely a story for children; what we have here is a serious word concerning the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In verse 26 we see the disciples response to the Lord s word about entering into the kingdom of God: But they were even more astounded and said among themselves, Then who can be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here we see that although the Lord was teaching about entering into the kingdom of God, the disciples minds were occupied with the matter of being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In verse 27 the Lord went on to explain, With men it is impossible, but not with God; for all things are possible with God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 28 Peter, speaking frankly, began to say to the Lord, Behold, we have left all and followed You.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I appreciate Peter s frankness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He seemed to be saying, Behold, Lord, we have left everything in order to follow You.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We left our family, our fishing boats, and even the Sea of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Doesn t this merit something?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verses 29 and 30 we have the Lord s reply: Truly I tell you, there is no one who has left house or brothers or sisters or mother or father or children or fields for My sake and for the gospel s sake but that he shall receive a hundred times as much now in this time, houses and brothers and sisters and mothers and children and fields, with persecutions, and in the coming age, eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here eternal life is not mentioned with respect to our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In this verse eternal life is a reward as our enjoyment in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the coming kingdom the overcoming believers will enjoy eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To enter into this enjoyment in the coming age is to enter into the coming kingdom and participate in its enjoyment of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now we can see that what is contained in chapter ten is related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord s word here is related to receiving the kingdom of God and, in particular, to entering into the kingdom in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THREE THINGS THAT MAY KEEP US</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>FROM ENTERING INTO THE KINGDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 10:2-31 we see three matters that may frustrate us from entering into the coming kingdom: marriage, oldness, and riches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The disciples had been brought into the way that leads into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now in chapter ten it was necessary for them to be taught concerning three things that could frustrate them from entering into the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we would enter into the coming kingdom, we need to learn to handle rightly the three matters of marriage, age, or oldness, and money.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to take care of marriage according to God s ordination, we need to keep from becoming old spiritually, and we need to handle our money in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May we be impressed with the fact that the Lord s teaching concerning these matters in chapter ten is related to entering into the kingdom of God.</S>
