Formerly in our practice, we only had one or two speakers in the meetings. Today some may think that, if we arrange to have eight to ten speakers in the meetings, we have mutuality. Actually, this is plurality, not mutuality. The ten speakers would become clergymen, and the rest of the saints would become laymen. In the church meetings, however, everyone can speak to build up the church. This is mutuality.</P><P>According to the clergy-laity system, if a question is raised in a group meeting, only the leader of the meeting is qualified to answer the question. But in the group meeting, everything is mutual. If I ask a question, someone who was baptized three days ago can answer my question. He may not be able to answer my question adequately, but whether an answer is adequate or not is a matter of degree. When I ask a question in a group meeting, the answer someone gives may be absolutely wrong. The answer may be wrong, but the activity of each one answering is right. To sit quietly in the meeting without speaking is absolutely wrong. It is better to function in a wrong way than not to function at all.</P><P>To speak in the group meeting is right, but to be silent is wrong. In a meeting in Elden Hall in 1966, I stood up and said that everyone could speak at least four words in a meeting. As I said this, I wondered what four words everyone could speak. Then I said that everyone could say, "O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah!" The Scriptures are full of the expression "O Lord," and Revelation 19:4 says that the elders and living creatures worshipped God, saying, "Amen, Hallelujah!" We can speak and sing these four words in any kind of meeting. In this way our meetings will never be silent. To sit silently does not require the exercise of our spirit, but to speak does. Our speaking in the spirit is very pleasant to the Lord. Today if our meetings are full of speaking, more people will come to the meetings. But our silence will kill the meetings, and fewer people will come.</P><P>Every kind of Christian meeting, including the group meeting, is for worship. To bow down or kneel down is not the true meaning of worship. To worship God is to enjoy God. According to John 4, to drink Him as the living water is real worship (vv. 14, 24). To drink the living water is to enjoy God.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 11: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (3) &nbsp; pg 56</div><br></body></html>
