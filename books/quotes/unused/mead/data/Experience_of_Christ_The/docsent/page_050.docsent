   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NO PREFERENCES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we practice this secret, we should not have any preference concerning what we do in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We, however, may prefer to do certain things in Him, but not other things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We hope that we could keep these things from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this regard, we are like husbands and wives who have secrets from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every husband has kept certain things from his wife, and every wife has kept certain things from her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The reason we do this is that we have our own preferences and do not want others to know about them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the matter of living by Christ we also have preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of all these preferences, we seldom turn to Him and ask Him what He wants to do in a given situation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But we need to pray, "Lord Jesus, do You want me to do this?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If so, show me Your way to do it, Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have Christ living in us, but we may not live by Him or do things in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The secret in Philippians 4 is to do all things in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The way to experience Christ is to do everything in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For more than fifty years, the Lord has been teaching me to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I still have not graduated, because l have not been that faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Sometimes I was faithful to live by Him for several days.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In those days nearly everything I did was in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But then I would become unfaithful again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Consider your Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Have you always been faithful in the matter of living by Him and doing all things in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ does not want us to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He wants to do everything for us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In a sense, we have already signed the agreement for Him to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This took place on the day we consecrated ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By consecrating ourselves to Him, we offered ourselves to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, after consecrating ourselves, we have not been faithful to live by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Rather, we have continued to live by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without exception, we all have broken our agreement.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>OUR HABIT OF BEING INDEPENDENT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The problem with doing all things in Him is not only a matter of intention, but also a matter of habit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We were born with a fallen nature, and we do not like to do things by others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is even true of little children.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The little ones may not want their mothers to feed them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They prefer to eat by themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They want to be free, liberated, and even wild.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In this country the young people are anxious to be eighteen years of age, for then they can fly away from the cage of their family.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To many, to be free means to be wild.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This illustrates the fact that by nature not one of us likes to do things by others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Because we are used to going our own way, it is often troublesome to have Christ living n us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When I preached the gospel more than forty-five years ago, I told people that we Christians had the most happy life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I asked the unbelievers to join us in this happy life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But later I no longer had the boldness to preach this way, for I learned that as a Christian my life is a life of troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I have Someone in me who is always giving me difficulty because He wants to do things differently from the way I would like to do them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Even if I should want to give up being a Christian, He would not let me go.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our problem is that we do not like to do things in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The secret of the Christian life is that another One, Christ, lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Christ is in us, and we must also be in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But we do not like to live in Him and with Him, nor do we like doing things by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By birth, we have the habit of being independent, and we all have our preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But every preference is a suffering, a loss, a failure, a defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The reason we do not have a victorious Christian life is that we are not faithful to live by Christ and to do things absolutely in Him.</S>
