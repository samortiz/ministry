        <h2 class="head2 alignleft">Excerpts from the Ministry:</h2>
<p>Our work for the Lord should have a long-term view. Six years go by very quickly; soon the children in first grade will be young brothers and sisters. When they enter junior high school, we can preach the gospel to their classmates in junior high. When they enter high school, we can lead many of their classmates to be saved. When they enter college, they will be gospel seeds. In this way the young people will multiply year after year. The benefit from this will be very great. Hence, I am pleading with the elders and the co-workers to promote the children&rsquo;s work, to lead all the sisters to take part, and to select and train some young sisters to be teachers. (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, p. 315)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHILDREN BECOMING THE GOSPEL SEEDS<br />
IN THEIR SCHOOLS</h2>
<p>God ordained that man be fruitful, multiply, and fill the earth (Gen. 1:28). Thus, man has multiplied, but how do we raise our children? Many years ago we did not know that children could be a great potential for the gospel. We stressed preaching the gospel but neglected the fact that children could also be the fruit of the gospel. When we realized that children could also be considered fruit of the gospel, I fellowshipped with the brothers, asking them to work with the goal of having ten thousand children in Taipei. If we had carried this out at that time and contacted ten thousand children, a majority of them would be older brothers and sisters today. We cannot guarantee that every child would have been saved, but at least eighty percent of the children would have been saved. This would equal eight thousand children. In addition, the ten thousand children was not a fixed number. Every year new children would have been added to us.</p>
<p>When children are saved, they become our young brothers and sisters. After they graduate from primary school, they become seeds of the gospel in junior high school. When we work in the schools, they become our inside helpers and bring their classmates to us. In this way, it is easier to work in the junior high schools. It is difficult to bring the gospel to a school where there are no saints who are teachers or students. However, young brothers and sisters in a junior high school can be likened to little seeds; they are waiting to sprout by responding to our call and bringing their classmates to salvation. When they enter into high school, they again become seeds of the gospel. During their three years of high school, we could bring three times as many people to salvation. When these young saints finish high school and enter college, they are seeds of the gospel in their college. In this way, the number of people saved is continually multiplied. This is truly a great thing. (<em>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery, Book 5: Concerning Various Aspects of Church Service,</em> pp. 83-84)</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHILDREN&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>When I returned to Taiwan in 1966 and in 1967, there were four thousand children in the children&rsquo;s meetings, and I told the brothers to set a goal of having ten thousand children in the meetings. I also asked the brothers to perfect the junior-high and high-school brothers and sisters to assist in teaching the children. These children would be gospel seeds in junior high school, they would be gospel seeds in high school, and they would be gospel seeds in college. They would be seeds the entire time that they are in school.</p>
<p>Suppose the youngest child in the children&rsquo;s work was six years old in 1967. He would now be twenty-three. If we had had ten thousand children in the children&rsquo;s work, there would be at least five thousand saints in the church life today. These calculations show that our &ldquo;business&rdquo; has failed; we have wasted much time and effort. Even though we have been busy in the church life, there are not more than three thousand five hundred saints in the meetings of the church in Taipei. If we had continued the children&rsquo;s work from 1967 until now, the children who were six years old in 1967 would now be twenty-three, and the ones who were twelve would be twenty-nine. Even if only half of the children came into the church life, we would have four to five thousand saints meeting with us. (<em>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service,</em> p. 36)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>We fellowshipped concerning the children&rsquo;s work in 1966; that was eighteen years ago. A child who was twelve years old at that time would be thirty now. In other words, the children whom we cared for in 1966 are at least thirty years old now. If we had worked with ten thousand children in 1966, we would have ten thousand young brothers and sisters today. Some may say that our present situation is according to God&rsquo;s will; otherwise, there might be false believers among us. However, we must have quantity before we can have quality. Of course, not all the children would have remained, but at least sixty percent would have remained; out of ten thousand children at least six thousand would be in the church life today. Now we are busy doing our best to preach the gospel, but the number of people we have saved still has not reached six thousand. Beginning in 1966, if the church in Taipei had focused on only the children&rsquo;s work, there would be at least six thousand brothers and sisters who were properly brought up in the church. We must give this careful consideration. (<em>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service,</em> p. 19)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>For such a work we need a group of sisters to give themselves to take care of the children on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. If one sister takes care of ten children, three hundred sisters can take care of three thousand children. The church can send out a formal announcement to notify the saints so that they can coordinate together. Then on the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning numerous sisters can coordinate together; some can pick up the children, some can take care of the little children, and some can teach the older children. If the sisters are willing to labor faithfully in this matter, when the children who are five or six years old are eleven or twelve years old, they will be saved and baptized. There will be ten thousand young saints. This is a much more effective way to gain the increase than preaching the gospel. Moreover, those who are gained in this way will have a good foundation. After they are saved, they will enter junior high school and be gospel seeds; they can initiate preaching the gospel in their schools. In this way we will multiply endlessly. What a precious work that will be! (<em>The Collected Works of Witness Lee, 1967,</em> vol. 1, p. 297)</p>
<p class="newSection">* * *</p>
<p>Among the saints in Taipei there are at least several thousand household units, and all of these households have children. When we say children, we are referring to young people between the ages of six and twelve, that is, elementary school students from first through sixth grade. We believe that there are more than two thousand children of this age group among us. There are also many children in the households of our neighbors, friends, relatives, colleagues, and classmates. We should not do a work merely among the children in the church. Our work must include the children outside the church. This is the children&rsquo;s gospel work. The inhabitants of this island would be happy for their children to know the Lord&rsquo;s truth and gain genuine benefits. This is a great matter, and we must do our best to promote it. By next summer, or at the latest by the end of next year, the church in Taipei can have at least five thousand children who are under the teaching of the brothers and sisters and who are listening to the truth every week.</p>
<p>We might have only one thousand children, but we hope that after one year or less we can have five thousand children. The children who are presently six years old will graduate from college in sixteen years, and the children who are twelve years old will graduate from college in ten years. If we continue the children&rsquo;s work, we will be unable to estimate the long-term results. After the children are saved and graduate from elementary school, they will be gospel seeds in junior high school; after they graduate from junior high school, they will be gospel seeds in high school; and after they graduate from high school, they will be gospel seeds in college. If we labor on the children, our numbers will continually grow. We believe that if we start with five thousand children and continue this work for fifteen or sixteen years, more than ten or twenty thousand young people will be brought in as a result of the children&rsquo;s work. That is a significant number. (<em>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery, Book 3: The Future of the Lord&rsquo;s Recovery and the Building Up of the Organic Service,</em> pp. 194-195)</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
