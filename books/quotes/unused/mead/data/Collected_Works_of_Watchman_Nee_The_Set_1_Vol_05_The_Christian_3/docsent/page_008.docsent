   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The teachings of Christ have fallen into the hand of this woman.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>She has the power to turn and upset them at will.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>She can add to them her traditions and ordinances so that these latter become as authoritative as the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>She can expound at will and can determine the interpretation of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is where the leaven lies.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The teaching of the church is the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whatever teachings they are, wherever they are found, and with whatever outward appearance they come, they always quench the Holy Spirit, offend the teaching of God's Word, and set up another master other than the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, they come in the name of the Lord and assume His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As such, the Lord's people are intimidated from opposing these false commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us now turn back to the woman Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Her name is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We know that the Bible always packs a lot of meaning into a little word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Many times the name of one person can tell us a lot of stories.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The name Jezebel, together with the history associated with her, causes one to realize that the Lord is referring not only to the one church in Asia Minor at that day alone, but to a woman in apostasy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>She was the daughter of the king of Sidon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through her influence, Ahab was led astray to worship and serve Baal.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As such, he "did more to provoke the Lord God of Israel to anger than all the kings of Israel that were before him" 1 Kings 16:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He strongly promoted idolatry among the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At his table he dined with eight hundred fifty prophets of Baal and Asherah.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was determined to kill Elijah, God's prophet.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He murdered Naboth just because the latter was not willing to give up his God-given inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was indeed the head and the chief instigator of sin among the Israelites at that day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In 1 Kings 21:25-26 it says: "But there was none like unto Ahab, which did sell himself to work wickedness in the sight of the Lord, whom Jezebel his wife stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>And he did very abominably in following idols, according to all things as did the Amorites, whom the Lord cast out before the children of Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before we go on, we have to mention another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Revelation 17 another woman is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Her name is "MYSTERY, BABYLON THE GREAT, THE MOTHER OF THE HARLOTS AND THE ABOMINATIONS OF THE EARTH" 17:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The woman that we are speaking of now is only the Jezebel in Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By the time of the great tribulation, she will develop into the woman described in Revelation 17.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We will cover that woman when we come to Revelation 17.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now we will only point out the fact that she is the same one as the woman in Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us come back to our subject.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The words concerning Jezebel here are very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It only mentions her as the one "who calls herself a prophetess."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The result of such calling is to entice people to fornication and idolatry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we read history, we do not find Jezebel calling herself a prophetess.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She was a queen, an idolatrous queen, but the Jezebel in Thyatira is not a queen.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, if we consider the fact that the Lord promised the overcomers that they would reign over the world, we can deduce that the name Jezebel does contain the sense of a queen.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We know that the Lord's promise to the overcomers in the seven letters corresponds to the condition of the churches where these overcomers were.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Hence, when we see Christ promising the overcomers to reign in the future, it means that these overcomers were not willing to reign together with the church at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>That is the reason why the Lord promised them a future reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although only Jezebel's name is mentioned here, it shows that the hypocritical church of that day reigned in the world as Jezebel did.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moreover, with the coming Babylon the Great there is also the reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, these two passages are related to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The hands of Babylon are stained with the blood of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet in Thyatira, we do not see the woman stained with blood.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>However, the name "Jezebel" suggests to us that she was the one who persecuted the faithful people of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Only when we bear this fact in mind can we fully understand the meaning of this letter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the same time, although the fourth parable in Matthew does not mention her being the queen or her persecution of others, it does clearly point out the nature of her calling herself a prophetess.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, this letter to Thyatira joins the other two prophecies together, and the three passages combined, Revelation 17, Matthew 13, and this letter, give us a full knowledge concerning the work of this woman.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Of course, all these things are speaking about the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These are the Lord's evaluation of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although man may think that she is not that much wrong, we have to judge her according to the Lord's view and the Lord's valuation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God's judgment is final.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In all the things that we will discover in the future, we will see that God's decision never changes.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How solemn this is.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From the prophecy, that is, from Revelation 17, we see that this woman will reign in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Protestantism that will be in name only will still be under her power.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We desire God's children to know God's view concerning her so that they will be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The works of Jezebel are worse than that of coveting unrighteous wages.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Her sin is greater than that of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thyatira here is allowing this woman to teach and to preach the dark, cruel, and idolatrous teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>She even considers herself to have God's command and God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>For her to call herself a prophetess means that she is assuming to speak for God and that God is behind her speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, such sin can never be hidden from the eyes of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>She not only preaches fornication but practices it also.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This sin of fornication symbolizes a union with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As Israel had committed fornication when it married Canaanites, in the same way, the church and the Christians have committed fornication when they have made friends with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The second result of her teaching is to eat idol sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This symbolizes how she is having direct fellowship with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The sacrifices offered by the Gentiles are sacrifices "to demons and not to God" 1 Cor 10:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>These two things are most offensive to God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In Pergamos only a minority listened to the teaching of Balaam, ate idol sacrifices, or committed fornication, but here in Thyatira the whole body of the church has allowed Jezebel to teach others and to entice them to commit fornication and to eat idol sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is indeed a step-by-step degradation in sin!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The teaching of Jezebel is the teaching of the church at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In these few letters, the Lord warns His people at length that the teaching of the nominal churches on earth today is no longer trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Although they are supposed to be the Lord's luminaries on earth, in these few letters the Lord warns His children that their teachings are not necessarily safe anymore regarding their soul, regarding the truth, and regarding sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Yet how many are there today who still consider the teachings, ceremonies, and traditions of the church to be full of God's authority and bear God's blessings!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Many think that since the church dares to do and to preach these things, they must surely be right!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Such people should remember that the Lord has said that Ephesus is fallen, Pergamos is dwelling in Satan's place, Thyatira is following the teaching of Jezebel, Sardis is living in name and dead in reality, and Laodicea will be spewed out of the Lord's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Man considers listening to the church as listening to God, yet this is the basis of the Lord's rebuke!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Man thinks that it is obedience to God when he follows the teaching of Jezebel, but actually, Jezebel was not God's prophetess; she only called herself such.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The saints should know that in the present church, as revealed to us from the Lord's letters, there are many who have rebelled and forsaken the Lord and who have added to and deleted from the Lord's word at will.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Therefore, we must be careful whose teaching we are following now.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>There are three sins of Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>First, she calls herself a prophetess.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>God's order is that a woman should not teach a man.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Even if what is taught is the truth, it is still forbidden 1 Tim 2:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Since God considers her a woman, this shows that she does not have the right to teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Second, although the Jezebel mentioned here is not a physical woman, spiritually speaking, God considers her a woman, which means that she should never teach God's servants.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Third, she teaches heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Hence, God's people should beware and should not think that they are safe.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Even the most steady ones are liable to fall!</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>When one follows man's tradition, it is unavoidable that he be tempted.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This woman is not only teaching fornication in doctrine only but is actually tempting others to practice it.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>With the teachings, there naturally come the works.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Many traditional teachings continue until today because there are those who promote them and practice them!</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The word "woman" in many manuscripts is "your wife."</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If the latter is indeed a better rendering, then we can see further meaning to the word.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The words "your wife" mean that this woman is subject to you and is under your authority.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Ahab represented the Israelites; he bore the moral responsibility of the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The messenger of Thyatira is the representative of the church in Thyatira, who also bears the moral responsibility of the church there.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The first sin of Ahab was to marry Jezebel and to participate in the worship of Baal.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>The second sin was to allow her as a Gentile and an idolator to rule over the religious affairs of his country and to call herself a prophetess in a land of God's jurisdiction.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>This was what was practiced during the period in church history after Pergamos at the height of the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>At that time, the church was joined to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The Roman Catholic Church claimed to have the authority of God and introduced many idolatrous practices into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Actually, historically the Roman Catholic Church was closer to Jezebel than Thyatira of the day.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Like Jezebel, the Roman Catholic Church not only introduced to God's people the heathen sins, but also shed the blood of many who refused this introduction.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In the Bible there is a great principle that when a woman is introduced as a type, this refers to a condition.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If the Bible introduces a man as a type, it refers to the act done under a certain condition.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Hence, whether it is rendered a "woman" or "your wife," the significance is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Whatever it may be, God holds the messenger responsible for the teaching of Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Ahab was responsible before God for his country, yet he allowed Jezebel to exercise authority and to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>As a result, there was apostasy unprecedented in the history of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The name Jezebel suggests that she was the wife of the messenger in the church in Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>This means that she represents the condition of the church at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>Those who bear the responsibility of the church for Christ should bear the responsibility of such a condition there.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>The Lord is not only rebuking the existence of such worldly and corrupt teaching in the church, but the assuming of authority of such teaching and the spreading of such in the name of the Lord as the faith of the church!</S>
