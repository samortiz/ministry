   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TYRIAN FATHER,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SOURCE OF SECULAR SKILL, HAVING TO DIE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Tyrian father, the source of secular skill, had to die that the son who learned this skill through the worldly father may be released from the worldly tie.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Hiram s Tyrian father died.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What a difference there would have been if his mother had died instead of his father!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If that had been the case, this record would not match our experience, and it would be impossible to allegorize this portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Praise the Lord that our father, not our mother, has died.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This means that the source of secular skill has been cut off by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The father signifies the source of skill, and the mother signifies human existence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If our mother died and our father lived, we would be ghosts fully involved with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must go on existing as humans.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even Paul says, I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The old man, the old father, has been crucified; yet we still exist.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That I who continues to exist is the mother of our human existence.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Moses is a good example.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was raised in the royal Egyptian family where he learned all the wisdom of the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>At the age of forty, he considered himself qualified to deliver his people from the usurping hand of the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, he failed because his Tyrian father, his connection with Egypt, still remained.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This indicated that the source of his skill had not been cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord intervened to break that connection, and Moses fled to the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although Moses Tyrian father, the royal Egyptian family, died, he himself continued to exist.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The widowed mother remained.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although she continued to live, she was no longer tied to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let us now apply this to our own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may earn a Ph.D. from Massachusetts Institute of Technology.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But after you earn this degree, Massachusetts Institute of Technology must die.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This does not mean that you must die.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You must continue to exist, but your existence must be widowed, separated from the worldly source.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You continue to possess your skill, but the origin and source of that skill has been cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Your continued existence is the mother, and the source of your skill, which has been cut off, is your deceased father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now you possess the skill without the source, and your human existence is no longer tied to your worldly origin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many of the young brothers and sisters are unbalanced and say, We are in the Lord s recovery and we are expecting the Lord to come back soon.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He may come back in two years.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why then should we worry about finishing high school and preparing ourselves for college?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should spend our time to pray-read and to fellowship with other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since the Lord is coming soon, why should we waste our time reading and studying?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If this is your attitude, the Lord may delay His coming back until you have learned to study.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Actually, you should not just aim to finish high school, but also to graduate from college, and even to earn a Ph.D. I know what is on the heart of the young people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many sisters think that it is sufficient to graduate from high school or, at most, junior college.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They may say, We sisters will not be elders.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why should we waste our time in school?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Isn t it good enough to learn to type and make six hundred dollars a month?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us enjoy an easy Christian life and a happy church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Sisters, you must abandon this concept.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No matter how much you love the Lord, if you hold this concept, you will never be very useful to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>No time spent in studying is wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As young people, you must use your time to study.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although the Lord may come back in a few years, you must still study and learn the Tyrian skill.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you are under the age of twenty-three, your time must be devoted to your education.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You should finish your university course by the age of twenty-two or twenty-three.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is not a regulation of the church in the Lord s recovery; this is my teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>From now on, when young brothers and sisters come to me, I shall ask them what year they have finished in school.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If anyone aged twenty-two would say that he has not yet graduated from high school, I would not waste my time in talking to him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Such a person, four years behind in school, might be retarded and would be unable to understand my fellowship concerning the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But if a brother would tell me that he has just finished his first year of graduate school, I would be happy to talk with him concerning the depths of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although you should do your best to earn an advanced degree, after you have earned it, you must be prepared to sever the worldly ties.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Do not burn your diploma you will need that for business purposes , but say within yourself, My Tyrian father has died.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The day of my graduation will be the day of his funeral.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After you have labored for years to earn your degree, you must put your Tyrian father in a coffin and bury him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Never boast that you have graduated from a university.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>After Moses left the royal Egyptian family, he never mentioned it again.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>That family was buried.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But many Christians with earned doctorates always like to put the title Dr. in front of their names.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Fifty or sixty years ago, people liked to say that they had graduated from Oxford or Cambridge.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Although some boast of their education, after we have earned our degrees, we must bury Cambridge, Oxford, and every other university.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The father of our Tyrian skill must die and be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The skill is useful, but the father has a foul odor.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As you read this, you may say that you do not understand what I am talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is mysterious, and there is no need to understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The best Christians are those who study diligently and who afterwards seem to forget that they have earned a degree.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Their unbelieving relatives and friends will not understand this.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To them, it is mysterious that we would devote so much time and labor to earn a degree and then not respect it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Praise the Lord that they do not understand us!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is another aspect of our Christian mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We Christians have many mysterious aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>For example, I know of some Christians who freely spend money on others, but not on themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Their relatives do not understand why they are so strict with themselves and so generous with others.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We Christians must be people with a mysterious history.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>How mysterious of us to earn a degree and then to cut off our Tyrian father!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If this father does not die, he will bind us to the world, and our education will become the strongest tie.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In my ministry throughout the years I have learned that no highly educated person can understand the Bible unless he cuts off this worldly tie.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Being proud of your education will hinder you from knowing the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>No matter how educated you are, you must humbly tell the Lord that you are a teachable little child and that in your whole being you are utterly empty.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You should be able to say, Lord, although I have three Ph.D. s, I know nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I am not filled up by my education.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>I am empty in my spirit, in my mind, and in my whole being.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Many highly educated professional people are filled to the brim.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For this reason, even after they are saved, they are unable to receive anything from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Their pride has usurped them.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>We need to cut the tie with our Tyrian father and become like a child who knows nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Although we have knowledge, we would not be proud or filled with knowledge; instead, we would be empty.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we are like this, we shall be able to understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We need some brothers and sisters with doctor s degrees.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It would be very beneficial to have some with Ph.D. s in biblical Hebrew and Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It would also be helpful for some to earn Ph.D. s in space science and nuclear physics.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>The church should not be poor or on a low level.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Rather, it should have the highest people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Young people, this must become your burden.</S>
