   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FIRST TOUCHING AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THEN TOUCHING THE PERSON</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we think about authority, the first thing that comes to our mind should not be the person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should only think of authority, not the person involved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should only be related to authority, not to the person involved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we set our mind on the person before we consider submission itself, we do not know the meaning of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A servant of God must first touch authority before he touches the person.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is wrong to touch the person and then to touch authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The right way is to first touch authority, being dislodged and conquered by it, instead of being occupied by the object of submission.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not hard to submit this way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, if a man submits to authority only after he has touched the person, his submission is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has not broken through in such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We are not submitting to men, but to the authority which God places in men.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>GOD'S GREATEST REQUIREMENT</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>BEING SUBMISSION TO AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Of all the commandments which the Bible places before men, the greatest is not the bearing of the cross, offerings, consecration, or sacrifices.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The greatest and highest demand in the entire Bible is the demand for submission to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Man regards such things as offerings, consecration, and sacrifices as the greatest things, considering them to be the most that a Christian can offer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When many people meet young Christians, their natural inclination is to exhort the latter to give themselves to these things, but please remember that the greatest demand in the Bible is the demand to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Samuel 15:22b says, "To obey is better than sacrifice,/And to heed, than the fat of rams."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that the most basic requirement in the Bible is obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Obedience is more basic and crucial than sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The other side of obedience is authority.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Offerings, consecration, and sacrifices may all be contaminated by self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Only obedience is not contaminated by self-will because obedience shuts out the self.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should obey whether or not things go our way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should submit whether or not we are willing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have to see that the bearing of the cross is not our highest obligation to God's will; submission to authority is.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>THE LORD'S PRAYER</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>IN THE GARDEN OF GETHSEMANE</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A few years ago I spoke in Shanghai on the Lord's prayer in the garden of Gethsemane.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Today I would like to speak on this again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some have the thought that the Lord's prayer, in which His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground, was the result of the weakness of His flesh Luke 22:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They have the thought that He acted in this way because He was afraid of the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Nothing can be further from the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While He was praying in the garden of Gethsemane, the cup and God's will were two different things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the reason He prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me" Matt 26:39 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not say that He would not do the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He only asked that the "cup" be removed from Him if possible.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He did not ask for God's will to be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At this point God's will was something absolute, while the cup was not yet something that was absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's will is an expression of His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before the Father revealed Himself clearly to the Lord, the Lord did not equate the cup with His will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Obedience is not the same as sacrifice, and taking heed is not the same as the fat of rams.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There was a time when the cup and God's will were two things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the reason the Lord prayed to know God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He did not drink the cup simply because it was the cup.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He had to wait until the cup and God's will became one thing before He could say, "The cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>John 18:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Once He became clear that the cup was God's will, He readily drank it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, the Lord's prayer in the garden of Gethsemane was for the purpose of determining the relationship between the cup and God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord wanted to know if it was God's will for Him to go to the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He did not hold to the cross; He held to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The prayer in Gethsemane contains a very deep thought, much deeper than human apprehension.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord went to the cross for the sake of accomplishing God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>His crucifixion was the highest expression of His submission to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have to realize that even with the cross, there was the possibility of a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, there could never be any mistake with God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the Lord became clear that the cross and God's will were one and the same, He chose the cross without hesitation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, His crucifixion was an act of submission to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Here we find the Lord upholding God's authority.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He was not upholding His act of crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Crucifixion is not the highest goal; the accomplishment of God's will is.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the reason Hebrews 10:7 tells us that when Christ came to the earth, He said, "I have come...to do Your will, O God."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord is truly our pattern!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In our service to the Lord, we should act according to God's will, not according to our will.</S>
