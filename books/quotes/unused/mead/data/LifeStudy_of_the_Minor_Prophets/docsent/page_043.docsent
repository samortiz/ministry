   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Third Reproof</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In chapter five we have Jehovah s third reproof to Israel, the strongest of the three reproofs.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>A Lamentation Taken Up by Jehovah</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>over the House of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 1 indicates that the third reproof is a lamentation taken up by Jehovah over the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Israel s Fall and Defeat</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Fallen and no more to rise / Is the virgin of Israel; / She has been cast down upon her land; / There is none to raise her up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>/ For thus says the Lord Jehovah, / The city that sent forth a thousand / Will have a hundred left, / And that which sent forth a hundred / Will have ten left, / To the house of Israel vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a word concerning Israel s fall and defeat in war.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jehovah Advising Israel to Seek Him and Live</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In verses 4 through 9 Jehovah advises Israel to seek Him and live.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They should not seek Bethel nor go to Gilgal, both of which would be under Jehovah s visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 7 says, They turn justice to wormwood / And thrust righteousness down to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that the leaders did not care for justice and righteousness and did not care for the people according to the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead, they turned justice into something bitter and cast righteousness to the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Verses 8 and 9 continue, He who makes the Pleiades and Orion / And turns the shadow of death into the morning / And darkens the day with the night; / He who calls for the water of the sea / And pours it upon the surface of the earth, / Jehovah is His name, / Who causes destruction to flash forth upon the strong, / So that destruction comes upon the fortress.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since God can do these things, Israel should be advised to seek Him and live.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>4.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Israel s Transgressions of Injustice</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>in Spite of Their Hypocritical Services</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>with Offerings to Jehovah, and Jehovah s Visitation</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verses 10 through 27 describe Israel s transgressions of injustice in spite of their hypocritical services with offerings to Jehovah, and Jehovah s visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They hated him who reproved in the gate, the place where the leading ones exercised judgment, and they abhorred the one who spoke with integrity v. 10 . They took a forced gift a bribe from the poor v. 11 . Their transgressions were many, and their sins were mighty awful . Eventually, the day of Jehovah will come upon them, a horrible day, and they will suffer woe, for it will be darkness to them and not light vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the one hand, the people of Israel were evil; on the other hand, they still worshipped God with offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They liked to have the feasts and to assemble for the worship of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because of their hypocrisy, Jehovah said to them, I hate, I despise your feasts, / And I will not delight in your solemn assemblies v. 21 . He went on to tell them to take away from Him the noise of their songs and let justice roll down like water, / And righteousness, like an ever-flowing river vv.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead of making noise and singing songs, they should exercise justice and practice righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All the Prophets are on the same subject, but each one gives a different picture from a different angle or with a different aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By reading all the Prophets we can realize how evil the children of Israel were and how loving God was toward them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Beginning approximately two hundred years before the coming of Nebuchadnezzar, God sent the prophets to warn Israel, to advise them, and to call them to return to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, Israel did not listen to the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This forced God to send the four kinds of locusts Joel 1:4 to chastise Israel for twenty-seven centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From this we all need to learn an important lesson: God means business.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For twenty-seven centuries God has been sending locusts to deal with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today the Roman Empire is still consuming Israel, and Israel continues to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the midst of such a situation, God has done something marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>First, He came to be incarnated as a man, and He lived on earth to set up a model of how to have the divine life expressed in humanity, of how to have the divine attributes expressed in the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then He died a particular death for our sins, and He entered into resurrection and ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then He was poured out as the Spirit in His descension to be one with us to produce a corporate Christ, that is, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All these things are mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No one can see them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But these are the things that accomplished God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The chastising of Israel and the judgment on the nations are the shell ; they are not the kernel.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The kernel is the mysterious things in the age of mystery, which began with Christ s incarnation and will end with Christ s second appearing.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These are the governing principles that we should hold when we read the Old Testament, especially the Prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today three things are taking place on earth: the chastisement of God over Israel, God s punishment of the nations, and the manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today we are enjoying all the conveniences invented by the Roman Empire for the manifestation of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The chastisement of Israel, the punishment of the nations, and the manifestation of Christ are great matters, for they are the items of the universal history according to God s economy.</S>
