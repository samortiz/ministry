   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EPHESIANS 6:10-11, 17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All six chapters of the book of Ephesians are constructed with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Ephesians 6 the Divine Trinity is moving for the defeating of His enemy, for dealing with His opponent.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the Triune God to defeat His enemy, we need to be empowered in the Lord the Son and in the might of His strength v. 10 . Then we need to put on the whole armor of God the Father , that we may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil v. 11 . Finally, verse 17 says that we need to receive the sword of the Spirit which the Spirit is the word of God the Father . Through the Divine Trinity, we receive the power and strength, we have the armor, and we also have the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we did not have the power or the strength, we could not fight.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this we need to trust in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We also need a covering to protect us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is the armor, and the armor is of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we need an offensive weapon against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the Spirit as the sword.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Son is the power and the strength for our fighting, the Father's armor is our covering, and the Spirit's sword is our offensive power.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows that even in the spiritual warfare, we need the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>FIRST JOHN 4:2</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1 John 4:2 we can again see the coordination of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This verse shows us the Spirit of God the Triune God including the Father , confessing Jesus Christ the Son , being out of God the Triune God .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Spirit is not independent.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is of Someone, of God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, He does something, not for Himself but for the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He confesses Jesus Christ, the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Again we see the Three working together for one goal to exalt the Son as the very embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>FIRST PETER 4:14</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Peter 4:14 says, "If you are reproached in the name of Christ, you are blessed, because the Spirit of glory and of God rests upon you."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we are reproached in the name of Christ the Son , we are blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are blessed because the Spirit of glory and of God God the Father rests upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Even in the persecution of the believers, the Three of the Divine Trinity are fully involved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are wrapped up with the persecuted believers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the believers of the Son are reproached, the Triune God is enjoying His rest by staying with them in their persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Spirit of glory and of God the Father is resting upon the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>"Resting" in this verse is a kind of staying, abiding, comforting, sustaining, covering, and protecting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While the Spirit of glory is staying with us, the suffering ones, He becomes our sustaining power, our protection, our covering, and our victory; yet with Him it is a resting.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This explains the real situation of Christian persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we are being persecuted, our Triune God is covering us, protecting us, sustaining us, and comforting us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He is resting upon us.</S>
