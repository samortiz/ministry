The Lord&#8217;s Promise to the Overcomers of This Stage</h2><p>To overcome in this epistle means to overcome persecution by being faithful unto death. The Lord said, [&#8220;Be faithful unto death, and I will give you the crown of life&#8217;&#8217; (2:10b). Here, as elsewhere in the New Testament, the crown denotes a prize in addition to salvation. The crown of life as a prize to those who are faithful unto death in overcoming persecution denotes the overcoming strength, which is the power of the resurrection life (Phil. 3:10).]<p>[&#8220;He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death&#8217;&#8217; (Rev. 2:11b). The second death is God&#8217;s dealing with man after man&#8217;s death and resurrection. It is, therefore, the final settlement (Rev. 20:11-15). Because the overcomers have overcome death through their faithfulness unto death under persecution and have left nothing requiring further dealing by God, after their resurrection they will not be &#8220;hurt,&#8217;&#8217; touched, by the second death, the death after resurrection. This indicates that those who do not overcome persecution will be hurt by the second death. This is for a believer to suffer some dealing from the Lord after he has been resurrected.]<h2 class=head1>III. THE CHURCH IN PERGAMOS</h2><p>[In Greek Pergamos means &#8220;marriage,&#8217;&#8217; implying &#8220;union,&#8221; and &#8220;fortified tower.&#8217;&#8217; As a sign, the church in Pergamos prefigures the church which entered into a marriage union with the world and became a high fortified tower, the equivalent of the great tree prophesied by the Lord in the parable of the mustard seed (Matt. 13:31-32). When Satan failed to destroy the church through the persecution of the Roman Empire in the first three centuries, he changed his strategy. He sought instead to corrupt her through Constantine&#8217;s welcoming her as the state religion in the first part of the fourth century. Through Constantine&#8217;s encouragement and political influence, multitudes of unbelieving ones were baptized into the &#8220;church,&#8217;&#8217; and the &#8220;church&#8217;&#8217; became monstrously great. The church has been called out of the world and has been separated from the world to God for the fulfillment of His purpose. However, by being welcomed by the Roman Empire, the church went back to the world and, in the eyes of God, even married the world.] [Because the church, as a chaste bride, is the spouse to Christ, her union with the world is considered spiritual fornication in the eyes of God.]<p>Now you can see why the leading ones in your locality always speak against the world and the worldly things. We must only have eyes for Christ and forsake the world.<h2 class=head2>A. The Condition of the Church at This Stage</h2><p>[In Revelation 2:13 the Lord Jesus said to the church in Pergamos, &#8220;I know where you dwell, where Satan&#8217;s throne is.&#8217;&#8217; Satan&#8217;s dwelling place is the world. Because the church entered into union with the world and became worldly herself, she began to dwell where Satan dwells-in the world.]<p>[In 2:14 the Lord said, &#8220;I have a few things against you, because you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam, who taught Balak to put a stumbling block before the sons of Israel, to eat idol sacrifices and to commit fornication.&#8217;&#8217; Balaam was a Gentile prophet who caused God&#8217;s people to stumble. For the sake of reward (2 Pet. 2:15; Jude 11), he brought fornication and idolatry to God&#8217;s people (Num. 25:1-3; 31:16). In the worldly church some began to teach the same things. When the worldly church disregarded the name, the person, of the Lord, she turned to idolatry, which issued in fornication.]<p>[In Revelation 2:15 the Lord went on to say, &#8220;You also have those who hold in like manner the teaching of the Nicolaitans.&#8217;&#8217; Nicolaitans is an equivalent of the Greek word nikolaitai, the root of which is nikolaos, composed of two words: niko, meaning &#8220;conquer&#8217;&#8217; or &#8220;above others&#8217;&#8217; and laos, meaning &#8220;common people,&#8217;&#8217; &#8220;secular people,&#8217;&#8217; or &#8220;laity.&#8217;&#8217; Hence, nikolaos means &#8220;conquering the common people,&#8217;&#8217; &#8220;climbing above the laity.&#8217;&#8217; The Nicolaitans, then, must refer to a group of people who esteemed themselves higher than the common believers. In the church in Pergamos their works (Rev. 2:6) progressed into a teaching. They not only practiced the hierarchy but also taught it. This hierarchy destroys the function of the believers as members of the Body of Christ, thus annulling the Lord&#8217;s Body in expressing Him.]<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_064.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_066.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Lesson Book, Level 5: The Church-The Vision and Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 65</div><br></body></html>
