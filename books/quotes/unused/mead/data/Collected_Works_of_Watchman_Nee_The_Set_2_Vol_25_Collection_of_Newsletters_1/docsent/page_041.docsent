   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>According to the Bible, a local church only has elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It does not have a third office.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the church in Jerusalem, there were only elders Acts 15:2, 4 and deacons 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the church in Philippi, there were also only "the overseers" and "the deacons" Phil 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The apostle only commanded Timothy to appoint elders and establish deacons 1 Tim 3:1-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A pastor governing a local church is something not found in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The pastorship is only a gift for the building up of the Body of Christ; it is not an office for governing a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, in the Bible, there are the elders of Ephesus Acts 20:17 and the deaconess of Cenchrea Rom 16:1 , but in no place is there the pastor of Corinth, Ephesus, Antioch, or of any place.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is because a pastor is not for a local church but for the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Bible only mentions pastors once in Ephesians 4:11.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Bible we cannot find a single passage that shows a pastor governing a local church like the pastors do today in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A local church just has elders and deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They are selected and established or ordained by the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Today there are no apostles, so today no one has the authority to establish elders or deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, God can raise up a group of people in His church with qualifications like those in 1 Timothy 3:1-13 who can bear the responsibilities of the elders and the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although this group of people does not have the title of elder or deacon, they do the work of the elders and the deacons.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have briefly covered the offices in church organization.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Now let us look at the gifts in church organization.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The gifts are for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are a total of five gifts: apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers Eph 4:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The other gifts mentioned in 1 Corinthians 12 are not included with these.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These five gifts apostles, prophets, evangelists, shepherds, and teachers are for the entire church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They are not like the offices which are for the individual local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The gifts are given by the resurrected and ascended Christ Eph 4:7-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are established by God 1 Cor 12:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Unlike the offices, they are not established or ordained by men, such as the apostles or their delegates.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The ministries are for governing the house of God the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The gifts are for the building up of the Body of Christ the entire church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Apostles The apostleship is an office as well as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The apostle is not appointed by man but by God Himself for the establishment of His church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The apostle is not solely for one local church but for the entire church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Peter and John were apostles in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When they went to Samaria, they were still apostles Acts 8:14-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They were not only apostles for Jerusalem but also for the churches in Samaria and other localities.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It did not matter whether Paul was in Corinth, Ephesus, Colosse, or Thessalonica; he was always an apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Paul was an apostle for all the churches, not just for one local church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The apostles are for building up the entire church the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Prophets The prophets are appointed by God to prophesy in His church to strengthen it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A prophet is not just for one locality but for the entire church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Agabus was a prophet in the church in Jerusalem; when he came to Antioch and Caesarea, he was still a prophet Acts 11:27-28; 21:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Judas and Silas were both prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It did not matter whether they were in Jerusalem or Antioch 15:22, 30, 32 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A prophet prophesies in the church to build up the entire church the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Evangelists These are not appointed by man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Furthermore, they are not hired and employed by man, but they are given by Christ to His church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are established by God Himself, and they are not for a local church but for the entire church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It did not matter whether Philip was in Samaria 8:5 or going down the road to Gaza v. 26 or in Ceasarea 21:8 ; he was always an evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Shepherds Shepherds are not appointed, hired, or employed by man either.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>They are given by Christ to the church and are established by God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A shepherd is a gift to shepherd the entire church.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is not an office to govern a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The shepherds are there to shepherd the entire church; they are not there to govern a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Furthermore, shepherds do not govern, baptize, or perform the Lord's supper service for others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The church today desperately needs the gift of the shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We do not oppose the gift of the shepherds.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We welcome and desire it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We do not oppose the gift of the shepherds but rather the system of the pastors!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The gift of the shepherds is given by God to a believer according to His will, so that he can shepherd and build up the churches of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The pastoral system is something set up by men.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this system, men choose men and ordain them as pastors to govern local churches and to replace the believers by carrying out the matters of service to God, such as baptizing people and distributing the Lord's supper, etc.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is no place in the Bible that tells us that only a pastor can baptize people.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Nor is there any example of a pastor baptizing others!</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the contrary, the Bible tells us that the command to baptize others was given to the disciples: "Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them...</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>" Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The people referred to here are the "disciples" in verse 16.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Although these eleven were also apostles, they did not receive the command in their capacity as apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They received the command to preach the gospel and baptize others in their qualification as disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>"Disciples" are not a small, special group of people; "all the nations" could become disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The baptizers are "disciples" v. 16 , and those being baptized are "disciples" v. 19 . If the command in Matthew 28:19 had been given only to a group of people with apostolic qualification, those of us without apostolic qualification would not be able to even preach the gospel because the Lord's command to preach the gospel and to baptize others goes together! If a believer cannot baptize someone, he cannot preach the gospel either! However, according to the Lord's command, whoever is qualified to preach the gospel is qualified to baptize others.</S>
