        <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">BUILDING AND BREAKING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Kings 4:29-30; 6:1, 7</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN BUILDING,<br />
SERVICE, AND WARFARE</h2>
<p>When we serve in the church with the saints, we are not merely serving together; we are being built up together. We should not only build up others; we need to be built up first. The extent of our being built up determines the extent of our service.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the people of Israel did not serve God individually. Their service was corporate, involving all the people, and the center of their service was the tabernacle. Before the tabernacle was built, the Israelites did not have a corporate service. When the tabernacle was erected in Exodus 40, they became a coordinated unit of service. The Israelites were a priesthood serving God together, and the Tent of Meeting was the center of their service. This means that the corporate service, the coordinated unit of service, the priesthood among God&rsquo;s people, was based on the building among them. Without being built by God, they could not be a coordinated unit of service. This corresponds to 1 Peter 2:5: &ldquo;You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up as a spiritual house into a holy priesthood.&rdquo; When we as living stones are built up into a spiritual house, this spiritual house becomes the priesthood. Then we can offer up spiritual sacrifices that are acceptable to God. Hence, the genuine service in the church is based on the building up among the saints.</p>
<p>In the wilderness the Israelites were not only a priesthood corporately serving God; they were also His army. In Numbers 2 the twelve tribes were encamped as an army on each of the four sides of the tabernacle (v. 2, footnote 1, Recovery Version). They were not only priests serving God but also an army fighting for Him. This reveals that genuine building enables God&rsquo;s people to have a corporate service and to become warriors fighting for God&rsquo;s kingdom. Our spiritual service and spiritual warfare depend on our being built up.</p>
<p>When the saints in a local church are not in harmony or one accord because they lack spiritual building, they are defeated before the enemy and cannot fight the spiritual warfare. They may meet together, but they will not have genuine service. Likewise, the responsible brothers may not argue, but if they hold unpleasant feelings toward one another and are not in one accord, they will not have genuine service, nor will they be able to fight for God, because there is no building among them. Our experience confirms this matter.</p>
<p>When a group of serving ones is in harmony, one accord, and is built up together, that is, fitly joined and firmly knit together, they will be able to have spiritual service and fight the spiritual warfare. Furthermore, Satan will have no ground among them, because they are priests of God and His warriors. The priesthood and spiritual warfare depend on the one accord and the building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BREAKING AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>In order to be built up together by being fitly joined and firmly knit together, we need to be broken. First Kings 6:7 says that the Israelites built the temple &ldquo;of finished stone, cut at the quarry, so that neither hammer nor ax nor any iron tool was heard in the house when it was being built.&rdquo; All the stones were cut at the quarry; hence, no iron tool could be heard in the temple while it was being built. This means that the materials did not need to be dealt with or broken during the building. Because they had already been dealt with, the materials could be fitly joined and firmly knit together.</p>
<p>If the stones had not been cut and carved but had retained their original form, they could only have been piled together, not built together. Stones that are merely piled together cannot be joined together or knit together. In order to be knit, they need to be joined, and in order to be joined, they need to be dealt with and broken. No stone can remain in its original form.</p>
<p>We can apply this clear picture to ourselves. God created us from a lump of clay (Rom. 9:20-21); hence, we are earthy. However, when we received the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit entered into us (John 1:12; 20:22); thus, we have God&rsquo;s nature (2 Pet. 1:4), and our nature is being changed. In God&rsquo;s eyes we are spiritual living stones (1 Pet. 2:5). Peter says that every saved person is a living stone, because on the day that he received the vision of the Christ as the Son of the living God, the Lord called him Peter (Matt. 16:16, 18). In Greek the name Peter means a &ldquo;stone.&rdquo; Stones are used for building. Peter was deeply impressed and understood that every person who knows Christ as the Son of God is regenerated and will have a change in nature to become a stone for God&rsquo;s building. Therefore, the purpose of salvation is to be built up into the spiritual temple of God. Our ultimate destination is an eternal habitation built up by God.</p>
<p>As living stones, it is inevitable for us to be dealt with and broken in order to be built. We need to be touched by the Lord. If instead of being dealt with and broken we retain our natural form, we can at most be piled together but never built up into the temple of God. May the Spirit give us the vision that a regenerated person has become a living stone. If, as living stones, we do not allow God to cut us through dealings and breakings, we will only be piled together with other Christians but not built up together with them into the house of God.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
