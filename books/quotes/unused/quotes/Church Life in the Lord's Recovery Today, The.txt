The church life mainly involves worshipping God, meeting, preaching the gospel, serving God, and working for the Lord
There are many other similar cases, in which the Bible mentions a certain matter without giving a particular explanation for it
Because the record in the New Testament is often spiritual it is difficult for us to be clear concerning the way to practice certain matters
Throughout the centuries those who love the Lord and desire to serve God have encountered problems when studying the Bible
Because not everyone has received sufficient light from the New Testament some unscriptural practices have been brought into the church life
Because there were so many arguments, many became confused, and consequently, some unscriptural practices were gradually brought in
In the second century a teacher by the name of Ignatius introduced an erroneous teaching, saying that an overseer is higher than an elder
He then appointed overseers as bishops over a district to rule over the elders of the different places within that district
On a higher level, there were the cardinals who surround the pope to rule over the Catholic Church on the whole earth
Although the presbytery system of the Presbyterian Church is not as strict, the principle is the same with them
The most evident example occurred in the 1500s when Martin Luther recovered the truth concerning salvation through justification by faith
In the 1800s the Brethren in England were raised up; they brought in a much clearer and deeper recovery of the church life
In the beginning of this century, after 1920, the Lord's recovery turned from Europe and America to the Far East
Concerning this matter, Brother Nee's reply was that we are in the Lord's recovery, and the Lord's recovery is gradually advancing
One condition was that our inner life was not sufficiently strong, living, or fresh, showing that we were in a half-dormant state
In those fifteen years, the annual rate of increase of the believers in the churches in the United States was only two to three percent
In general, this was the condition of the churches in both the East and the West-the rate of increase of believers was very low
Not only did we detect this problem, but the large denominations also discovered that they had the same problem
Although our numbers did not decrease and even slightly increased, the rate of increase was neither high nor fast enough
These revelations mainly comprise four major items, all of which we had not seen so clearly, or perhaps not seen at all, prior to 1984
We cannot deny, however, that our gospel preaching has not been so powerful, and the results have been unsatisfactory to us
Of investigating the reasons for our being in such a condition, we simply continued to preach the gospel in a routine way
In the past, our concept and our feeling were merely that since we are believers we should love the Lord and lead others to salvation
In Chinese, the service to God is called 'the priestly service of sacrifice,' and those who serve are called 'the sacrificing priests'
Since we, the New Testament believers, are the priests of the gospel, we are exclusively in charge of the preaching of the gospel
At the beginning of the New Testament, we first see John the Baptist, who may be considered the last of the Old Testament priests
He was born into a priestly family, and his father, Zachariah, was not only a priest but also the leading priest of a priestly order
What John the Baptist did indicates a basic turn and change from the service of God in the Old Testament to that of the New Testament
John rejected being a priest of the Old Testament, and he turned and became the first priest of the gospel in the New Testament
Becoming a New Testament priest who offers up spiritual sacrifices to God is the result of preaching the gospel
In Roman 15:16 he told us that, as a priest of the gospel of God, he offered to God as sacrifices the Gentile sinners saved through him
Not only so, but in 1 Corinthians 14 he encouraged those who served God to desire earnestly that they may prophesy
At the same time, the New Testament priests are a priesthood, in which all believers should and can participate
Of others doing it for you, you need to carry it out personally by preaching the gospel to save sinners and offer them to God as sacrifices
Today as the priests of the gospel we cannot be substituted we ourselves personally need to preach the gospel and lead people to salvation
Every one of us must learn how to preach the gospel to save sinners, bearing fruit of the gospel as sacrifices to be offered to God
The first step is to go forth and visit people with the gospel that sinners may be saved and offered as sacrifices to God
To prophesy is to speak for the Lord speak forth the Lord and speak the Lord into people thereby dispensing and ministering Christ to others
The church should have a meeting for all the saints to come together that all the saints may be perfected to speak for the Lord
Every believer going out personally to bring people to salvation as a priest of the gospel should accomplish this step
If our organic faculties, whether physical or spiritual, are not exercised for a long period of time, they lose their function
We fully acknowledge that the big gospel meetings can save sinners; moreover, apparently the number of saved ones is considerably large
If we compare this practice with the practice of every believer preaching the gospel, there is still a great difference
According to statistics, it is rare for any Christian organization to have more than a thirty percent rate of increase of believers
They have to walk according to the indwelling Spirit that they may be justified subjectively, sanctified, and transformed in life
Not only in gospel preaching but even in playing the piano or playing ball, we need to learn and receive instruction from a teacher
If we were to cover our eyes with a black cloth so that we could not see anything, after a period of time our eyes would become blind
Is our condition one of 'the more we walk, the more we can walk,' or is it a condition of 'the slower we walk, the less we like to walk'?
Brothers and sisters, we must see that what has been passed down by today's Christianity is half right and half wrong
The God-ordained way for gospel preaching is not for us to invite people to come and listen but for us to go and bring salvation to people
He desired to preach the gospel to us the sinners but instead of sitting in heaven and bidding us to go there He came down from heaven to us
He also sent out twelve disciples to pass through village after village to announce the gospel and heal the sick everywhere
One day He purposely went to the city of Jericho to seek a God-chosen yet fallen sinner, Zaccheus, and to bring salvation to his whole house
When we go out to preach the gospel, there is no need to knock on new doors; it is enough to just knock on familiar doors
After hearing these messages, every one of us should get a notebook and write in a list the names of all the candidates for our gospel
We should pray for them before the Lord one by one and look to the Lord's leading to go and preach the gospel to them
If we all are willing to do this, it is not difficult; to be sure, we can have one person saved in three to four months
From today on, brothers and sisters, we must all be priests of the gospel of God to preach the gospel to our acquaintances
If you bring one person to be saved in one month, yielding new fruit every month , you will be the happiest person in the entire country
Abel, the second generation of mankind, began to offer sacrifices to God, and through the offering of sacrifices he fellowshipped with God
After the flood destroyed the world, Noah came out of the ark and built an altar on the new earth to offer sacrifices to God
At their time God had not instituted the priesthood, so we can say that they were merely individual, unofficial priests
From then on, there were priests among God's people, not individual, unofficial priests but corporate, God-ordained priests
Under God's ordination, those who served as priests could approach God, and they also took care of the needs of His people
Through the Urim and Thummin they received revelation from God and brought the divine revelation to God's people
They became a group of people who were very intimate with God, who brought God to His people and brought His people into His presence
It was through him that God ended the institution of the Old Testament priests and initiated the reality of the New Testament priests
The kingdom of God was no longer a type but a reality, and likewise the Christ of God is not a type but a reality
In His preaching of the gospel, He told people not only to repent but also to believe into Him and receive Him as the reality of God
The work that is carried out by the New Testament priests of the gospel is still primarily to offer sacrifices
The sacrifices offered by the New Testament priests and the sacrifices offered by the Old Testament priests are altogether different
As such, they have become a part of Christ and are offered to God as living, spiritual sacrifices by the New Testament priests of the gospel
The first step is to help sinners repent and believe into the Lord and thereby be regenerated as the children in God's family
In 1 Thessalonians 2:7 Paul said, 'We were gentle in your midst, as a nursing mother would cherish her own children'
In the original language, cherishing here includes nourishing; it indicates care that is more tender than mere nourishing
In John 15:16 the Lord said that He chose us and set us that we would go forth and bear fruit and that our fruit would remain
When they are first saved, we offer them to God as sacrifices, but after we have fed them, they can present themselves to God
He begins by saying, 'Pursue love, and desire earnestly spiritual gifts, but especially that you may prophesy'
The new way is not door-knocking alone; it does not consist merely of knocking on doors to visit people for gospel preaching
In less than ten minutes, seven or eight people can answer a question in a complete way so that everyone learns and everyone is taught
If we have this kind of small group meeting, week after week, for fifty-two weeks yearly, how much and how greatly we will be benefited!
These meetings are neither the worship services in the denominations nor the meetings among us for listening to messages
Everyone who comes to the meeting begins the meeting while still in his home or on the way, coming with singing and praying
The proper church life in the Lord's recovery today is one in which every believer is a New Testament priest of the gospel
We should also go to the homes of the new believers to have home meetings that we may nourish and cherish them and lead them to grow
Every week we need to spend time to bring them to the small group meetings that they may be taught and perfected
If we truly do this, God's New Testament economy will be accomplished quickly, and the day of the Lord's coming will be near
O Lord, make us those who love You, who enjoy sitting at Your feet to listen to the word concerning Your heart's desire
Speak in our speaking and seal every word with Your Spirit that we may have fresh utterance and the expression that is of You
The difference lies in the fact that the Godordained way is altogether organic and since it is organic everything is a matter of the Spirit
Our human body is constituted with many members, and everything in this body is a matter of life; everything is organic, not mechanical
If we were robots, our mouth would move when its switch was turned on, but none of our other parts would be involved
If there is a sufficient amount of oxygen, the blood circulation will be normal, and the entire body will feel refreshed
If all day long we neither call on the Lord nor pray, we become miserable because the organic essence within us cannot operate
The more we call on the Lord and the more we pray, the more we feel comfortable and refreshed because the life within us is activated
The Holy Spirit and the divine life are just like the oxygen and the blood circulation that refresh us and make us healthy
Each of these four steps must be organic; every step must be carried out in life and through our being filled with the Holy Spirit
In today's Christianity, all these things are not organic and are not carried out by being filled with the Spirit
In principle, all the activities in Christianity depend upon organizational arrangement, not upon life and the Spirit
As gospel preachers, we need to pick up the burden to pray every day for our gospel contacts whose names we have listed
In our prayers, as we are moved and led by the Lord, we know to which one we should go that we may lead him to salvation
As we lead him in this way to receive the Lord and be baptized, he is saved and becomes a person who has the divine life and the Holy Spirit
The Christian meeting is based upon prayer and singing and is constituted with the word of God and the Spirit of God as its elements
In such an organic small group meeting, no one comes to attend a worship service, and no one comes to lead the meeting
Such a meeting does not have any fixed program or procedure; we simply follow the organic operation and act according to the Holy Spirit
According to the Bible, Christian meetings are not mechanical but living, not organized but organic, full of the Spirit and full of life
When they open their mouth they have the word of truth with the experience of life to speak forth the Lord and to speak the Lord into others
It only requires us to be saved and regenerated and to receive spiritual nourishment, teaching, and perfecting
Christianity simply puts this matter aside, and 1 Corinthians 14 has become a chapter buried and sealed up in the Bible
We believe that today, in the last days of this age, it is the right time for the Lord to recover 1 Corinthians 14 among us
After we are saved and sanctified, we grow and are transformed so that we present ourselves to the Lord as living sacrifices
We also should be those who love the Lord and fellowship with Him and who constantly have His appearing and inspiration
A large city such as Tokyo may be likened to a huge fishpond in that there are people everywhere who are all candidates for the gospel
If we are blessed to arrive at such a condition even the outsiders the unbelievers will be saved and blessed and the church will be built up
He will recover the organic essence of the Body of Christ so that every member is living, full of the Spirit, and full of life
We all should have much faith and maintain a heart of endurance, being hopeful in the Lord and hopeful concerning His new way
We all have our old background and old upbringing which are not easy to discard and replace with something new
We should not be too hasty to have a success but should rather proceed slowly with a right heart and endurance
Do not forget that whichever way we are in, we are all those who believe in the Lord, who love Him, and who are for Him
In the previous messages we have seen clearly that God's desire in the New Testament is that every saved one be a priest of the gospel
We need to go and preach the gospel to gain sinners that they may be regenerated so that we may offer them to God as sacrifices
For fifty-two weeks in a year, all should come together weekly to fellowship, minister, ask questions, answer questions, teach, and learn
In the stage of perfecting, we need to help others to exercise and learn to speak for the Lord, that is, to prophesy
If someone does not have the opportunity on one occasion, he can wait for the next occasion to speak, if time allows
There may be some whose speaking is not rich or strong, but there will always be some who speak in a very rich and strong way
Week after week, the supply that we receive will be of a great variety, and the functions in which we are perfected will be extensive
When the church does this, sinners will be saved, believers will grow, saints will be perfected, and all will prophesy one by one
A number of saints went there to be trained, but to speak honestly, they did not receive much genuine training
One person may be diligent, serious, thorough, and absolute, but the other one may be just the opposite-lazy, loose, sloppy, and careless
The church life in the Lord's recovery today is very noble because here we are doing the work of the priests of the gospel
Apparently, every step is a work, but in reality, it is our living, which is the living of the priests of the gospel
Our life consists not only of sleeping eating being clothed exercising studying and working there are other matters that comprise our life
We must tell them that to prophesy is not to talk about secular matters or merely about how our sicknesses have been healed
Rather, it is to release the truth according to the Bible and testify the truth according to the experience of life
As Christians and as those who love the Lord, we also need to have a part of our time in our living for recreation and amusement
What a joy it is to come to the meetings to have mutual fellowship with the brothers and sisters, singing, praying, and testifying!
If we live in this way, we can bring at least two people to the Lord every year and equip them to be perfected
If we lose one of them, we should go to bring another one or two more to be saved and then nourish and lead them
In this way, from the beginning to the end of the year, we will always have two or three under our nourishing and perfecting
We must do this regularly, ordinarily, and according to a specified time; we should neither be overly zealous nor indifferent
Every day we begin with morning revival; then during the day we continue to live an overcoming life and are thereby renewed day by day
We should not be blown about by the winds of teaching; furthermore, we should not preach or teach different opinions in the church
We have no dissension; we simply work according to God's New Testament economy and avoid speaking about anything else
We are waiting for His coming, and when He comes, we will receive either His reward or His punishment before His judgment seat
