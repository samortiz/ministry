MOSES, WITH THE ELDERS OF ISRAEL,<br>COMMANDING THE PEOPLE TO KEEP<br>THE WHOLE COMMANDMENT<br>WHICH HE WAS COMMANDING THEM THAT DAY</H2><P>In 27:1-26 Moses, with the elders of Israel, commanded the people to keep the whole commandment which he was commanding them that day. This was the day of the rehearsal of the law.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The People Erecting Large Stones<br>on Mount Ebal, Coating Them with Plaster,<br>and Writing upon Them All the Words of the Law</H2><P>When the children of Israel crossed over the Jordan into the God-given land, they were to erect large stones on Mount Ebal (vv. 2a, 4). These were to be natural stones not worked on by man, signifying unchangeableness. The stones were to be coated with plaster (v. 2b), and upon them the people were to write very clearly "all the words of this law" (vv. 3, 8). I believe that these words refer to the Ten Commandments.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Building to Jehovah Their God<br>an Altar of Stones and Offering Up<br>Burnt Offerings upon It to Him,<br>Sacrificing Peace Offerings,<br>Eating There, and Rejoicing before Him</H2><P>In the God-given land, the children of Israel were to build to Jehovah their God an altar of stones not touched by an iron tool (vv. 5-6a). It is significant that when the blessings and the curses were about to be released, Moses charged the people to build an altar. This altar implies grace. Before the people took care of either the blessing or cursing, they built an altar. The building of an altar is a great matter, for, after man's fall, what we first need with respect to God is an altar&#151;the cross of Christ. We thank God that, before He dealt with us regarding blessing or  cursing, He accomplished salvation through Christ's redemption on the cross. Praise the Lord that an altar has been built!</P><P>Upon the altar, which signifies the cross of Christ, the children of Israel were to offer up burnt offerings (Christ) to God (v. 6b). The people were also to sacrifice peace offerings (Christ) and eat there and rejoice before Jehovah their God (v. 7). On the cross, Christ offered Himself to God as a burnt offering for God's satisfaction. He also offered Himself to God as a peace offering for us so that we could be satisfied. Now in the presence of God, we can enjoy Christ as the peace offering for our fellowship with God.</P><P>The burnt offering and the peace offering in verses 6 and 7 indicate that the one who wants to keep the commandments of God must offer himself as a burnt offering to God for His satisfaction, so that he can offer a peace offering to God for his enjoyment with God in fellowship. This means that if we intend to do something before God, we must first offer Christ to God as a burnt offering for God's satisfaction. Then, mainly for our own need and our satisfaction, we must also offer Christ as a peace offering. Then we will have enjoyment with God in the divine fellowship.</P>
