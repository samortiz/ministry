   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The believers who are faithful, who endure, and who overcome for the Lord today will obtain authority to sit on the throne with the Lord and to reign with Him over everything when He comes again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Bible shows that when the Lord returns, the kingdom of the heavens will come to earth to reign and rule over the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord Jesus will establish His kingdom on earth and rule the earth for one thousand years.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Despite the fact that both the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, which is so-called Christendom, and the reality of the ruling of the kingdom of the heavens in the overcoming Christians are present on earth today, the kingdom of the heavens is still a hidden mystery to the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christendom is merely the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, not the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even the submission of the overcoming Christians to heavenly authority is not the full manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens but only a small, mysterious reality of the kingdom of the heavens that is hidden from the worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although worldly people today can see the outwardly great and magnificent appearance of Christendom, they cannot see the authority and glory of the kingdom of the heavens, and although they can see overcoming Christians who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens with pureness, brightness, goodness, meekness, unselfishness, and with no attachment to the world, they have no understanding of the source of this reality.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The kingdom of the heavens is hidden from the worldly people, but it will be manifested when the Lord Jesus returns to rule the earth.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>According to the Bible, Satan and his angels are presently ruling this dark world Eph 6:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the future the Lord will return to deal with Satan Rev 20:1-3 , and the kingdom of the world will become the kingdom of the Lord 11:15 .</S>

   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then the kingdom of the heavens will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Christians who will participate in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens are those who have lived in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens by submitting to the heavenly authority, receiving the heavenly restriction, and overcoming.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the glorious appearance of the kingdom of the heavens, there will be no portion for defeated Christians, much less for false Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the third aspect of the kingdom of the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In conclusion, when the Bible speaks of the kingdom of the heavens, there are three aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First, the appearance of the kingdom of the heavens includes all who are called Christians, both believers who are saved and false believers who are not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Second, the reality of the kingdom of the heavens includes the overcoming Christians who submit to the heavenly authority, receive the restriction and governance of the heavens, and allow the heavens to exercise authority in them today.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Third, the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens includes the overcoming Christians who live in the reality of the kingdom of the heavens today by allowing the heavens to rule them, by receiving the heavenly restriction, and by overcoming to the end, even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the Lord Jesus returns, only they will enter into the manifestation of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In order to be clear about the kingdom of the heavens, we must clearly differentiate between these three aspects as well as differentiate between the kingdom of the heavens and the kingdom of God, the millennial kingdom, the messianic kingdom, the heavens, and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, we need to spend more time to examine these differences.</S>
