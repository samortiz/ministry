   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Second Step</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to Have Man to Receive God as Life 2:8-17</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we come to the second step.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Most people cannot accomplish anything in a single step.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Thus, after God created man as vessels with a human spirit to receive Him and to contain Him, He took another step by placing man in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>a. Placing Man in Front of</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>the Tree of Life</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As I mentioned in the last message, when I was a young Christian I was troubled by Genesis 2 because it did not seem to be a classical piece of writing as I felt the Bible ought to be.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It reminded me of the play of some little boys who made images out of clay and put them before certain objects.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, according to Genesis 2, God placed man in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is life?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Life is mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not even medical doctors or biologists are able to define life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although life is mysterious, it is presented in Genesis 2 in a solid and substantial way as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may be eager to know the meaning of the tree of life, but we cannot afford to be hasty.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should not approach something as mysterious as life in a quick and superficial way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is easy to talk about this blackboard, but very difficult to speak about life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For the time being we simply need to see that God put man in front of this tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When I was young and read the first two chapters of Genesis, I wondered why God did not command Adam to worship Him as the Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I thought God should have told Adam, "I am your Creator.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You must worship Me every morning, noon, and evening.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You must worship Me at least seven times a day.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You must bow down, kneel down, and prostrate yourself before Me. I will write some praises for you so you may practice how to worship Me." That was my concept.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As far as I was concerned, it was foolish of God to place man in front of the tree of life with nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Furthermore, I felt that after God had created Eve, He should have given both Adam and Eve a wedding sermon, saying, "Adam, you must thank Me for giving you such a dear wife.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You must promise Me that you will love her forever.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eve, I command you, as his wife, to submit to him."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It seemed to me entirely logical for God to make such demands.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Under the influence of Christianity, especially the conduct of wedding ceremonies, I assumed that God would have delivered a wedding sermon to the first couple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, God gave them no such word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He only seemed to tell them, "Be careful about your eating.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You must eat correctly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I don't care whether or not you love your wife or submit yourself to your husband.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I don't care very much about worship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I care about your eating.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If you eat wrongly, you will be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you eat the wrong tree, you will die.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Adam, you must realize that it is not a matter of what you do; it is a matter of what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You will be what you eat.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you eat death, you will become death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you eat life, you will become life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is not a question of doing, but of being.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Take care of your eating."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In my early days as a Christian, I was bothered by this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To tell you the truth, during that period I did not like Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I liked chapter 1 which described God's work of creation, but I felt that chapter 2 resembled a children's cartoon.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After God created man, He put him in front of a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God did not charge him to obey ten laws and requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>There were no commandments, but there was a placement.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God placed man in front of the tree of life; He wanted man to eat this tree.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Later in this message we will see the meaning of the tree of life.</S>
