   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Light is in the Word of God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since life rests with light, with what then does light rest?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From the Bible we see that light rests with the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is also a great principle in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Psalm 119:105 says, "Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.''</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>And verse 130 says, "The opening of thy words giveth light.''</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These verses show us that light rests indeed with the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore if we want to obtain light, we must obtain the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whenever we obtain the Word of God, we obtain light.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The reason we do not have light is that we lack the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Word of God we speak of here does not refer to the written word in the Bible, but to the word the Holy Spirit speaks to us from within.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible is God's written Word; this is certainly correct.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But such a Word, composed of mere fixed letters, does not have the power of shining light and cannot be light to us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, when the Holy Spirit reveals anew the word of the Bible, opening and quickening it to us, the Word then has the power of shining light and can be our light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>C. Light is the Inner Sense of Life</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the old creation God commanded the light to shine outwardly, but in the new creation, God Himself has shined into our hearts 2 Cor 4:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When we talk about light, we are not talking about the light outside of us, but we are speaking of God as light shining inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This light actually is the sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What we are in our self is different from what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He loves, while we hate.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He is holy, while we are worldly.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is righteous, while we are unrighteous.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He exposes us for what we are, which is not what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the inner sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For example, you may say something to criticize or joke about your brother.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord did not say it, but the law of sin in your flesh made you say it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Right away, you may feel that was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That sensation is light, the inner sense of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What do you do now?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All you have to do is to say, "O Lord Jesus, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That was not You speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fill me up with Yourself.''</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As you are praying according to the light, the Lord forgives you, cleanses you and grows in you so that you are more conformed to the image of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>D. The Way to be Enlightened</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Firstly, we must want the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since God is already in us, He is always shining.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we do not want the shining, we ignore it or argue with it, but as we accept and receive the shining, we are enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Secondly, we should be open to the Lord and turn to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second Corinthians 3:16 says, "Whenever it our heart shall turn to the Lord, the veil is taken away.''</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we call on the Lord, pray or read His word, we are turning to Him, and we will definitely have His shining.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If our heart is distracted by other things, we enter into darkness and we may do things against the Lord and not express Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thirdly, we should not argue with the light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more we argue, the more we stay in darkness, and the feeling of death pervades.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the Lord shows you that you argued with your mother, do not say that she was too much.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Just confess by agreeing with the light.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Then the Lord will forgive you and grow in you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we learn to experience life by the light, that we will grow up into Christ in all things, and God will be expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Questions Can you give a short definition of the law of life?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please explain the functions of the law of life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What is the function of light?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Can you find additional verses that talk about life and light?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How can we experience life by the light?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Can you give a personal experience?</S>
