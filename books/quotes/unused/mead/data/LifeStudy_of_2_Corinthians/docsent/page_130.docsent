   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SOWING WITH BLESSINGS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What about the sowing of seed?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to chapter nine, our giving equals not only our gathering, as in chapter eight, but also equals sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our giving is both a gathering and a sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The gathering of manna is miraculous.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have emphasized that the manna gathered by the children of Israel was balanced in a miraculous way so that no one had any lack and no one had anything over.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now from chapter nine we must see that our giving is also likened to sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>According to 9:6, he who sows sparingly shall also reap sparingly, and he who sows with blessings shall also reap with blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 6 we have the thought of sowing for the benefit of others.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But what farmer, when he sows seed in his field, has the thought of sowing for others?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Surely, most farmers have the concept of sowing for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This kind of sowing, however, is not with blessings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To sow with blessings is to give to others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is to sow with blessings to others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When we give of our money, we are sowing, and this sowing is not for ourselves, but is for others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we sow with blessings to others, we shall reap with blessings from God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>LEARNING TO GIVE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As children of God, we all must learn to give.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To give is to gather.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How much manna we can gather depends on how much we give.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Luke 6:38 the Lord Jesus says, Give, and it shall be given unto you; good measure, pressed down, and shaken together, and running over, shall men give into your bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For with the same measure that ye mete withal it shall be measured to you again.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This verse indicates that if we want to receive, to gather, we first need to give.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our giving is our gathering, our receiving.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all need to gather manna every day.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because our gathering is our giving, we all need to give in order to gather.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We gather little because we give little.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>May we all be impressed that our giving is our gathering.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the matter of giving and gathering, divine miracles are involved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not believe in a superstitious way that the more we give, the more we shall receive.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If this is the way we understand this matter, our motive in giving will be to gain riches for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The point here is related to God s balancing hand.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He would distribute the supply so that we would be neither poor nor rich.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He certainly does practice a divine and heavenly balancing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He knows how to balance the wealth among His people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For more than fifty years, I have been living by faith in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Often I have been very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nevertheless, I can testify that even though I have been in extreme poverty, I never had any lack.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I gathered little, but I had no lack.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At other times I had an abundant supply, even large sums of money.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, I must testify that I did not have any excess.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, I can testify from my experience that whenever I have gathered much, I have had no excess and that whenever I have gathered little, I have had no lack.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Who balances the supply in this way?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is done by God with His heavenly balance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we try to gather more than what is needed, we shall eventually see the excess money fly away.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you keep too much in excess, your money will seem to sprout wings and fly away from you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The reason this happens is that God in the heavens balances the social wealth of His children.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have seen that giving is both a matter of gathering and of sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Sowing brings in reaping.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is a natural law that first we sow and then we have a harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we sow, we should sow generously, not sparingly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we sow sparingly, we shall reap sparingly.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But if we sow generously, we shall also reap generously.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In our sowing, we are the ones who are generous and liberal.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But when we reap, we find that God is the One who is generous.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Why did Paul add chapter nine?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He added this chapter in order to provide us a further illustration of giving.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have pointed out that in 2 Corinthians 9 Paul uses sowing to illustrate giving.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, from chapters eight and nine we see that giving is gathering and also sowing.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>These two concepts deep within Paul governed his writing of these two chapters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>GIVING AND GATHERING</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Paul was not a superficial writer.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the contrary, he was deep, and his thoughts were profound.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In his reading of the Old Testament he realized that Exodus 16 speaks of God s people gathering what they need for their daily supply.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to Paul s concept, we today are in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Daily we work; however, actually we are gathering manna.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But our gathering must turn to giving.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we do not give, we shall not continue to gather.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We work to earn money, but this earning of money must become our giving.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then whatever we give will become our gathering, as pictured by the gathering of manna by the children of Israel in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Now we can see that Paul likens our giving to this gathering of manna.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This thought is deep, profound.</S>
