[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE ASSEMBLY, THE HOUSEHOLD, THE BODY, AND THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Eph 1:22-23; 2:19, 14-16; 4:24; Col 3:10-11
[3]  When the Apostle Paul wrote concerning the new man in the Epistles to the Ephesians 2:15; 4:24 and to the Colossians 3:10 , the recipients may not have had a full understanding or appreciation of such a word.
[4]  Beginning also with the Brethren, the saints began to see that the church is God's household, God's family.
[5]  This is clearly revealed in Ephesians 2:19 which says, "So then you are no longer strangers and sojourners, but you are fellow citizens of the saints and members of the household of God."
[6]  THE CHURCH AS A MAN WITH A UNIQUE PERSON
[7]  The church is not only the assembly, the household, and the Body.
[8]  I do look to the Lord that we all may be brought into the highest vision, that we would see that the church is not only the gathering, the assembly of God's called ones, not only the folks of God's household, and not only the Body of Christ, but also the new man, created according to the image of God Christ.
[9]  CHAPTER TWO WORLD HISTORY IN THE LIGHT OF GOD'S PURPOSE Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26-28; 10:5, 20, 31, 32; 11:7-9; Acts 2:5-11; Rev 5:9-10; Eph 2:13-15; 4:22-24; Col 3:10-11
[10]  The Bible is a record of two men, the old man and the new man.
[11]  The record of the Old Testament is a record of the old man, and the record of the New Testament is the record of the new man.
[12]  However, this is not all, because the new man has not yet come into fullness.
[13]  GOD'S SOVEREIGNTY FOR THE PERFECTION OF THE NEW MAN
[14]  Today in certain parts of this country the white people and black people cannot come together in one church, but if both the white brothers and the black brothers saw the new man, they would realize that both white and black have no place in the new man, but Christ is all and in all.
[15]  CHAPTER THREE CHRIST AND THE ONENESS OF THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: Eph 2:14-15; 4:22-24; Col 3:10-11; John 19:19-22 A FURTHER WORD CONCERNING THE FOUR MAJOR EVENTS OF HISTORY
[16]  Throughout all the centuries, God has been sovereign over human culture on the earth.
[17]  The Raising Up of Great Britain for the Spread of the Gospel
[18]  For fulfilling His purpose to spread the gospel to the whole world, God needed to defeat Spain.
[19]  The new man is not a new organization or a new "United Nations."
[20]  This new man is just Christ Christ spreading and Christ enlarged.
[21]  You have no place in the new man, and neither do I. We all have no place in the new man, but Christ is all and in all.
[22]  Even if you are in Christ, yet you do not live by Christ, you have a problem related to this new man.
[23]  To have the practice of the new man we must know who Christ is and where Christ is.
[24]  CHAPTER FOUR CHRIST THE LIFE AND PERSON OF THE NEW MAN Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:10-13a; Rom 15:5-6; Eph 3:16, 17a, 19b; 4:24; Col 3:10-11 GOD'S INTENTION TO HAVE THE NEW MAN
[25]  God's intention in His New Testament economy is to have a new man to replace the old man.
[26]  CHRIST AS THE LIFE AND PERSON OF THE NEW MAN
[27]  The new man is not a movement, such as the ecumenical movement, and is not an organization but a man.
[28]  As a man, the new man must have life and he must have a person.
[29]  First Corinthians 1:10 says, "That you all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion."
[30]  Similarly, Romans 15:5-6 says, "Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be likeminded one toward another according to Christ Jesus, that you may with one accord and with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[31]  CHAPTER FIVE THE WAY THE NEW MAN COMES INTO EXISTENCE Scripture Reading: Eph 2:14-16; 4:22-24; Col 3:10-11; Gal 3:27-28; 1 Cor 12:13; 1:10; Rom 15:5-6; 12:2 THE CREATION AND EXISTENCE OF THE ONE NEW MAN
[32]  After everything in the universe had been prepared by God within six days, God created man in His own image Gen 1:26 .
[33]  God's intention was to be expressed through this man, and this man is not an individual, but a corporate man.
[34]  God created such a man, but this man fell into the hand of Satan, the enemy of God.
[35]  The baptism in the Spirit is the first step needed for the one new man, which has already been created, to come into existence.
[36]  As the Spirit is the sphere and element of our spiritual baptism and in such a Spirit we were all baptized into one organic entity, the Body of Christ, so we should all, regardless of our races, nationalities, and social ranks, be this one Body.
[37]  The new man was created on the cross, but for the new man to come into existence there is the need of the baptism in the Spirit, which is to baptize the Jews, the Greeks, the slaves, and the free in one Spirit into one Body.
[38]  The third step for the created new man to come into existence is that he needs to be renewed Col 3:10 .
[39]  From the very first day that I came to the United States, the Lord showed me that I had to give up my Chinese mentality.
[40]  I wanted a mind that only cared for the Lord's recovery and not for my Chinese way of living.
[41]  The first aspect concerning this one new man is that Christ through His death on the cross in the flesh has completed the creation of this one new man.
[42]  Ephesians 2:15 is one verse in the whole Bible which is so strong to tell us that this one new man has been created "Having abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man, making peace."
[43]  In the eyes of God, the one new man was created two thousand years ago on the cross, in Christ, of two peoples the Jews and the Gentiles.
[44]  PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN BY BEING RENEWED IN THE SPIRIT OF OUR MIND
[45]  Ephesians 2:15 tells us that the new man was created on the cross, yet Ephesians 4:22 tells us that we have to put off the old man.
[46]  Because the new man in Ephesians is corporate, the old man, in the same principle, must also be a corporate man.
[47]  When we are being renewed in the spirit of our mind, we do not only put off the old man but also put on the new man "which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth" 4:24 .
[48]  The one new man was created in Christ, but on you nothing of the new man may exist.
[49]  In Colossians 3:10 are the creation of the new man and his renewal.
[50]  We need to have our mind renewed for the existence of the new man.
[51]  God has created the new man, but the new man has not fully come into existence because of our unrenewed mind.
[52]  We must see that in the new man there is no place for religious ordinances.
[53]  When we began to meet in the early sixties in Los Angeles to have the church life, some people complained to me that in our meetings we did not have the gifts.
[54]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE RENEWING OF OUR MIND IN OUR DAILY LIFE Scripture Reading: Eph 2:14-15; 4:22-24; Rom 12:2; Acts 10:9-20; Rev 5:9-10 THE GOAL OF GOD'S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY
[55]  The goal of God's New Testament economy is to gain the new man.
[56]  The old man failed God, so in His New Testament economy God is going to get a new man.
[57]  For this purpose Christ died on the cross not only to take away our sins, to crucify our old man, to destroy Satan, and to judge the world, but also to abolish the ordinances, the different ways of living among different peoples, so that He could create in Himself a new man.
[58]  THE FISHING MINISTRY, THE BUILDING MINISTRY, AND THE MENDING MINISTRY
[59]  THE RENEWING OF THE MIND IN OUR DAILY LIFE FOR THE ONE NEW MAN
[60]  About twenty centuries have passed since the Lord's death on the cross, but we must ask ourselves where the builded church is.
[61]  The Lord said that He would build His church Matt 16:18 , and Paul told us that we are "being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit" Eph 2:22 , but where is the building?
