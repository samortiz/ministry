   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECRET OF EXPERIENCING CHRIST AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christ is the Spirit, and this Spirit is in you and me and in our spirit all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we want to talk to our spouse, we should not do it right away.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must first have a little conversation with the Lord, saying, O Lord, my spouse is here.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do You want me to talk to her?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do You want to talk to her?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If You would not talk to her, I would not talk to her either.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord can testify that many times this is my practice when I talk to my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Quite often when I want to talk to her about something, I have this feeling in my spirit that says, You should first converse with the Lord and ask Him if He wants to talk.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I inquire of the Lord in this way, eight out of ten times He does not want to talk, so eventually I also will not talk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By this kind of practice we can avoid gossiping and wasting our time, and we can also keep ourselves in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to practice this even in our dressing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You should not decide by yourself what you should wear.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead, you should first ask the Lord, Lord, do You want to wear this shirt?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If You will wear it, I will wear it; but if You will not wear it, neither will I. When you do this, you are living Christ, and the issue is that it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When people come to debate with me concerning certain doctrines, sometimes when my words are on the tip of my tongue, inwardly I am reminded that I must first turn to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then I fellowship with the Lord, saying, Lord, do You want to speak?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If You speak, I will speak; if You will not speak, I will not speak either.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eight out of ten times the Lord does not want to speak, so I do not speak either.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the end, many troubles are avoided.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is to live Christ and to enjoy Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is a fact, not an empty doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord is real and living, and He is right inside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must always contact Him and have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever we speak or do anything, we should not do it according to our own decision.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, we should first contact the Lord and have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even if you have been wronged and want to cry and shed tears, you still have to fellowship with the Lord first, saying, Lord, will You cry?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If You will cry, I will cry.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If You will not cry, I will not cry.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we all practice this, the result will be that we will live Christ, and we will experience Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Christ in whom we believe is God, the Lord who created the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He is the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit while at the same time He is our Redeemer and Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today He has become the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, and even the sevenfold intensified Spirit who is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not neglect Him at any time, but we should always practice having fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even when we are about to get angry, we should first ask Him, Lord, I am getting angry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Are You angry?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I want to punish my children; do You think I should beat them?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I want to scold them; would You scold them?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once we fellowship with the Lord, we will be enlightened right away.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We will see that we do not have any love, light, holiness, and righteousness at all.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We will also realize that He is in us as love, light, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the husband wants to scold his wife, the Lord will immediately be unhappy, and often when the wife wants to buy the merchandise on sale on Saturday, the Lord will withdraw right away.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Surely we all have had this kind of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many times although He does not say anything, we know His feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sometimes we may be having enjoyable fellowship with Him, but at a certain point He turns His face away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a result, we realize that He does not agree with us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is because He is love, light, holiness, and righteousness, and we are not love, light, holiness, and righteousness at all.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Eventually, we will be subdued by Him and will do things according to His will.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the secret of experiencing Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord Jesus is the all-permeating Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is not only on the throne in the heavens but also in us at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Ephesians 3:17a says that He is even making His home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Our heart is composed of all the parts of our soul our mind, emotion, and will plus our conscience, the main part of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For Christ to make His home in every part of our heart, He must spread outward, permeating us part by part, and He must also go downward, taking root in us step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is invading us all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He first enters into our spirit and waits for the most opportune time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Once He has a chance, He enters into our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Sometimes we struggle with Him, trying to push Him out, but He is very patient.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He keeps struggling to move on, and eventually He invades our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Then He waits for another opportunity to enter into our emotion and will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may tell Him, Lord, don t go so fast.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Please slow down.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, the more we say this, the faster He comes.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the end, He invades our emotion and will also.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I have been invaded by the Lord for more than fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Today there is nearly no room in me left for myself; almost all the room has been occupied by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Even though I may not want to say, It is no longer I but Christ, I still have to say it because He has already occupied my entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I do not have any room for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Sometimes when I want to do something, immediately the Lord who is in me will say, You do it yourself; I am not doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Ultimately, I also cannot do it because it is no longer I but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In our practical daily living, is it I or is it Christ who lives?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>May this short and simple fellowship be a constant reminder to us.</S>
