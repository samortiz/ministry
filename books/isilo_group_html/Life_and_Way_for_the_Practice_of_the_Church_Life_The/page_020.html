Just before I came here this evening, around suppertime, I was with the Lord considering the message tonight. I had prepared a message which was different from what I am speaking now. I had everything ready for that message, but I sensed a darkness in me. Somehow I was in a shadow. Then when I was with the Lord, the sense came to me that I had to give the message which I am speaking here tonight. I said to the Lord, "Lord, no doubt, I will go along with You." Right away within me it was transparent. The cloud was lifted and the sky became clear.</P><P>How do you know that you are going along with the Lord? Just by checking in this way, "Am I clear? Or am I cloudy, smoggy, foggy?" If you have the cloud, the smog, or the fog, that means there is something between you and the Lord. You are on the wrong track. You need to be adjusted within. Some brothers like to make jokes. I would ask you, "After you make a joke, do you feel you are clear within? Or do you sense you are foggy, smoggy?" There is nothing wrong with your morality when you make jokes, but if you are a person who jokes too much, I am sure you are a person not taking Christ as life. If you are one who takes Christ all the time as life, you will not joke, because the life of Christ is not a joking life. Joking is unbecoming to the inner life. I use this illustration to show you how you can know whether you are in the flow or not, whether you are in the transparent spirit or under the clouds. When you take Christ as your life, you have joy, and you have the shining.</P><P>Now let us consider the law of life within us. The life is the law. With any kind of life, in principle, there is a law. The divine life, which is Christ Himself, is the very law. Christ within you is not just the life, the light, the fellowship, and the joy, but also the law. You have an inner, living regulating. You have some regulations within you, not written in word but written in the Spirit. The inner regulating of this life is deep, strict, and fine.</P><P>You know what is right and what is wrong; you know what you should do and what you should not do. You know because you have the regulating within you. Since I learned the lesson of the inner law of life, I realize one thing&#151;there is no need for you and me to tell people what is right and what is wrong, what to do and what not to do. Whenever a saint comes to me and asks me something about good or evil, right or wrong, I always answer him by asking, "How do you feel?" You know the answer. There is a living rule within you, and this living rule is Christ Himself. He is not only the life, the light, and the flow; He is also the law.</P><P>In the Old Testament times God gave Moses the Ten Commandments as the law. That law is the description, the definition, of God. By that law we know what kind of God He is. But today in the New Testament times, God Himself comes into us as the law. The old law of letters consisted of words written as the description of God. Today God Himself comes into us as the living law. This is something subjective, something inside of us; it is not something objective, something outside of us. The Lord Himself, the living One, is the law within us. What kind of relationship should you have with Him? It is not according to the regulations of the so-called church or according to doctrinal teachings, but according to the inner regulating.</P><P>In the Old Testament times, an Israelite could do a lot of good things, and he could even sacrifice himself and all that he had for others. In spite of all the good things that he had done, if he did something against the law, he still had a problem before God. Today it is the same with us related to the law of life. If we are not right with the inner regulating, no matter how many good things we may have done, we know there is a problem within between us and God. Maybe we would preach the gospel, minister the word, and do a lot of things to help others, but we know there is a problem between us and God because we are wrong with the inner regulating.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Life and Way for the Practice of the Church Life &nbsp; pg 20</div><br></body></html>
