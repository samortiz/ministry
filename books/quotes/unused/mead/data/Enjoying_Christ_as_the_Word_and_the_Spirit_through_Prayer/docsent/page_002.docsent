   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE TRANSFERRING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>INTO THE SPIRIT BY PRAYER Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 6:63; 1 Cor 15:45b; Acts 6:4; 2:42; 10:9; Isa 56:7</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible reveals that God is our enjoyment and that all the riches of God, what God is in His fullness, are the riches of Christ Eph 3:8, 19b .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the fullness of God is embodied in Christ Col 1:19 and becomes the items of the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The reality of Christ is the Spirit, who is the Spirit of reality John 14:17 , and all that Christ is, that is, all the riches of Christ, are revealed in the Word 1:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, in order to know the riches of Christ, we have to know the Word, which is the revelation of all that Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Moreover, the place in which we realize the Triune God is our human spirit 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order to realize Christ and always enjoy Him, we have to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is no other way to enjoy Him, and there is no other organ with which we can enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to exercise our spirit to realize all that God is in Christ through the Holy Spirit and as revealed in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These five items God, Christ, the Holy Spirit, the Word, and our spirit are the factors of our enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>CHRIST FIRST BEING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>AND THEN BECOMING THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is first revealed as the Word, and in His resurrection He was transferred from the Word into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, our experience of Christ is an experience of constantly transferring the word into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 6:63 is a great verse in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It says, It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word is spirit, and the Spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word is life to us only when it is transferred into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do not have the word of life directly.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need a step in between; that is, the word must be spirit in order to be life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Without this step, the word is mere knowledge to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to know the Scriptures and to know life, we must be familiar with and very clear about all these principles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we will have the keys to open the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Otherwise, no matter how many times we read the Word, we will read it in a blind and foolish way, and it will never be clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The four Gospels tell us that the Lord Jesus came as the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the beginning, in eternity before the foundation of the world, He was the Word, and in time He came in incarnation John 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the New Testament begins with Christ as the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then at the end of the Gospel of John Christ became the Spirit as the breath of life 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This Gospel begins with the Word and ends with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Word and the Spirit are not two persons; they are one person with two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>First He was the Word, and eventually He became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With the help of the Epistles we can realize who this Spirit is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The proper term used for this Spirit is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Corinthians 15:45b says, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Again we see that the Bible is opened by this one principle, that the Word becomes the Spirit as life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ is the Word, Christ has become the Spirit, and this Spirit is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE WAY TO TAKE THE WORD AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is by the Word through the Spirit that Christ is life to us and imparts life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to the letter of the Bible, many Christians know that Christ is life, but not many can say how Christ can be life to us practically.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must be clear that Christ is life to us because He is the Word who became the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now in order to receive, realize, and experience Christ as our life, we must know the Word and how to transfer the Word into the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the way to take Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>From my youth I heard Christian teachers say that the word of the Bible is life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, they did not tell me how the black and white printed words of the Bible can be life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The answer is that the word in black and white must be transferred into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the word is merely in letters, it is not life; it is mere knowledge that kills 2 Cor 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is when the word is transferred into the Spirit that it becomes life, because it is not the words directly but the Spirit who gives life.</S>
