   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. Flowing Out to Dispense Himself</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>with His Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>as the Life Element, the Life Supply</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God is flowing out to dispense Himself with His divine life as the life element, the life supply Christ as the tree of life , to meet the need of His elect and to be their pleasures and satisfaction Rev 22:1-2; cf.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Psa 36:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this purpose, when Christ died on the cross, not only blood, signifying redemption judicially, flowed forth but also water, signifying the water of life organically to be dispensed into God's elect John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are the Lord's elect.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Praise Him that He chose us and then called us to receive Him, the flowing God as the fountain, with Christ as the element in the flow.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>What pleasure and what satisfaction!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Psalm 36:8 and 9 say, "They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For with thee is the fountain of life; in thy light shall we see light."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I picked up two words from these verses: satisfied and pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A saved person should be satisfied with Christ and filled up with God's pleasures.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the way to study the Bible to get the intrinsic, central line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Fountain, pleasures, and satisfaction are seen in Psalm 36.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Without these three words, this psalm is merely the dead letter, which is vanity of vanities, to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But within this psalm, we can see God as a fountain flowing like a river to satisfy us and fill us up with His pleasures.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>John 19:34 says that when Christ died on the cross, blood and water flowed out of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>No other Gospel records this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John is a book of signs, just like the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Both blood and water are signs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Blood signifies redemption judicially, and water signifies life flowing organically to be dispensed into God's elect.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As those who are God's elect, we are in the marvelous line of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. God's Flowing Out Being "Bright As Crystal"</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the New Jerusalem, the jasper stone is clear as crystal 21:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>C. The Lord's Calling with a Promise 1.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What a promise and what a calling!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This immoral Samaritan woman had many husbands.</S>
