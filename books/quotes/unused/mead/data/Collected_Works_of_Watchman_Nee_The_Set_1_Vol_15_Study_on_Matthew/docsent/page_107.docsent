   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prudence or foolishness does not refer to one's nature but to the difference in outward behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We can prove this from one instance in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>See Matthew 7:24-26.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The prudent one is the one who puts into practice the Lord's words.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The foolish one is the one who does not.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The "rock" refers to the Lord's words, and "sand" refers to man's opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To build on the rock means to base everything on God's words.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The foolish one bases everything on his own opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Proverbs says that the fear of God is the root of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before God, to be simple-minded is wise, and to disobey is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In God's word, it is foolish to say "but," "or," "according to my opinion."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To do things according to God's word is utterly foolish in the eyes of man but is prudent in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The two kinds of virgins differ only in two respects: the prudent took oil in their vessels, whereas the foolish did not.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The prudent could participate in the feast, while the foolish were excluded.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, they have much in common: 1 they were all virgins; 2 they all carried a lamp, signifying their outward behavior; 3 their lamps were lighted, signifying a conduct that glorified God; 4 there was oil, representing the Holy Spirit, in their vessels; 5 they all went out to meet the bridegroom, that is, they were all waiting; 6 they all slept; 7 they all heard the midnight cry; 8 they all arose, signifying resurrection; and 9 they all trimmed their lamps, that is, they all prepared the oil.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although the two kinds of virgins have much in common, slight differences can produce widely divergent results.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Should we not then be careful in our behavior?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The cause determines the effect.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A deviation today will cause a further deviation tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All future deviations arise from present deviations.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether it will be glory or shame in the future depends on how we make our choice today.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The foolish virgins did not take oil.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This oil is in addition to the oil that is already in the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The five prudent virgins took oil in their vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The lamp here refers to outward behavior Matt 5:16, "light" refers to good works that glorify the Father , whereas oil refers to the Holy Spirit cf.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Exo 30:22-33; Zech 4:2, 12; Heb 1:9; 1 John 2:20, 27 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here there are two kinds of analogies: the oil in the lamp and the oil in the vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The oil in the lamp typifies the Holy Spirit, who dwells in the regenerated person.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Every Christian has the indwelling Holy Spirit see Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>36:26; Eph 1:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Proverbs 20:27 ASV says, "The spirit of man is the lamp of Jehovah, / Searching all his innermost parts."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Romans 8:9 tells us that all the regenerated ones have the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From 2 Corinthians 13:5 and 1 John 3:24; 4:13 we see that if a man is not disapproved, then Jesus Christ lives in him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Lord lives in us through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Having oil in the vessel means that there is not only the indwelling of the Holy Spirit but also the infilling of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At the time of regeneration we have the Holy Spirit dwelling within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But the infilling by the Holy Spirit is conditioned upon our pursuit of the Lord after regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every believer has the Holy Spirit, but not every believer is filled by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are two kinds of filling: 1 being filled with the Holy Spirit and 2 being full of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The former is related to the gift for the work, while the latter is related to the holiness of life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The oil in the vessel includes these two kinds of fillings: being filled and being full of.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The vessel is something apart from the lamp and is not the main emphasis of this parable.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It does not have any special significance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since oil is not a solid, it needs a vessel to contain it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God's desire is that we will not only have oil in the lamp but will also be filled with and full of oil.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A student's goal in studying is not just to pass the examination that is, to be saved but also to excel that is, to be filled .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>To prepare the lamp is not the best way; neither is any kind of dressing up.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What God cares for is the extra oil.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet believers today pay attention only to the outward appearance of the lamp.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The less oil there is, the more they strive to dress up with a nice appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Shining the lamp, however, cannot replace the need for oil.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We think that it is enough to have oil once, but God requires that we have oil twice.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The second oil is different from the first oil.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The first time we receive the oil, it is freely given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The second time, we gain it by paying a price.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Whoever is not willing to pay the price, deny the self, and pursue the oil will never obtain the second oil.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May we all be watchful!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we are loose and lazy today, others may not be able to tell whether we have the second oil or not.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But no laziness will escape that day; in that day all will be tried.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Believers, are you willing to pay the price?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The filling of the Holy Spirit is the condition for rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A balloon can rise only when it is filled with gas.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The same is true with us.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, let us all pay the price to prepare oil in our vessel, lest we become the foolish virgins.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Verses 5-7:"And while the bridegroom delayed, they all became drowsy and slept.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But at midnight there was a cry, Behold, the bridegroom!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Go forth to meet him!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then all those virgins arose and trimmed their own lamps."</S>
