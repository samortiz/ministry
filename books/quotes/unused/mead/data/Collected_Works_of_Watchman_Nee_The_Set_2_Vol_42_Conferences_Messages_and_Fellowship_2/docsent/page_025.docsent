   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No one can testify for the Lord without knowing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The extent of our knowledge of Christ determines the magnitude of the testimony we bear.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Knowing Christ is knowing the power of His resurrection.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Who is qualified to bear His testimony?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The question is whether or not we know Christ and whether or not we know the power of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is easy to have the power of the Spirit, but having the power of the Spirit is not the goal.</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>OF THE POWER OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A testimony is not a doctrine; we cannot come up with a testimony from our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A testimony is also not a theology; it is not a biblical exposition of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can only testify of the Christ whom we know.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We cannot testify of Christ beyond what we know of Him.</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This may happen within a second.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>There is no need for us to exert any effort.</S>
