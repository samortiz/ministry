<h2 class=head1>XV. FINE FLOUR IN A PAN</h2><p>“And if your offering is a meal offering in a pan, it shall be made of fine flour with oil” (Lev. 2:7). The fine flour in a pan signifies Christ’s humanity in another kind of suffering. All the other items in this offering are the same in significance as those in the offering of fine flour on the griddle.<h2 class=head1>XVI. GREEN EARS</h2><p>In verses 14 through 16 we read of another category of meal offering—green ears.<h2 class=head2>A. Produced of the Harvest of the Labor on the Field</h2><p>The green ears are produced of the harvest of the labor on the field. This signifies that our labor on Christ produces the harvest with green ears. Green ears are very tender, very fresh, and very tasty.<h2 class=head2>B. As the Firstfruit of Green Ears</h2><p>The firstfruit of the green ears signifies the fresh enjoyment of Christ in His resurrection. Christ was the grain sown into the earth; He died and grew up in resurrection to produce green ears (John 12:24). These green ears are the firstfruit of His resurrection.<h2 class=head2>C. Crushed</h2><p>Leviticus 2:14 speaks of “crushed grain from fresh ears.” The word crushed signifies being dealt with by the cross of Christ. The green ears had to be crushed; that is, they had to pass through the crossing out of Christ’s death. This indicates that if we would live a life by Christ as the meal offering, we cannot avoid the cross. We need to experience the crushing; this is the experience of being crossed out by Christ’s death.<h2 class=head2>D. With Oil on the Meal Offering</h2><p>“And you shall put oil on it and place frankincense upon it; it is a meal offering” (v. 15). The oil upon the meal offering signifies the Holy Spirit poured upon Christ’s humanity.<h2 class=head2>E. With Frankincense upon the Meal Offering</h2><p>Frankincense was to be placed upon the meal offering. As we have pointed out, this signifies the fragrance of Christ’s resurrection upon His humanity.<h2 class=head2>F. Some Ears, Some Oil, and All the Frankincense Burned on the Altar</h2><p>“And the priest shall offer up in smoke as its memorial portion some of its crushed grain and its oil, with all its frankincense, as an offering by fire to Jehovah” (v. 16). The burning on the altar of some ears, some oil, and all the frankincense signifies that Christ’s humanity in its freshness, with the Holy Spirit and the fragrance of Christ’s resurrection, is offered to God as food for His satisfaction. Again we see that a portion of the meal offering—the best portion—is for God’s food.<h2 class=head2>G. As a Memorial</h2><p>God’s portion of the meal offering is offered up as a memorial. It is a memorial because of its satisfying effect. This portion is so satisfying to God’s taste that it becomes a memorial.
