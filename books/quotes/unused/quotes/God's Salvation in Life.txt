God's desire and purpose in creating man is that He may be man's life , and this is symbolized by the tree of life
At the beginning, in the first two chapters, it speaks of how God created the universe with all the things therein including mankind
We all have heard of the apple tree, the grape vine, the apricot tree, and others, but we probably have not heard of the tree of life
Not only so, after mentioning the tree of life in the first two chapters, the Bible does not mention it again until at the end
The Bible tells us that God created the heavens, the earth, the animals, the plants, and the creeping things, and then He created man
In Psalm 36 it says, 'They are saturated with the fatness of Your house, / And You cause them to drink of the river of Your pleasures
We know that there is the plant life, there is the animal life, there is the human life, and there is the divine life
After God created man He wanted man to take in the tree of life that is He wanted man to receive God Himself into him to be his life supply
Before man ate of the tree of life and would thereby receive God, the devil seduced man to eat of another tree and receive him
The devil is symbolized by the other special tree in the Garden of Eden, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil
We have love; we love our parents, we love our relatives, we love our neighbors, we love our schoolmates, and we love others
According to the Holy Scriptures, we are good with regard to God's creation, but with regard to the devil's corruption we are evil
When a man gets older, he becomes older in his outward transgressions and thus becomes an experienced transgressor
Redemption was added because man became fallen and was corrupted and thereby became a sinner and a transgressor
The angels and the devil would shake their heads and say, 'You are a God of righteousness, light, holiness, and glory
God's redemption, with the precious blood of Christ as its focus, was necessary in order to meet the need of the judicial aspect
Although you have made up your mind to do good, it is not up to you when you are surrounded by the power of evil
In this full salvation God has prepared for us fallen sinners, one of its elements is to redeem us, and the other element is to save us
In a certain university in America, among the top students there was a student in second place who tried to kill the best student
After becoming a department head, he wants to be the vice president, and after becoming the vice president, he hopes to be the president
One day the husband was offended in the office and was still full of anger after he left the office and got into his car
Covetousness, lust, pride, and anger are the four monsters within us that cause us to not behave properly as human beings
One day, four thousand years after man was created, God was incarnated to become a man, and His name was Jesus
One day He went to the cross and shed His blood to die for us, to bear our sins, and to solve all our problems
Since He was in union with mankind, when He died as a man, we also were brought by Him to the cross to die there
The salvation of God is carried out by His imparting Himself to us to be in us through the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus
He brought the human race with Him to be resurrected, and in this resurrection He regenerated those whom He had chosen
The Christ who died and resurrected was God incarnated to be a man to die for us and to bring us with Him into His resurrection
God's salvation in life consists of four major steps: regeneration, transformation, conformation, and glorification
Regeneration does not mean that 'all the things of the past died yesterday and all the things henceforth are born today,' as some may think
We all can testify that if in the morning we do not pray or call on Him, we feel empty and restless throughout the day
God in His salvation ordained that man, who was chosen and created by Him, should be regenerated in addition to being created
Before the foundation of the world, when the heavens and the earth were not yet in existence, and before we were born, God chose us
The first aspect is to be born of water by being convicted concerning sin and by repenting of and confessing our sins
John 1:12 says, 'But as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name'
He redeemed us by dying on the cross for our sins; then He regenerated us by entering into us through His becoming the life-giving Spirit
The first issue of regeneration is that we become the children of God with the divine life and the divine nature
The second issue of regeneration is that we are members of the household of God, those who are of the household of the faith
Originally Christ was alone by Himself; then He regenerated us one by one, and we all became His members, His increase
John 3 first speaks of regeneration and then it speaks of us the regenerated ones being His increase which is His counterpart and His bride
The sixth issue of regeneration is that as the increase of Christ we constitute the Body of Christ as the fullness the expression of Christ
These are the members of Christ who constitute the Body of Christ, which is the church as the expression of the fullness of Christ
Not only so, this nature of the divine life builds us together to constitute us the Body of Christ, which is His church
We have seen clearly that the unique heart's desire of God in the universe is to work Himself into us to be our life
He was born in a royal family, being a descendant of King David, but at that time the royal family was in complete ruin
The Creator of the heavens and the earth actually lived in that little cottage for thirty-three and a half years and worked as a carpenter
He was the One who died to make redemption for all our sins, to solve our problems, and to terminate our old man
A rich man took His body, wrapped it in linen cloths with precious spices, and laid it in a new tomb hewn in the rock
Before the heavens and the earth were in existence, before we were born, we believers all had been chosen and predestinated by God
Lord, You are the Lord who was God, who became the life-giving Spirit through incarnation, death, and resurrection
Many Christians change their behavior this way, and their relatives praise them, saying, 'It is good to be a Christian
What is the difference between the behavioral improvement of Confucius' disciples and the transformation of Jesus' believers?
They did not realize that what the teachings of Confucius produced, at most, was an improvement in behavior and not a transformation
Transformation is not merely a noticeable change outwardly in behavior; rather, it is a metabolic transformation inwardly in essence
The first step of transformation is that God has washed us, but this washing is not an outward washing by water
To be born of water is to confess that we are sinners who are condemned, who suffered the penalty of death, and who are buried
Now that he is saved, when he wears these shoes, he feels that there is too much of a worldly flavor, so he cannot wear them
Praise the Lord, after two or three meetings his headdress was gone, and after another week his long beard was also gone
She had gone to Shanghai by herself to study law in the university so that she might come back to fight for her inheritance
The Lord wants us who love Him to have our spirit spread into our soul that we may always set our mind on our spirit
Starting from the outside we have the body the soul and the spirit whereas starting from the inside we have the spirit the soul and the body
The renewing of the mind is the foundation of the transformation of our soul, and it is the result of our setting our mind on the spirit
God, who is Spirit, cannot dwell firstly in our body or in our soul; He has to take our spirit as His dwelling place
We who are saved have God in our spirit, and yet at times we do not follow God in our spirit but rather follow our flesh
When we set our mind on this mingled spirit immediately we are joyful uplifted and released we also feel satisfied watered and enlightened
Previously we thought that we were quite all right, but now we see that our love is just our own love and not God's love
The Lord is so fine and detailed that He interferes even in the matter of how long or how short our hair should be
To see what the mind of the Lord is requires us to return to our spirit and follow the Spirit who is life within us
In the blood circulation, new elements and good elements must be added into the blood; otherwise, the blood circulation will be useless
When the Chinese speak of taking care of the body, they mean eating better so that the blood may gain the nutrients
The blood brings the new nutrients to the different parts of the body, and at the same time, it discharges the old elements from the body
If we were to change ourselves, we would not have the new elements, and our change would be only an outward cosmetic change
The transformation which the Lord is carrying out in us is with the bountiful supply of the all-inclusive Spirit
The metabolic transformation cannot be carried out in a hurry; rather, it is like taking Chinese medicine where the effect is gradual
By the power of His life and with His life elements we shall gradually be metabolically transformed to have His life shape
What is most important is that through the renewing of our mind we shall gradually be transformed into His image
The way of transformation is by an increase and an advance, that is, advancing from one degree of glory to another degree of glory
In the pathway of transformation, we proceed from one level of glory to another level of glory, from glory to glory, progressively
Since that time the Spirit of God has passed through various processes with the Lord Jesus and has been consummated
Today this Spirit is not merely the Spirit of God but also the Spirit of Jesus the Spirit of Christ and even more the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Our being transformed into the same image as the Lord, which is mentioned in 2 Corinthians 3:18, is from this Spirit, the Lord Spirit
He supplies us within continually, dispensing the riches of Christ and the fullness of God into our whole being
The Spirit does not simply improve us; instead, He transforms us, who are not God, into God-men and unites us with God as one
When we are transformed, we obtain Christ as the element of the divine life and grow and mature in the divine life
The second issue of our transformation is that we arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
The purpose of transformation is the building up of the Body of Christ and the accomplishing of God's eternal economy
Not only will our spirit be regenerated and our soul be transformed, but our body also will be redeemed and transfigured
He died and resurrected, and in resurrection He was transfigured to become a life-giving Spirit that He might enter into us
Conformation is the effect of transformation in life , with the firstborn Son of God, the God-man who joins God to man, as the mold
Both the inward and the outward changes in us, the product, are the results of the operation of the law of the Spirit of life in our being
When He became in the likeness of men, entering into the condition of humanity, He was found in the lowly image of a man who embodied God
Other times when He spoke, people might not have seen much glory there, but the words they heard Him speak were truly glorious
He can conform us to such an image that we may live such a Godman life a life in which the divine attributes are expressed in human virtues
These different fruit trees do not need the gardener to provide molds for them to produce different kinds of fruit
Apple trees produce fruit in the shape of apples, and for thousands of years the shape of apples has remained unchanged
When it grows in the womb, it develops ears, eyes, nose, and other parts of the body until it grows into a boy or a girl
Today we who believe in Christ have both the human life and the divine life; the divine life can transform our human life
The caterpillar grows and grows until finally it becomes a butterfly, and what is left of the original caterpillar is just an empty cocoon
If we have a bad temper, we will think that we need the Holy Spirit to adjust us so that we would not have a bad temper
When He came in, He brought with Him some factors and elements with which to transform us in our inward being day by day
The apostle Paul said in Philippians 1:19, 'This will turn out to salvation through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ'
Originally He was merely God, but now by putting on human nature through His incarnation, He has become a God-man
In His wisdom and by His sovereignty God planned and prepared the cross, and on this cross Jesus, the God-man, was crucified
In this Spirit there is the power of resurrection that releases the divine life, the eternal life, the uncreated life
God was incarnated to be Christ, Christ was transfigured to become the Spirit, and the Spirit comes into us with all these elements
In order to know and experience this power of Christ we need to be joined and conformed to the death of Christ
To be conformed to the image of the firstborn Son of God is to take the life-giving Spirit, the pneumatic Christ, as our life and person
Ephesians 4:24 says, 'And put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality'
The more we put off the old man and put on the new man, the more we will be like God in His righteousness and holiness
The more we put on the new man, the more we will manifest the image of God's righteousness and holiness in our living
Stanza 1 says, 'Lo, the central thought of God / Is that He be one with man; / He to man is everything / That He might fulfill His plan'
Stanza 9 says, 'God in man and man in God / Mutual dwelling thus possess; / God the content is to man, / And the man doth God express'
The central thought of God is that He be one with man; He wants to be everything to man that He might fulfill His plan
After He regenerates us, He dwells in our spirit, and from that time on He wants to spread out daily from our spirit
We have a glorious hope, that is, that one day He will come to transfigure our body so that we may enter into God fully
From the inside to the outside we will have the life of God, the nature of God, and the glorious expression of God
He was God, who came into humanity, put on humanity, and died on the cross to terminate everything negative and release His life
Now we are waiting for the fourth step of God's salvation in life, that is, the transfiguration and glorification of our body
Objectively, glorification is that the redeemed believers will be brought into the glory of God to participate in the glory of God
Sometimes we feel that we are very far away from the glory of God, but this kind of feeling is only partially accurate
On the other hand, we are being transformed into the image of the Lord, with glory upon glory, that is, from glory to glory
In springtime when all kinds of flowers are blooming, none of these beautiful flowers descend on the stems from the outside
If you are such a person, there is no glory of the Lord upon you, and there is no glory of God at all to be seen in you
Today if we endure sufferings for the Lord, this will increase the weight of glory that we will receive from the Lord
He wants us to live Him out in difficult situations, and He wants us to live Him out also in smooth situations
Regeneration is accomplished in our spirit, transformation is through our soul, and glorification is consummated in our body
The believers' entering into the glory of God to participate in the glory of God is their entering into God Himself to enjoy God Himself
Regardless of whether you are young or old rich or poor as long as you enjoy God and experience God you are glorious in the eyes of others
It is God's salvation in life saving us to the uttermost through regeneration, transformation, conformation, and glorification
With regard to God, the believers' glorification is the accomplishment of God's economy for the satisfaction of God's desire
