AND STRENGTHEN HUMANITY</h2>
<p>Created man is finite and earthly; God is uncreated, infinite, and heavenly. God is great and high, and we are small and low; hence, we cannot communicate with Him. Even if we had not sinned or fallen into the world and become the flesh, we would still be low. Thus, we need to be saved.</p>
<p>As human beings, we are not only low but also fallen. God&rsquo;s salvation first saves us out of our fallen situation and then uplifts us. When the infinite, eternal, high, and heavenly God enters into us, we have a change in nature. Our humanity is uplifted and strengthened. Salvation changes our nature from being low and limited to being high and unlimited. God saves us by entering into us and mingling Himself with us so that we can partake of His life and nature and obtain His element. The result of this mingling is that we can fellowship with God. However, neither God nor man is annulled.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 2:15 says, &ldquo;The spiritual man discerns all things.&rdquo; A spiritual man can discern all things because he has unlimited insight and heavenly wisdom. A limited man cannot discern all things; only an unlimited man can discern all things. Both unlimited insight and heavenly wisdom come from God; they are eternal. The extent of our unlimitedness is determined by the degree of our spirituality. It is not possible to know to what extent a spiritual man can love others; even he himself does not know the extent to which he can love others, because he is unlimited. A spiritual man also has unlimited power. In Ephesians Paul speaks of &ldquo;the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe&rdquo; and &ldquo;Him who is able to do superabundantly above all that we ask or think, according to the power which operates in us&rdquo; (1:19; 3:20). The words <em>surpassing greatness</em> and <em>superabundantly above</em> imply unlimitedness. The fellowship of Madame Guyon and Father Fenelon could transcend the limitations of time and space, because they touched infinity in their spirit. Finite man is mingled with the infinite God, such that what is finite becomes infinite and what is low becomes uplifted and strengthened. What a salvation!</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO LOSE THE SOUL BEING TO DENY THE SELF</h2>
<p>In order to experience death and resurrection, we must see that when the Lord was put to death on the cross, our soul-life, our old man, was crucified together with Him. Based on this seeing, we must deny the self. In addition to enlightening us, the Holy Spirit will work in our environment to break us. The most important step is for us to deny the self. Once we see that we are crucified with Christ, we must deny the self. To deny is to reject. This includes to detest, to condemn, to lose, and to forsake. Hence, to deny our self is to reject our mind, our emotion, and our will. When the Lord asked those who followed Him to deny the self, He was asking them to lose their soul-life (Matt. 16:24-26; Luke 9:24-25). This is the responsibility of every person who has received the revelation from the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The Lord likened Himself to a grain of wheat (John 12:24). In order for a grain of wheat to bear many grains, it must fall into the ground and die. The Lord was not forced to die, He died voluntarily: &ldquo;I lay down my life...No one takes it away from Me, but I lay it down of Myself&rdquo; (10:17-18). After coming down from the Mount of Transfiguration, He steadfastly set His face to go to Jerusalem (Luke 9:51), that is, to go to the cross to die. Just as the Lord walked into death, we should do the same. If we are selfish, self-satisfied, self-contented, self-pitying, self-loving, or self-confident, we cannot be saved, because we will be unwilling to deny the self. Hence, we must not be selfish, self-satisfied, self-contented, self-pitying, self-loving, or self-confident.</p>
<p>It is right not to have many opinions, but this does not mean that we should be mindless persons. We must be full of thoughts, but we must be willing to forsake our thoughts. This is to deny the self, that is, to die. When we deny our self and condemn our natural life, we are accepting the principle of death. If we are always willing to deny our mind, emotion, will, inclinations, and opinions, we will be setting our face toward Jerusalem in order to accept the death of the cross. People in the world commit suicide, but Christians deny the self through the cross. This kind of self-denial is death.</p>
<p>Once we experience death, we will experience resurrection. Our responsibility is to deny the self, and the Lord&rsquo;s responsibility is to resurrect. This was the experience of the Lord. He walked into death, but God raised Him from the dead. When we reject and deny the self, God will resurrect us and change our nature. If we take the responsibility to enter into death, God will take the responsibility to resurrect our mind. When our mind enters into death and resurrection, its function is changed, and God&rsquo;s element is mingled with us. Formerly, our mind possessed only the thoughts of the self, but after death and resurrection our thoughts express the element of God; our limited humanity gains the unlimited God. Even simple believers become wise and can understand messages that educated people have difficulty understanding. Through such a fellowship God is mingled with man, and man is also mingled with God.</p>
<p>A lifeless pebble that is buried in the soil will not change. A seed, however, possesses life; hence, when it is buried in the soil, it dies, enters into resurrection, and its life is multiplied. Similarly, the more we deny the self, the more we will enter into resurrection and the richer our humanity will become, because we are mingled with God. Unbelievers are like pebbles. Hence, it does not make any difference whether or not they deny the self. However, as believers, we have the life of God; hence, we are like grains of wheat. The more we deny the self, the more we are in resurrection. The more we forsake our own love, the more we will love others. Formerly, our love was low and limited, but our love in resurrection is heavenly and unlimited.</p>
<p>Every genuine spiritual experience depends on forsaking the soul, losing the soul, and putting the soul-life to death. God&rsquo;s unique work in us is to transform us from being natural to being heavenly and from being void of His element to being full of His element.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> </body></html>
