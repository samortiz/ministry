   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>35 THE TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Historically speaking, there was a temple in the ancient city of Jerusalem, but in the New Jerusalem there is no temple Rev 21:22 , for God Himself and Christ are the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We may ask, then, since God and Christ are the temple, are They the Dwellers within the city or are They the dwelling place?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The answer is, They are both.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They are the temple, where the serving ones will dwell and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A temple is a place where those who serve God dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have already seen how the dwellers are the dwelling place, and the dwelling place consists of the dwellers.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we would dwell in the church today, we must be built into it, we must become a part of it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is very subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The dwellers are also the dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we are not built into the New Jerusalem, we will never get into that city.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But here is something more: God is the very God whom we serve, but He is also the temple where we serve.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That means that we serve God in God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These thoughts are exceedingly deep.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Where are you serving God today?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Are you in a material building or an organization?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Oh, God and Christ are our temple!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must serve God in God; we must serve Christ in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God Himself and Christ Himself are the temple in which we serve God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>36 GOD'S DWELLING PLACE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The thirty-sixth point is that the holy city is also the dwelling place of God Rev 21:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God and Christ dwell in this city.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On one hand They are the temple in which we dwell, and on the other hand They are also the Dwellers within the city.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that the New Jerusalem is a mutual habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God dwells in us, and we dwell in God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church today is a habitation where God may dwell Eph 2:22 , and God is the home where we may dwell Psa 90:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is not a new concept.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ said in John 15, "Abide in me, and I in you" v. 4 . He is saying in essence, "I am your abode, and you are My abode." So together with God we become a mutual habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How profound!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To God we are the city, and to us God and Christ are the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have the presence of God and Christ as the temple to us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are not just before God's presence and Christ's presence; we are in God's presence and Christ's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The presence of God and Christ becomes a dwelling place for us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we would serve God and Christ in the church, we must be surrounded by God and Christ, and covered by God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must serve God and Christ in God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Oh, how much we need Him!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He is the One whom we serve, and He is even the temple in which we serve.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do you realize and experience God and Christ in such a way?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do you serve God and Christ in such a way?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is intensely subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Human logic argues that such a mutual habitation is absurd.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some may ask, "Who then is within, and who is without?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If God and Christ are within us, how can they ever be outside of us?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If God and Christ are in us, we can never dwell in God and Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The best logician can never comprehend this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But consider, the air is within us and the air is also outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The air is in me, and I am in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If the air were not in me, I would soon expire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>And if I were not in the air, I could never breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is not difficult to believe this subjective fact.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God and Christ are in you, and you are in God and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise Him!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We may experience this as a reality in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>One day, in the new heaven and new earth, we will realize this in the fullest way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We will see how much God and Christ are to us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He dwells in us, and we dwell in Him; so we will enjoy His presence to the uttermost!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>37 THE HOLIEST OF ALL</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This brings us to our thirty-seventh point.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Another reason the holy city is without a temple is that the whole city is the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>And since the city is foursquare and equal in three dimensions, the whole city is not just the temple, but the holiest of all.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>During the time of Noah and Abraham, the small tent and altar had very little shape.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There was no outer court, holy place, or holiest of all.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When God and the two angels visited Abraham, they abode with him outside the tent Gen 18 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then during the time of Moses there was the tabernacle with an altar, a building with more shape.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The holiest of holies in this tabernacle was in three equal dimensions.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Later, the temple of Solomon was built in the same pattern as the tabernacle, with the dimensions all enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>These second and third stages of God's building had more form.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Finally, the New Jerusalem, as the ultimate stage of God's building, has just one part: everything is swallowed up by the holiest of holies.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is no longer an outer court or a holy place.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Neither is there a need for the temple, for the whole city is the temple, and every part of the city has been translated into the holiest of all.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is one reason the city is called the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Such a city is the ultimate manifestation of God's building.</S>
