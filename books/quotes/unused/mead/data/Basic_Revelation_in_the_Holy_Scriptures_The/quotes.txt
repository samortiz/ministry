[2]  CHAPTER ONE GOD S PLAN Scripture Reading: Eph 1:4, 5, 9-11; 3:2, 8-9, 11; Col 1:25; 1 Cor 9:17; 1 Pet 1:1-2; Rom 8:30; Gen 1:26a, 27; 2:7; Zech 12:1
[3]  The divine revelation in the sixty-six books of the Bible is exceedingly profound.
[4]  The first three points are God s plan, Christ s redemption, and the Spirit s application.
[5]  Based upon His heart s desire, God made a purpose Eph 3:11 .
[6]  In Ephesians 1:10 and 3:9 the word oikonomia is used for household administration, which is God s plan to dispense Himself into His chosen people.
[7]  Paul s stewardship was the dispensing of the unsearchable riches of Christ into God s chosen people.
[8]  Following His selection, God predestinated us Eph 1:5; Rom 8:30 .
[9]  When God created man in His image and after His likeness, He did not put the divine life into him.
[10]  God created man with a spirit, although at the time of creation he did not have God s life.
[11]  Praise the Lord that we are here under God s plan and in His plan; that we have been made by Him in His image and after His likeness; that we have a spirit to receive Him; and that He, as the divine Spirit, has entered into our human spirit, making us His sons for His expression!
[12]  CHAPTER TWO CHRIST S REDEMPTION Scripture Reading: John 1:14; Heb 2:14; Rom 8:3; 2 Cor 5:21; John 3:14; 1 Pet 2:24; 1 Cor 15:3; Heb 9:28; Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20; Eph 2:15; John 12:24, 31; 19:34; 7:39; Luke 24:26; Acts 13:33; Rom 8:29; Heb 2:11-12; 1 Pet 1:3; Eph 2:6; 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17-18; John 20:22; Eph 1:20-21; Acts 2:36; Eph 1:22-23; Acts 2:33
[13]  In the eyes of God, man s fall involved the entire creation.
[14]  But the Bible also contains Romans 8:3, which says that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin.
[15]  The incarnation was wonderful, and the crucifixion is marvelous.
[16]  We have no human words to explain the incarnation in full; neither can we fully explain the fact of Christ s death.
[17]  According to Isaiah 53:6, when Christ was on the cross God took all our sins and put them upon this Lamb of God.
[18]  In Ephesians 2:15 Paul tells us that through His death on the cross, Christ abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances.
[19]  Christ s death was not only a terminating but also a releasing death.
[20]  His death released the divine life concealed within Him John 1:4 .
[21]  In resurrection Christ also became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .
[22]  In resurrection, the subject of 1 Corinthians 15, Christ as the last Adam, through His death and resurrection, became a life-giving Spirit.
[23]  Consider, then, what is included in His resurrection: He was glorified; He became the firstborn Son of God, making all of us His brothers; and He became the life-giving Spirit breathed into us to be with us forever John 14:16-20 .
[24]  CHAPTER THREE THE SPIRIT'S APPLICATION Scripture Reading: Gen 1:2; Judg.
[25]  To understand the Spirit's work in applying Christ's accomplishments, let us consider how the Spirit is gradually revealed throughout the Scriptures.
[26]  When I was young, I was taught that in Exodus 30:22-30 the anointing ointment is a type of the Holy Spirit.
[27]  But after God in the Son became a man and died on the cross, passing through death and resurrection and entering into ascension, the Spirit became the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19 , compounded with God's essence and Jesus' humanity and His death and resurrection.
[28]  The Holy Spirit is called the Spirit of Jesus in Acts 16:6-7.
[29]  The Holy Spirit of God is not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of the suffering Jesus and the Spirit of the resurrected Christ.
[30]  "The Spirit of the Lord" 2 Cor 3:17 indicates that the ascension of Christ is compounded with the Spirit.
[31]  "The Lord" in this verse refers to the crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ.
[32]  Paul says that the last Adam, through His resurrection and in His resurrection, became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45 .
[33]  He became not only a Spirit, but specifically a life-giving Spirit.
[34]  All these points indicate that in the last book of the divine revelation the Spirit of God, for the building up of the churches in a dark age, becomes the sevenfold, intensified Spirit, who carries out God's universal administration for the fulfilling of God's eternal purpose and fully expresses Christ as God's universal Administrator to bring in God's kingdom in the millennium Rev 20:4, 6 and to bring the kingdom to its ultimate consummation as the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth Rev 21:1-2 .
[35]  This wonderful Spirit eventually becomes so simple in title: the Spirit Rev 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 14:13; 22:17 .
[36]  In Revelation we have the seven Spirits and the Spirit.
[37]  In the seven epistles to the churches in Revelation, the beginning of each epistle refers to the Lord Jesus as the One writing to the church in a certain place.
[38]  When we call on the name of the Lord Jesus, we receive the Spirit as the reality of Christ John 14:17 , and this Christ, the Son of God, is the very embodiment of the Father Col 2:9 .
[39]  This compound, processed, all-inclusive Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.
[40]  Whatever He planned, whatever He has accomplished, whatever He will apply to us is all wrapped up in this compound Spirit.
[41]  We strongly emphasize these two spirits, the compound Spirit of the Trinity and the human spirit within us, because the compound Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God reaching us for our enjoyment, and the human spirit is the only means for us to receive such a rich compound Spirit that we may enjoy the riches of the Triune God and experience Him daily, even hourly.
[42]  CHAPTER FOUR THE BELIEVERS Scripture Reading: John 3:6; Matt 28:19; Gal 3:27; Rom 6:3; I Cor.
[43]  As part of our initial salvation, we have been positionally sanctified, that is, separated by God from the world unto Himself.
[44]  The death of Christ has fully fulfilled and satisfied God's righteous requirements, so that we are justified by God through His death Rom 3:24 .
[45]  BAPTIZED Into the Name of the Father, the Son,
[46]  After His resurrection and before His ascension, the Lord Jesus charged His disciples to go and disciple the nations, "baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit" Matt 28:19 ; that is, they were to baptize people into the very Person of the Triune God.
[47]  In Acts and in the Epistles, however, there is not one verse indicating that the apostles baptized people into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[48]  To be baptized into Christ equals to be baptized into the Triune God because the very Christ into whom we have been baptized is the embodiment of the Triune God.
[49]  After believing and being baptized, we are indwelt by the Spirit Rom 8:9, 11; 1 Cor 6:19 .
[50]  Few Christians pay attention to the growth in life 1 Cor 3:6-7 and the building up 1 Cor 3:10-12 as the Body of Christ and as the church, the house of God.
[51]  Spirituality comes out of the growth in life; the aim of the growth in life is the building up of the Body of Christ and of the house of God.
[52]  Finally, we shall be glorified in the divine life and divine nature Rom 8:30 to bear the glory of God for His expression in the New Jerusalem.
[53]  CHAPTER FIVE THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 16:18; 18:17; I Tim.
[54]  2:5; Eph 1:22-23; 3:19b; 2:15; 4:24; Col 3:10-11 Eph 5:25, 29, 32; John 3:29; Rev 19:7; 21:2, 9; 22:17; Eph 6:11-12; 1 Cor 12:12-13; Acts 8:1; 13:1; Rev 1:11-13, 20; I Cor.
[55]  The church is both God's household expressing God the Father and the Body of Christ expressing Christ as the One who is the embodiment of the Triune God Col 2:9 .
[56]  The church is also the house of God 1 Pet 2:5 .
[57]  By this we do not mean merely that the church is the dwelling of God.
[58]  God's dwelling place today on earth is the church, and God, as such a great Father, has a family, which is the church.
[59]  God's house, the family of God, is organic, but, in a sense, it is not as organic as the Body.
[60]  A group of Christians may be an assembly, but may not actually be the house of God because they do not live in the spirit.
[61]  Paul said he prayed that the Father would strengthen us with power through His Spirit into the inner man that Christ might make His home in our hearts, and that we might know Christ's dimensions the breadth, length, height, and depth that we might be filled unto, resulting in, the fullness of God, the expression of God Eph 3:14-19 .
[62]  The church today should be such an expression, issuing out of the rich enjoyment of the unsearchable riches of Christ.
[63]  We should bow our knees to the Father that He may strengthen us into our inner man that Christ may make His home in our hearts, fully settling down in every avenue, every part, of our inner being.
[64]  We will be filled with Him unto the fullness of God, the expression of God.
[65]  This is a group of people fully possessed by Christ and enjoying Christ to the uttermost, being saturated by Him and filled with Him to such an extent that they become an expression of God.
[66]  Ephesians 2:15 says that Christ through the cross "abolished in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances, that He might create the two in Himself into one new man."
[67]  Our life is Christ, our living is Christ, our intention is Christ, our ambition is Christ, our will is Christ, our love is Christ, and everything else about us is Christ.
[68]  In chapter four the new man fulfills God's purpose.
[69]  When Peter recognized that the Lord Jesus was the Christ and the Son of God, the Lord told him that He would build His church on this rock.
[70]  A lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God.
[71]  The church's foundation is Christ, revealed and ministered through the apostles and prophets.
[72]  CHAPTER SIX THE KINGDOM 1 Scripture Reading: Matt 3:1-2; 4:17; 10:1, 7; Luke 10:1, 9, 11; 4:43; Matt 24:14; Luke 17:20-21; John 3:3, 5; Mark 4:26-29; Acts 1:3; 8:12; 19:8; 20:25; 28:23, 30-31; Rom 14:17; 1 Cor 4:17, 20; 6:9-10; Gal 5:21; Eph 5:5; 2 Pet 1:3, 11; Rev 1:9 THE CHURCH AND THE KINGDOM
[73]  The Father's plan, the Son's redemption, and the Spirit's application produce the believers, who are the components of the church.
[74]  In Matthew 16:18-19 the Lord Jesus told Peter, "On this rock I will build My church, and..I will give to you the keys of the kingdom of the heavens" to open the doors of the kingdom.
[75]  Peter used one key on the day of Pentecost to open the gate for the Jewish believers to enter the kingdom of the heavens Acts 2:38-42 ; he used the other in the house of Cornelius to open the gate for the Gentile believers to enter the kingdom Acts 10:34-48 .
[76]  The first blue circle of the chart is the church, which is composed of the real Christians.
[77]  God's desire is to have a people who will go along with Him to overcome Satan and all the negative things.
[78]  The kingdom was first formed among the children of Israel.
[79]  In Exodus 19:6 the Lord told the children of Israel that they would be unto Him a kingdom of priests.
[80]  All things which relate to the divine life have been granted to us for an entrance into the kingdom 2 Pet 1:3, 11 .
[81]  Second Peter 1:3 says that "His divine power has granted to us all things which relate to life and godliness."
[82]  In Acts the kingdom was taught by the Lord after His resurrection.
[83]  Acts 1 :3 tells us that He was with the disciples for forty days, "speaking the things concerning the kingdom of God."
[84]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE KINGDOM 2 Scripture Reading: Matt 11:11; 16:18-19; 5:3, 10, 20; 7:21; 13:24-25; 25:1, 14; 19:28-29; 24:45-47; 25:19, 23; Rev 11:15; 20:4, 6; 1 Cor 15:24; Rev 21:1-2, 3-7; 22:2-5, 14, 17 THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE KINGDOM OF GOD
[85]  The ministry of John the Baptist begins the New Testament, but he himself was not in the kingdom of the heavens.
[86]  Matthew 11:11 confirms this: "Among those born of women, there has not arisen a greater than John the Baptist; yet he who is smallest in the kingdom of the heavens is greater than he."
[87]  The reality of the kingdom of the heavens, as the reality of the church life Rom 14:17 , is revealed in Matthew 5 through 7.
[88]  John 3:5 reveals that regeneration is our entrance into the kingdom of God.
[89]  To enter into the kingdom of God requires regeneration as a new beginning of our life John 3:3, 5 , but to "enter into the kingdom of the heavens" demands surpassing righteousness in our living after we have been regenerated Matt 5:20 .
[90]  Christians will either receive a reward or suffer discipline.
[91]  The reward is the kingship to be exercised by Christ with His faithful followers in the one thousand years.
[92]  The millennium has an earthly part and a heavenly part.
[93]  The earthly part is the kingdom of the Messiah 2 Sam 7:13 , the tabernacle of David Acts 15:16 , the kingdom of the Son of Man Matt 13:41; Rev 11:15 .
[94]  THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION 1 Scripture Reading: Rev 21:1-3, 9-14, 16-23; 22:1-2, 5, 14, 17 CREATION AND BUILDING
[95]  The wall of the city is made of jasper upon a foundation of twelve different precious stones Rev 21:18-20 .
[96]  In the New Testament we are charged to be careful how we build 1 Cor 3:10-12 .
[97]  The city and its street are pure gold like transparent glass 21:18b, 21b .
[98]  John says he saw "no temple in it, for its temple is the Lord God the Almighty and the Lamb" 21:22 .
[99]  The ultimate consummation is the bride, the wife of the Lamb 21:2, 9 .
[100]  THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION 2 Scripture Reading: Rev 1:1; 21:1-3, 10-21 THE KEY TO UNDERSTANDING
[101]  Revelation 1:1 says that God gave the revelation of Jesus Christ to Him to show to His slaves; "and He made it known by signs."
[102]  In Revelation 5:5 Jesus Christ is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah.
[103]  The great red dragon signifies the Devil, Satan 12:3-4 .
[104]  All these signs are the main scenes on this divine television screen of Revelation.
[105]  The telecast begins with seven lampstands, signifying the churches; then follow seven shining stars, signifying the messengers of all the churches; then there is a jasper stone, signifying God's appearance; then a lion and a lamb, both signifying Christ; then a universal woman with twelve stars on her head, the sun clothing her, and the moon under her feet; then a red dragon ready to swallow her child; then a man-child brought forth by her and raptured to the throne of God; then a beast coming up from the Mediterranean Sea; then a harvest on this earth, and out of the harvest a firstfruit; then a great prostitute, the great Babylon, terrible, ugly, abhorred; but then, hallelujah, a beautiful wife. the bride; then finally, something brighter, something greater, the New Jerusalem, which is God's tabernacle just as Jesus was God's tabernacle when He was on earth.
[106]  This New Jerusalem is not only a tabernacle to God but also a wife to God's Son, Jesus Christ.
[107]  Revelation 1:1 is the key verse to the entire book.
[108]  If in this age we can dwell in God, taking Him as our dwelling place, and can give God a place in us, it is not logical to think that in eternity we will no longer have Him as our dwelling place, but rather live in a golden city as our dwelling place.
[109]  If the New Jerusalem were an actual city made of gold, pearls, and precious stones, it would mean that a physical city was the conclusion of the entire revelation.
[110]  I hope we will all be impressed with the proper interpretation and understanding of this last and greatest sign in the entire Bible.
[111]  God, through creation, incarnation, redemption, resurrection, ascension, and all His transforming, building work through all these Christian centuries, will get a living composition of His redeemed people to be His dwelling and His counterpart to fully satisfy Him.
[112]  THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION 3 Scripture Reading: Rev 21:2-3, 10-23; 22:1-2a, 14, 17, 19 TWO MAIN SCHOOLS OF INTERPRETATION
[113]  When we come to Jacob, without the divine light we can see only a naughty boy.
[114]  "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God," and this Word became flesh John 1:1, 14 .
[115]  The New Jerusalem is the consummation of such a temple.
[116]  Based upon this principle, we cannot say that it is a physical city or a heavenly mansion.
[117]  This composition will be a mutual abode, for God to dwell in the saints and for the saints to dwell in God.
[118]  Revelation 21:17b says the wall's measurement is "a measure of a man, that is, of an angel."
[119]  In Matthew 22:30 the Lord Jesus indicated that in resurrection man will be "as angels of God in heaven."
[120]  THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION 4 Scripture Reading: Rev 21:3-4, 6-7, 24, 26; 22:2-5, 14, 17
[121]  Ephesians 1:4-5 tells us that before the foundation of the world God predestinated us unto sonship.
[122]  When I was young, I loved these verses, but I thought God had predestinated me unto heaven.
[123]  Every chosen one is a sinner, even an enemy to God, but God has the redemptive ability to make you, who are a sinner and an enemy of His, one of His sons.
[124]  Romans 8 says, "As many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God" v. 14 . God has not given us a spirit of slavery but a spirit of sonship v. 15 . His Spirit witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God v. 16 . The entire creation is eagerly expecting this sonship of ours v. 19 . God is now conforming us to the very image of the Firstborn, Christ v. 29 . We are His brothers today, but not fully.
[125]  In the new heaven and new earth there are two categories of people.
[126]  When we are in the New Jerusalem, we will be the sons of God, not the peoples of God.
[127]  John tells us in Revelation 1:6 that Christ has made us "a kingdom, priests to His God and Father."
[128]  The peoples of God in Revelation 21 are a remnant of the sheep described in Matthew 25:31-46.
[129]  When the Lord Jesus comes back, He will sit on His throne of glory in Jerusalem and will gather all the living, different peoples of the nations to Him.
