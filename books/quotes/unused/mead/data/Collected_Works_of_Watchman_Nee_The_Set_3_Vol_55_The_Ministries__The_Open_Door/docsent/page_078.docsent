   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I have no other intention than to exhort the brothers and sisters to not miss our special opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There have never been as many wonderful and numerous opportunities as those that we are facing today.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we but open our eyes a little, we will see these opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Let me repeat: We should not miss any opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we seize every opportunity, we will stop many things from happening.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we grasp every opportunity, distracting situations will not develop in some areas.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Diversions developed in some areas because the brothers were lazy and poor.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The brothers should be strong to take action.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Once God moves, we should move.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not give up any opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I am happy that God has given us opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When an opportunity comes, we find money coming as well; souls are saved, and the work advances.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we just afford these opportunities a little opening, they rush in. The problem, however, is that opportunities do not wait for us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God opens the way for us to do something, we must do it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Once time moves on, the opportunity is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we wait until tomorrow to do something, we will miss the opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It may be useful to talk to a brother today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, if we wait until tomorrow, it may no longer be useful because the opportunity is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We must have spiritual insight, and we must have spiritual senses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must ask God to preserve each opportunity He has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Recently, I experienced a great change in my feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I believe the Lord wants our senses to be sharpened.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we make any mistakes now, we will lose the God-given opportunities, and once these opportunities are gone, we may have to wait a few decades before they will come again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Perhaps I will conclude my words here.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But I still want to bring up some practical matters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once the new believer edification meetings are well established, I believe we should find a way to reach out to the groups that love the Lord and are amicable to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should establish fellowship with them and bring them to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the past our emphasis was to gain sinners from among the "Gentiles."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Among believers, we only sought to bring in individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We were afraid that people would say we were stealing sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We were hesitant to go out to them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This was our attitude in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even to this day, we have taken this way.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was what the Lord wanted us to do in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After the second Kuling conference, my feeling began to change.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It was not a doctrinal change.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Over the past three months, this inward feeling has become stronger and stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today I feel that we must not only gain lovers of the Lord individually but must gain group after group of those who love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Suppose there is a group of people who love the Lord in a pure way, who are not a mixed denomination.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Suppose further that the people there do not know the church and have not taken the same way as us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When the new believer edification meetings are well established, I think the Lord will want us to fellowship with such a spiritual group.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course, if the new believer edification meetings are not strong, we cannot stand up easily.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the brothers must be mobilized to go out and reach these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We did not do this in the past; we must do it now.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must pray much.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Everyone must consider before the Lord to see if these feelings will grow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On the one hand, we must emphasize the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>On the other hand, we must pay attention to the spiritual groups.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We will gain not only individuals but entire groups.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The responsible brothers in each locality must see if this is what the Lord wants us to do today.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, there is the "Family of Jesus" Church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Perhaps the time has come when we should gain them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can learn something from them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They know more than we do and are more advanced than we are in the matter of possessing all things in common and living the communal life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They can help us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Perhaps, we can help them concerning the truth of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This can become a great move of God in China.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May God lead us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If this is His opportunity, I hope we do not miss it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If our goal is to bring all the groups that love the Lord into the same way, there are many other spiritual groups aside from the Family of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>All the brothers and sisters have to rise up to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We want to turn them as a group.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am presenting this matter before us today in a simple way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I hope we will spend some quiet time to meditate upon such God-given opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is the opportunity of opportunities.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We do not want to miss it; we want to take advantage of it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We must repent and confess our sins for having missed so many opportunities!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have continually dropped the opportunities which God has given us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we had not lost so many opportunities, there would be more than one meeting hall and one place for training today.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>There would be more than one communal farm today.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I hope that from now on, no opportunity will escape our feelings and our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we take the way of opportunities, perhaps we will be able to gain a few more steps along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Shanghai,</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>July 19, 1950</S>
