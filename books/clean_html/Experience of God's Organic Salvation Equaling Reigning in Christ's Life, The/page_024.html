<h2 class="head1">I. IN ESTABLISHING NOT OUR OWN RIGHTEOUSNESS<br />BUT GOD&rsquo;S RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>We reign in life in establishing not our own righteousness but God&rsquo;s righteousness (Rom. 9:14&mdash;10:4). The Israelites, being ignorant of God&rsquo;s righteousness, seek to establish their own righteousness by trying to keep the law, and have not submitted themselves to the righteousness of God, which is Christ Himself. This is an insult to God, and it causes them to miss the way of God&rsquo;s salvation. We have believed in Christ and have therefore received God&rsquo;s righteousness. This is to establish God&rsquo;s righteousness, which is Christ Himself.</p><h2 class="head2">A. Being Exceptionally Strengthened<br />in Establishing Not Our Own Righteousness<br />but God&rsquo;s Righteousness in Our Reigning with Christ</h2><p>We are exceptionally strengthened in establishing not our own righteousness but God&rsquo;s righteousness in our reigning with Christ. To strengthen is to emphasize; this is with regard to the contents. In our work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery what we strongly emphasize is that &ldquo;grace is the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.&rdquo; This is representative of our speaking in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I hope that you all can be like &ldquo;tape recorders&rdquo; and have this word deeply impressed in you. Then when you go out to contact others, you can spontaneously speak, and only speak, this word. May such &ldquo;tape recorders&rdquo; increase more and more until no other speaking can be heard on the whole earth except this: &ldquo;Grace is the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head2">B. Being Exceptionally Radiant<br />in Establishing Not Our Own Righteousness<br />but God&rsquo;s Righteousness in Our Reigning with Christ</h2><p>We are exceptionally radiant in establishing not our own righteousness but God&rsquo;s righteousness in our reigning with Christ. To be radiant refers to the outward expression; it is regarding the result. In our work in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we do not boast in anything except grace as the manifestation of the Triune God in His embodiment in three aspects&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. We consider this as our radiance, our boast. To be strengthened is something inward; to be radiant is something outward. Today the Lord has given these truths to us that we may strengthen them in their contents inwardly and radiate them in their reality outwardly.</p><p>Some may ask, &ldquo;Does this mean that among us we should not teach anything else?&rdquo; It is not a matter of whether or not to teach other things. Actually, it is that we do not have any spare time to teach anything other than the central revelation of the Bible. In the past we received Brother Nee&rsquo;s leading to meet according to 1 Corinthians 14&mdash;not to have one man speaking and all the rest listening, but to have everyone prophesying. From 1933 Brother Nee began to strongly promote this practice, but it was unsuccessful. It was not until the recent years when we restudied 1 Corinthians 14 that we discovered that the Lord&rsquo;s intention is not merely to have all the members taking turns to speak but to have all the members blended together as one Body to speak. In the past we did not dare to speak in the meetings, because we did not know what to speak. But now the whole situation has been changed; everyone is glad to prophesy and everyone speaks concerning the unique central revelation of the Bible. This is what we particularly emphasize and boast of.</p>
