   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES 3 Issue No. 7, May 1926</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Current Events in the Light of the Scriptures THE CHINESE SOCIETY FOR</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE PROMOTION OF CHRISTIANITY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because of the danger of the work of this Society, the reporter issued a warning in the fifth issue of this paper.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thank the Lord that many have awakened to the work of this Society.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>All the works of this Society are for the improvement of society.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They do not preach the redemptive gospel of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Many officers among them are famous modernists in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I do not understand why Bible-believing orthodox churches would support such works that oppose God and would yield to their soft-spoken control.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes they conduct retreats also.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But every time I read the report of their retreats, I could not help but sigh.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why did they have to call it a retreat?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why did they not call it a discussion meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They use this term with only one intention: to entice average spiritual Christians and to turn them to become their co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What Christianity lacks today is not organizations that are greater and expanded, or discussions that are more refined and more detailed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have too many of these things already!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>May the ever-blessed God lead His children to work in a solid way and let the others organize and discuss as much as they please.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Before February the editor of the Morning Light Paper wrote me a letter and told me that the church in Chefoo has never joined the Society.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When I heard this, on the one hand, I thanked the Lord, and on the other hand, I congratulated the church in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Recently I received a letter from a friend in Nanking saying that the China Inland Missions throughout China are also withdrawing from the Society.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I also heard that a certain co-worker said that the China Inland Mission is now withdrawing from the Society.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Thank the Lord that He has opened the eyes of His children to see that the believing ones and the unbelieving ones have nothing to do with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>May the Lord lead His faithful servants to leave this Babylonian organization and to serve Him without the camp.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THE CHINESE CHRISTIAN LITERARY SOCIETY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The chief figures of this Society are ______ and ______ plus other famous modernists in China.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Strictly speaking, the aim of this Society is to overthrow our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The fundamental doctrines that we hold as Christians are completely denied by these people.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They really belong to another religion; they do not belong to Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot recognize those who do not believe in the inspiration of the Bible or other fundamental doctrines as Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This group is now translating the book The Bible for Today by Dr. ______, a noted modernist.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I have read this book, and I know that this translation, like all the other books by the same author and published by the Youth Association, will cause untold damage to the faith of many young people.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I exhort God's children not to buy books by this publisher nor any magazine by the modernists in the Youth Association.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I would further advise others to beware of publications by these organizations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Apostasy is growing day by day, and we should do our best to fight for God's truth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus is coming soon!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>PROGRESS IN PALESTINE</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The population in Palestine, according to a recent survey, has reached one hundred fifty thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the highest number since the Jews were chastised by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This proves that the return of the unbelieving Jews to their homeland has become a reality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Their return is a preparation for the end of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Within the national library of the Jewish state, in the newly built Hebrew University in Jerusalem, there is a gradual increase of valuable books.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There are also many valuable ancient manuscripts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Jewish women occupy an important place in Palestine, in contrast to the ancient Jewish custom.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The recent issue of the women's journal in Jerusalem was printed in Hebrew.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This paper is called Ha-Isha, which means The Woman.</S>

   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is hard to predict the outcome of the present world situation.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But when the time comes, He who will come will surely come and will not delay.</S>
