<p>Although the Bible does not explicitly say that Moses was a priest, Moses served as a priest. Moses was with God for forty days (Exo. 24:18), and when he came out from God&rsquo;s presence, the children of Israel could not gaze on his face, because it was full of God&rsquo;s glory (34:29-30; 2 Cor. 3:7). Moses was a priest because he contacted God, received God, and let God flow through his inner being. Moses was God&rsquo;s deputy authority as well because he was faithful in God&rsquo;s house (Heb. 3:2). A priest draws near to God, contacts God, and lets God saturate him in his fellowship with God, and a king comes out from God&rsquo;s presence and represents God&rsquo;s authority. Being a priest and a king involve expressing God&rsquo;s image and receiving God&rsquo;s authority to represent God.</p>
<p>From its beginning to its end, the Bible speaks of God&rsquo;s desire to gain priests and kings. When He created man, God intended to gain a people who would serve as priests and kings. Regrettably, the God-created man, Adam, failed. Later, however, Noah, Abraham, and Jacob drew near to God and offered sacrifices to Him (Gen. 6:8-9; 8:20; 12:1, 7-8; 18:16-33; 28:10-22). In Exodus 19:6 God spoke of His desire for the chosen descendants of Abraham, the children of Israel, to be a &ldquo;kingdom of priests.&rdquo; <em>Kingdom</em> speaks of kingly authority. God&rsquo;s original desire was that all the Israelites would be priests, a group of people who would draw near to Him, would be saturated with Him, and could be entrusted with His authority. When the Israelites failed at Mount Sinai (ch. 32), God chose the tribe of Levi from among them to replace the Israelites as a whole (vv. 28-29). Subsequently, the priests lived before God, drew near to God, and let God flow through them so that His intention could be revealed through the Urim and the Thummim (28:30).</p>
<p>The situation at that time, however, was not fully according to God&rsquo;s intention, because God&rsquo;s authority was represented by a separate office&mdash;the kingship. When Aaron passed away, he was succeeded by his son, Eleazar, and when Moses died, Joshua assumed the leadership. Joshua represented the office related to God&rsquo;s authority, the kingship, whereas Eleazar represented the office related to God&rsquo;s image, the priesthood. Nevertheless, Joshua and Eleazar shared in the work of dividing the good land among the Israelites (Josh. 17:4; 19:51). This shows that the kingship depends on the priesthood; without the priesthood, there is no kingship. Those who do not express God&rsquo;s life cannot represent God&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p>When the priesthood became desolate, God raised up a new priest, Samuel (1 Sam. 2), and Samuel anointed David to be the king of Israel (16:13). Hence, the priesthood brought in the kingship. When David&rsquo;s condition was proper, he treated matters related to the Ark of God according to the priesthood. When he received the Ark into the city of David, he commanded the priests to serve before the Ark, and he even put on the priestly ephod, the priestly robe. David was not a priest, but when he stood before the Ark of God, he was girded with an ephod (2 Sam. 6:12-15). On this occasion, he was a person with both the kingship and the priesthood. He also restored and strengthened the priestly service through his division of the services of the priests and his establishment of the service of song among the priests, arranging them into twenty-four divisions (1 Chron. 6:31-32).</p>
<p>The priesthood and the kingship are involved whenever the Bible speaks of the building of the holy temple, God&rsquo;s habitation. For example, when King Solomon completed the building of the temple, he devoted attention to the service of the priests before God (2 Chron. 8:14-15), just as his father David had done. This shows that the building of the temple is always related to priestly service and kingly authority. God wants to gain those who fellowship with Him, live before Him, and allow Him to flow through and saturate them. Such ones can express Him, be entrusted with His authority, and build up His dwelling place.</p>
<p>At the time of Chronicles, the kings of Israel were in a fallen condition, and the priests were in a desolate condition. During this time evil kings, such as Ahab, did not represent God&rsquo;s authority, and the priestly service ceased to function. As a consequence, prophets, such as Elijah and Elisha, became prominent (1 Kings 16&mdash;22; 2 Kings 1&mdash;8). At the end of the Old Testament, the book of Zechariah shows that the building of God&rsquo;s temple still depends upon priests and kings. Zechariah prophesied that the Lord Jesus would be both Priest and King, One who would fellowship with God, be saturated with God, and have God&rsquo;s authority. The Lord was the Shoot raised up to build God&rsquo;s temple (6:12-13).</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus came, He was focused on the temple as the great desire of God&rsquo;s heart. The four Gospels often speak of Him in relation to the temple. When He was twelve years old, He went to Jerusalem and stayed in the temple to be in the things of God (Luke 2:49). At the beginning of the Gospel of John, His zeal for God&rsquo;s house is portrayed by His cleansing of the temple by driving the moneychangers out of the temple (2:15-17). When the Jews asked Him for a sign, He spoke of rebuilding the temple of His body through death and resurrection (vv. 18-22). The Gospel of Matthew also refers to the Lord&rsquo;s cleansing of the temple, which occurred chronologically at the end of the Lord&rsquo;s ministry prior to His death and resurrection (21:12-16). The reference to the Lord&rsquo;s cleansing of the temple at the beginning of the Gospel of John and at the end of the Gospel of Matthew shows that Christ was continually focused on the temple. Even when Peter received the revelation that Jesus was the Christ, the Son of the living God, the Lord unveiled the building of the church on the rock that was Christ Himself and the revelation concerning Christ (16:18).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus, as both Priest and King (Zech. 6:13), is a rock. First Peter 2:4 speaks of Christ as being a living stone as well as the cornerstone who was rejected by the Jews but chosen by God. At the same time, those who have been regenerated with His life are spoken of as being &ldquo;living stones&rdquo; (v. 5). Since He, as a living stone, is a royal Priest, we, who are also living stones, should also be royal priests. When we are built together, we become a priesthood, even a royal priesthood. This royal priesthood is not related to individuals but to one corporate Body, which is the building. Only a corporate group of priests and kings can accomplish God&rsquo;s building work. We must be royal priests, those who live before God, in order to express and represent Him.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_045.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_047.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Priesthood and God's Building &nbsp; pg 46</div><br></body></html>
