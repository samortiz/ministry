   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When he returned to Shanghai from Foochow, I was invited to visit the churches in Ping-Yang County of Chekiang province.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Watchman encouraged me to go, so I went.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In October of that year, he went to Hangchow for the fourth overcomer conference and I traveled there from Ping-Yang to attend the conference.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Again, this was another glorious time!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>RELATIONSHIP IN SUFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>During the conference at Hangchow, Watchman's mother and the eldest sister co-worker, Ruth Lee, both urged Watchman to get married during that conference time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They considered it to be a good time since all the co-workers from the entire country were present.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Watchman agreed with the condition that I would be his best man and that Philip Luan would be master of ceremonies at the wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sister Lee fellowshipped with both of us concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We told her immediately that we would be more than happy to do what Watchman desired and felt honored to be asked by him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At the wedding Mrs. Samuel Chang was the maid of honor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the co-workers and local saints attended the wedding.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was a happy time for all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Following the wedding I traveled to Chefoo for a rest.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While I was there, the big turmoil against Watchman's marriage transpired.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since I had been best man and Philip Luan had been master of ceremonies, we two were considered to be the ones best qualified to bear responsibility for handling the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, Brother Luan cabled me and charged me to return to Shanghai to care for the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Immediately I cabled Watchman with the word of Deuteronomy 23:5: "Jehovah your God turned the curse into a blessing for you."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I arrived in Shanghai on New Year's Day 1935.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Philip Luan and I, with the help of Peace Wang, did our best to calm down the turmoil.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All of our efforts seemed in vain because of the strong attack from the opponents.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, because of his sickness and tiredness, Philip Luan returned to his home in Hangchow to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This left me alone in that difficult situation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>During that trying period, one morning Watchman came to me with the newspaper of the day and said, "In my entire life I never saw a marriage publicly attacked by printing an open advertisement in large characters in the country's leading paper."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He said this with much sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After that, he left Shanghai and traveled to the southwestern provinces of China.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the same time Ruth Lee departed from Shanghai to visit the central part of China.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The only help I had came from Sister Peace Wang.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The situation was becoming difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the Lord's mercy, Sister Wang and I decided to know nothing, do nothing, and say nothing concerning this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We simply continued on positively with the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Praise the Lord, eventually He gained the victory and brought us through.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before Watchman left Shanghai, he did not say a word to me concerning the work there.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But following his departure, I discovered from one of the elders that his instruction to them was that the responsibility of the work there had been committed to me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After three or four months, Watchman returned, and by May of 1935, although the storm was still present, it had calmed somewhat.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then Ruth Lee suggested to me that since Watchman would not minister, we must find a way to urge him to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But regardless of how much we urged him, he would not minister.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then one day Ruth said to me, "Let us beg him to hold a study with us on the Song of Songs."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We therefore went to tell him that we were really eager to know the Song of Songs, and we asked him to accompany us to West Lake in Hangchow for a couple of weeks' rest and at the same time to have a study with us on the Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He was happy about it and did it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only four brothers and three sisters, who were all co-workers, went and stayed with him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The studies given by him at that time are now published in the book entitled The Song of Songs.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Again, I received great help through these studies in the stages and turns of life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>After that, Watchman began to minister regularly again.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>From 1933, when Watchman returned from his trip to visit the Brethren in England, the Brethren had written us several letters concerning our fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Up to the time of Watchman's wedding, we had not had time to respond to those letters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But since the wedding was over and the turmoil had subsided, Watchman began to consider how best to answer the letters of the Brethren concerning our fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He asked me to care for this matter, but I did not take his word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually, he did it himself and asked me, another co-worker, and the three elders in Shanghai to sign the letter with him.</S>
