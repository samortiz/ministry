<h1 class="title">THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="title">(5)</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE TABERNACLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h2 class="head2">The Tabernacle</h2>
<p>In this chapter we will see how the tabernacle typifies the church (Exo. 26:15-30; 36:20-34). The tabernacle came into existence when the people of Israel left Egypt and came to Mount Sinai to serve God. The tabernacle was the center of children of Israel, and the twelve tribes of Israel encamped around the tabernacle. The tabernacle also was the means through which they served God. When the people of Israel gathered together, they met at the entrance of the tabernacle (29:42); hence, the tabernacle was called the Tent of Meeting.</p>
<p>As a type, the tabernacle, or Tent of Meeting, bears four significances. First, the tabernacle typifies the Lord Jesus Himself. John 1:14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; <em>Tabernacled</em> in Greek means &ldquo;pitched a tent.&rdquo; The incarnation of the Lord Jesus was God&rsquo;s tabernacling among men. He dwelt among men through His tabernacling in the flesh. Thus, the first significance of the tabernacle is that the Lord Jesus was manifested in the flesh among men. Just as the tabernacle was God&rsquo;s dwelling place for man to enter and meet God, so Christ is the dwelling place of God for man to contact God. In other words, the incarnation of the Lord Jesus provided God with a tabernacle, a place for Him to dwell on earth. The Lord&rsquo;s coming to the earth in the flesh was His becoming a tabernacle, in which God could dwell on the earth among men. Just as man was able to fellowship with God in the tabernacle, man was able to contact God in the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Second, the tabernacle typifies the church. The tabernacle as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth is an exact portrait of the church as God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth. Ephesians 2:22 says, &ldquo;In whom you also are being built together into a dwelling place of God in spirit.&rdquo; This verse points out that the church is God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth. Moreover, the church is the enlargement of Christ. Just as Christ is the tabernacle of God, so God&rsquo;s dwelling place on earth is the church.</p>
<p>Third, the tabernacle typifies the saints. Every saint is a temple of the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:19). Hence, the tabernacle also typifies the saints.</p>
<p>Fourth, the tabernacle typifies the coming New Jerusalem. Revelation 21:3 clearly says that the New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God with men; God will tabernacle with men there.</p>
<p>In terms of the church as a whole, the church is the tabernacle of God. In terms of the members of the church, every believer is a tabernacle of God, a temple of God, a habitation of God. In the future the totality of all God&rsquo;s redeemed throughout the ages will be a great tabernacle, the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem will be the habitation of God on earth. Before this reality becomes manifest, there is a picture, a type in the Old Testament, which portrays how God will obtain a dwelling place, a tabernacle, on earth. In this chapter, we will focus on the second significance of the tabernacle, which is the church.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Base of the Tabernacle</h2>
<p>As a tent, the tabernacle had a simple construction and thus required a solid base in order to stand firm. The base of the tabernacle was composed of sockets made of the expiation silver spoken of in Exodus 30:11-16; thus, silver denotes redemption. The sockets made of the expiation silver typify that the base of the church, that is, the standing of the church before God, is the redemption of Christ. Exodus says that each socket was a talent of silver (38:27). One talent is approximately one hundred pounds, or forty-five kilograms (cf. Rev. 16:21). There were one hundred silver sockets in the tabernacle, representing a significant amount of weight.</p>
<p>If the silver sockets were not weighty, they would not have been able to stabilize the tabernacle. During the journeying of the children of Israel&rsquo;s journeying in the wilderness, the whole tabernacle would have blown away if the base of the tabernacle had not been stable. Therefore, in order to stabilize the tabernacle, the silver sockets had to be very weighty. The tabernacle&rsquo;s ability to stand firm when it was erected depended on the silver sockets underneath. This shows that the church has a standing, a base, before God, which is stable and unshakable and which cannot be swayed or shaken by any turmoil. This base is Christ&rsquo;s redemption, typified by the silver sockets.</p>
