<h2 class="head1">FOREWORD</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s move today is to recover the proper and practical church life for His full expression. In the church life the first and basic item of its practicality is the meeting life. Besides our experience and enjoyment of Christ, nothing is more crucial and vital than the meetings of the church. God&rsquo;s people are a meeting people and every gathering should be a wonderful exhibition of the Christ each one daily experiences and enjoys as well as a testimony of His victory over Satan and of the oneness of His Body, the church. It should also be a most pleasant time, one that is refreshing and nourishing to all the saints and one that is living, rich, uplifted, and full of rejoicing.</p>
<p>The Lord in these recent days has further opened His Word concerning the meeting life of the church. We are thankful that this book, which is composed of messages given by Witness Lee in 1982 in Anaheim, California and Irving, Texas, could be made available to all the Lord&rsquo;s children. Its contents unveil in a new and fresh way the biblical revelation concerning the gathering together of God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>The most complete type of the church in the Old Testament is the children of Israel. Following their salvation from Egypt out from under the oppression of Pharaoh and the bondage of the Egyptians, God&rsquo;s first requirement was that His redeemed ones hold a feast unto Him with one another (Exo. 5:1). This assembling was a time of rejoicing and a strong exhibition of God&rsquo;s victory over and their deliverance from the tyranny and slavery of Satan.</p>
<p>Eventually, God&rsquo;s leading and guiding brought the children of Israel to God&rsquo;s habitation, the tabernacle and later the temple. The tabernacle and temple typify Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God (John 1:14; 2:19; Col. 2:9), as the dwelling place of God on this earth. The different sacrifices offered at the appointed feasts also typify Christ. All the offerings&mdash;the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering&mdash;were the means for God&rsquo;s redeemed ones to enter into God&rsquo;s habitation where they dwelt in and with God as a mutual abode. They were also food for God, the offering ones, and all the priests. When the children of Israel gathered together in oneness, both God and His people were fully satisfied with Christ. God also dwelt with them as His people and they dwelt with Him as their God. The full unveiling and the fulfillment of all these types concerning the meeting life of the church is in the New Testament, particularly in the Gospel of John where Christ is revealed as the tabernacled God and as the fulfillment of all the offerings. Our experience today of these glorious types is made real and realized by our enjoyment of Christ as the Spirit of reality (John 15:26; 16:13-15).</p>
<p>We pray that the following pages of this book with its clear vision will become a revelation to all who read them. May more and more of the Lord&rsquo;s children become those who are experiencing and enjoying Christ day by day as all the offerings for the church meetings, having Christ as their practical entrance into the Triune God as their dwelling place (John 17:21). Here God and all the saints are satisfied with Christ, and God has His living testimony and expression on the earth through His church.</p>

<h1 class="title">MEETING TO EXHIBIT CHRIST IN HIS VICTORY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 5:1; 10:9; 23:14; Psa. 42:4; 122:1; Acts 2:46-47; 1 Cor. 14:26; Heb. 10:25</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, thank You for this gathering. How we thank You for all the churches with all the saints in this area. Lord, this gathering is a testimony of Your victory over us, even over the enemy in us. Lord, we trust in You for instant utterance. We have no decision as to what to say. We trust in You for Your living Word. Touch our heart and visit our spirit. Lord, even open up our sober mind that we all may see something on Your heart, that we may see something according to Your plan. In Your precious name we claim, amen.</p>
<p>After the summer training I began to consider the matter of meeting. While I have been considering this, I believe some new light, even new lights, have come to me. As you can see from the title of the message, what we would say is not something so usual concerning the meetings. In this message we would see that the meeting is to exhibit Christ in His victory.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING OF THE MEETING LIFE</h2>
<p>Have you ever asked when the meeting life began in the Bible? Most of you, after thinking a little bit, might say that the meeting life began from Acts 2 on the day of Pentecost. But you have to realize that the meeting life began much earlier than this. The meeting on the day of Pentecost was just a continuation of the meeting which began centuries ago. When did God&rsquo;s people begin to meet together? Could you find some meeting of God&rsquo;s people in the book of Genesis? There is no meeting there. At most you may find a kind of family reunion. In all of the fifty chapters of Genesis there is no meeting, no assembly. There was no gathering of God&rsquo;s people.</p>
<p>But when you come to the second book of the Bible, Exodus, there was the meeting of God&rsquo;s people. In Exodus when God&rsquo;s salvation was brought in, right away there was the demand of the assembly of God&rsquo;s people. There was the request to meet together, and this request goes along with God&rsquo;s salvation. In a sense God didn&rsquo;t save any individuals or even a bunch of individuals. God saved an assembly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Feast unto the Lord</h2>
<p>Of course, according to the appearance of the wording in Exodus, you couldn&rsquo;t find a word like assembly. Yet when God called Moses and sent him to deliver the children of Israel out of Egypt, He spoke in this way: &ldquo;And afterward Moses and Aaron went in, and told Pharaoh, Thus saith the Lord God of Israel, Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness&rdquo; (5:1). My people is collective; it is not just one person. This is a collective people. Moses was to tell Pharaoh to let God&rsquo;s people go to hold a feast unto Him. You have to realize that the thought of assembling, the thought of gathering, is implied in this word feast.</p>
<p>I believe we all know that there is no possibility to have a feast if there is only one person. It is difficult to have a feast by yourself. You may buy some chicken and some pie and some other things and try to have a feast by yourself. It is hard to do. Even to have a feast with your wife and children is difficult. Still there is not that much of a feast flavor. The more people you have, the more flavor you have of a feast. A feast is a kind of assembled eating. You have to assemble people together for eating, and this eating implies an assembly. So a feast implies two things: eating and assembling. Both are crucial.</p>
<p>It is hard to say which may be considered first and which second: eating or assembling. But anyhow these are the two factors that constitute a feast. Without eating there is not a feast; without assembling there is not a feast. A feast needs eating and assembling; it needs assembling and eating. &ldquo;Let my people go, that they may hold a feast unto me in the wilderness.&rdquo; This means to eat by assembling in front of God and also with God. It is a feast for the people but &ldquo;unto God.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Way of God&rsquo;s Salvation</h2>
<p>Now you can see the requirements of God&rsquo;s salvation. The first requirement is to meet. According to this principle you cannot receive God&rsquo;s salvation without joining the assembly. According to the typology in Exodus God did not save any individuals; God saved a people. And this people ate together and assembled together. That was their keeping of a feast unto the Lord. They enjoyed the eating by the assembling, but they did this not only for themselves, but mainly unto the Lord. This was the way of God&rsquo;s salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head2">On the Day of Pentecost</h2>
<p>Even on the day of Pentecost, it was a people and not individuals who were saved. According to the principle of the first mentioning in the Bible, the first instance of God&rsquo;s salvation at Pentecost was not a saving of individuals. It was a saving of a people. Right after they were saved, they all assembled together (Acts 2:46-47). If you study the book of Acts carefully you will see that all the people who were saved on the day of Pentecost stuck themselves together. Not only did they stay together, they also stuck themselves one to another. Their sticking together was a testimony of victory. That testimony scared the people. Acts 5:13 tells us that other people dared not to join them. When I was a small child, the first time I saw an army I was scared to death. I dared not go close to that army. That was terrifying! I do believe that on the day of Pentecost, the first meeting of the church was very terrifying. Of course, in those days they met nearly the whole day and every day, and whenever they met that was a testimony of the victory. It was a testimony of Christ&rsquo;s victory in them over the enemy, over Satan, over the world, over all the demons!</p>
<p>The first point of the new light concerning the meetings is this: the meeting life of God&rsquo;s people began in Exodus. Don&rsquo;t think the meeting life of God&rsquo;s people began in Acts. What transpired in Acts was a continuation of that meeting which began in Exodus centuries ago. Even the meeting place was not changed! The New Testament people of God met in the same temple where the Old Testament people of God had met. The meeting in the temple was a continuation of the assembly of the children of Israel at Mount Sinai. Properly speaking, God&rsquo;s people began to meet at Mount Sinai.</p><h2 class="head1">A TESTIMONY OF THE VICTORY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>The second new light is this: the meeting is a testimony of the victory of Christ. The meeting of God&rsquo;s people is a testimony of the victory of Christ in God&rsquo;s people over His enemy. Look at the situation: when the children of Israel were there under the tyranny of Pharaoh in Egypt, there was no salvation; there was no victory over Pharaoh. The children of Israel, the people of God, were all defeated and captured. They were under a kind of tyranny. But when they assembled at Mount Sinai that meant a victory over Pharaoh, over Egypt, over Satan, over all his demons!</p>
<p>Today the church meetings are an exhibition of the victory of Christ over all the demons and the Devil in all of us. If Christ had not defeated Satan, how could we be here? We might be at the beach or in a movie theater or in some nightclub or in a ball game. When we were in those places we were captured; we were under the tyranny of Satan. About sixty years ago I was there. But hallelujah! today I am not there. Today I am on Mount Sinai meeting with all the saints. Our being here in the meeting is a testimony of the victory of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Coming to the Meeting with a Multitude</h2>
<p>Sometimes, though, I noticed that some saints do not come to the meetings like captives who have been released. Although some have advised me not to talk so much about Elden hall (the first meeting hall of the church in Los Angeles), I cannot avoid speaking about those years of 1969, 1970, 1971, and 1972. My! when the saints were coming to the meetings, there was the victory! The saints came to the meetings with shoutings, with praisings, with singings, with hallelujahings!</p>
<p>Of course, some of the neighbors were bothered by the shoutings, the rejoicings, the singings, so they called the police to complain. The police told those complaining neighbors that before the church came this area was terrible and even horrible. Some murders had happened on the street. But since the church came, the area had become such a nice area. So they encouraged the neighbors to go along with us or to consider moving. This happened several times.</p>
<p>Close to three hundred saints lived right around the hall, and there were more than this coming to the meetings. The meetings at that time began in the homes. I still remember that I gave a message using Psalm 122:1: &ldquo;I was glad when they said unto me, Let us go into the house of the Lord.&rdquo; I still remember my word of encouragement: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t come to the meeting by yourself! Always come to the meeting with a multitude!&rdquo; This word multitude is used twice in Psalm 42:4. &ldquo;When I remember these things, I pour out my soul in me: for I had gone with the multitude, I went with them to the house of God, with the voice of joy and praise, with a multitude that kept festival&rdquo; (lit.). I encouraged the saints not to come to the meeting by themselves, but to come to the meetings in company&mdash;singing, praising, walking and jumping, rejoicing and hallelujahing! And the saints did it! That was wonderful!</p>
<h2 class="head2">Not Silent, but Rejoicing</h2>
<p>But today I notice that when the saints come to the meetings they are so silent. They are a silent people. They are like a group of silent captives released from the poor prison. At least you got released. You are here and not in the casino. The only thing is that you are not full of joy; you are not full of rejoicing. When the children of Israel got released from Egypt and met at Mount Sinai, don&rsquo;t you believe that they rejoiced? How can we know they rejoiced? We know that they rejoiced because they were rejoicing on the shore of the Red Sea. When God delivered them out of Egypt and put Pharaoh and his army to the bottom of the sea, all the children of Israel gave a loud praise to God, especially the sisters, under the leadership of that old sister Miriam. Today we need more Miriams. The sisters are too quiet, and the brothers are even quieter.</p>
<p>This is why I want to share with you that the meeting of God&rsquo;s people is a testimony of victory over Satan, victory over the prevailing world, victory over the demons, victory over all the bondage.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Redeemed and Released to Enjoy a Feast</h2>
<p>Look at the picture that the Bible portrays. God created man with a purpose, that is, to express God. But this man fell again and again and again, in at least three or four stages. Eventually this man fell into Egypt where he was altogether under Pharaoh&rsquo;s tyranny, having no freedom and no God. Then God came in to deliver man out of Egypt, out of the usurping hand of Pharaoh. But most preachers, including myself, when we have preached the gospel by such a story, never pointed out that God&rsquo;s salvation is one that releases people from the tyranny of Satan into a feast! This feast implies not only the release and the freedom, but also the assembling to enjoy a feast. You have to realize that this assembling to enjoy a feast is a testimony of the victory of God&rsquo;s salvation in all His redeemed people over His enemy.</p>
<p>If one is redeemed, yet is not in that feast, it is wrong. This is the situation with many Christians today. Many have been saved, but very few are in the feast. At Elden hall the attendance of the meetings was very high. When we had three hundred people, nearly all three hundred were present in every meeting. Sometimes even the attendance at the prayer meeting was higher. If the attendance of a local church is low, this is a sign that the saints do not realize and enjoy the victory of Christ so much. If we enjoy the victory of Christ, surely we will join the feast. We will plunge ourselves into the feast!</p><h2 class="head2">No Excuses</h2>
<p>Some dear ones who have a tender heart and who sympathize with the saints may say that some have a job and they work long hours and then they have a long drive and so they are worn out. I agree with this, but why in Elden hall was the attendance that high? Does it mean that all the saints there were jobless? Actually, today more are jobless. Today the unemployment is high. Twelve years ago at Elden hall nearly no one was jobless. So this is not a good excuse. Another excuse is that most of the sisters have to take care of their children. Again, what about Elden? Did all those sisters not have children? Were all the sisters single? There is no excuse! The only reason is that the enjoyment of the victory of Christ has been much reduced.</p>
<p>If you have ever met Christ in the morning, surely you expect to come to the meeting in the evening. The enjoyment of Christ, the meeting with Christ, always sends you to the church, to the meeting. Not only so, if you have been enjoying the victory of Christ over the enemy during the day, you are just equipped and ready and expecting and waiting for the meeting time. You would come to the meeting with shouting, with rejoicing, with praising. You come with the expectation that you can have a time to give a testimony that Christ today has defeated the enemy in you. Dear saints, the principle of the Bible is precious. God&rsquo;s salvation is for a feast, and a feast always implies an assembly.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Short of God&rsquo;s Salvation</h2>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t come to the assembly, this is a strong proof that you are short of God&rsquo;s salvation. You don&rsquo;t enjoy Christ that much; you don&rsquo;t participate in Christ&rsquo;s victory that much. So your appetite, your hunger, your thirst after the meetings is not that high. This is the principle: if you enjoy Christ, surely you will have an aspiration to come to the meeting. If you participate in the victory of Christ you would hate that the day is too long. You would like to shorten the day so that you could come to the meeting sooner.</p>
<p>If you don&rsquo;t participate in the victory of Christ, you always feel that the day is too short. Six-thirty would come quickly and you have not yet finished dinner. How could you go to the meeting? If this is your sensation, it proves you haven&rsquo;t participated in Christ&rsquo;s victory today. There is no need to say that you need to participate in the victory of Christ that much. If you just participate in Christ&rsquo;s victory a little bit, it will encourage you, it will stir you up, to come to the meeting, the earlier the better. And when you come you will look for the front-row seats. When you have been defeated, you just are so reluctant to come to the meeting. Then you come in late and although some vacant seats might be in the front you would not take them. You would sit at the back. This is a sign that you need the victory of Christ.</p>
<p>Apparently, it seems that God&rsquo;s enemy has defeated God in gaining man. Look at today&rsquo;s world. All men have gone from God. All men have been captured by Satan. They also have their assemblies. You just consider every night how many gatherings, how many congregations, how many meetings, how many assemblies the fallen people have. Going to a theater is to go to a kind of an assembly. Going to a night club is to go to a kind of an assembly. Today the entire world has been captured by Satan. Satan does have his train of captives. But praise the Lord! Christ has won the victory. At least He has won a people. He has captured us! In every place there is the need of some proper Christian assembly that can constitute a testimony of the victory of Christ. All the people have become captives in Satan&rsquo;s train but we are here! We wouldn&rsquo;t join that train. We have no share in that kind of an assembly. We are here meeting as a testimony to the victory of Christ over Satan. We need to do this every day, the more the better, and as much as we can. Don&rsquo;t you believe that the saints at Mount Sinai met every day?</p>
<h2 class="head2">Seeking First the Kingdom of God</h2>
<p>Then you might ask, What about our living? What shall we eat? What shall we drink? How shall we be clothed? Don&rsquo;t come to me. You had better come to the Bible to see what those people did at Mount Sinai. Have you forgotten? Manna came down, and living water flowed out. Then you would ask, Do you really mean it? If we meet every day, would manna come down? I really mean it! If you don&rsquo;t believe me, let us try. Let us meet every night and see whether we will be short of food. The Lord Jesus&rsquo; words were to seek first His kingdom and His righteousness, and all these things shall be added to you.</p>
<p>At Mount Sinai the ancient saints met every day. For forty years those nearly two million people only met and traveled. They just handled one thing, the tabernacle. They met around the tabernacle; they traveled with the tabernacle. That is all. They didn&rsquo;t do anything else. For forty years they had no job: no farming, no industry, nothing. That was a clear type. Then on the day of Pentecost, the New Testament saints did the same thing. Day by day and day after day they met in the temple and from house to house. What were they doing? They were not gossiping but praising, preaching, teaching, talking about Jesus. No doubt, dear saints, Christianity has lost such a character. God has saved His people into a feast, but this feast has become a formal service.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Enjoyment of Christ and<br />
the Participation in His Victory</h2>
<p>Recently I read some definite news that in Red China in one county there were 140,000 new believers meeting in different places. Sometimes some of them, mostly the leading ones, came together to have meetings for the whole day from six in the morning to six in the evening. All the day long they met there. And the good thing is this: they called on the name of the Lord, and they pray-read the Word. It seems that we have lost the calling on the name of the Lord, and we have lost the pray-reading. Once in Elden hall in one prayer meeting the saints pray-read the entire book of Ephesians. Today we pray-read so little. This is a sign of a weak point, that we have lost the enjoyment of Christ, and we have missed so much the participation in His victory. If we would recover the enjoyment of Christ and the participation in His victory, surely the shouting, the singing, the praising, the calling on the name, and the pray-reading will be recovered.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RECOVERY OF THE PROPER MEETING</h2>
<p>Here is a battle, a struggle, between God and Satan. We have to realize that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery the first thing the Lord recovers is the meeting. The meeting is the front part of God&rsquo;s recovery. You know that the front part of any building is very prominent. If the Lord&rsquo;s recovery doesn&rsquo;t have the proper meeting, it doesn&rsquo;t have a front. We must look to the Lord for His mercy that we would pay adequate attention to the matter of meeting. The recovery of the Lord must have a front to declare the enjoyment of Christ and the participation in the victory of Christ. We enjoy Christ; we participate in His victory, and now we are in the feast.</p>
<p>Let us look at Exodus again. The children of Israel were slaves under Pharaoh. But one day they enjoyed the Passover Lamb. That was the beginning of their enjoyment of Christ. Christ became not only their redemption, but also their life plus their release and their freedom. Christ got into them. That hour they could not stay away from one another. From the hour of Passover they stayed together and right away they became an army of the Lord. And that army defeated the Egyptian troops by the Lord. So you could see that they enjoyed Christ, and they participated in the victory of Christ over the Egyptian army. These two things&mdash;the enjoyment of Christ and the participation in the victory of Christ&mdash;brought them into the feast. And that feast is the assembly. They assembled together to enjoy more of Christ. Eventually, they became not only the people of God but also the army of God. And their way of fighting was just to meet and to eat. Their way of fighting was to enjoy Christ and to participate in the victory of Christ. This enjoyment and this participation are nothing but meeting together.</p>
<p>We have to forget about the services Christians have today. In the morning we have to enjoy Christ, and during the day we have to participate in His victory. These two things will send us in the evening to the meeting. Every morning we enjoy Christ, every day we participate in Christ&rsquo;s victory, and every night we come together. If you enjoy Christ in the morning, and during the day you participate in His victory, I don&rsquo;t believe that in the evening you would stay home by yourself. These two things motivate you and urge you and charge you and even send you to the meeting. There would be no need for me to encourage you to sing hallelujahs or to call on the Lord&rsquo;s name. You would do it spontaneously! The enjoyment of Christ and the participation in His victory would motivate you, would cause you to fly, to soar, to jump, to shout hallelujah, and to come to the meeting by companies.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">MEETING TO DO THE WILL OF GOD<br />
AND FULFILL HIS PURPOSE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 15:13, 17; Deut. 12:11; Psa. 73:16-17; 1 Cor. 14:26; Heb. 10:25</h1>
<p>Apparently the verses above from Exodus, Deuteronomy, and Psalms have little to do with the matter of meeting. Yet in fact they are on the matter of meeting. Exodus 15, we know, is a section of the victorious praises offered to God by the released people. When the children of Israel were released from Egypt out of the tyranny of Pharaoh, when they crossed the Red Sea, and when they saw all the Egyptian armies were drowned under the depths of that sea, they offered a praise to the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DESTINATION OF<br />
GOD&rsquo;S GUIDING</h2>
<p>Verse 13 says, &ldquo;Thou in thy mercy hast led forth the people which thou hast redeemed: thou hast guided them in thy strength unto thy holy habitation.&rdquo; Have you ever noticed that the destination of God&rsquo;s guiding is His holy habitation? He guides us to this destination. He leads forth His redeemed people, and He guides them to such a destination, that is, His holy habitation. We know that this is the dwelling place of God. Firstly it was the tent or the tabernacle. Eventually it became the temple. Whether it was the tabernacle or the temple, it was the dwelling place of God, His holy habitation. This is the destination of God&rsquo;s leading. This is the destination of God&rsquo;s guiding. God leads us and guides us to this destination, His holy habitation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S DWELLING PLACE</h2>
<p>Could you realize that God&rsquo;s habitation is the meeting of His redeemed people? So you have a term that combines these two things together: the tent of meeting. The tent refers to God&rsquo;s dwelling place, and the meeting, no doubt, refers to the gathering of God&rsquo;s people. This indicates that the gathering of God&rsquo;s people is just God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, the picture was not so clear because it was really hard to portray how the gathered people of God were just God&rsquo;s dwelling place. In the Old Testament type you have God&rsquo;s dwelling place typified by the tent, the tabernacle, as the center of God&rsquo;s gathered people. At the same time you have a gathering of God&rsquo;s people around the tent.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN ASSEMBLY OF THE CALLED-OUT ONES</h2>
<p>In the New Testament, you have to realize that God&rsquo;s habitation is just the church. And the church according to the Greek word, <em>ekklesia,</em> means a kind of meeting. It is a meeting or an assembly of the called-out ones. When God&rsquo;s called-out ones meet together, this is the church. The church is just the meeting of a collective people, a gathering of the believers.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH IN A PRACTICAL WAY</h2>
<p>According to the New Testament teaching, do you believe that the saints in a locality do not need to come together, do not need any gathering, yet they could be the church? You have to realize without the gathering together of the believers in their locality, there is no practical church life. The practical church life is just the gathering of the saints in a certain locality. If you just live in Huntington Beach, but you don&rsquo;t come together, there are many saints, no doubt, in that city, but practically speaking there is no church.</p>
<p>The church becomes real and practical when you all come together. That is an <em>ekklesia.</em> The <em>ekklesia</em> is the coming together of all the saints. And this coming together of all the saints is a gathering. You have to realize this gathering is the habitation of God. So the church is just the tent of meeting. The tent signifies God&rsquo;s dwelling place; the meetings signify the gathering, the coming together, of all the saints. Exodus 15:13 talks about the meeting of God&rsquo;s redeemed people. They got redeemed, but what should they do after being redeemed? God led them forth to the meeting. God guided them to the meeting.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S LEADING AND GUIDING</h2>
<p>Have you noticed that in Exodus 15:13 two predicates are used? First of all it says that the Lord led them forth. Then it says that the Lord guides them. What is the difference between leading and guiding? Some years ago when I was in Elden hall I heard someone pray, &ldquo;Lord, lead us and guide us.&rdquo; That is very meaningful. That was quite impressive to me.</p>
<p>Firstly, the Lord leads us, and then He guides us. Look at the picture in the typology. When the children of Israel were traveling through the wilderness, there was the pillar of cloud or of fire always taking the lead. That was the leading. If the pillar of cloud or of fire stayed, they did not move. At the same time that the Lord was taking the lead, He was also guiding them. He was with them, and He was among them guiding them. In our Christian pilgrimage, in our Christian course or journey, the Lord is always taking the lead, and at the same time He is guiding us.</p>
<p>In 1958 when I visited Jerusalem, we used a travel guide. He was not only a guide, but also a leader. When we went to the temple or to other places, he was taking the lead. When we had troubles, right away he became the guide. He turned back to us and walked with us shoulder to shoulder, talking to us, and explaining to us. To take the lead is somewhat general, but to guide is somewhat particular.</p>
<p>Today the Lord takes the lead in a general way giving us a general direction. Then at certain times He comes to us to be our guide explaining to us in details. Eventually it was by His guiding that He brought them in His strength unto His holy habitation. The leading only took the people on the way, but the guiding took them to a particular point, that is, God&rsquo;s holy habitation. That habitation, dear saints, is just the gathering. That is the meeting. So following His redemption God&rsquo;s leading and God&rsquo;s guiding is to bring His people into the meeting.</p>
<p>Let me check with you according to your experience. Right after you got saved it was wonderful! It was excellent! But you didn&rsquo;t have the sense that you were at home. You hadn&rsquo;t arrived at the destination until the time that you were brought into a meeting. When you got into that meeting right away you had the sense that you were at home. No one had to tell you. When you got into the meeting you had the sense that this was the right place for you. That is God&rsquo;s habitation and your meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR DESTINATION BEING GOD&rsquo;S HABITATION</h2>
<p>Most Christians do not realize the matter of meeting in this way. Mostly they consider the Christian meeting a kind of service for worship. They don&rsquo;t realize that the Christian meeting is a destination that you have to arrive at. And with your arrival this destination becomes God&rsquo;s habitation. I must tell you that when God is homeless, then you are also a wanderer. When God doesn&rsquo;t have a home, neither do you have a home. When God has a home to dwell in, that home becomes yours. God&rsquo;s home is your home. Many times when we come to the meeting we just have the sensation that we are home. If you stay away from the meetings for two months you will have the sense that you have become homeless. You have become a wanderer. Then when you come back to the meeting, my! you feel that you are home. This proves that our meeting is God&rsquo;s habitation, and God&rsquo;s habitation is our home.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AT HOME WITH OUR FATHER</h2>
<p>When God is dwelling properly, we are too. This dwelling is our meeting. I mention this to show you the importance of our meeting. It is not just a kind of service or a kind of worship or a kind of coming together to have a Bible study or a prayer time. It is not just that. It is to have God&rsquo;s dwelling place on this earth! When we come together we constitute God&rsquo;s dwelling place. In this dwelling place we are home with God; we are home with our Father. Every gathering is a family reunion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PLANTED ON MOUNT ZION</h2>
<p>Verse 17 reads, &ldquo;Thou shalt bring them in, and plant them in the mountain of thine inheritance, in the place, O Lord, which thou hast made for thee to dwell in, in the sanctuary, O Lord, which thy hands have established.&rdquo; Mount Zion is the mount of the Holy Land. And the Holy Land is God&rsquo;s inheritance. So the mountain of God&rsquo;s inheritance is Mount Zion. According to this verse God wanted to plant all the children of Israel on Mount Zion. You may think that geographically speaking it is impossible to plant all the children of Israel on Mount Zion. This is your natural understanding. According to God&rsquo;s understanding and in God&rsquo;s view, all of the children of Israel were planted on that mountain. At least three times a year&mdash;at the time of the Passover, at the time of Pentecost, and at the time of the Feast of Tabernacles&mdash;all the males came together to stay on that mountain. So in the eyes of God all the children of Israel were planted on that mountain.</p><h2 class="head1">A HAPPY TIME TO GOD</h2>
<p>You have to realize this plantation was the gathering and the habitation of God. During those days of the feasts, all the children of Israel stayed there on the mountain day and night. If their feast lasted seven days, they stayed on the mountain seven days. When God looked upon Mount Zion and saw all His chosen and redeemed people staying there, He was so happy! That gathering was God&rsquo;s dwelling place on this earth. All His chosen and redeemed people stayed with Him on that mountain. That was a plantation, that was a gathering, and that was a habitation. And that was a mutual home to God and to His chosen people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FULFILLMENT OF THE TYPE</h2>
<p>That was a picture in the Old Testament, and today our meetings are the fulfillment of that type. In the past we have had two slogans: Christ is our life, and the church is our living. We need to change the word church to the word meeting. Christ is my life, and the meeting is my living.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t you realize that all the people today on this earth are miserable? Whether they are dancing, or surfing, or playing ball, or eating, or drinking, or gambling, or stealing, they are miserable. Whether they are strong or weak, they are miserable. Whether they are well or sick, they are miserable. How about us? Are we also miserable? If you don&rsquo;t come to the meeting, are you miserable or pleasant? I can testify that I am happy every day in my home, but often I am not that happy. But I am guaranteed to be happy when I come to the meeting. In my fifty years in the church life I cannot remember a meeting in which I was miserable. I was miserable sometimes in my home, but I don&rsquo;t remember even once being miserable in the meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MOST PLEASANT PLACE</h2>
<p>Why are we so pleasant in the meetings? Sometimes I have had the feeling that the meeting was too long. Recently our Lord&rsquo;s table meeting lasted two hours and forty minutes. I was really tired out by sitting there for one hundred and sixty minutes. But I must tell you that I was not miserable. I was tired out, yet I was still pleasant. In a sense I wanted to go home, yet in another sense I wanted to stay there. I was hesitating to go back home. As long as I am in the meeting I know I will be pleasant, but when I get back home I might be miserable. I do have the assurance and the guarantee that I will be pleasant as long as I am in the meeting.</p>
<p>We need to spend some time to re-study our meeting life so that we could see something more. In a sense I am not encouraging you to come to the meeting, but I would like to tell you what is the difference between coming to the meeting or not coming to the meeting. You have a choice, life or death. It is up to you. If you like to die, you just remain there at home. If you like to live, come to the meeting. Outside the meeting you are about to die. But if you come to the meeting you are guaranteed to live. It is pleasant here. From my experience I can say that the most pleasant place on earth is the meeting.</p>
<p>Sometimes due to your subjective personal problems you brought your miserable situation from your home to the meetings. You shouldn&rsquo;t blame the meeting. You should blame your foolishness. Sometimes I brought my miserable situation right to the front door of the meeting hall, but then I said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t follow me! go away!&rdquo; Then I came into the meeting without my miserable situation.</p>
<p>According to the human life, the unique pleasant time and the unique pleasant place is the meeting. Some might say that the most happy time and the most happy place was their wedding. It might be. But even if it was really a happy time and place, that was only once for your whole life. But we can experience the meeting time and the meeting place again and again and again.</p>
<p>Comparatively speaking the most pleasant place and the most pleasant time is our meeting. The unbelievers don&rsquo;t have this kind of meeting so they have never tasted such a pleasant place. But we have! If you were to ask me according to my human life experience what is the most pleasant time and what is the most pleasant place, I would say it is the meeting.</p>
<p>I love America, but I must tell you the truth that if there were no meeting, the U.S.A. would not be a pleasant place. What could I do here? Watch TV? That would be disgusting! Listen to the music? That would be terrible! What shall we do? We have to believe in the Lord Jesus that He will lead and guide us into His dwelling place. That is the meeting.</p><h2 class="head1">STAYING IN GOD&rsquo;S DWELLING PLACE</h2>
<p>How can I say that the mountain in verse 17 refers to Mount Zion? It is because that is the dwelling place of God. The sanctuary that God dwells in is the temple. Firstly, God made Mount Zion. Then God built and established the temple on Mount Zion. Mount Zion with the temple as God&rsquo;s sanctuary was the meeting place of all the children of Israel. Three times every year they all had to go there, not just to have a visit, but even to stay, to dwell. They dwelt there not just by themselves but with God for seven days. Seven days in the Bible indicate a full course of time. This means that for the full course of our human life we must stay in the gathering with God. We must stay in God&rsquo;s dwelling place. We must stay in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PLACE CHOSEN BY THE LORD</h2>
<p>Now we need to read Deuteronomy 12:11: &ldquo;Then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the Lord.&rdquo; This verse refers to a place. God charged the children of Israel that after they entered into the good land, they should not come together at just any place. There was only one place which was legitimate for them to gather together. That was Mount Zion where God&rsquo;s temple was. Three times every year they had to bring all their top produce from the land to that place for gathering. There they stayed together with God. That was their meeting time. They met there every year. We know that these are different aspects of one thing, that is, our today&rsquo;s gathering. Our today&rsquo;s gathering should be like that.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING TO DO THE WILL OF GOD<br />
AND FULFILL HIS PURPOSE</h2>
<p>How can we prove that to meet is to do the will of God and fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose? Psalm 73:16-17 says: &ldquo;When I thought to know this, it was too painful for me; until I went into the sanctuary of God; then understood I their end.&rdquo; When the psalmist thought about certain matters, it was painful for him, but when he went into the sanctuary of God he began to understand.</p>
<p>I believe that in the past many of us were seeking after the Lord&rsquo;s will concerning our families, our marriage, our job, our school. Many times it was painful. We were seeking to know the will of God concerning these things, but it was painful. But a number of times when we just came into the meeting, the thing we were seeking to know became very clear to us. The message didn&rsquo;t cover that particular thing. No testimony referred to it. We just came to the meeting and sat there and the clearness came. Of course, many times the testimonies helped us to be clear, and even more times the message helped us to be clear. But anyhow we all can testify that the best place and the best time for us to know God&rsquo;s will is when we come to the meeting. Not many have gotten to know the Lord&rsquo;s will quite often outside the meeting, but many have gotten to know the Lord&rsquo;s will quite often in the meeting. Too many times we prayed concerning things again and again, seeking to know the Lord&rsquo;s will, but we failed to get clear. But when we came to the meeting, it became so clear. To do the Lord&rsquo;s will firstly depends upon the knowing. If you could know the Lord&rsquo;s will, the major part is accomplished already.</p>
<p>When we come together, our intention may be to pray, to worship, to serve, to hear a message, to be taught, to be exhorted, to be strengthened, to be comforted, to be encouraged. This is our understanding. Actually, dear saints, with our meetings there are so many wonderful things underneath the surface. We gain a lot of benefits and profit that we do not realize by participating in the meetings. So this means we don&rsquo;t treasure the meeting as we should. We don&rsquo;t appreciate the meeting as we should.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MOST CRUCIAL THING</h2>
<p>We have to realize today on this earth, besides our inner life, no other thing is so crucial, so important, so profitable as the matter of meeting. Believe me! One day you will testify that to lose your job is not so important as to miss a meeting. To miss a meeting means the real loss. To lose your job doesn&rsquo;t mean some real loss. I don&rsquo;t want to assure you in the way of superstition, but I would say that if you meet properly, the Lord would probably keep you in a job. If you meet properly like the children of Israel did and you don&rsquo;t have a job, then the Lord might send the manna to you. Then you might say, If this is so, let us all quit our jobs. We would take this hall as Mount Zion, and we would meet here every day and stay here daily. This is superstition.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GATHERING OF MANNA</h2>
<p>But you have to remember that in 2 Corinthians 8 Paul reckons our regular job to the gathering of manna. You know the story of the gathering of manna. Some greedy ones gathered more, but afterward the measurement was the same. Many of us like to gather more, but eventually it comes out the same. Those who receive more or gather more have no excess. And those who gather less have no lack. It comes out the same. Even though you gather so much with all your energy and endeavor, eventually what you get is the same.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEKING FIRST HIS KINGDOM</h2>
<p>We who are the meeting people do live on manna. Don&rsquo;t live on your job. Go to do a job, but don&rsquo;t live on your job. Live on manna. Even your job is manna. God can take away all the manna. God can use just His little finger to touch the American economy and the jobs are gone. When the jobs are gone, there is no manna. You think this is your job, but this is manna sent by God to you.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word is trustworthy. He says not to worry about tomorrow. He says not to have any anxiety about tomorrow. Tomorrow is not in your hands. Don&rsquo;t live a life of tomorrow. Live a life of today. Seek first His kingdom. Then what you need for clothing, for drinking, for eating your Father will add to you. He will give you the kingdom that you firstly seek plus all the necessities (Matt. 6:31-34). This is the manna. To lose your job should not worry you, but to miss a meeting should bother you.</p>
<p>I have been serving the Lord for about fifty years. I didn&rsquo;t lose my job at the beginning of the fifty years; rather I quit my job. I had a good job, but I gave it up. My! when I was about to make the decision to quit my job, that seemed bigger than the earth. But fifty years have passed now, and the fact is that the Lord&rsquo;s word is trustworthy. We surely don&rsquo;t need to worry about our living. We don&rsquo;t need to have any anxiety about our necessities as long as we seek after Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRACTICAL KINGDOM LIFE</h2>
<p>You have to realize that the practical kingdom life is the meeting. If we seek after His kingdom, yet we don&rsquo;t meet, what kind of kingdom is this? The practical kingdom is the meeting life. To meet is to seek the kingdom first. To attend the meeting is to seek the kingdom first.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DOING THE WILL OF GOD</h2>
<p>Now we come back to the matter of doing the will of God. We live on this earth, and our goal, our purpose, is to do the will of our Father. How could we know His will? There is no other way except by attending the meetings. I can assure you that without coming to the meeting it would be more than hard for you to know God&rsquo;s will. The way to know God&rsquo;s will is to come to the meeting. When you begin to miss the meeting, you begin to miss God&rsquo;s will. Then you would begin to go back to that miserable life under Satan&rsquo;s tyranny from which you have been delivered already.</p>
<p>So we must do whatever we can not to miss any meetings. If this would jeopardize our job, let it jeopardize it. Coming to the meeting must be first. I have never seen one saint who eventually really suffered because of coming to the meeting. I have never seen one. Rather I can testify I have seen thousands in the past who kept coming to the meetings and who were much blessed by the Lord, not only spiritually but even physically. The Lord is faithful, and His promise is trustworthy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OUR DESTINY</h2>
<p>Saints, be encouraged and be assured. This is not only the right way, this is also the unique way. We have no choice. To be a human being, you have to be a Christian. To be a Christian, you have to come to the meeting. There is no choice. This is our destiny. To come to the meeting is not only our destination, it is our destiny. Our Father predestined us this way. To come together is our destiny. If we go along with God&rsquo;s predestination, surely we will be under His blessing. If not, we are kicking against the pricks, and we will suffer.</p>
<p>Some might consider that they sacrifice too much time to come to the meetings. They might consider that if they used all their time to do business they would make more money. Let them try four or five years and they will see the suffering. I have seen too many cases like this. This thought is quite deceiving and quite misleading. We have to stand on the trustworthy word in God&rsquo;s Holy Scripture. We have to trust in His promise, and we have to obey His commandment to come to the meeting. If you come to the meeting you are keeping His predestination, and the destiny of blessing will come to you. It will come not only to you, one generation, but perhaps even to the third generation, or generation after generation. Both you and your children will be under God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>This is our destiny, dear saints. To meet together is not a small thing. It is our destiny. We cannot have any other choice. Here we know the will of God and here we do the will of God and eventually we fulfill His purpose.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">MEETING TO SATISFY GOD WITH CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Deut. 12:5-7, 11-12; 14:22-23; 16:16-17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE OLD TESTAMENT TYPES</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament the church was still a hidden mystery within God. In the Old Testament God did not reveal the church to anyone. He kept it as a mystery within Himself. Yet in the Old Testament there were a lot of types, prefigures, and shadows of the church. For instance, Ephesians 5 tells us that Eve, the wife of Adam, was a type of the church. She was a wonderful type of the church. If we had only the New Testament, we could not know the church so much as we can through Eve as a type of the church. Not only so, if you go to Genesis 24, you have Rebekah, the wife of Isaac. The Bible students know that Isaac is a type of Christ, and Rebekah is a type of the church. She typifies certain crucial points of the church, such as how the church was selected mostly from the Gentiles, from out of the world, and brought to Christ.</p>
<p>In the next book, Exodus, the tabernacle was not only a type of Christ but also a type of the corporate Christ, that is, the church. The ark within the tabernacle was a type of the individual Christ, but the tabernacle was a type of the corporate Christ, the church.</p>
<p>The biggest type of the church in the Old Testament was the people of Israel. As a collective people the people of Israel were a type of the church. This type was the biggest among all the types of the church because the church in the New Testament is also a people, a collective people. In the Old Testament God had a people, and in the New Testament God also has a people. The people in the Old Testament were a type of the people of God in the New Testament. What the history of the children of Israel depicted was a type of the history of the church. Many crucial aspects of the type in the history of Israel cannot be found in the New Testament. The types are very meaningful and rich to help us know the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p>Many Christian teachers have spent time studying the New Testament to find out how Christians should meet. Every one of them could testify he didn&rsquo;t find the adequate way. Just by reading or studying the New Testament, you surely cannot see adequately how the Christians should meet. Only a few verses mention the matter of meeting. First of all, in Matthew 18:20 the Lord said that, where two or three are gathered together in His name, He was in the midst. This verse only tells us something about meeting together into the Lord&rsquo;s name. Of course, the Brethren teachers grasped this verse as a real ground. They expounded and enlarged this verse to condemn all the denominational names because the Baptists meet into the name of Baptist, and the Presbyterians meet into the name of the Presbytery. The Lutherans meet into the name of Luther. The Wesleyans meet into the name of Wesley. So the Brethren teachers condemned this practice as a kind of spiritual fornication, saying that we should gather only into the unique name, that is, the name of our Lord Jesus Christ. He is our unique husband. We should come together into this unique name. If we come together into any other name, that is a kind of spiritual fornication. This is quite serious.</p>
<p>Then you may go on to the book of Acts. You may think that the book of Acts should tell us how Christians should meet. Actually, you can find very little. In chapter twenty it does tell us that the disciples met on the first day of the week to break bread. Of course, some picked this up and said that we have to meet on the first day of the week. And this is confirmed by 1 Corinthians 16:1 which speaks of setting aside of certain amount of income on the first day of the week as a gift to the Lord. Also in Acts you could find some verses telling us that when the Christians came together they continued in the apostles&rsquo; teaching and fellowship (Acts 2:42).</p>
<p>The only verse in the New Testament that tells us how to meet is 1 Corinthians 14:26. The Brethren teachers made a big subject out of this verse. Based upon this verse the Brethren teachers practically annulled the so-called services in Christianity. But still 1 Corinthians 14:26 does not adequately tell us how to meet. Years ago I studied this verse very much and tried my best to find out something. After so much study I could not find something adequate on how to meet. Even I noticed that the Brethren with whom I met didn&rsquo;t practice that verse as much as they should. That was mainly a verse to them as a ground for their teaching to annul the Christianity services. But they didn&rsquo;t practice that verse in full. The point is this: just by the New Testament, we cannot find out how to meet.</p><h2 class="head1">A MEETING PEOPLE</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament you have a collective people typifying the church. One of the primary things this people should impress us with is the matter of meeting. Beginning from the night of the Passover they continued to meet. They had the Passover in their houses, but I don&rsquo;t consider that as a meeting. But in a sense it was a kind of home meeting. But there was no individual Passover. The Passover was not held by individuals. It was held by houses. The Passover Lamb was not killed for any individual, but for the houses.</p>
<p>Then continuing that Passover they were gathered. That was a meeting. They were gathered to be an army. Right after the Passover they began to fight. So they needed to be formed into an army, and that formation into an army was their meeting. Right after the Passover all the children of Israel became a meeting people. They met, not only every day, but all day and all night. You might ask, How could we meet like this? But if you read Acts 2 and 4 there was this kind of atmosphere or at least this kind of aspiration. The three thousand and the five thousand, after being saved, had the aspiration, I believe, to stay together day and night. Once again I say that one of the primary things the children of Israel did that should impress us is their meeting. They became a meeting people. It was through that meeting that God did everything. God did nothing outside of their meeting. God did nothing without that meeting. God did everything through that meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PEOPLE MEETING</h2>
<p>You have to realize that those people who were there meeting together were a type of the church. What is the church? The church is a people meeting together. This is the <em>ekklesia,</em> a people called out to meet together. Suppose there is no meeting. Where then is the church? If there is no meeting, there is no church. The church is just the meeting. The church is not only the meeting people, but the people meeting. The meeting people may not meet. But when the people are meeting, surely everybody is in the meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SCATTERED INTO CAPTIVITY</h2>
<p>Suppose we don&rsquo;t come together anymore. Suppose we are dismissed forever. Where is the church? Then we are scattered. Dismissed is a good word, but we don&rsquo;t like the word scattered. If the church is scattered it means the church is in captivity. When so many saints miss the meetings I wonder whether they have been dismissed or scattered. If you have been dismissed, that is very good. But if you have been scattered, that means you are captured. I don&rsquo;t like to offend you, but I must be frank and honest to tell you the truth: if you don&rsquo;t come to the church meeting, you are in captivity.</p>
<p>I have missed the meeting very few times within the past twenty years. When I was not in the meeting I had the feeling that I was left in prison. There was not one time when the church was meeting and I was not in the meeting that I had a good time. I cannot say that the church was meeting and I stayed home and had a good time. I cannot say how pleasant it is that while the church is meeting I am staying home. What is your feeling when you stay home from the meeting? Captivity! You have not been properly dismissed. You have been captured. You are in captivity. We must see what is the church. The church is not just a meeting people; it is a people meeting.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A MEETING LIFE</h2>
<p>In a recent meeting with the sisters I said that human life is vanity and that the Christian life is meaningless without the church life. Then what kind of life is meaningful? It is neither the human life nor in a sense the Christian life. There are millions of Christians today on the earth, but many of them do not have a meaningful life. They are Christians, yet still their Christian life is meaningless because they don&rsquo;t have the church life.</p>
<p>Now I must add that the church life is just a meeting life. The Christian life needs the church life, and the church life is a meeting life. Your human life is vanity. Your Christian life needs the church life, and your church life must be a meeting life. If you don&rsquo;t meet, you don&rsquo;t have the church life. If you don&rsquo;t have the church life, your Christian life is meaningless.</p>
<p>If you want to have a life full of reality you must be a Christian. But even as a Christian you cannot by yourself reach the reality. Yes, Christ is reality, but this reality could only be reached and experienced in full in the church life. If you don&rsquo;t have the church life, you don&rsquo;t have the reality of the riches of Christ in full. Christ can never be touched and experienced adequately unless you are in the church. So if you don&rsquo;t have the church life your Christian life is aimless. There is no goal, no purpose. The purpose, the goal, the aim of the Christian life is the church. And you have to realize that the church is a people meeting. The church life is just a meeting life. There can be no argument. The fact is the fact. Don&rsquo;t tell me that you have been a Christian for years and that you do not meet with people often. Don&rsquo;t tell me that you stay home by yourself. I would say you are a poor Christian. But hallelujah! I am an enjoying Christian. I enjoy Christ! I experience Christ! How? By meeting with the saints. No one could call me a poor Christian. I enjoy the Lord Jesus all the time with the saints.</p>
<p>I would illustrate once again with the wedding day. The wedding day is supposed to be the most pleasant day. On the one hand my wedding day was very pleasant but compared with the meeting days, there was a different flavor. On a pleasant meeting day there is only honey. There is not a bit of vinegar. But many times on the wedding day there is not only honey but also vinegar. The wedding joy couldn&rsquo;t last as long as the meeting joy. In 1942 and 1943 we had a big revival and even tonight when I have a little recollection of these meetings I am so happy. When I think about the meetings in Elden hall in 1969 and 1970, my! I am so happy.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MOST PLEASANT TIME</h2>
<p>The most pleasant thing is meeting. Do you want to get rid of your anxiety? Come to the meeting. There is no anxiety in the meeting. If you still keep your anxiety, you are not in the meeting. You are in your anxiety. Don&rsquo;t think that I have no troubles. I have a lot of troubles, but when I come to the meeting I can say, Hallelujah! I am happy; I am pleasant.</p>
<p>Even regardless of how tired I am, whenever I come to a meeting I feel fine. There is no tiredness. I am so strengthened by the meeting. I am enriched, I am healed, I am uplifted by the meeting! Why? The joy of the Lord is your strength. And this strengthening joy is also a healing. The medical doctors would tell you that one of the best medicines is joy. If you could be joyful all the day long you wouldn&rsquo;t be sick so much. The most pleasant time is the meeting time.</p>
<p>According to typology the church is a people meeting. Without the meeting life, there is no church life. You may have the church in terminology, but you don&rsquo;t have the church in living reality. The living reality of the church is the meeting life. Hallelujah! We are churching! We are not only meeting, we are churching.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING TO SATISFY GOD WITH CHRIST</h2>
<p>Now we come to a very crucial point: for what do we meet? In the first message we pointed out that we meet to exhibit Christ in His victory, and in the second message we pointed out that we meet to do the will of God and fulfill His purpose. But in this message I would like to fellowship with you that we meet to satisfy God with Christ. Dear saints, you all have to realize that this is a big subject. To satisfy God is not a small thing. And to satisfy God with Christ is not a small thing. Both points are too great.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A DIVINE HUNGER</h2>
<p>If you read Exodus and Leviticus and Numbers and Deuteronomy you could realize that in the whole universe there is a divine hunger. God is hungry. When I studied the Pentateuch again with the saints in Taiwan about twenty-three years ago I was so impressed with this word. Leviticus 3:11 and 16 speak of &ldquo;the food of the offering made by fire unto the Lord.&rdquo; Certain offerings were food to God. You are not the only one who needs food; God also needs food. You are hungry, and your hunger is a sign of God&rsquo;s hunger. When you are hungry it should remind you that God is hungry.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John, the incarnated God one day came to a sinful woman asking for a drink. He was thirsty. He came to a thirsty sinner, the Samaritan woman, asking for a drink. Eventually that woman was satisfied, and the incarnated God also was satisfied. Why? Because the sinner got the Savior, and the Savior got the sinner. So both were satisfied. God is hungry. God needs something to eat. This thought is deeply revealed in the Pentateuch. In these four books of Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy you can find out that some of the offerings God required to be offered to Him by His people were for His food.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BURNT OFFERING</h2>
<p>For many years I read the Bible but I didn&rsquo;t understand the real meaning of the burnt offering. The burnt offering was the first of all the offerings. What was it for? For redemption? For peace making? No, the burnt offering was for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. You have to realize that the entire burnt offering was food to God (Lev. 3:11, 16). The burnt offering could only be enjoyed by God as His food when it became two things: when it became the sweet savor in the air, and when it became ashes on the ground. When the burnt offering became a sweet savor in the air and a heap of ashes on the ground, it was food to God. The burnt offering is altogether for God&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONLY ONE KIND OF BURNING</h2>
<p>The entire burnt offering was burnt by one kind of burning. With the sin offering there were two kinds of burnings&mdash;the sweet burning of the inside, of the inwards and the fat, and the judging burning of the outside, of the flesh, the skin, and the dung. But with the burnt offering there was only one kind of burning, the burning of the incense. This is the sweet burning, that causes something to ascend up to God. That is the sweet smell, the sweet savor, that goes to God for God&rsquo;s enjoyment. If you know the Bible you could see that whenever the burnt offering was being burnt on the altar, God was enjoying, and He was satisfied. It was a pleasant eating to Him. That was His breakfast and His dinner. The burnt offering had to be offered to God in the morning and in the evening. So at least God eats twice a day: breakfast and dinner. When is the time for you to offer your morning burnt offering? It is at morning watch time. In the morning you have to offer something to God. When is the time for you to offer your evening burnt offering? When is God&rsquo;s dinner time? It is the evening meeting.</p><h2 class="head1">PART OF OTHER OFFERINGS<br />
ALSO BEING FOOD TO GOD</h2>
<p>The meal offering, at least in part, was for God&rsquo;s food. The greater part was for the priests&rsquo; food. It was the same with the peace offering. A part was for God&rsquo;s food and a part was for the offerer&rsquo;s food, and another part was for the ministering priests&rsquo; food.</p>
<p>Even with the sin offering the inside, the inward parts, were burned sweetly to God for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. The same principle applied to the trespass offering. When we get into Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy in our life-study we will get into the details of all these offerings. We will see much more clearly.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FEEDING GOD</h2>
<p>But in this message I would like to impress you that this people in their meeting did nothing but feed God. In the feeding of God they themselves were fed. Their meeting was just a feeding. Firstly, they fed God. In the feeding of God, they got fed. They presented something for God to eat. God enjoyed a part, and the rest was for them to eat and enjoy before God. This is to hold a feast unto the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPLYING THE TYPE</h2>
<p>We all know that the feast was a type. How can we apply this today? It is so simple. Don&rsquo;t you have Christ? We all have Christ. So day after day we all should come together. Deuteronomy 16:16 says that we should not appear before the Lord empty. This means not to appear before God without offerings. You must come as the children of Israel did. You must come to God with some surplus, some produce, from the good land. These are the burnt offerings and the tithes, the tenths. These are the free-will offerings and the offerings of your vows. All these you must bring with you to the meeting for God. Whenever you come to the meeting you must have a deep realization that you have come to the meeting with Christ. Don&rsquo;t come to the meeting empty-handed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HANDS FULL OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In our Life-study of Exodus we have seen that to sanctify the priests to serve God is to fill their hands. This means to fill their hands with the offerings, with Christ. We all need to come to the meeting with Christ. Could you say that you don&rsquo;t have Christ? You might say you don&rsquo;t have much of Christ, but still you have some of Christ. You have something of Christ that you can offer.</p>
<p>When we come to the meeting we have to realize that God requires us to bring something of Christ as food for Him and for ourselves and for all the dear ones in the meeting. You have to feed them with Christ. You may say that you don&rsquo;t have much of Christ. But at least you have some amount of Christ. You have to exhaust what you have of Christ. Although Christ in Himself is exhaustless, you have to exhaust what you have of Christ. This is very much like our love feast. To come to the love feast empty-handed is a shame. If you just bring your two shoulders with one mouth ready to eat to the love feast, that is a shame. You must come to the love feast with something in your hand. Even if you bring only some donuts or some grapefruit, still that is good. Don&rsquo;t come to the love feast empty.</p>
<p>Based upon this principle our meeting time should always not be sufficient. This is why many times we may divide our meetings into many home meetings so that we may have more time for every one to feed God, to feed others, and to feed himself. This is not like today&rsquo;s situation. In the Christianity services of today there is very little feeding. There is just a speech or a sermon. But when we come together, you must come with Christ. When you get into the meeting don&rsquo;t wait or you will miss your time. Right away you need to feed, to serve, God with Christ.</p>
<p>Even the young sisters can come to the meeting with Christ to serve God. You can offer a short praise or a short prayer or a short testimony. Surely you can give a testimony in every meeting. If all of us would offer a short praise, a short prayer, a short testimony, there would not be sufficient time in the meeting. But there would be a lot of feeding.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OPENING YOUR MOUTH TO BE FILLED</h2>
<p>How then should we praise or pray or give a testimony? I would say forget about how-to! Just remember that when you get into the meeting, open up your mouth. The Bible promises us that when we open up our mouth, He will fill us (Psa. 81:10).</p>
<p>I can testify that a number of times when I was walking up to the platform I still didn&rsquo;t have any idea what I was going to speak. But when I opened my mouth something came. When you open up your mouth the Lord will fill you. Surely you have something to say. Be encouraged, be bold. I know that you have a lot of testimonies, but you hide the testimonies, keeping them as mysteries for eternity. It seems you want to keep these mysteries to tell us in the New Jerusalem. That will be too late! The testimonies given in this age all are pleasant. If you wait till the New Jerusalem, that will be a little too late. I encourage you all to praise, to pray, and to testify in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FORERUNNERS TO CUT THE WAY</h2>
<p>Let me repeat: the church is just the meeting life. How shall we meet? Just bring Christ with you and present this Christ by praising, by praying, and by testifying. Do this by faith. You have it! I feel we all must be the forerunners to cut the way into a proper meeting life. Even up till today at the end of the Twentieth Century the Lord hasn&rsquo;t got what He wants. He wants a people meeting as the church to bring Himself to all the meetings and to present Himself to God and to man for God&rsquo;s satisfaction and for man&rsquo;s satisfaction and even for their own satisfaction. The Lord wants such a people to come together day after day to be a living testimony in the entire universe. We must be the forerunners to pioneer the way, to cut the way. Let us forget about the Christianity services. Let us forget about religious services. Let us be impressed that we are God&rsquo;s people meeting with Christ. We come to the meeting with Christ to present Him to God and man that the meeting might be so living, so rich, and so uplifted.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">MEETING TO ENJOY CHRIST WITH GOD</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Deut. 12:5-7, 11-12; 14:22-23; Lev. 2:1-3; 3:9-11; 6:9, 12, 26; 7:5-6, 15, 19b, 29-34</h1>
<p>In this message we come to this point, that is, when we meet, we meet to enjoy Christ with God. When most people go to a Christian gathering or a Christian meeting, they wouldn&rsquo;t say that they go to offer something to God, or even to enjoy something. Usually they say that they go to listen to the preaching or to listen to the Word or to worship. Of course, this is not wrong, but this is altogether from the human point of view concerning a religious meeting.</p>
<p>In the New Testament we have not been charged much to meet together. Of course it does charge us, but not that much. The first time that the New Testament says something about Christians gathering is in Matthew 18:20: &ldquo;For where two or three are gathered together into (Gk.) My name, there I am in their midst.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The book of Acts didn&rsquo;t charge the newly saved ones to meet together, but they gathered spontaneously every day. In Paul&rsquo;s writings he did instruct us a little bit in 1 Corinthians 14 how to meet. First Corinthians 14:26 may be considered the unique verse that tells us how to meet. That verse says that when we come together as the church, each one should have something. This one has a psalm. Another one has a teaching, and another one has a revelation. The last two are tongues and interpretation of tongues. This means you have to come together with something. Using the Old Testament term, do not come empty-handed. You should come with something in your hand. You should be filled to come to the meeting to do something. But even in this verse Paul doesn&rsquo;t mention that you have to offer something and that you have to enjoy something and that you have to rejoice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OLD TESTAMENT PICTURES</h2>
<p>Once again you can see how that the New Testament with its clear teaching in plain words needs the Old Testament picture to illustrate it. A picture is always better than a thousand words. Some things you just cannot describe by word. Suppose you try to describe my face by writing. You would need so many terms to describe the shape of the nose or the two lips. But if you simply have a photo you can be so clear about my face. Right away you can see two ears and one nose. You can see two eyes and one mouth, two cheeks, and a forehead. You don&rsquo;t need to exhaust the dictionary. You can simply look at the photo. This is the reason that God teaches us in the Bible in somewhat a kindergarten way. Firstly, there are the pictures in the Old Testament; then there is the word in the New Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REDEEMED TO MEET</h2>
<p>In the Old Testament you do have an excellent and wonderful type of how to meet. I love it. In 1959 I had a thorough study of the Pentateuch with the saints in Taiwan. In that year the Lord showed us many marvelous things concerning how His people should meet. It was at that time we saw that God redeemed His people mainly for the purpose of meeting.</p>
<p>The children of Israel were down in Egypt, under the tyranny of Pharaoh and in the slavery of the Egyptians. But then they were redeemed and delivered out of that tyranny and slavery and brought into the wilderness. In the Life-study of Exodus we pointed out that the word wilderness here is not a negative term. It is a positive word. The Lord said that He would bring His people into the wilderness to meet. In their meetings what did they do? They feasted with God and with one another. They feasted before God and with one another. God then spent a long time to train them how to meet in the way of feasting. God didn&rsquo;t teach them how to sing a solo or a quartet. God didn&rsquo;t write a hymn book for them. God didn&rsquo;t even teach them to kneel down, to bow down, to prostrate. He didn&rsquo;t teach them how to be quiet, how to meditate, or even how to shout. That was not God&rsquo;s teaching concerning His people&rsquo;s meeting. The singings, the solos, the quartets, the being quiet or the being noisy are all religious inventions.</p><h2 class="head1">DIFFERENT WAYS OF WORSHIP</h2>
<p>I was born into Christianity. My mother&rsquo;s grandfather was saved and became a Southern Baptist. I was the fourth generation Southern Baptist. Eventually I turned to the Chinese Presbyterian church. But that disappointed me also. During that time I got saved through a young sister who was an evangelist. After I got saved I was even more disappointed with the Chinese Presbyterians. Then I turned to the British Brethren, where I stayed for seven and a half years. But neither was I so satisfied with them. Eventually I came into the inner life. Eventually I felt it was not satisfactory to me, so I went to taste something of the Pentecostalism. Pentecostalism altogether makes a show. Nothing is hidden. Everything is on the surface. There are no mystical things. Everything is an exhibit. The Pentecostal meetings are like public shows. Neither was I satisfied with this.</p>
<p>When I was in the Philippines I purposely went to the Catholic cathedrals a number of times to study the situation. I stayed there for a time to see how the people bought the candles and how they looked for a &ldquo;saint.&rdquo; Sometimes a lady would go to &ldquo;Saint Teresa,&rdquo; and the next time she would go to &ldquo;Saint Mary.&rdquo; I watched how they burned the candles and how they made their prayers to reduce the length of their parents&rsquo; time in purgatory.</p>
<p>When I was very young, even though I was born into Christianity, sometimes I was brought into the Buddhist temple, and I saw how the Buddhists worshipped their idols. In 1935 about seven or eight co-workers and myself stayed with Brother Watchman Nee at the famous Western Lake. Around the lake on the shore were many temples full of idols. Every morning the worshippers went there to worship the idols and to make some funny noises. I purposely went to watch their worship.</p>
<p>In 1958 I traveled through Europe. I went to Tehran, Persia, today&rsquo;s Iran. I went to Baghdad, Iraq. I went to Beirut, Lebanon. Wherever I went I did my best to study how the people worshipped. When I was in Athens, Greece I went purposely to the Greek Orthodox Church to contact their people and to study and to look at their worship. When I was in Jerusalem I went to that square with the big denominations at the four corners: the Greek Orthodox, the Roman Catholic, the Protestant, and the Armenian. I saw all their services. I even went to the well in Samaria and paid two dollars to buy a cup of water brought up from that well by an Armenian monk. I have studied all these religious things. When I was in Jerusalem I went to the second most important mosque of Islam. The first is in Mecca and the second is in Jerusalem on Mount Zion. Probably it occupies the site of the old temple. The first thing they ask you to do is to take off your shoes. We all took off our shoes and put on their so-called holy sandals. I noticed how the Moslems, the Arabs, worshipped God. In a big yard in the open air they all prostrated themselves on the ground. They worshipped there, not just for one hour, but nearly for half a day. My point is this: I found out that different religions all invented different ways to have their worship to God. I learned all these things before 1958.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORSHIP GOD DESIRES</h2>
<p>Then in 1959, as I mentioned before, I had another time to study the Pentateuch. It was with the background of the study of all the different kinds of worships invented by all the different religions that the Lord showed me the unique worship He actually wants.</p>
<p>After God created Adam and Eve He didn&rsquo;t command them to worship Him. The principle in Genesis 2 is the same as in Exodus and Leviticus. After God created man, God brought him not to the matter of worship, but to the matter of eating. God didn&rsquo;t charge them to worship, but to eat. They should eat the right thing and eat rightly. Then they would get life. If they ate the wrong thing and ate wrongly, they would get death. After man&rsquo;s fall, man saw his own nakedness, and he did something to cover his nakedness. Of course, God came in and did something. He made a covering of the skin of the cattle. The main thing mentioned in Genesis 3 is the matter of eating.</p>
 <h2 class="head1">PRIESTLY SERVICE TO GOD</h2>
<p>Abel was the second generation of mankind. What did he do? Did he worship God? Did he sing a hymn? Did he praise God? There was no record of such a thing. He offered of the firstlings of his flock to satisfy God. Abel was the first priest because he offered the proper sacrifice to satisfy God, through which he was accepted by God. He was pleasing to God, and he was acceptable to God.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t think that the priests began from Aaron and his sons. Noah also was a priest. Also in Genesis there was a priest whose name was Melchisedec. What is a priest? Or who is a priest? It is one who offers some food to God, one who serves God, not by singing, not by praising, not by bowing down, but by offering some food for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. That is a priest. Singing, praising, and bowing down are all natural, human, religious inventions.</p>
<p>What is revealed in the holy Word concerning worship? To worship God is to offer something that pleases God and satisfies God. And this something we have to offer, according to what is revealed to us in the entire Bible is just Christ Himself. Abel&rsquo;s offering to God was a type of Christ.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s chosen people, the children of Israel, all got fallen into Egypt. God came in and redeemed them and delivered them out of tyranny to a meeting place. To do what? To do the priestly service to God, just to bring what God wants, to bring what can please God and satisfy God to God as God&rsquo;s food. Then they were to eat together with God and to rejoice in what they ate. Brothers, this is how to meet. God&rsquo;s redemption and God&rsquo;s salvation are for such a goal. God redeemed us to meet. God saved us to meet. God brought us out of the tyranny of Satan and the slavery of sin to a meeting place.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S NAME AND GOD&rsquo;S HABITATION</h2>
<p>He brought us to a meeting in the place designated and chosen by God Himself with two main things: His name should be settled there, and His habitation would be there. The place which God has chosen for us to meet is with His name and His habitation. His name and His habitation both keep His people in oneness. There is only one name into which we should meet (Matt. 18:20). And there is only one center where we should meet, and that center is God&rsquo;s habitation. Without these two things God&rsquo;s people will be divided. We will meet according to our tastes. We will come together according to our choice, our preference. But God says, &ldquo;You have no preference. I don&rsquo;t let you have your choice. The choice must be uniquely Mine. Only I, your God, have the choice. I will choose a place and designate it with My name and put My habitation there&rdquo; (Deut. 12:11-18). Eventually we know that this place was Mount Zion. God put His holy name there, and God built His habitation there. That became the unique and undivided and indivisible center of God&rsquo;s people where they met together.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A MEETING LIFE</h2>
<p>So you can see that meeting is not a small thing. The meeting life, even in the Old Testament, was God&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s life. God&rsquo;s people&rsquo;s life was a meeting life. By reading the Old Testament carefully you could see that all the males of Israel should come together three times a year: at the Feast of the Passover, at the Feast of Weeks or Pentecost, and at the Feast of Tabernacles (Deut. 16:16). According to the Old Testament any male who would not come was cut off (Num. 9:13). It was so serious because the proper life of God&rsquo;s redeemed people was a meeting life. For them to meet was to gather together into the name of God and into the habitation of God to offer food to God and to serve God with food. It was not a matter of singing or praising or bowing down or prostrating. In this service the serving ones, the priests, have a share to eat before God, with God, and with one another.</p>
 <h2 class="head1">EATING AND REJOICING</h2>
<p>Dear saints, this is to meet. To meet is to offer sacrifices. To meet is to eat what you have offered to God. To meet is to rejoice in what you eat. Have you ever realized that we Christians must meet together to feed God? We are the waiters and some of us are even the cooks. We cook and we serve God with food. When we serve Him we eat with Him and we eat before Him, and we eat one with another. Then we rejoice (Deut. 12:7).</p>
<p>These things concerning the meetings are not so easy to describe, so God gave us a photo. The photo is in Deuteronomy and Leviticus. Don&rsquo;t think that those are just Old Testament teachings and that they are just for the old Israel. At least you have one book in the New Testament, Hebrews, which gives us a lot of interpretations of the Old Testament books. Also the writer in Hebrews indicated clearly that he didn&rsquo;t have the time to give us the full interpretation of the Pentateuch (Heb. 5:11; 11:32). So this means there are a lot of things in the Pentateuch which have not been touched by the writers of the New Testament. But we should not believe that because they were not touched by the New Testament writers, they mean nothing to us. That is not logical. Logically speaking, they should mean something to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TYPES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Most Christians realize that the Passover is a type of Christ. We should not consider that only the Passover offering was a type of Christ and the rest were not. In principle we cannot say this. In principle you must say that every offering and every bit of a certain offering must be the type of Christ. Based upon this principle not only the offering but also the produce of the good land must be also a type of Christ, because the offerings or the sacrifices came from the produce of the land. It was around 1959 that the Lord showed us that even the land of Canaan was a rich and all-inclusive type of Christ.</p>
<p>One of the first conferences I gave in this country was concerning the good land as a type of the all-inclusive Christ. Most of those messages came from a few verses in Deuteronomy 8. No doubt there are sufficient reasons to believe that every aspect of the good land is a type of the riches, the all-inclusiveness, of Christ in certain points. So the good land was a type of Christ, and the produce, no doubt, was also a type of Christ. Out of the produce you have the tithes, and you have the firstborn ones. All these are Christ. All the tithes, all the firstborn ones, all the firstfruits brought to Mount Zion to present to God are Christ. All these things became the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, the wave offering, the freewill offering, and the offerings of the vows. All the different offerings are Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">A FESTIVAL</h2>
<p>What shall you do when you come to the meeting? We all have to learn to say that we come to the meeting first of all to feed God. Secondly, we come to the meeting to eat before Him, with Him, with one another, and also to rejoice in what we eat. This is not a kind of common feeding, so the Bible calls this a feast, a festival (Deut. 16:16). You cannot have a feast just by yourself. To have a feast you need two kinds of riches. You need to have riches in people. You need a number of people coming together. I surely like to eat with people. The more the better! Feasting is a joy. Yet feasting must be rich in people and also rich in food.</p>
<p>Look at the picture. The children of Israel from the first day of the year to the last day of the year, with the exception of all the Sabbaths, were working on the land. And the land was Christ. No doubt, this is a picture showing us how that we as God&rsquo;s redeemed people should work all the day on Christ. We sow the seed, we water the crop, then we reap a rich produce. We live on this and then we keep the top portion, the firstborn, the firstfruit, the top tenth aside for the time when we come together for the meeting. We gather into the name of our God, and we gather into His habitation. Where He dwells, we meet with Him. Actually, we all are invited by Him to come to His home.</p>
 <h2 class="head1">COOPERATING WITH GOD</h2>
<p>Here is a strange point: usually those who are invited to a feast don&rsquo;t bring food. But to come to a feast with a lot of food is very scriptural. God invited all His people to come together, yet God didn&rsquo;t cook. Although God didn&rsquo;t cook the food, He had given the food already. He had given them the food by sending the sunshine, the air, and the rain year around. Yet they needed to cooperate with God&rsquo;s sending. All the things were sent, but they needed to cooperate with God to have the produce. Then the produce became the tithes, and the tithes were brought to answer God&rsquo;s invitation. Everyone was invited to God&rsquo;s home. Everybody came home to feed the Father and to satisfy Him. What a happy time this was!</p>
<p>All this must be Christ. When we come together, we should come with Christ in this way. You have to forget about your music. Forget about sopranos and altos. This is not the main thing. The main thing is how much Christ do you bring to the meeting? How much Christ you bring to the meeting depends upon how much Christ you produce, how much Christ you have grown. You have to labor on Christ as the land so that you can produce Christ. Actually, it is not that you produce Christ, but that Christ produces Christ Himself through your labor. The poor thing today is that the Christians as God&rsquo;s redeemed people all come together empty-handed.</p>
<p>I believe thus far we have presented a clear picture of how we should come together. Meeting is the proper church life. Meeting is the practical church life. Without this kind of meeting we don&rsquo;t have the practical church life. What we have might be just a kind of organization with certain communal activities. But the proper church life should be a meeting life. Before coming to the meeting we must be laboring on Christ. We must reap Christ. We must have gathered some amount of Christ so that when we come to meet we come filled with Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FILLED WITH CHRIST</h2>
<p>In the Life-study of Exodus we have seen what is a priest. A priest is one not only washed and clothed and redeemed, but also filled without and within. Before we were saved, we were dirty, we were naked, we were sinful in nature, and we were empty without and within, having nothing to satisfy God nor ourselves. But one day God sanctified us. He sanctified us by washing away all our dirt, by covering our nakedness, by redeeming us, and by filling us outwardly and inwardly. Now we are full of Christ. The washing water is Christ, the clothing is Christ, the redeeming is Christ, and the filling up is also Christ. Our hands are full of Christ, and our inward being is full of Christ, and we do have something to offer to God for His food that He may be satisfied. Even we have something to satisfy ourselves, to saturate us, and to transform us. This is God&rsquo;s revelation. To meet is to be filled with Christ and to come together to feed God with Christ and to feed one another with Christ, even to feed yourself with Christ, and to rejoice in this feeding.</p><h2 class="head1">A PORTION OF CHRIST BY FAITH</h2>
<p>How can you practice this? I believe that you already know that you have to labor on Christ all the day long. And you already know that you need to come to the meeting with Christ filling your hand and filling you inwardly. But now I would like to fellowship with you about this one point: you should have some amount of faith to believe that you do have some portion of Christ. I tell you, Satan is a liar! Satan is tricking us, telling us a lie that we have nothing. Satan has cheated all of us. He always points out that we don&rsquo;t have a good attitude toward our wife, that we are not victorious in our family living, so how can we dare to shout and to declare or to proclaim something? Accusation from Satan has subdued you.</p>
<p>If Aaron had been altogether victorious, altogether clean and pure, then he would not have needed the sin offering. Don&rsquo;t forget that when the children of Israel came together, they firstly needed the sin offering and the trespass offering. Even the word offering implies a certain degree of redemption. The blood was shed and poured upon the altar signifying redemption. Every time we come to the meeting we need the blood. Claim the blood, and apply the blood to your situation. Sometimes you may have been a little negligent, not so much on the alert, and you lost your temper. So you got a defeat. Still come to the meeting! Claim the blood! Apply the blood to your situation by faith. Then you have to tell Satan, &ldquo;Satan, even though I got a defeat, yet I still have some amount of Christ!&rdquo; Sometimes you have to stand up and tell the saints, &ldquo;Dear saints, just thirty-five minutes ago I was defeated in a situation with my family. But I have applied Christ as my sin offering! His blood has cleansed me. I would like to tell Satan before you all that I have an amount of Christ!&rdquo;</p>
 <h2 class="head1">FORMALITY BECAUSE OF DEADNESS</h2>
<p>I believe if we all would practice in this way, our meetings would be delivered from being formal. The formality in today&rsquo;s Christian services is due to the deadness of all the attendants. Because every one comes in dead some form is needed. We need someone to do this for us, and we need another one to do that for us. We need someone to sing a solo for us, and we need a group wearing long robes to sing a quartet for us. All these formal things are full of death.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PORTION TO SATISFY EVERY PARTY</h2>
<p>All of us should come with Christ. We should come not only with Christ as our burnt offering, our meal offering, our peace offering, but also as our sin offering and trespass offering. Even we should come with Christ as our wave offering and our heave offering, offering the breast in love. We come with a resurrected Christ offering Him in love and enjoying Him. We bring the ascended Christ of strength and power, and we share Him in the meetings.</p>
<p>Have you noticed of all these different kinds of offerings, even with the sin offering, the priests, all the clean ones, have the right to eat a portion? It was the same with the trespass offering. Of course the burnt offering was burned completely to be food for God. With the meal offering some was burned for God&rsquo;s food and the rest was for the priests&rsquo; food. The priests didn&rsquo;t eat secular food. They ate the meal offering and the peace offering. The peace offering is so rich: there is a portion for God, a portion for the offering people, a portion for the ministering priests, and a portion for the priests&rsquo; family. There is also a portion for others. This is the peace offering because this is the offering that satisfies every party. So we all are satisfied; we all have peace; we all have joy; we all have the enjoyment with satisfaction. This is the real peace! Hallelujah! This is to offer Christ to God for His food and to eat Christ ourselves and to rejoice in what we eat. Don&rsquo;t forget these three words: offer, eat, and rejoice. This is to meet! Offer Christ! Eat Christ! Rejoice in Christ!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">MEETING TO ENJOY CHRIST WITH GOD</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Deut. 12:5-7, 11-12; 14:22-23; 26:9-11; Num. 18:12-13</h1>
<p>In the past messages we have seen that the worship God desires is for us to offer Christ to Him in the meetings. This means that firstly we labor on Christ and then we bring Him and present Him to God as God&rsquo;s food. The destination of our salvation is a feast with God. In this message we need to consider what are the groceries used in preparing a feast with God. We know that groceries are mostly items that grow in the field and are reaped. Some of the groceries for preparing a feast for God are listed in Deuteronomy 12:6: &ldquo;And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, and your tithes, and heave offerings of your hand, and your vows, and your freewill offerings, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">INTO THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>In verse 5 the Lord indicated that He would put His name in a certain place. The name always denotes the person. A name without a person is nothing. It is vain and empty. So the name is the person. When the Lord says that He will put His name there, it means that He will put Himself there. There will be on this earth a place where Jehovah God, the Triune God, will put His name, even Himself. This is not a small thing. The principle of meeting is here.</p>
<p>We can also see this principle in the New Testament. Matthew 18:20 says, &ldquo;For where two or three are gathered together into (Gk.) My name, there I am in their midst.&rdquo; So in Matthew 18 there is the name of the Lord Jesus, and in the Old Testament there is the name of Jehovah your God. These are one. So in the New Testament when we say that we have to meet into the Lord&rsquo;s name, that means into Himself. Even in the Old Testament the meeting of God&rsquo;s chosen people was in the same principle. They met unto the name of Jehovah their God (Deut. 12:5). That means they met unto the Triune God, because they had to go to a place where God put Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">UNTO GOD&rsquo;S HABITATION</h2>
<p>They also had to go to a place that was God&rsquo;s habitation. For God to put His name in a place means that God Himself is there, so that place becomes a place where God dwells. That is the habitation. Today whenever we meet together into the Lord&rsquo;s name, then our meeting becomes the dwelling place of our Lord. This dwelling place is just His habitation. Where should we meet? We should meet where the Lord is and where the Lord has put His name. And we should meet where there is the habitation of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SEEKING GOD&rsquo;S HABITATION</h2>
<p>Verse 5 also says, &ldquo;Unto His habitation shall ye seek.&rdquo; We all have to seek His habitation. This is not just to go. To go is a weaker expression. To seek is stronger. We should not only go to the meeting, but also seek the meeting. We must have a desire, a hunger, for the meeting. When we are not hungry physically we don&rsquo;t think about eating. But when we are hungry we seek after food. The word seek indicates some kind of hunger and desire and thirst.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MAIN ITEM OF FOOD</h2>
<p>Verse 6 continues, &ldquo;And thither ye shall bring your burnt offerings.&rdquo; This is not the groceries; this is the cooked food. The main item, and even the first item of food with which we feed God, is the burnt offering. The first and main dish of a meal may be steak or turkey. That is the first course. The burnt offering is the first course of God&rsquo;s food. The divine feast has a first course, and that is the burnt offering.</p>
 <h2 class="head1">OTHER COURSES OF THE FEAST</h2>
<p>Then come the sacrifices. These are dishes, or courses, following the main course. These are the courses following the burnt offering. After the burnt offering you have the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. These are the sacrifices. In his writing of Deuteronomy, Moses saves some words and repetitions. He simply says burnt offerings and sacrifices. But in the first six chapters of Leviticus he gives us more details concerning the sacrifices such as the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, the trespass offering, and the subordinate offerings.</p>
<p>These are the courses of our feast. Suppose you are going to set up a feast for feeding God and feeding your fellow believers. What are you going to serve? First of all you should serve a burnt offering and second a meal offering. Why? It is because the burnt offering is from the cattle; it is of the animal life. The second course, the meal offering, is of the vegetable life. The third course is the peace offering which includes both the animal and the vegetable life. The fourth course is a sin offering of an animal. The fifth is a trespass offering of the animal life and sometimes a little of the vegetable life. You have to serve God in your divine feast with these five main courses with some subordinate courses. The subordinate courses would be like the dessert.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TITHES</h2>
<p>Verse 6 also mentions the tithes. This is not a course. This means one tenth of your produce. This is a total title of all the groceries. All the groceries are tithes. One tenth, the top part, of your produce is set apart for God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HEAVE OFFERING</h2>
<p>The heave offering is also mentioned in verse 6. The heave offering is not the main offering. It may be considered a subordinate offering. The heave offering also includes the wave offering. The heave offering refers to the ascension, and when you mention the ascension, resurrection is included also. When you speak of resurrection, you may not have the ascension, but when you speak of the ascension, resurrection is also included. Just as the burnt offering includes all of the following offerings so the heave offering includes the foregoing offering. The foregoing offering to the heave offering is the wave offering. Resurrection goes before ascension, and ascension follows resurrection. So there is the burnt offering as the leading offering, and there is the heave offering as the ending offering. The burnt offering is the leading one of the main offerings, and the heave offering is one of the subordinate offerings. It is very meaningful.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OFFERINGS OF YOUR VOWS</h2>
<p>In verse 6 the phrase &ldquo;and your vows&rdquo; is better translated, &ldquo;and of your vows.&rdquo; The whole phrase should read, &ldquo;The heave offerings of your hand, and of your vows.&rdquo; There are two things here. All the offerings offered to God are produced from the land by the labor of the hand. That offering was required just like today we have to pay income tax. Income tax is required today. Tithing actually was a kind of income tax. The first offering was required as a produce from your hand. But the second is offered for a vow. That is not required. For example, you are required to pay a certain amount of income tax, but besides the income tax you paid, you give the government something more. That is not a required tax; that is a kind of payment of your vow. That is a kind of a payment based upon your patriotism. Because you love your country you want to give your country something more than is required.</p>
<p>It was the same with the Israelites. Whether you loved God or didn&rsquo;t love God, as long as you were an Israelite you had to bring in the tax. Of all your produce, one tenth should be brought in. This may be likened to the income tax. If you don&rsquo;t pay your income tax you will get into trouble. The government may fine you or may put you into jail. But the vow is different. The vow means you like to give something more than what is required by the government because you are so patriotic.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FREEWILL OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>The freewill offerings are also mentioned in verse 6. What is the difference between the offerings of the vow and the freewill offerings? The offerings of the vow were for a promise that you made. You promised to give a certain amount. Sometimes the church may practice this. Six years ago when we were preparing to build this hall we didn&rsquo;t know how much the saints could or would give, so we asked many of you to write a kind of promise to the church telling us what you would give. Many of us including myself wrote a kind of promise. That became a vow to the church. Every month we put in a certain amount to fulfill our vows.</p>
<p>But besides that, some still gave something more. This was a freewill offering. It was voluntary. Some gave what they promised for the hall plus something more. The extra portion became the voluntary offerings. The offerings for the vow are stronger, and the tithe was even much stronger because that was to fulfill a requirement. The vow implies partially a kind of free will. If you never made such a vow you are not obligated. But whether we make a vow or don&rsquo;t make a vow we still have to pay the income tax. According to the Pentateuch all the offerings are of these three degrees. The tithes are the strongest, the vows are weaker, and the voluntary offerings are the weakest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIRSTLINGS OF THE HERDS AND OF THE FLOCKS</h2>
<p>From these verses we can see what are the main courses of the divine feast and what are the groceries. Thus far we haven&rsquo;t gotten to the groceries. But now we come to the last item, the seventh: &ldquo;And the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks.&rdquo; These are items of the groceries. Firstly, it speaks of the firstlings of your herd, and secondly, the firstlings of your flocks. The herds refer to oxen, and the flocks refer to sheep. Now there are two kinds of groceries. The firstlings of the herds and of the flocks are the first two items of the groceries.</p><h2 class="head1">WHEAT, WINE, AND OIL</h2>
<p>Now we need to go to Deuteronomy 14:23 to find more items of the groceries. &ldquo;And thou shalt eat before the Lord thy God, in the place which he shall choose to place his name there, the tithe of thy corn, of thy wine, and of thine oil, and the firstlings of thy herds and of thy flocks; that thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always.&rdquo; In this verse there are three categories of groceries which are not of the oxen or of the sheep. These three are vegetables. Corn is wheat or cereal. Wine is of the grapevine. Oil is of the olive tree. Following the three categories of vegetable life are the firstlings of the herds and of the flocks. Firstling means the firstborn. This is the firstborn of your oxen and of your sheep.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THAT WE MAY LEARN TO FEAR THE LORD</h2>
<p>This verse mentions that thou mayest learn to fear the Lord thy God always. What does this mean? Let me illustrate. When we pay income tax, we all fear the government. You have to be careful to pay it rightly. If you don&rsquo;t pay it rightly you offend the government. This is exactly what is mentioned here. God ordained this ordinance so that His people might learn to fear Him. If they didn&rsquo;t tithe all the increase of their seed from the field and if they didn&rsquo;t offer the firstborn ones of their herds and of their flocks, this means they did not fear God. This means they did according to what they liked, according to their desire, according to their intention, according to their will, not according to God&rsquo;s ordination. So they did not fear God. These ordinances were given that they might learn how to fear God.</p>
<p>You may consider that this is too much of the law. Don&rsquo;t say this. Today you feel free and you feel good, so you come to the meetings. But if you don&rsquo;t feel free and you don&rsquo;t feel good you don&rsquo;t come to the meetings. Then after coming to the meetings, if you feel happy you say something. If you don&rsquo;t feel happy you don&rsquo;t say anything. What does this indicate? This indicates that you don&rsquo;t have any fear of the Lord. If you have the fear of the Lord surely you will come to the meetings regularly, and when you come, you will surely offer Christ.</p>
<p>To use our illustration once more, if you feel that you are tired of paying income tax and you don&rsquo;t want to pay income tax anymore, this means you have no fear of the government. If you have the proper fear of the government you will pay your tax before April 15. Our country has a government with all the ordinances concerning the taxation of our income. We have to fear the country. We have to pay the taxes according to the regulations and the requirements.</p>
<p>By studying the type I have realized that to come to the meeting indicates a fear of God. I have no choice. And I must come to the meeting to function. That is my obligation. I have no choice. I fear my God. I cannot stay home when the church is meeting. If you can stay home and take it easy, playing your piano or watching your television or relaxing instead of coming to the meeting, this means you don&rsquo;t have a proper fear of God. If the church meeting is going on, yet you stay home for your pleasure this indicates you don&rsquo;t fear God. It seems that your God doesn&rsquo;t have any government or any ordinances.</p>
<p>Sometimes when you are tired you may consider getting to the meeting late. Instead of arriving on time you arrive ten minutes after the scheduled time. This is not only your laziness; this is your lacking of a proper fear toward God. I am pretty sure God is there before the scheduled time. I surely don&rsquo;t like for Him to wait for me. I should go there to wait for Him. If you are invited by a certain brother to his home for dinner by six o&rsquo;clock and you arrive at seven-ten, this means you don&rsquo;t respect the host. You don&rsquo;t have the proper fear that you might offend the host.</p>
<p>I can surely testify that unless I am quite sick or unless I am very much occupied by something I cannot avoid, I don&rsquo;t have the peace to stay home when the church is meeting. If the meeting is going on and I am staying home I don&rsquo;t have the peace. I get condemned, and my conscience doesn&rsquo;t allow me. A hole is made in my conscience, and I have to get it clear. This is why we have to learn to fear God by coming to the meetings regularly, by functioning, and by being on time. We must have a proper fear toward our God. We are not playing. We are not in some kind of religion serving idols. If you are serving idols it doesn&rsquo;t matter whether you come late or not. If the government of a country is just a mess it might not make much difference whether you pay tax or not; perhaps nobody would bother you. But I wouldn&rsquo;t like to live in a country like that. But this country is good. It has order in everything. It has all the governmental ordinances. To be good citizens we have to have a proper fear of the government. We must have the same attitude toward God concerning the meetings.</p><h2 class="head1">EATING AND REJOICING</h2>
<p>Now let us go on to Deuteronomy 26:9-11. Verse 9 says, &ldquo;And He hath brought us...&rdquo; This is a word spoken by the children of Israel, yet they were charged by God to speak this. God had charged that all of Israel had to say this. Verse 10 says, &ldquo;And thou shalt set it before the Lord thy God, and worship before the Lord thy God.&rdquo; In this verse eating is first, and worship is second. Without eating, the worship is not proper. Verse 11 reads, &ldquo;And thou shalt rejoice in every good thing which the Lord thy God hath given unto thee, and unto thine house, thou, and the Levite, and the stranger that is among you.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIRSTFRUITS FOR THE PRIESTS</h2>
<p>Now we need to read Numbers 18:12 and 13: &ldquo;All the best of the oil, and all the best of the wine, and of the wheat, the firstfruits of them which they shall offer unto the Lord, them have I given thee. And whatsoever is first ripe in the land, which they shall bring unto the Lord, shall be thine; every one that is clean in thine house shall eat of it.&rdquo; Firstfruits here is in apposition with the oil, the wine, and the wheat. The firstfruits are the best of the wheat, the olive tree, and the vine tree. The phrase &ldquo;shall be thine&rdquo; means they shall be the priests&rsquo;.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LABORING, LIVING, AND OFFERING</h2>
<p>After reading all these verses I would like to give you a picture of the groceries. First of all you have to see that what they offered to God was what they had labored on. Firstly, they labored on it. It is also what they lived by. They labored on these things, and they lived by these things. God had given them a good land, and God had given them the seed. So they had to labor on the good land with the seed which God had given them. They labored on it, and then they reaped the produce, and then they lived by the produce. Out of this produce they had to put aside a portion, the top portion, for God. When the meeting time came, that means the time of the feast, they brought all the top tenths which had been put aside for God to the meeting place to offer to God. So what they offered was what they had labored on and what they had lived by. Let me add a very meaningful word. According to the Bible the children of Israel didn&rsquo;t have any other industry. They had only one industry, that is, farming. They were working on the God-given good land to produce something that they could live by. Out of that something they could offer to God the top tenth for God&rsquo;s satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAND, THE SEED, AND THE PRODUCE</h2>
<p>What they produced from laboring on the good land was of two kingdoms: the vegetable kingdom and the animal kingdom. In the vegetable kingdom there were mainly three things: wheat to produce the flour, olive trees to produce the olive oil, and grapevines to produce the wine. The second kingdom was the animal kingdom that produces oxen and sheep (Deut. 14:22-23). All these things are very, very meaningful. The good land is Christ. God has given Him to us as the good land. The seed is also Christ. Both the land and the seed are Christ. Now God charges us to labor on Christ with Christ. Daily we have to labor on Christ with Christ. Then we will have the produce. Every day we will have the produce. We live by this produce which is also Christ. The land is Christ, the seed is Christ, and the produce is Christ. The land is Christ not yet labored on; the seed is Christ not yet sown into the land; the produce is Christ labored on, sown, and reaped. Once there is the reaping we need to eat for our living. We live by the very Christ whom we labor on and whom we have sown into the good land and who now becomes our produce.</p>
<p>Then we bring the top portion, the top tenth, of this Christ whom we have labored on, whom we have sown, whom we have reaped, and whom we have enjoyed to the meeting to present Him to God as food and to have a feast for all the saints to eat together with God.</p>
<p>Let us consider again the categories of groceries. In the animal kingdom you have the oxen and the sheep. In the vegetable kingdom you have the wheat, the oil, and the wine. You have to realize that the animal life is the main item of the groceries. Even today if you invite people to a meal and you serve them only vegetables, they would not appreciate it. Before the fall God ordained man to eat vegetables, but after the fall beginning with Genesis 9, God ordained that the fallen mankind had to eat animals with the shedding of blood, because the fallen people now needed redemption. If you don&rsquo;t have redemption you cannot enjoy anything before God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PEACE AND LIFE SUPPLY</h2>
<p>So Christ is firstly our groceries in the animal kingdom with the shedding of blood to take care of our problems before God so that we may have the peace to feast with God. In any kind of feast if there is no peace, there is no happy eating. The happy eating must be in a peaceful situation. Then He is also the groceries in the vegetable kingdom. We can see both of these in the Gospel of John. In chapter one there is the Lamb of God (v. 29). This is an item of groceries in the animal kingdom. But in chapter six the Lord Jesus said He was the bread (vv. 35, 48, 51), and in chapter twelve He was the grain of wheat (v. 24). Furthermore, in chapter fifteen He is the vine tree to produce the wine (vv. 1, 5). So in one Gospel there are the groceries in both kingdoms. There is the lamb in the animal kingdom, and there are the wheat and vine tree in the vegetable kingdom. Wheat indicates life and life supply. All the bread and all the cakes and wafers are made of wheat flour. The meal offering is composed mainly with wheat flour. That is for life and life supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ANOINTING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The oil is produced by the olive tree, and this indicates a kind of life by the anointing Spirit. There is not only life and life supply, but also the Spirit for your living. You have to live for God by Christ as your life supply. The power and the means for you to live such a life is the oil, the anointing Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DYING FOR GOD</h2>
<p>The wine which comes out of the grapevine signifies the matter of dying for God. We are destined not only to live, but also to die. This means we have to pour out the very life we live. Every day we enjoy Christ as the life supply, and we live by the anointing oil, and we die by pouring out our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FRANKINCENSE</h2>
<p>Another item of the groceries is frankincense. Frankincense signifies life in resurrection. So Christ as the wheat is our life supply, and the oil is the anointing Spirit for us to live. Every day we have to pour out our life to God as the wine. Then we will have the flavor, the fragrance, of the resurrection life as the frankincense. These are the groceries with which we cook our divine feast. We have Christ as the wheat, with the anointing Spirit as the oil, and with the poured-out life as the wine. We have the life in resurrection as the frankincense. For us to live such a life is altogether based upon Christ being our oxen and being our lamb. He redeemed us, and He became our food. These are the groceries for us to cook the divine feast with all the courses.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW TO HAVE CHRIST INCREASED<br />
FOR OUR SIN OFFERING<br />
AND TRESPASS OFFERING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Deut. 12:6-7; Lev. 4:13-14, 27-28; John 1:29; Rom. 8:3; 2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Cor. 15:3; 1 Pet. 2:24; 3:18; Heb. 9:26b, 28</h1>
<p>In this message we need to consider how to have Christ increased that we may offer Him in the meeting as so many different offerings. According to Leviticus chapters one, two, and six the first offering among the five basic offerings is the burnt offering. Then comes the meal offering and the peace offering. The last two are the sin offering and the trespass offering. So the sequence in these chapters is firstly the burnt offering, and then lastly the two offerings for sin and the trespass. This is the sequence of the record of all the offerings. But in our experience the burnt offering does not come first. In our experience the first offering is the trespass offering. Following the trespass offering is the sin offering. Then in our experience we have the peace offering. After this we enjoy Christ as our food, as the meal offering. Then we experience the burnt offering. In this message we have to follow the sequence not in the holy record but in our experience. In our experience we enjoy Christ firstly as the trespass offering.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROCERIES WITH WHICH TO PREPARE<br />
THE OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>Deuteronomy 12:6 gives us what we call the groceries with which we prepare the offerings for God. It says that you have to bring your burnt offerings and sacrifices, your tithes, and the firstlings of your herds and of your flocks. The tithe here indicates the ten percent of all the produce of the things from the field, including the wheat, the oil, and the wine. Verse 6 does not give us the details; it just gives us the title, the tithes. More details are in Deuteronomy 14:22-23. In those verses we are told that the children of Israel had to tithe all the produce of their seed. That means all the produce of the wheat and the oil and the wine. So those verses give us the details of the tithes of the vegetables.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OFFERINGS FROM THE ANIMAL KINGDOM</h2>
<p>In Deuteronomy 12:6 there is a clear word concerning the groceries from the animal kingdom&mdash;the herds and the flocks. We have to realize that the tithes of the vegetables are not good for burnt offerings or for sin offerings or for trespass offerings. They are only good for the meal offering, for the drink offering, and for a small part of the peace offering. The main part of the peace offering is still of the animal kingdom. In all the offerings the main groceries come from the animal kingdom. The main dishes of the divine feast are cooked with the groceries from the animal kingdom. Then from the vegetable kingdom, the groceries are good for the meal offering, for the last part of the peace offering, and for the drink offering.</p>
<p>For us today Christ is firstly the life of the animal kingdom. This is why John 1:29 speaks of the Lamb of God. This is the life of the animal kingdom. He is the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world. The groceries from the animal kingdom are more basic than the groceries from the vegetable kingdom. This is why in sequence we cover firstly the animal kingdom and then the vegetable kingdom. We want to cover how to have Christ increased in the kingdom of the animal life. According to our experience this is good firstly for the trespass offering and then for the sin offering. It is also good for the first part, the leading part, of the peace offering. After we finish this, we will go on from the animal kingdom to the vegetable kingdom, to see how Christ is also the vegetable life, good for the last part of the peace offering. He is also good for the entire part of the meal offering and the entire part of the wine offering for God&rsquo;s satisfaction and our satisfaction too. This is to feed God and to feed ourselves.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS OUR SIN OFFERING</h2>
<p>According to our experience Christ is firstly our trespass offering and then our sin offering. Even for the real practice of the offerings such as the sanctification of the priests, they firstly had to offer the sin offering. Then they offered the burnt offering. With some of the sin offerings there was nothing to eat for the priest or for the people who offered the offerings. It was altogether burnt with two kinds of burnings. The first burning was the burning on the altar of the fat and the inward parts of the offering for God&rsquo;s satisfaction to meet God&rsquo;s requirements. Then the body of the offering was burned, not on the altar, but outside the camp. The burning outside the camp was not a burning to send a sweet odor up to God but a burning of judgment, a burning of abandonment. So mainly what we can enjoy in the trespass offering and the sin offering is just to see the blood. The blood of Christ is shed for us. When we see the blood we have peace. When we see the blood we are released from the condemnation. That is mainly what we can enjoy. That is not for our eating. That is just for a kind of settlement of our problem.</p>
<p>This is somewhat like the way we begin our day. When we rise up in the morning we begin our day by washing. It is so good to begin every day with a shower to get yourself fully washed from head to toe. We also need such a thing in our spiritual life. We have to begin our spiritual life with a shower. How do you take a spiritual shower? By applying the sin offering. Every morning you offer Christ to God as your sin offering. That is like taking a spiritual shower. Don&rsquo;t think that you are not dirty, that you are quite clean. As long as you are living you need a sin offering to wash your being!</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />
THE SIN AND TRESPASS OFFERING</h2>
<p>The trespass offering may be likened to washing your hands during the day. You take a shower once in the morning, but you may wash your hands many times during the day as they become dirty. During the day whenever you realize that your hands are dirty you need to wash them again. This is like applying Christ as the trespass offering.</p>
<p>We have to spend some time to see the difference between the trespass offering and the sin offering. In Leviticus 4 there is the sin offering, and then in Leviticus 6 and 7 there is the trespass offering. It is hard to differentiate between what is sin and what are sins or what is sin and what is a trespass.</p>
<p>The Bible illustrates these two in a way which helps us to understand. The Bible illustrates sin as something of ignorance and as something not seen, something hidden (Lev. 4:2, 13, 22, 27; 5:15). Leviticus illustrates a trespass as something quite different. It speaks of deceiving your neighbor or wronging your neighbor or damaging someone (Lev. 6:1-4). That is a trespass. That is not of ignorance, and that is not something hidden from the eyes. That is very apparent and very visible. This is the way that the Bible illustrates the difference between sin and trespasses.</p>
<p>Sin is a hidden invisible problem not seen by people, which you may often do in ignorance. This illustrates sin in our nature. It is hidden from the eyes. Suppose I am a gentleman all day long, doing nothing wrong to anyone. Even my wife couldn&rsquo;t find any fault in me. This may mean I have no trespasses, but this does not mean I am not sinful. I may be perfect in behavior, in my outward doing, but it does not mean that I am not sinful in my inward nature.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING NATURALLY BY OUR SINFUL NATURE</h2>
<p>We need to see the light. We are not only sinful in our nature, but also our entire nature is sin. Just like a table may be made of wood, our nature is made of sin. Although I may not commit any trespass all the day long, for the whole day I have been sin. All day long I may have been living just naturally. I didn&rsquo;t exercise my spirit, I didn&rsquo;t contact the Lord, I didn&rsquo;t live Christ, I didn&rsquo;t walk and have my being in the spirit. I just lived myself. I sat down without Christ. I took a walk without Christ. I ate without Christ. I didn&rsquo;t offend any others, but it was without Christ. This is something hidden from the eyes. The sinful nature is there, but hidden from the eyes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF ENLIGHTENMENT</h2>
<p>If I am in spiritual darkness, I might be ignorant of this sinful nature. Because I was humble, honest, faithful, gentle, so much in order, and caring for others I might consider that I am a wonderful and excellent person. But this would be in ignorance. Once the light came I would realize that this is not Christ. This is myself. This is the produce of Adam, a sinner. I was living Adam; I was living a sinner. Then the invisible sin would become visible in enlightened eyes, and I would offer Christ as my sin offering. The sin offering is for this. I am concerned that even up to now some may still remain in that ignorance, thinking that they are okay, that they are so excellent, so perfect, so nice, so humble, so gentle. This is ignorance.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A REMINDER THAT WE ARE SINNERS</h2>
<p>But I believe at least a number have been enlightened through these years so that you are not ignorant of what you are. Every day you have some realization that you yourself by nature are nothing but the totality of sin. Outwardly you may be okay. Outwardly you may be excellent. But inwardly you are not excellent. Inwardly you are sin. Inwardly you are not only sinful, but sin itself. So every day when you begin a new day, the first thing you must do is offer Christ as a sin offering. Every day we should offer Christ as our sin offering. This kind of offering always cleanses us and reminds us that we are sinners. As you begin a new day you have to remember that you are a sinner. The first person you may see in the new day is your wife. If you realize clearly that you are a sinner, how could you exchange words with her? That sin offering which you offered early in the morning would remind you that you are a sinner. Because you offered Christ as your sin offering early in the morning you would be reminded that you are a sinner. You are not still under ignorance, because you fully realize that you are sin and that every day you need Christ to redeem you.</p><h2 class="head1">REDEMPTION IN OUR DAILY EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>According to the fact we know that Christ redeemed us 1900 years ago. Some teachers have stressed this very much. But we need to stress the experiential redemption as well as the factual redemption. We need the redemption in our daily experience. Every morning when we begin our day the first thing we need to do is to offer Christ as our sin offering. Don&rsquo;t think this is too repetitious. You have to realize that life is altogether the totality of repetition. I have been eating breakfast 365 days a year for seventy-seven years. But I shouldn&rsquo;t say that I am disgusted and bored with breakfast, so I won&rsquo;t eat it anymore. Life is the totality of repetition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OFFERING CHRIST AS THE SIN OFFERING<br />
EVERY MORNING</h2>
<p>Every day you have to repeat the offering of Christ for your sin. If you don&rsquo;t have a good breakfast in the morning you cannot have a good day. In like manner, in the morning you must have a proper offering of Christ as your sin offering. You need to offer Christ as a big bull for your sin offering. The way to have good health is to have a good breakfast. The way to be healthy spiritually is to begin by offering Christ as your sin offering. Don&rsquo;t say that you have no heart to offer Christ as a sin offering and that your spirit is dormant. This is your laziness. Some who do not eat a proper breakfast say they have no appetite. They have no appetite because they don&rsquo;t eat. The more you eat the more you have an appetite. Eating gives you an appetite and even enlarges the capacity of your appetite. Don&rsquo;t excuse yourself. It is your duty to take a good breakfast, and it is your duty to keep yourself healthy spiritually by offering Christ as a sin offering early in the morning to begin your day. Don&rsquo;t say that you don&rsquo;t have a heart and you don&rsquo;t have the spirit. This is your obligation. Try to do this and you will see that you will be healthy.</p>
<p>I hope to hear many prayers such as this: &ldquo;Lord, thank You that You have helped me to begin my day by offering You as a sin offering. Lord, thank You that You are such an offering to me for this day.&rdquo; But mostly when you pray, you pray in the ordinary, regular, and religious way. You don&rsquo;t have any prayer offered to the Lord according to the riches of the typology in His holy Word. The prayers you have offered are too common, too religious, and too natural. There is no revelation. There are no riches inherited from the rich word of God&rsquo;s Scripture. I hope that after reading these messages your prayer would be changed and transformed. Don&rsquo;t offer those old-fashioned prayers. Rather, offer something according to the rich typology of the Word, offering Christ as all the offerings to God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS OUR TRESPASS OFFERING</h2>
<p>Now let us talk about the trespass offering. Suppose you began your day by offering Christ as your sin offering. But when you came to the breakfast table it was just a mess and breakfast was not ready. Right away the flame rose up within you. You were offended with your wife. Eventually you said something to let her know that you were not so happy. But once you got into the car and were driving on the highway you were condemned. You asked the Lord to forgive you because you were in your flesh! &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. Thank You, Lord, You are not only my sin offering but also my trespass offering.&rdquo; This means you offered the Lord Jesus as a trespass offering. We need Him to be our trespass offering many times a day.</p>
<p>At work you have many opportunities to be offended by your colleagues. This is another chance for you to trespass. But by confessing to the Lord you enjoy Him as your trespass offering. While you are driving home another driver may offend you, and you may blow the horn at him. Then right away you would realize that you have trespassed again. You would offer Christ once more as your trespass offering. &ldquo;Thank You, Lord, You are my unlimited trespass offering.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO HAVE CHRIST INCREASED IN YOU</h2>
<p>This is the way to have Christ increased in you for the sin offering and for the trespass offering. If you live a life every day in such a practice, you will be so rich with Christ as your sin offering and your trespass offering. Then you will come to the meeting with such a Christ. In your prayer this will be expressed. In your testimony this will be expressed. In your sharing something will come out. Especially at the Lord&rsquo;s table you will appreciate and see the Lord as your sin offering and as your trespass offering. At the table meeting you will enjoy the Lord as a big bullock, so adequate for your sin and for your trespass offering. You will thank the Lord that He has taken care of your sinful nature, of your sinful self. He has also taken care of your transgressions, your trespasses, your wrongdoings. You will realize that you have no merit and no goodness to justify you and to cause you to be accepted by God, but Christ is your sin offering and your trespass offering. If this is your case, your prayer at the Lord&rsquo;s table will not be according to the traditional way. Because we are void of the experience of Christ we have the kind of heart to come to the meeting again and again with empty hands. Either you don&rsquo;t open up your mouth or you open up your mouth and just speak a word that is so ordinary and so much under the influence of tradition.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING WHAT IS REVEALED IN THE TYPES</h2>
<p>I hope that you will see this is the way to have Christ increased in you. Rather, I would say this is the way for you to raise Christ, just like a rancher raises cattle. If you don&rsquo;t have this kind of practice experientially, when you come to the meeting you don&rsquo;t have Christ. This is not according to the side of doctrine but according to the side of experience. In Deuteronomy and Exodus in the typologies there are not only the doctrinal things but also the experiential things. Even many of the seeking Christians have no interest to get into these things. The riches in the typology have been buried in these books for years. We have to see that these are the real contents of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and this is the reality of the contents of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery.</p>
<p>How marvelous if we could come together and sit around the Lord&rsquo;s table offering prayers and praises in this way without any of the traditional Christianity heritage. This would cause our meetings to be absolutely different from the Christian meetings of today. We have to practice what is revealed in the types in the holy Word. This will impress people. At the beginning they may be offended, but eventually they will be convinced. This will satisfy the real seekers, the real hungry ones. Let us go on to learn something and to enter into a new field and to practice what the Lord has been showing us in these days.</p>
<p>I hope that this word could help us to see how we can raise Christ to be the groceries for us to cook a course for God as either the sin offering or the trespass offering. I hope also that we could have a clear view of the difference between sin and sins, that is, between the sin offering and the trespass offering in a practical and experiential way. You have to put all these matters into your daily practice.</p>
<p>Some of the verses in the Scripture references show that Christ deals with sin as the sin offering. John 1:29 says that the Lamb of God takes away the sin of the world. Romans 8:3 says that God sent His Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, or for sin. Sin here, according to Darby&rsquo;s note, has the thought of the sin offering. Then 2 Corinthians 5:21 says that Christ was made sin, not sins, for us that we may become the righteousness of God in Him. These verses show that Christ is our sin offering.</p>
<p>Other verses listed show that Christ is our trespass offering. First Corinthians 15:3 says that Christ died for our sins, not sin. Then Peter says that Christ bore our sins on the tree (1 Pet. 2:24). He also says that Christ died for our sins (1 Pet. 3:18). These verses show how Christ deals with sins, trespasses, and transgressions as our trespass offering.</p>
<p>Hebrews 9:26 says that Christ was manifested to put away sin. This means as the sin offering. Verse 28 says that Christ made the sacrifice for sins. This is the trespass offering. So four of the verses refer to Christ as the sin offering, and four of the verses refer to Christ as the trespass offering. When you read the singular word sin you must realize that Christ is our sin offering. When you read the plural word sins you must realize that Christ is our trespass offering.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW TO ENJOY CHRIST AS OUR SIN OFFERING<br />
AND TRESPASS OFFERING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Lev. 5:1-19; 6:24-30; 7:1-7</h1>
<h2 class="head1">PUZZLES CONCERNING THE OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>These verses in Leviticus 5, 6, and 7 are not easy to understand. The more you read them, the more puzzled you would be. For example, have you ever imagined or heard that the fine flour made of wheat could be a trespass offering? Even the trespass offering eventually becomes a sin offering. So what is the difference between the sin offering and the trespass offering if the trespass offering can eventually become the sin offering? Also, how could a tenth of an ephah of fine flour be a sin offering? This seems to contradict Hebrews 9:22 which says that without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness. How could the fine flour which has no blood to shed be a trespass offering and eventually a sin offering?</p>
<p>Leviticus 5:7 presents another puzzle: &ldquo;And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass offering for that wherein he hath sinned; two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the Lord, one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering&rdquo; (lit.). This offering is for a trespass, so it should be a trespass offering. How could it be that of the two pieces of the trespass offering, one becomes a sin offering and the other becomes a burnt offering? Have you noticed also that with every kind of trespass offering, there is the mentioning that it is the sin offering?</p>
<p>There are at least four or five kinds of trespass offerings mentioned in these chapters. The first kind is a lamb, which is bigger than a turtledove or a pigeon. The second kind is two birds, either two turtledoves or two pigeons. The third kind is the tenth of an ephah of fine flour. These three kinds of trespass offerings are for the trespass in ordinary, common things. Then from verse 14 you have the trespass offering for the trespass in the holy things such as sacrifices offered to God. For example, if you did something wrong in offering your tithe to God, then you have to offer a ram for your trespass offering. If you trespass in the things belonging to God, the holy things, you have to offer a ram. A ram is bigger than a lamb. There is no choice. The biggest trespass offering is a ram. The second biggest is the lamb. The third biggest is two pigeons or two turtledoves. The fourth is just one tenth of an ephah of fine flour.</p>
<p>What about these three puzzles? How could the vegetable life without blood be used for a trespass offering which eventually becomes the sin offering? Number two, how could the trespass offering eventually become the sin offering? The four kinds of trespass offerings mentioned here are eventually called sin offerings. Sin offerings are mentioned more times in this chapter than the trespass offerings. Number three, how could a part of the trespass offering become a burnt offering? Of the two pigeons or the two turtledoves for the trespass offering, one becomes the sin offering and the other becomes the burnt offering. How could this be? Another problem: this is concerning the trespass offering. All the trespass offerings are edible; they are good for the priests to eat. But the sin offering is different.</p>
<p>According to chapter four there is the sin offering for different people. Firstly, there is the sin offering for the priests, and secondly, there is the sin offering for the congregation of the people, for the nation. Thirdly, there is the sin offering for the ruler of the people, and fourthly, the sin offering for the common people.</p>
<p>The blood of the sin offering for the priests and for the congregation was brought into the holy place to be sprinkled before the veil seven times before God. Some of this blood was put upon the horns, or corners, of the altar of sweet incense. Then the rest of the blood was poured out at the bottom of the altar of the burnt offering. But the sin offering for the ruler and the sin offering for the common people were different. The blood of these offerings was not brought into the holy place. This blood was sprinkled only on the horns, or corners, of the altar of burnt offering, and the rest was poured out at the bottom of the altar. This kind of sin offering was good for the priests to eat.</p>
<p>In the preceding message we pointed out that the sin offering is mainly for God&rsquo;s satisfaction and that your enjoyment of the sin offering is just the sprinkled blood at the altar. When you see the blood, you have the peace. But actually you can have more enjoyment because a part of some of the sin offerings are good for the priests to eat, and all of the trespass offerings are good for the priests to eat. By checking with my experiences I realized that in our daily life when we enjoy Christ as our sin offering we enjoy more than just the satisfaction through His blood. We enjoy much more than that.</p>
<p>When we offer Christ to God as our sin offering and as our trespass offering, in our experience we surely realize such a Christ is good for eating. He is really good for eating! Also, at that time there are a lot of other senses and a lot of other realizations within you concerning Christ. Every day I am practicing what I fellowship with you. I offer Christ as my sin offering to begin my day and all the time during the day I offer Christ as my trespass offering. Oh! Spontaneously I have the deep sense that Christ is in me! The very Christ whom I offered to God as my sin offering and as my trespass offering is in me. He is in me supplying me and strengthening me. He is in me sustaining and supporting. Also there is a kind of satisfying sense within me. There is a sweet sense, a sweet feeling, within me. There is a comforting sense within me.</p>
<p>When we offer Christ as the sin offering every day and when we offer the trespass offering during the day, we surely have the sense that His blood solves all our problems. We have the full peace. But this is not all! We also have something of the offerings to eat and enjoy. We don&rsquo;t just enjoy an objective blood that has been shed and poured out. But we enjoy something subjective to fill us up. Every day we can be satisfied.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TRESPASS OFFERING<br />
BECOMING THE BURNT OFFERING</h2>
<p>Now we need to come back to solve some of the problems related to the trespass and sin offerings. First of all we need to see how one of the two birds of the trespass offering could become a burnt offering and how the second could become a sin offering. If you just read these verses according to the letter you cannot understand them. You have to go to the experience. Your experience will render a lot of help to you in understanding these verses.</p>
<p>Have you noticed that with the lamb for the trespass offering there is no mention of the burnt offering? It is only with the two pigeons or the two turtledoves that there is the mentioning of the burnt offering. When you offer Christ as a lamb for your trespass offering, that is the regular size. A lamb is the regular size for the trespass offering. For example, a regular size letterhead is eight and one-half by eleven inches. If it is shorter or narrower, it is not the regular size. The regular size for a trespass offering is a lamb, but too many times we are not able to offer a lamb. Then what shall we do? Then we offer two pigeons or two turtledoves. In other words, we should use a regular size letterhead, but we are poor. We don&rsquo;t have the regular size. So instead we use smaller pieces of paper.</p>
<p>Because we are not able to offer a lamb, we offer two pigeons. At that time because of your disenablement you feel that the Lord Jesus is so sweet. Though you are so poor and unable to offer a lamb, yet you can still be accepted by offering two pigeons. This gives you a sweet sense, a sweet feeling. When you begin to have such a sweet feeling, you feel you should be absolute for the Lord. Right away at least half of what you have offered to the Lord as the trespass offering becomes a burnt offering.</p>
<p>The significance of the burnt offering is being absolute to the Lord. The burnt offering is just for the Lord. It is just to satisfy God. It is not to make propitiation for your sin or for your trespass, but to satisfy Him. Let me repeat: when you offer Christ as your trespass offering under the regular size with two small pigeons, you feel so grateful to the Lord that even though you are so poor and unable to do what you should do regularly, you still are accepted. You have the sense of gratitude. You feel that the Lord is so sweet to you. At this juncture you have a deep sense that you should be absolute for the Lord. This means that while you are enjoying the very Christ whom you offered for your trespass offering, you also enjoy this One at least fifty percent as a burnt offering.</p>
<p>Many times when I offered Christ as my trespass offering under the regular size I was so grateful to Him that I could be accepted that spontaneously I had the sweet sense that I should be absolute for Him. But at the same time I realized that I could not make it to be absolute to the Lord. But thank Him, He can! He was absolute to God for me. So spontaneously I prayed: &ldquo;Lord, thank You! You are not only my trespass offering, You are also my burnt offering.&rdquo; This is the kind of burnt offering that comes from one half of your trespass offering which is under the regular size.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRESPASS OFFERING<br />
BECOMING THE SIN OFFERING</h2>
<p>How then could the trespass offering become the sin offering? I believe this is easy to figure out even logically. All the trespasses are the fruit of the tree. The tree is sin and every piece of the fruit which comes from the tree is sin. The tree is the father, and all the fruits are the children of the father. Trespasses are children of sin. Not only is sin sin, but all the trespasses are also sin. So the trespass offering could become the sin offering because the trespass comes from the sin. Sin is the father and the trespass is the child. From where does your gossiping come? It comes from sin. From where does your lying come? From sin. From where does your temper come? From sin. In other words, from where do all your activities of trespasses come? From one father&mdash;sin. A trespass is sin. So the trespass offering for the trespass is also the sin offering for the sin.</p>
<p>Then you might wonder why the Bible needs to have a difference, to use two expressions: sin offering and trespass offering. There is a difference. All the fruit may be peaches, but the tree is only one. The peach tree is the sin, and the peach fruits are the trespasses. The Bible is more than logical. The only thing is that we are short of experience.</p>
<p>According to your experience, when you offered Christ as your trespass offering, didn&rsquo;t you realize that that trespass came out of your sinful nature? Actually, that trespass does not belong to another category. It belongs to the same category as sin. So you realize that your trespass offering is not merely a trespass offering. Your trespass offering actually is a sin offering.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t excuse yourself by saying that you have a little weakness. Don&rsquo;t excuse the loss of your temper to your wife as a little weakness. Don&rsquo;t excuse your gossiping as a little weakness. You have to realize that all these things come from your sinful nature. If you don&rsquo;t realize this in such a thorough way it indicates that your offering of Christ as the trespass offering is not absolute. If your offering of Christ as the trespass offering is thorough, you will realize that even a little negative speaking concerning a brother comes from your sinful nature. That is sin. So whatever you offered is not merely a trespass offering; it is also a sin offering.</p>
<p>As husbands we have a lot of experiences with the wife. If you were to ask my dear wife she couldn&rsquo;t say that I lose my temper very often. Even within a year, I may not lose my temper once. But too many times I had a lot of feelings. Too many times a lot of thoughts have gone through me. I was not so happy with her. For example sometimes I like to change my food a little bit, but nearly every morning I get the same kind and the same quantity of food for breakfast. Although I have never said anything to her, many times when I came to the breakfast table there were some feelings within me. Too many times, I am sorry to say, I didn&rsquo;t offer Christ for this trespass. I took the excuse that it was such a small thing. Actually, when I would offer Christ as the trespass offering for this kind of weakness, I would begin to realize that is sin. I would begin to realize that this comes from the sinful nature within me. Now you can understand why the trespass offering also is a sin offering.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SMALLEST OF THE TRESPASS OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>Now we come to the weakest and the smallest of the trespass offerings, the one tenth of an ephah of fine flour (Lev. 5:11-13). With this smallest and weakest of the trespass offerings, the sin offering is mentioned twice. The smaller your trespass offering is, the more you should realize your sinful nature. Never take any excuse. Sometimes you might just be standing and looking out the window. A lot of thoughts come in: you don&rsquo;t like your room. It is a little bit too small. It doesn&rsquo;t have such a good bathroom. The bed is too soft. You are not talking but just thinking. Suddenly the question comes: What are you doing here? Committing trespasses!</p>
<p>I don&rsquo;t believe many of us have ever practiced confessing these kinds of things. We excuse them, saying these are small things. This is just natural for someone to think about. We just forget about them. This means we excuse all these things. Don&rsquo;t excuse yourself. You have to condemn them. You have to see they are from your nature, from the inward sin. They are abominable to you. They are against the divine nature within you and frustrate your living Christ. So you need to offer Christ as your trespass offering and also as your sin offering. The trespass offering eventually becomes your sin offering, not just for your outward doing but also for the root, for the source, for the nature. Why wouldn&rsquo;t you stand before the window and let thoughts concerning Christ&rsquo;s loveliness, His greatness, His beauty go through your mind? It is because you are so natural. What does it mean to be natural? It is to be sinful. If you are natural you are sinful. To say you are natural may not sound like such a bad term. Actually it means you are sinful.</p>
<p>In the next message we need to take care of the most puzzling point: how the vegetable life without any blood to shed for sin could be our trespass offering and eventually our sin offering.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW TO ENJOY CHRIST AS OUR SIN OFFERING<br />
AND TRESPASS OFFERING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Lev. 5:11-13; 6:30; 7:1-7</h1>
<h2 class="head1">FINE FLOUR OFFERED AS A SIN OFFERING</h2>
<p>In this message we come to a big, big problem that seems to be against the scriptural principle. Hebrews 9:22 says that without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sins. But according to Leviticus 5:11-13 the tenth part of an ephah of fine flour, which, of course, has no blood, could be offered for a sin offering. How could any blood be shed from the grains of wheat, especially out of flour made from wheat? It is impossible! Blood has to come out of an animal, not out of any vegetable. In poetry people sometimes like to say that a grapevine sheds its blood to produce wine for us. But still that is wine, not blood. Blood cannot come out of a vegetable. How then could the fine flour of wheat be used as a trespass offering and even for a sin offering?</p>
<p>Some teachers have said that Leviticus 5:1-13 is still on the sin offering as a continuation of chapter four. But nearly all the leading versions of the Bible translate the Hebrew word in 5:6 into trespass offering. Leviticus 5:7 should also read the same, but the King James Version did not render it so accurately. The best translation of Leviticus 5:7 reads: &ldquo;And if he be not able to bring a lamb, then he shall bring his trespass offering for that wherein he hath sinned; two turtledoves, or two young pigeons, unto the Lord, one for a sin offering, and the other for a burnt offering.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Other teachers have said that the Hebrew word for trespass or trespass offering is a derivation from the Hebrew word that means be guilty. You may translate this Hebrew word into guilt, and you may translate the same Hebrew word into guilt offering, which means the trespass offering.</p>
<p>Most translators translate this word for trespass offering into one of three words: trespass offering, transgression offering, or guilt offering. In chapters four and five of Leviticus the verb form, be guilty, is used many times (4:13, 22, 27; 5:2, 4, 5, 17). The noun form of guilty can be translated into a guilt offering, meaning a trespass offering.</p>
<p>But in verse 6, to translate the word into guilt is meaningless. To say he shall bring his guilt unto the Lord for his sin is not meaningful. So according to the context of the verse you have to translate it into a kind of offering, whether you call it a trespass offering, a transgression offering, or a guilt offering. It is a kind of offering, not just a kind of guilt, or a kind of trespass, or a kind of transgression. The sentence governs the meaning of the word. The same word in any language may be used differently according to the context of the sentence. You must make a decision based upon the context. No one can explain away the trespass offering in 5:6. This is a strong proof that 5:1-13 is not a continuation of the sin offering. It is a new section, a section on the trespass offering.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A REFLECTION OF OUR EXPERIENCES</h2>
<p>All these points indicate that there are many complications related to these chapters. Not only in the writing of the Bible are there complications, but also even in our experiences we have many complications. Why are there complications in the writing of the Bible? It is because the writing of the Bible is a kind of reflection of our experiences. For example, a certain machine is made in a particular way, so it has a book of particular instructions. If you only look at the instructions apart from the machine, you may think that the writer was not so clear and that his instruction has a lot of complications. But it is because the machine itself was made with so many complications. How could the instructions have no complications? If the instructions had no complications, that would not match the machine. The instructions are written according to the make-up of the machine. You have to realize that Leviticus 4, 5, and 6 were written according to your make-up and your experiences.</p>
<p>In this chapter there is also a bigger and even more basic complication, that is, the word guilt. Many times the word guilt is used instead of sin and instead of transgression or trespass. Two kinds of offerings are mentioned and yet both are dealing with the matter of guilt.</p>
<p>Of course, sin is a guilt and transgressions are also guilt. We illustrated previously using a peach tree and peaches. Both are peach. You cannot say that the peaches are peach but that the tree is not peach.</p>
<p>Apparently this is a complication. Actually it is not a complication. It is a distinct writing. The tree is the tree, and the peaches are the peaches. Although all are peach, still there is a difference. In like manner sin is a guilt, and all the trespasses are guilt. Both are guilt, yet there is a difference. Sin as a guilt is something in our nature. Trespasses or transgressions are guilt, yet they are not in our nature. They are in our conduct and behavior. Yet they all come out of the very sin that is in our nature. The many guilts come out of that one guilt which is in our nature. In our daily character and daily behavior there are a lot of guilts. All these guilts have come out of that unique guilt which is in our nature.</p>
<p>Adam committed sin, and now we have committed sin. What is the difference? The difference is this: with Adam the committing of sin was unique, but with us the committing of sin is not unique. Adam&rsquo;s committing of sin was a father to produce so many other committings of sin in us.</p><h2 class="head1">BASED UPON OUR EXPERIENCES</h2>
<p>In the last message we saw that part of the trespass offering could become a burnt offering and the other part of the trespass offering could become a sin offering. You have to realize that these few chapters on the offerings are not written based only upon God&rsquo;s requirement. Rather they are written also based upon our experiences. How can we know this? It is because one clause is repeated several times: &ldquo;If he be not able.&rdquo; Firstly God requires you to offer a bullock, but you are not able. Then God requires you to offer a ram. Still you are unable. Then God requires you to offer a kid of the goats, something smaller. But still you are not able. Nor are you able to offer a lamb. Perhaps you are not able even to offer anything from the herds or from the flock. Then God would ask you to offer just two little birds, either turtledoves or pigeons. But you cannot offer even these two things. Because you are unable to offer the least in the animal kingdom, God would allow you to offer just a tenth of an ephah of fine flour from the vegetable kingdom. So you can see that this portion is written according to the Lord&rsquo;s requirements and also based upon our experiences.</p>
<p>According to the Lord&rsquo;s requirements for any kind of propitiation or any kind of forgiveness, whether it is the unique sin in our nature or many sins in our conduct, there is the need of the blood to redeem you. Without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sin. This is the Lord&rsquo;s requirement. But so many of us could not afford to offer a bullock or a ram or a lamb or even two little birds for the shedding of the blood. All we are able to offer is just a little flour of the vegetable kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIFFERENCES IN APPRECIATION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>These few chapters also show us that we as God&rsquo;s redeemed people all have different sizes of our appreciation of the Lord Jesus. With the Lord Jesus Himself there is no difference in size. The book of Colossians shows us that the Lord Jesus is not only all-inclusive but also all-extensive. He is infinite; He is unlimited; He is eternal. Actually He does not have a size, because He is the very dimension of the entire universe. What is the length, the width, the height, the depth of the universe? All four of these dimensions are just Christ Himself. Christ is too high! Too deep! Too long! Too wide! He is immeasurable. This means He has no size. You can measure my size, but you cannot measure Christ&rsquo;s size.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPREHENDING BY APPRECIATION</h2>
<p>Our appreciation of the Lord and our apprehension of the Lord differs in size. How much you can apprehend of the Lord depends upon how much you can appreciate. Our appreciation differs. To one Christ may be a big bullock. To another Christ may be a ram. To another Christ may be a goat. To another Christ may be just a lamb. To many of us Christ is just two little pigeons or two little turtledoves. To the majority of the Christians Christ is just one tenth of an ephah of fine flour.</p>
 <p>There is not only the matter of size and quantity. There is also the matter of quality. In the matter of the shedding of blood, none of the offerings has as much blood as a big ox. Surely two small pigeons do not have as much blood as a big ox. Neither does a lamb have as much blood as a big ox. And of course the fine flour has no blood at all. Whether Christ to you is a bull or a lamb or a turtledove or some amount of fine flour all depends upon your appreciation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPRECIATING CHRIST IN HIS HUMANITY</h2>
<p>The majority of Christians mainly consider one aspect of Christ, that is, His humanity which is so fine and so good. When I was young I always appreciated Christ in the four Gospels. He was so fine, so gentle, so mild, so kind, so patient, so even.</p>
<p>In the four Gospels you could see such a man. Surely every reader of the four Gospels appreciates the man Jesus. No other biography or autobiography can present to you a character or figure such as the Lord Jesus. He is too fine and too good and too gentle and too kind and too merciful and too gracious! I believe all of us have always appreciated the Lord in this way.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRECIOUSNESS OF CHRIST<br />
IN HIS BEING A BULLOCK</h2>
<p>But I would ask you a question: Have you ever appreciated the Lord in any other way? Have you ever appreciated the Lord as a big bullock? According to the New Testament and according to the types in the Old Testament, the preciousness of Christ is not only in His being an excellent man in His humanity, but also in His being a bullock, laboring, working, sacrificing, and eventually being killed on the cross not only to satisfy God&rsquo;s requirements, but also to meet our needs and to satisfy our need.</p>
<p>Christ was not only a fine man living an excellent human life on this earth. While He was on this earth He was also laboring and working to fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal will. And after all that He did, He was brought to the cross as a bullock. However, most believers do not appreciate the Lord as such a laboring and sacrificing bullock so much as being a man so perfect and fine. But God does. Christ&rsquo;s main commission was to be a bullock laboring and sacrificing for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s redemption. This made Him the biggest sacrifice with a lot of blood shed. Only such a big sacrifice for the sin offering could afford enough blood for the high priest to bring into the tabernacle, to sprinkle before the veil, and to sprinkle upon the four corners of the golden incense altar, and then to pour out the rest at the base of the burnt offering altar. A pigeon couldn&rsquo;t afford that much blood for the priest to accomplish all these things.</p>
<p>Most Christians simply appreciate the Lord Jesus as a fine man. This means as the fine flour. He was so balanced, so gentle, so mild, so meek, so kind, so gracious. I am afraid that you have never appreciated Christ in the way of a bullock. If the Lord Jesus had only been the fine flour, how could He do the Father&rsquo;s will? How could He labor and work for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s eternal plan? The grains of wheat could not be crucified on the cross. The grains had no blood to shed. With the grains of wheat there was no way to fulfill God&rsquo;s purpose and no way to satisfy God&rsquo;s requirement and no way to solve your problems before God. The offering had to be not fine flour, but cattle. So our appreciation must come up to a higher standard.</p>
<p>When we come to the meetings, especially the Lord&rsquo;s table, most of our praises and thanks have been only up to the standard or to the height of the fine flour. Most of our praises and thanksgiving have only been concerning the fine humanity of the Lord Jesus. Seldom has there been adequate praise concerning the Lord&rsquo;s laboring and working and being slaughtered on the cross for fulfilling God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and accomplishing God&rsquo;s will. We simply don&rsquo;t have this kind of appreciation, so we have no cattle to offer. We have no cattle to bring to the meeting. Most of the time we only bring a handful of fine flour.</p>
<p>It does not mean that God doesn&rsquo;t want you to offer a bullock. God wants you to, but you do not have the strength. You are not able because you have never appreciated the Lord in this way. You don&rsquo;t have the appreciation, so you do not have the experience, the produce.</p>
<p>Today the Christians who can offer the fine flour might even be considered as the best ones. Quite a number don&rsquo;t have anything to offer. In the prayer meeting and in the Lord&rsquo;s table meeting perhaps only one-fifth are the praying ones. Perhaps four-fifths are the silent ones. I don&rsquo;t know what the silent ones have to offer. For sure they don&rsquo;t have any cattle, and perhaps they do not have even one tenth of an ephah of fine flour.</p>
<p>We surely need to have a revolutionary change, first in our concept, then in our appreciation, then in our experience, and then in our meetings. Daily we don&rsquo;t have any appreciation of the Lord as any kind of cattle with blood to shed. So we do not experience Him in this way. Not many could offer in their experience such a big bullock or a ram or some turtledoves or pigeons. I believe that many of us are simply offering fine flour meeting after meeting. Once again I would say that the different items in these chapters are not based upon God&rsquo;s requirements only. They are based also upon our appreciation and our experience of Christ.</p>
<p>With this as a foundation, we can understand how a tenth of an ephah of fine flour as a trespass offering could become a sin offering. That offering is not of the animal kingdom, but of the vegetable kingdom without any blood. How could this be accepted by God? God did say in His Word that without the shedding of blood there is no forgiveness of sin (Heb. 9:22). With fine flour it is quite evident that there is no blood. If there is no blood, how could God forgive our sin?</p><h2 class="head1">ACCOMPLISHMENT AND APPLICATION</h2>
<p>Christ was offered to God once for all to be our sin offering, and that offering had a lot of blood. That is an accomplished fact. But we are not talking about the accomplished fact. We are talking about our experience. We are not talking about Christ&rsquo;s accomplishment. Christ could never accomplish the redemption for sin for us without the shedding of blood. No! That would offend God. That would never be accepted by God. So Christ was God&rsquo;s Lamb. &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world&rdquo; (John 1:29)! As the Lamb of God He had a lot of blood, and He shed all His blood on the cross.</p>
<p>Charles Wesley wrote a hymn which speaks of five bleeding wounds. The five wounds bleeding mean that all His blood was shed on the cross. John 19:34 says clearly that while He was dying on the cross blood and water came out of His crucified body. He had a lot of blood, and He shed it to accomplish the redemption for our sin. We are not talking about the accomplishment of the redemption for our sin. We are talking about our experience, or our application, of His accomplished redemption. The way for Christ to accomplish the redemption for our sin was absolutely according to God&rsquo;s unique requirement. It was short of nothing! But when we come to apply His redemption, to appreciate His redemption, to use His redemption, to experience His redemption, our usage, our application, our appreciation is altogether too poor. Even though we may shout, &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God!&rdquo; this is just our shouting. Our actual appreciation is not a lamb; it is just a handful of fine flour.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A DAY OF MERCY AND GRACE</h2>
<p>But today God is merciful; this is the day of grace. According to the Gospel of Matthew God sends the rain both to the righteous and to the unrighteous (Matt. 5:45). God&rsquo;s mercy and grace today is just like the rain. When the rain comes down from the heavens, if you are open it will fill you up right away. If you are not open, still the water will find a way through a small crack. Why would God accept our different offerings of Christ? It is because God is merciful. Sometimes we may be more strict than God. God would forgive everybody, but you would only forgive yourself. And sometimes you would not even forgive yourself. This is because you don&rsquo;t appreciate Christ that much, so you doubt concerning God&rsquo;s forgiveness.</p>
<p>But God&rsquo;s forgiveness does not depend upon your application. God&rsquo;s forgiveness depends upon Christ&rsquo;s accomplishment. As long as you would call upon His name and come to God in His name, that is sufficient. Whether you come with a handful of fine flour or you come with a big bullock, God would forgive you because of that name. God would forgive you because of the name of that One who accomplished a full redemption for your sin. The accomplishment in full is altogether completed. But our appreciation is not adequate. Most of our appreciation has no blood shed. I don&rsquo;t believe you have ever appreciated the Lord&rsquo;s blood so much as you appreciate His fine humanity. When I was young, I didn&rsquo;t appreciate the Lord&rsquo;s shed blood so much as I appreciated His fine humanity. In faith and in doctrine I believed in the Lord&rsquo;s blood, but in appreciation, especially in my inner sensation, the Lord was so dear to me, not because of the blood He shed for me, but because of His fineness in His excellent humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PICTURE OF OUR EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>This is why the Bible says several times, &ldquo;If he be not able.&rdquo; If you are not able to bring a lamb, then bring a pair of pigeons. If you are not able to bring a pair of pigeons, then bring one tenth of an ephah of fine flour. This is not a picture of what God requires. This is a picture of what you are able to do. This is a picture of your experience.</p>
<p>So in your poor experience there is no blood. Even though in your prayer you may mention the blood again and again, it may actually occupy very little space. What occupies the space is the Lord&rsquo;s fine humanity, His kindness, His meekness, His gentleness, His balancedness, His evenness, His excellency in all His human life. These nearly occupy your appreciation in full. So there is no blood.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING ANY OIL</h2>
<p>Not only is there no blood, but there is also no oil. Of course, if your appreciation is limited to such an extent, there will not be much Spirit. This is why many times when you came to the Lord&rsquo;s table and prayed, you felt it was so dry. There was no oil. It was just dry flour without any Spirit. This is because your appreciation of the Lord is nearly altogether natural. There is no enlightenment. You have never been enlightened by the Word of God or by the light of God. That could only come through the Spirit. If you have much Spirit you would have received much enlightenment and much revelation. Then you would appreciate the Lord much more. You would not appreciate the Lord merely in His fine humanity. The enlightenment will release you and expand your appreciation of the Lord. You will have a lot of oil with your offering. But with your limited appreciation of the Lord, the flour is dry. There is no oil.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING ANY FRANKINCENSE</h2>
<p>Furthermore, there is no frankincense with your offering. That means there is no resurrection. Your concept concerning the Lord&rsquo;s excellency is altogether natural. It is not in the resurrection life. Unless you receive some enlightenment and some anointing from the Spirit, you could never see how the Lord labored on this earth, how He worked on this earth for the fulfilling of God&rsquo;s will, how He went to the cross to be slaughtered to shed His blood to accomplish a full and complete redemption. So our appreciation of the Lord is mostly that He is the fine flour with no blood, no oil, no frankincense. This means no Spirit and no resurrection. This is the poorest appreciation of the Lord, yet by God&rsquo;s mercy and grace, He would still accept such an offering. This kind of word is altogether based upon our experience.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW TO ENJOY CHRIST<br />
AS OUR PEACE OFFERING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Lev. 3:1-5, 6, 7, 11, 13, 17; 7:11-14, 28-34</h1>
<p>In this message we come to the matter of the peace offering. We have given messages on the peace offering in the past, but this time we will apply it to the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE CATEGORIES OF TYPES</h2>
<p>We all have to realize that in the Old Testament typology there are three main categories: the tabernacle, the offerings, and the priests. These three categories cover most of the types in the Old Testament. In the book of Exodus it is mainly the tabernacle with all its utensils and furniture which is revealed. Of course it also gives some record of the priests&rsquo; garments and food. But the main thing that is revealed in Exodus is the tabernacle with all its furniture. The next book, Leviticus, is a record of the offerings and of the activities or services of the priests.</p>
<p>To get into the details of the typology is just like entering into a big forest. It is deep, it is spacious, and it is somewhat mysterious. The more you get into it, the more you may get lost and the more you will get many puzzles. Once you get into the forest, it is so easy to get lost. So in coming to the types we need to stand back from a distance and have an overall look at the situation. This would make it easier to be clear.</p>
<p>All three of these categories are types of the different aspects of Christ. Christ is too rich! Christ is so all-inclusive! Christ is so all-extensive! He needs these three categories of things to illustrate Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>The tabernacle shows us how Christ came from God. This is based upon John 1. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Then verse 14 says, &ldquo;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; This means that Christ is the tabernacle. To be the tabernacle He needed to come from God. Actually He came as God. This is a mystery! Is God the tabernacle or is He the dweller? God is both! God in Christ with the flesh is the tabernacle, and God as the Spirit is the dweller. The very God became the tabernacle for God to dwell in.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Coming to Us</h2>
<p>Christ as the tabernacle is God coming to us. When He came, God came. Without His coming, God had no way to contact man. God was God, far away from man, and man was man, far away from God. Then God Himself became the tabernacle. That means He came in the way of being a tabernacle. He came and tabernacled among man, so solid for man to contact Him. Would you contact God? Then come to the tabernacle. You can come to the tabernacle and contact the tabernacle, and you can touch the tabernacle. Even you can enter into the tabernacle. You can travel through the tabernacle and enjoy its contents. You can enjoy the showbread table for nourishment, the lampstand for enlightening, the ark for fellowshipping, and even the incense altar for speaking to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Issuing in the Incense Altar</h2>
<p>With the tabernacle which is Christ Himself, you have God. Not only can you touch God and contact God, but you can enter into God. You can travel, you can live, you can stay in God. You can enjoy the contents of God. The contents of God are mainly in three things: the showbread table for life supply, the lampstand for life enlightening, and the ark for life fellowship. If you enjoy these three things, the incense altar will come out as the center of your experience. The incense altar is the center of the experience and enjoyment of the contents of God. This is why the incense altar was not listed among the other furniture of the tabernacle. It stands alone. If you draw a diagram of the showbread table, the lampstand, and the ark you will see that they form a triangle, and in the very center of this triangle is the incense altar. This is quite meaningful! It is the issue of the enjoyment of such a triangular situation. It also motivates people to contact God and to enter God and to walk through God and to enjoy God. Out of such an enjoyment a prayer life will come out. That is the incense altar. The proper prayer life always comes out of the enjoyment and experience of God in the way of eating the bread on the table and receiving the light from the lampstand and staying with God in the fellowship. Then you become a partner of Christ in His interceding ministry. That is the incense altar.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>This is Christ typified by the tabernacle. But without the offerings there could not be any bread on the table. The bread on the table came from the offerings. So there is the need of the second category of types, the offerings. The tabernacle portrays how Christ brings God to us. It portrays how He offered God to us that we may enter into God and enjoy God. But the tabernacle has no way to get into us. It could only be our dwelling; it could not be our nourishment. The tabernacle may be likened to our house in our daily life. Our house is for dwelling. Christ came to be your tabernacle. He came with God and He came to present God to you, and you entered into God. Now you have a dwelling place. But if you have a house without any groceries you are still empty. You are still hungry. You have gotten into the house, but nothing has gotten into you.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Two-way Traffic</h2>
<p>As the tabernacle Christ came to us with God. As the offering He goes back to God with us. This is a two-way traffic. He came to us with God, and He goes back to God with us. As the tabernacle He came with God to us, and now as the offerings He is going back with us to God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ in Us</h2>
<p>Not many Christians have seen and experienced these two aspects adequately. Many only have Christ as the tabernacle for them to enter into and for them to experience. They don&rsquo;t have Christ as their offerings for them to enjoy as food by eating Him. Not many Christians today speak of how to enjoy Christ. Sometimes they may speak of an experience of God or an experience of Christ. Seldom would they use the word experience as a verb directly. Seldom would they say, &ldquo;I have experienced Christ.&rdquo; This means they don&rsquo;t adequately realize how to have Christ in them. To be in Christ in our experience means to experience Christ as the tabernacle. We can travel through Him and in Him. But to have Christ in you is another aspect. To have Christ in you is not only the hope of glory, but the food of today. It is not just a matter of glory in the future but of daily food. Christ in you is the daily food.</p>
<p>This is where many Christians are short today. Some even oppose our declaring that Christ is in us. According to their concept Christ is too great to be in us. There is a hymn entitled &ldquo;How Great Thou Art&rdquo; which I appreciate very much. Eventually we wrote a sister hymn concerning how small the Lord is. He is small enough that we can eat Him (John 6:57). Not only is He great, but He is also small enough to eat. He is all-inclusive.</p>
<p>The tabernacle is one category of types showing how that Christ came with God to give us a way to enter into God. Now He is the offerings for us to take Him in. He is the offerings for us to eat Him. To enter into your house is one thing, but to get food into your body is another thing. Although we may not buy a house every day, every day we need to eat several times.</p>
<p>These illustrations show us that many of the spiritual things are the same in principle as the physical things. Physically speaking, we need a house to dwell in, and we need food to eat. We need Christ not only to be the tabernacle as our dwelling but also to be the offerings as our food. If you have only the tabernacle without the offerings, it is not adequate. To enter into the house may be considered as a matter once for all, but the offerings are a daily matter. There was a morning offering and an evening offering (Exo. 29:39). It is just like eating.</p>
<p>The tabernacle mainly signifies that God was available for you to experience, not for you to enjoy and not for you to take in. As the tabernacle God is available for you to enter into Him, but He is not available for you to take Him into you. So there is the need of the offerings. The offerings typify God who is good for us to take in.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Mingling with Us</h2>
<p>The offerings also signify that God can be mingled with us. When you enter into the tabernacle, you are joined to it. But you don&rsquo;t need to be mingled with the tabernacle, and even you cannot be. But whenever you eat something, you are mingled with it. Eating does not bring about just a kind of joining. Eating brings about a kind of saturation and mingling. This is why it mentions in Leviticus 7:10 and 12 that some of the cakes were mingled with oil. Whatever you eat saturates your cells and mingles with your fibers. If you were to eat something inorganic like a piece of rock, that surely could not be mingled with you. But if you eat something of life, something organic, it will be digested and assimilated, and it will saturate your being. It will be fully mingled with your being and even become your being. This is why the dietitians say that you are what you eat. Whatever you eat becomes you. This matter of the mingling is a deeper thought found throughout the entire Bible.</p>
<p>In the second chapter of Genesis after God had created man, He put him before the tree of life, signifying that God Himself was to be man&rsquo;s life supply. So the thought of eating was there even in Genesis 2. There was the thought of some food to saturate our being, to mingle us with Himself. Then in John 6 when the Lord Jesus came He indicated that He was the bread of life (6:35). He went on in verse 57 to say that whoever eats Him shall live by Him.</p>
<p>Paul continues this thought of the mingling by saying that &ldquo;he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 6:17). How could we be one spirit with Him? It is because He is the Spirit, and we also have a spirit. By regeneration the two spirits are mingled as one. If He mingles with us it should be a mingling of the Spirit. This thought of mingling is deep, but it is clearly revealed in the Bible. Yet people&rsquo;s eyes have been blinded and covered by the natural thought, by the religious teachings, and by the traditional theology. Hallelujah! Our God is edible. He is our food. We enter into Him as the tabernacle, and He enters into us as the offerings. We all have to testify strongly that we are in God, and God is in us. Christ is the tabernacle to us, and Christ is also the offerings to us.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE HIGH PRIEST</h2>
<p>But now there is the need of someone to cook the groceries to be the offerings. A single man needs a house, he needs groceries, and he also needs a wife to cook his groceries. You have to realize that Christ as the High Priest is the cook. We have to learn of Him how to cook. Let Christ take the lead in cooking, and you just follow.</p>
<p>Christ is our tabernacle, Christ is the offerings as our food, and Christ is also our Priest preparing the food. Suppose you have the tabernacle and all the offerings, but no priest. This means you don&rsquo;t have a cook. This is like having a house with all the groceries, but no cook. I am afraid that many Christians today are in a situation where they have just one broken corner of the tabernacle with nearly no offerings and no priests to cook the food. They are used to worshipping God in that broken corner. They are not used to worshipping God with a complete, perfect, and erected tabernacle. They are not used to having so many items of the offerings to offer to God. Nor are they, as proper priests, used to preparing the food.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Need of Practice</h2>
<p>Over the past years I have bought a number of pianos, but I have never learned to play a piano in a proper way. I like to play the piano in a natural way. Likewise, we all like to worship God in our natural way. It is so easy for us to have a natural way to worship. We bring our hymnal and sit on the chairs and sing the hymns. It seems too difficult for us to offer Christ as the trespass offering, as the sin offering, as the burnt offering, and all the other offerings. It seems too difficult to labor on Christ and then to bring Christ to the meeting. We like to depend upon others to be our priests. We let them pray in the meetings for us so that we don&rsquo;t need to do anything.</p>
 <p>Once when I was in the San Francisco Bay area a gentleman told me that today is the Twentieth Century, and that everything is specialized. He said that if you would teach the Bible or you would teach people to sing, you must go to a seminary to study and become a specialist. The others are busy with their jobs or with their studies so they have no time to learn these things. Sunday should be the day they can relax and let the seminary specialists do their work. He said we should not ask the common believers to offer a prayer because they have never learned to do this properly. This kind of concept is the natural way and this is the prevailing practice among today&rsquo;s Christians.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Nothing Natural in the Tabernacle</h2>
<p>If you look at the tabernacle you can see that the entire situation is not natural. To know how to act in the realm of the outer court, you have to drop your natural way. You have to learn how to kill the sacrifices and how to take care of the blood. You have to know how to take care of the breasts and the shoulders. You have to know what to do with the meat. You have to know how to enter into the Holy Place where you handle the showbread table and where you dress the lampstand. With every point there is a regulation. If you don&rsquo;t act and behave and move according to the regulation, right away you would die. The two sons of Aaron died this way (Lev. 10:1-2). Nothing natural and no natural way is allowed in the tabernacle.</p>
<p>Nearly all of the Christian services today are full of natural ways and natural activities. This is why there is such poverty among today&rsquo;s Christians. The riches are in the Bible, but they have been neglected.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PEACE OFFERING</h2>
<p>Now we come to the central and the most meaningful offering, the peace offering. All the other offerings are for this offering. This is the center and the focus of all the other offerings. There are five main offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. The peace offering is at the very center of these offerings.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Burnt Offering Being for the Sin Offering</h2>
<p>In spiritual experiences the burnt offering is for the sin offering. If Christ had never been absolute for God, He could never have been our sin offering. His qualification to be our sin offering was His absoluteness. He was absolute for God. According to the clear word in Hebrews 10:9 and according to the prophecies in Psalm 40, He was a Person who lived His life absolutely for God. Every part of His being, His every breath, and every drop of His blood, were altogether absolutely for God. Because of this He was qualified to be our sin offering to deal with our sin and to take away our sins which we inherited by birth. This is not a shallow thing; this is not an easy thing. It needs One who lived a life absolutely for God. So the sin offering is supported by the burnt offering. The burnt offering is the backing of the sin offering. This is why in the record of these five offerings sometimes the sin offering could become the burnt offering (Lev. 5:7,10). Christ as our sin offering is supported by Himself as our burnt offering, as One who lived a life so absolutely for God. The burnt offering is the backing, the support, the base of the sin offering. Without the burnt offering, there is no sin offering.</p><h2 class="head2">The Meal Offering Being for the Trespass Offering</h2>
<p>In the same way the meal offering is for the trespass offering. The meal offering is a type of Christ&rsquo;s humanity. His human life was just like the fine flour, so even, so perfect, so fine, having no defect and no coarseness. So He is qualified to be our trespass offering. Trespasses are the defects in our human life. We have a lot of defects, a lot of imperfections. We have a lot of shortcomings, a lot of mistakes, and a lot of wrongdoings. We need One who in His human life was perfect, balanced, fine, One with whom nothing was rough or tough or coarse. This qualifies Him to be our trespass offering. The meal offering backs up the trespass offering.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Knowing These Things by Our Experiences</h2>
<p>We can know this by our experiences. When you apply Christ as your trespass offering, at first you may not realize the matter of Christ as the meal offering. But gradually you will begin to realize there are so many defects and mistakes and imperfections and transgressions in your daily walk. At the same time you will realize that the Lord Jesus is the perfect One. He is so fine and complete and balanced. With Him there is no imperfection. Because of this you realize that He can be your trespass offering. You would begin to realize how the Lord Jesus as a man could die on the cross as your trespass offering. It is because He was so perfect. By reading the four Gospels you can see that His human living was even and perfect, just like the fine flour.</p>
<p>It is in the same way that you can realize something of the sin offering and the burnt offering. Perhaps you have been born again for twenty-five years and growing in the Lord, yet you realize that you are still sinful. Sin, such an ugly and troublesome thing, is still in your nature. Spontaneously you would apply the Lord Jesus as your sin offering. At the same time you would realize that He is for God, but you are not. You would realize that you may be partially for God, but you are not absolutely for God. You would realize that He is so absolute for God, so He is qualified to deal with your sin and even with your nature. He was qualified to nail on the cross your sin including your nature. This means in your experiential prayer there is something mentioned concerning Christ as the support and the backing of the sin offering. This means that when you experience Him as the sin offering, you realize at the same time He is the burnt offering so absolute for God that He is qualified to be your burnt offering. His perfection in His human living qualifies Him to deal with our trespasses, and His absoluteness for God qualifies Him to deal with our sin.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t take this as a mere doctrine. You have to practice this continually. We have to know the truths not just by teaching, but by our experiences, especially realized in our prayer. What kind of prayer we have depends upon our experience.</p>
<p>The first two offerings, the burnt offering and the meal offering, support the last two offerings, the sin offering and the trespass offering. This shows us the offerings from the side of the supports. But there is another side, the side of our enjoyment.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Offerings from the Side of Our Enjoyment</h2>
<p>According to our experience we don&rsquo;t start our enjoyment of the offerings from the first two, the burnt offering and the meal offering, but from the last two, the trespass and the sin offerings. Firstly, we enjoy Christ as our trespass offering. Even at the time of our conversion we experienced Christ as our trespass offering. According to 1 Peter 2:24 He bore our sins, our trespasses on the tree. But after the experience of Christ as the trespass offering we discover that we are still sinful. In our nature there is nothing but sin. So we then come to Christ as the sin offering. This was Paul&rsquo;s experience in Romans 7. He discovered that in his flesh there was nothing good (v. 18). He discovered that sin was dwelling in his flesh (v. 17). At that time he began to enjoy Christ as the sin offering. Paul discovered his sinful nature in Romans 7, and he experienced Christ as the sin offering in chapter eight. Romans 8:3 says that, &ldquo;God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.&rdquo; J. N. Darby in his notes on Romans 8:3 indicates that the phrase &ldquo;for sin&rdquo; refers to a sacrifice for sin or a sin offering. In Romans 8 the dealing is with sin, not with the sins in our behavior, but the very sin in our flesh and nature. When you experience these matters and when you enjoy these things, spontaneously you will realize that to be such a complete trespass offering, Christ needs to be so perfect as the meal offering. Also to deal with the sin in your nature, Christ needed to be absolute as the burnt offering to God.</p>
<p>This is why I encourage you to practice taking Christ as your sin offering and as your trespass offering. Then you will realize that Christ is your burnt offering for the sin offering and that Christ is your meal offering for the trespass offering.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A Composition of All the Offerings</h2>
<p>Suppose we have experienced all these matters. This brings us then to the peace offering. The peace offering is just a composition of all the other four offerings. In the peace offering a part would be burned to God as the burnt offering (Lev. 7:30, 31). Another part would be given for a meal offering (7:11-13).</p>
<p>Furthermore, within the peace offering the trespass offering is also implied. The peace offering is constituted with the animal life and the vegetable life. Firstly, there is the need of some sacrifice to shed the blood. This shedding of the blood implies the shedding of the blood of the sin offering and the shedding of the blood of the trespass offering. This is an all-inclusive shedding of the all-inclusive blood of the two offerings, the sin offering and the trespass offering.</p>
<p>Then there is the vegetable life with the cakes of fine flour for the meal offering. Also a part of the peace offering which is offered for sin and a trespass offering is burned on the altar as a burnt offering. This means that with this one central offering, the peace offering, all the other four kinds of offerings are included. In other words you cannot enjoy Christ as the peace offering if you have not enjoyed Him as the sin offering and trespass offering based upon the burnt offering and the meal offering.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW TO ENJOY CHRIST<br />
AS OUR PEACE OFFERING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(2)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Lev. 3:1-5; 7:11-15, 28-34; 16:3, 5</h1>
<p>Before we get into the details of the enjoyment of Christ as our peace offering, we need to see something concerning the basic divine principles. We who are believers in the Lord Jesus all know that God is our portion. He is not only our Creator, He is also our portion. In order for Him to be our portion, He has to be our life and life supply. Even He has to be everything to us. If you spend some time to cover all the sixty-six books of the Bible, you can pick up many wonderful nouns and terms and names ascribed to God. For example, God intends to be our Father, our comfort, and our encouragement. He intends to be our light, our life, our strength, our power, and even our authority.</p>
<p>In the Bible these few words are really troublesome: strength, might, power, and authority. Especially in the New Testament these four words are used. God is our strength. God is our might. God is our power. God is our authority. If you go further you would see that God is our energy. It is really difficult to define these words. It is difficult to know the difference between energy and strength, between strength and might, between might and power, between power and authority. It is really hard for people to differentiate between these terms, but the Bible has differentiated these things because God is everything to us in a detailed way.</p>
<p>God is everything to us&mdash;our clothing, our food, and even our beauty. Sisters, when you are adorning yourself, don&rsquo;t beautify yourself by other things. You have to beautify yourself by God and with God. God has to be your beauty and your glory. He also has to be your virtue. In his Epistle Peter tells us that God has called us by His glory and virtue. The preposition &ldquo;by&rdquo; can also be translated &ldquo;to.&rdquo; It has a double meaning. This means that God has called us by His glory and virtue to His glory and virtue. Although it may be difficult for us to understand the difference between glory and virtue, He is these two items to us. God is so many things to us.</p>
<p>But although God is so many things to us, do you know how to participate in and to enjoy God as your portion? This is a very practical matter, yet through all the generations it has been missed and lost among God&rsquo;s people. I don&rsquo;t have the assurance that many of you realize the biblical and revealed way to participate in God as our portion. Colossians 1:12 says that the Father has qualified us for a share of the portion of the saints in the light. The word portion actually means lot. When the children of Israel entered into the good land, each one was allotted a portion of land. That became his lot, his portion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">POSSESSING GOD BY ENJOYING HIM</h2>
<p>God is our portion, but the poor thing is that we don&rsquo;t know how to possess the portion. Even the word possess is not adequate. Actually we don&rsquo;t know how to enjoy our portion. We may possess our portion and yet still not know how to enjoy it. For example you may possess a lot of groceries in your refrigerator, yet you don&rsquo;t know how to enjoy them. The Bible reveals to us that the real possessing is the real enjoyment. If you don&rsquo;t know how to enjoy God as your portion, you surely don&rsquo;t know how to possess God as your portion.</p>
<p>We are still fellowshipping concerning the meetings. Why have the Christian meetings all become Christian services? There is a big difference. The Christian meetings are very biblical, but the Christian services are something traditional. Christian service is not such a good term. It is a term in the degradation among today&rsquo;s Christians. When the Christian meetings degraded, they all became a kind of service. This happened because the believers didn&rsquo;t know how to enjoy God. Because they didn&rsquo;t enjoy God within them, when they came together, they came with nothing. They came empty-handed. They had God only in name. They didn&rsquo;t have the very God in reality for their enjoyment.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD, THE WORD, THE FLESH,<br />
AND THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>John chapter one is a crucial chapter. It tells us that &ldquo;in the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God. And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us&rdquo; (John 1:1, 14). This means that the flesh is the tabernacle. Now you can see that four things are one: God, the Word, the flesh, and the tabernacle. These are not four separate things. They are not even four things in four steps or four stages. They are one thing in four different aspects. God is the Word. The Word became flesh. And the flesh is the tabernacle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GRACE AND TRUTH</h2>
<p>Verse 14 goes on to tell us that when God as the Word became flesh to be the tabernacle, grace and truth came. Two new aspects were added. Now you may say that grace and truth are the tabernacle. When the tabernacle is here, you enjoy grace, and you touch truth. Some Christians who know these spiritual, biblical terms, grace and truth, would define grace as unmerited favor, and they would mainly consider truth to be doctrine.</p>
<p>Have you ever heard that grace is the tabernacle? Have you ever heard that the truth is the tabernacle? If you have never entered into the tabernacle, you don&rsquo;t know what truth is, and you don&rsquo;t know what grace is. When you enter into the tabernacle, you not only know the grace, you enjoy the grace. Grace is more than unmerited favor. Grace is free enjoyment. Grace to us today is the free enjoyment of God. Today we enjoy as grace the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive, life-giving, and indwelling Spirit! This is our portion. We have the enjoyment of such a God who is processed, who is triune, who is all-inclusive, who is indwelling, who is the Spirit. The enjoyment of such a God is grace. Our God is processed, and now He is such a Spirit. He is also indwelling us in our spirit. He has been located. If you are seeking God you don&rsquo;t need to go anywhere. He is in your spirit. Isn&rsquo;t this wonderful!</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOW TO ENJOY THE PROCESSED GOD</h2>
<p>He is in your spirit, but how shall you enjoy Him? This is a mystery. I have used our physical body many times in the past as an illustration. Our physical being does have a <em>bios,</em> a biological life. Not even doctors who have been working on this body for years can tell us the mystery of the <em>bios</em> in our body. It is here, but no one can fully understand it. It is too mysterious! We also have a spirit. This is mysterious, but it is not superstitious. Don&rsquo;t forget that even electricity is a mystery. Although it is mysterious it is still believable.</p>
<p>We must know how to enjoy the processed and even located God. If we don&rsquo;t know how to enjoy God, we could never have the proper meeting. Our meetings would become services. We would need either some bishops or pastors or ministers or preachers or elders or leading ones to take care of the meetings. They would need to take care of the meetings because you come with nothing. You come empty-handed. Whenever you come with nothing and someone else has to function, that is a service. We all have to hate that kind of thing. To have the proper meeting needs the proper enjoyment of the very God whom we have.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE WAY TO ENJOY GOD</h2>
<p>This is why we come to the Gospel of John. This Gospel tells us the way to enjoy the very God. In the beginning was God, and this God was the Word. This Word became the flesh, and this flesh is the tabernacle. The tabernacle is just the grace we enjoy and the truth we realize. After this comes a seventh aspect, the Lamb of God (1:29). Chapter after chapter there are so many items in the Gospel of John for us to enjoy.</p>
<p>This book also shows us the way to enjoy this wonderful portion, our processed, located, and indwelling God. This Gospel has the only verse in the entire Bible which says that the Lord Jesus is the way. Many Christians have applied this verse to their situation, saying that the Lord is the way for them to get a job and the Lord is the way for them to get a wife and the Lord is the way for them to discipline and educate and teach their children. Of course this is not bad, but it is not adequate.</p>
<p>You have to learn to apply Christ as the way to enjoy God. Have you ever prayed this way? &ldquo;O Father, I don&rsquo;t know how to enjoy You, but the Son, Jesus Christ, whom You have given me is the way.&rdquo; If you read John 14:6 in its context you can see that Christ is the way for you to contact God and to enjoy God, not just for you to get a job or to get a wife. If you don&rsquo;t know how to take Christ as your way to enjoy God, you don&rsquo;t really know that He is the way. The Gospel of John shows us that Christ is the way to enter into God and to enjoy Him.</p>
<p>According to the types in the Old Testament, we can see clearly that no one is qualified in himself to enter into the tabernacle. Every one who wants to enter into the tabernacle needs to pass by the altar where two offerings are needed&mdash; the sin offering and the trespass offering. Without these two offerings you are not qualified, and you have no way to enter into the tabernacle. If you enter into the tabernacle without these two offerings, you will die. God as the tabernacle is here and ready for us to enter so that we may enjoy grace and truth. But the problem is that you are a person with sin in your nature and with trespasses in all your behavior. How could such a person enter into this tabernacle? You need the Lamb of God!</p>
<p>Actually the Gospel of John tells us even more. He was not only the Lamb to take away our sin. He was also the brass serpent in chapter three. He was such a brass serpent lifted up on the tree, that is, on the cross to nail the old serpent, Satan, to the cross. In chapter one as the Lamb of God, He took away our sin. In chapter three as the brass serpent, He nailed Satan, the old serpent, the source of all the problems, on the cross.</p>
<p>It is through Christ as our sin offering and our trespass offering that we enter into the tabernacle. Without the offerings we do not have the qualification to enter into the tabernacle. We come to the altar, to the cross, not just to come to the altar, but to enter into the tabernacle. We come to the cross with the intention of entering into the processed, tabernacled God. Our intention is not to enter into God in the third heavens. If He is only in the third heavens we cannot enter into Him. But He is the tabernacled God in our spirit! You must realize that His tabernacling is His dwelling and even His indwelling.</p>
<p>According to the concept in the New Testament, tabernacling and indwelling are synonyms. When God is indwelling you, that means that He is tabernacling in you. We come to the cross taking Him as our sin offering and our trespass offering with the intention of entering into the tabernacled God. And this God into whom we enter is not so simple. Even the tabernacle as a type was not so simple. It had an outer court and an inner court. It had so many items of furniture, including the showbread table, the lampstand, the ark, and the incense altar. God is not so simple. We need to experience Him and to enjoy Him and to participate in Him.</p><h2 class="head1">ENJOYING GOD THROUGH ALL THE OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>The basic prerequisite to enjoying God is to take the offerings. In the last message we saw that there were five main offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. But you shouldn&rsquo;t consider that the five offerings are separate offerings, having nothing to do with one another. No, they are offerings related to one another. Actually, they are just a group of offerings. You must see that this group of offerings is the way to enjoy our processed Triune God. Christ came as the tabernacle, and as the tabernacle He is all the offerings. These offerings are for us to enter into the tabernacle. We need to see how to participate in all these offerings. In other words we need to see how to enjoy all these offerings.</p>
<p>The sin offering always directs us to the burnt offering, and the burnt offering is always reflected in the sin offering. Leviticus 16:3 and 5 put these two offerings together. Whenever Aaron as the high priest offered the sin offering, he also needed to offer the burnt offering. This means the burnt offering goes with the sin offering, and the sin offering directs us to the burnt offering.</p>
<p>This kind of light has come not just from the study of the Scriptures, but also from experience. From my experience I have realized that there is no way to encounter the sin in our nature but by being absolute to God. If we are absolute to God, this kills our sinful nature. Christ could be the sin offering for us because He was altogether absolute. So when we realize that we have sin in our nature, that our being is just sin, then we realize that we need the Lord Jesus as our sin offering. At that time we might pray, &ldquo;O Father, I am so sinful. I am just the constitution and composition of sin. I am just the totality of sin. How could I be for You? It is impossible! Yet, thank You, Lord Jesus, You are absolutely for God. And You are absolutely for God instead of me, on my behalf.&rdquo; By this kind of prayer you offer Christ as your sin offering to God, and at the same time you participate in Him as your burnt offering.</p>
<p>The sin offering directs us to the burnt offering, and the burnt offering is always reflected in the sin offering. If you offered Christ as your sin offering this morning, you surely realized that the Lord Jesus is also your burnt offering. When you taste the Lord Jesus as your sin offering, surely you also enjoy Him as your burnt offering. You have a sweet sensation in you that you are acceptable to God not because of what you are, but because of Him and because of what He is. This is to enjoy Him as the sin offering directing you to the burnt offering. And this is to enjoy Christ as your sin offering with the burnt offering reflected in the sin offering. In experience you cannot divide the sin offering from the burnt offering.</p>
<p>We also have seen that the trespass offering directs us to the meal offering, and that the meal offering is reflected in the trespass offering. These two offerings also go together as a pair. The more you realize that you have a lot of trespasses, the more you will be directed to the meal offering. The more we contact others the more opportunity we have to transgress and trespass. Forty-seven years ago in 1935 I went to the Lord in prayer. I just couldn&rsquo;t get up. The more I confessed, the more I had to confess. I confessed many trespasses against my brothers, against my wife, against the brothers in the church, against so many others. I saw that I had trespassed in everything. Right away there was such an appreciation of the Lord Jesus. I am so imperfect and full of defects, but the Lord is so perfect. What is this? This is the meal offering reflected in the trespass offering.</p>
<p>If you would offer these two offerings, the sin offering and the trespass offering, again and again and again, eventually you would have all five offerings. You would have the sin offering with the burnt offering. You would have the trespass offering with the meal offering. In addition to these four you would also have the peace offering as a result of the other four offerings. Eventually the peace offering is the all-inclusive composition of the other four offerings. It is composed of the sin offering and the trespass offering and the burnt offering and the meal offering. All the elements and substances of these four offerings are composed together in the peace offering.</p>
<p>When you offer the burnt offering, you seldom offer it directly. Mostly you offer the burnt offering when you offer the sin offering. It is the same with the meal offering. You seldom offer it directly. Mostly you offer the meal offering when you offer the trespass offering. This means that within the peace offering you have the sacrifice of the sin offering and the sacrifice of the trespass offering and the sacrifice of the burnt offering and also the present of the meal offering. There is the food supply of the cakes and the wafers, and there is also the blood of the sin offering and trespass offering. Furthermore, there is the burnt offering with the fat and the inwards which had to be burned on the altar as an offering by fire as a sweet savor to God. The burnt offering is an offering by fire, so a part of the peace offering is also a burnt offering.</p><h2 class="head1">ANOINTED, MINGLED, AND SOAKED WITH OIL</h2>
<p>In the peace offering there are many different kinds of cakes. The cakes must be either mingled with the oil or anointed with the oil. A few even had to be soaked or saturated with the oil (Lev. 7:12, ASV). To anoint the cakes is to pour the oil upon the cakes. To mingle the oil with the cakes is something deeper. To soak or saturate the cakes is the deepest. As the fine flour you should not only be anointed with the oil, but you should also be mingled with the oil and even soaked with the oil. You should let the oil enter into every fiber of your being. You must be anointed, you must be mingled, you must be saturated. Some today would oppose the teaching of mingling. They consider this to be a kind of heresy. But I would like to declare that there is something even deeper than mingling, that is, saturating. This can be seen with the cakes of the meal offering in Leviticus 7:12. In this one all-inclusive offering, the peace offering, there is the element of the sin offering, the element of the trespass offering, the element of the burnt offering, and the element of the meal offering. This means the peace offering includes all the other offerings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE PEACE OFFERING</h2>
<p>The peace offering means that all the problems have been solved. All the requirements have been fulfilled. All the needs have been met. All the parties are satisfied. Furthermore, all the parties are now fellowshipping in the full enjoyment. This is the peace. If there are problems not yet solved, you don&rsquo;t have peace. If any requirement is not yet fulfilled, you don&rsquo;t have peace. If any need is not yet met, you don&rsquo;t have peace. If any party is not yet satisfied, you don&rsquo;t have peace. Even if these four things are taken care of, but you don&rsquo;t have a fellowshipping enjoyment with one another, you are still short of peace. Peace means so much! I don&rsquo;t think even this definition has exhausted the real meaning of the peace offering. The peace offering is the top offering. The peace offering indicates there is no problem, no shortage, no want. There is a full enjoyment of fellowship with God and man and with man and God. Every meeting should be a peace offering. Christians today do not have the proper meetings because they have not enjoyed Christ adequately as the peace offering.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE OFFERINGS BY REPENTING</h2>
<p>Christ came as the tabernacle, and Christ as the tabernacle is all the offerings for us to enjoy Him. But how can you enjoy Him? The opening word of the preaching in the New Testament is &ldquo;repent&rdquo; (Matt. 3:2)! This is the opening word for you to enjoy Christ as all the offerings so that you may enter into God as the tabernacle. It all depends upon repenting. After a sinner confesses his sins, right away he receives Christ as his Savior, as his Redeemer. More technically accurate is to say that he receives Christ as his trespass offering. Our Savior and our Redeemer is the trespass offering. We lay our hands upon Him as our trespass offering. He was crucified on the cross bearing all our trespasses.</p>
<p>As we take Him as our trespass offering, at the same time we realize how perfect He is, how fine He is, how balanced He is, how complete He is. This is Christ as the meal offering reflected in our application of Him as our trespass offering. The way to enter into the enjoyment of the Lord Jesus as the offerings is to repent and make confession.</p>
<p>Shortly after you were saved you probably began to realize that you were not just sinful outwardly in your conduct and in your doings, but that you were, even the more, sinful in your nature. You are just sin itself. Then you confessed to the Lord and took Him as your sin offering. You treasured Him more, you appreciated Him more, and you realized that you were not for God at all, even though you may have been doing things for God. You realized that you were not so much for God, but that Christ is.</p>
<p>This is why in the sin offering and the burnt offering and the peace offering, all the inwards of the sacrifices were burned to God. Inwards typify what Christ is within Himself before God. He is genuine, He is real, He is absolutely for God. So He is the burnt offering. When you apply Him as your sin offering, you realize and appreciate Him as your burnt offering. At the same time you have all the elements as the constituents and the components for you to have a complete offering, that is, a peace offering. And the way to enter into the enjoyment of the peace offering is to repent.</p>
<h2 class="head1">APPLYING CHRIST AS OUR OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>Every day we have to practice applying the Lord Jesus as our trespass offering and as our sin offering. Early in the morning you need to pray: &ldquo;Lord, thank You that You have given me another day. Lord, I offer You anew as my sin offering and as my trespass offering for this day. Lord, I realize I am sinful. I anticipate that from morning to evening I will trespass a lot today. Although by Your mercy and grace I would do my best not to trespass, still I will trespass. So, Lord, I take You as my trespass offering for my daily walk today.&rdquo; This practice is to apply the Lord Jesus as your sin offering and as your trespass offering for today. By this you will have Him as the burnt offering reflected in your sin offering, and you will have Him as your meal offering reflected in your trespass offering. Believe me, the whole day you will enjoy Him as the burnt offering and as the meal offering. Then you will have the all-inclusive offering, the peace offering.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SIDE OF APPLICATION</h2>
<p>Some might oppose this kind of practice, saying that it brings people back to the Old Testament. They might argue that in the Old Testament they offered offerings every year and even every day, but that the New Testament tells us Christ&rsquo;s offering is once for all. So we don&rsquo;t need to offer. That kind of teaching is absolutely scriptural but it only shows one side, one aspect. It only shows the side of the accomplishment of the sin offering. The accomplishment of the sin offering was once for all, but to apply what the Lord Jesus is and has accomplished is a daily matter. This kind of practice is not a matter of the accomplishment of the sin offering or of the trespass offering. This is a matter of the daily application of these two offerings. Every day we have to offer Christ as our sin offering and our trespass offering. This will usher us into the enjoyment of the burnt offering and the meal offering, and this will consummate in the peace offering.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW TO ENJOY CHRIST<br />
AS OUR PEACE OFFERING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(3)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Lev. 7:11-15, 28-34; Eph. 1:2; John 1:14, 16; 14:27; 20:19, 26</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE PICTURE OF THE TABERNACLE<br />
AND ITS OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>As we continue the messages on the meetings, we need to consider once again the picture of the tabernacle with all the offerings. Surely the record concerning the tabernacle and all the offerings shows us clearly that the Bible is the divine revelation of God. If the Bible were not inspired by the Holy Spirit, who could design such a tabernacle? No one could imagine or even dream of such a thing. Who could imagine a tabernacle that has an outer court? Within the outer court is an altar and a laver. By means of all the offerings you enter into the tabernacle. After entering you see the showbread table. From there you turn to the lampstand to be enlightened. The lampstand then turns you to the ark. From the ark you turn back to the center where there is the incense altar. If all these things had not been revealed by God, how could Moses have had such an excellent mentality to design such a thing? No philosopher has ever said something like what is revealed in the Bible concerning the tabernacle and the offerings.</p>
<p>Here is a portrait showing a tabernacle for you to enter into, for you to travel in, and for you to stay in. And within this tabernacle is some wonderful enjoyment: a bread table, a lampstand, an ark, an incense altar. Then you need something to fill you up, to enable you, to energize you, to strengthen you to enter in. So there is another category of types, the category of all the offerings. From God&rsquo;s end coming to us there is the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. But from our end, going to God, it is just the opposite. From our end there is first the trespass offering, then the sin offering, then the peace offering, then the meal offering, and finally the burnt offering. On our end there is nothing but trespasses and sin. Outwardly we have trespasses; inwardly we are full of sin. The more you try to wash your trespasses by improving yourself the more you will see something worse.</p>
<p>Close to fifty years ago Brother Watchman Nee used a very simple illustration in a message. In the olden days the Chinese didn&rsquo;t have so many wonderful toys as today. Most of the little girls had a doll made of clay. They whitened its face and put a little pink color on the cheeks and some black color above the eyes. This was their doll. They all loved it, but by touching it and playing with it, they got it dirty. One of the little ones, after getting her doll dirty, decided to wash its face. The more she washed the face of the clay doll, the more the dirt came out. When she cried and showed her mother, she was told that the doll was not washable. Saints, don&rsquo;t you know that you also are not washable? Don&rsquo;t try to wash yourself. You are full of trespasses. You need to take Christ as your trespass offering. When we go to God, we always start from our trespasses.</p>
<p>As you go on you will realize that not only do you have trespasses outwardly, but you also have even sin inwardly. Then you have to offer Christ as your sin offering. God comes to us from the burnt offering to reach us in trespasses. We begin our journey to God from trespasses and sin. If the Bible were not inspired by God, who could imagine these kinds of things? Who could imagine the trespass offering, the sin offering, the meal offering, the burnt offering, the peace offering, plus the wave offering and the heave offering?</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FULFILLMENT OF<br />
THE TABERNACLE AND THE OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>We have mentioned previously that the Gospel of John is a fulfillment of the tabernacle and of the offerings. In the beginning was the Word and the Word was with God and the Word was God, and this Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (John 1:1, 14). It is so clear that the incarnated God by the title of Jesus Christ was and still is the tabernacle. He is the tabernacle for us to enter into and for us to travel in. We all have to declare and shout, God is enterable! God is here for us to enter into and to travel through and to stay with Him. By what means can we enter into God? By the means of all the offerings.</p><h2 class="head2">The First Item of Grace</h2>
<p>In John 1 there is the tabernacle. Verse 14 says that when the tabernacle came in the flesh, He was full of grace. Don&rsquo;t consider that grace is merely unmerited favor. That is too vague. We don&rsquo;t need to guess what is grace. Even the Bible does not allow us to guess anything. This is God&rsquo;s revelation. God&rsquo;s revelation does not need our guessing and our inference.</p>
<p>John 1 says that the tabernacle is among us full of grace and truth. Then it says, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world&rdquo; (v. 29)! This is the first item of grace! The first item of grace is the Lamb of God taking away the sin of the world.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ as the Sin Offering</h2>
<p>In the Gospel of John this tabernacle was traveling and talking to people. Nicodemus, an old gentleman, who was very ethical and very moral, came to Him in the night. He was a teacher and a ruler of the Jews. He came to talk to this tabernacle. But by that time he had not entered into the tabernacle. He was talking with the tabernacle outside of the tabernacle. In this wonderful talk the tabernacle indicated to him, a teacher of the Old Testament, that he surely should know what Moses did. At one time Moses lifted up a brass serpent on a pole because the children of Israel had been bitten by poisonous serpents in the wilderness. Because the children of Israel were bitten by serpents, they needed a serpent to be judged on the pole on their behalf. So Moses lifted up a brass serpent in the wilderness. It had the form of the poisonous serpent, but it did not have the poisonous nature. Whoever had been bitten by the serpent and was dying, had only to lift up his eyes and look at the brass serpent, and God healed him, making him alive (Num. 21).</p>
<p>Then the tabernacle talked to this old gentleman teacher telling him that as Moses had lifted up the brass serpent on the pole, the Son of Man, this tabernacle, this One in the flesh as a Son of Man in humanity, would be lifted up. The next verse, 3:15, says, &ldquo;That every one who believes in Him may have eternal life,&rdquo; that is, to be made alive. These two verses show us the fulfillment of the type in Numbers 21:8-9. Verse 16 says, &ldquo;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.&rdquo; These three verses together show us Christ as the sin offering. He was the sin offering so that Nicodemus might enjoy the One who came to him.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Lamb Becoming the Brass Serpent</h2>
<p>Why in chapter one is there the Lamb and in chapter three the brass serpent? This is to indicate something deeper. In chapter one there is the Lamb, and there is sin, not sins. But in chapter three there is a brass serpent replacing the Lamb and the poison of the serpent replacing sin. In other words, the very Lamb of God in chapter one became the brass serpent. The sin in chapter one became the poison of the serpent in you. You have to realize that sin in you is just the poison of the old serpent, Satan the Devil. In the eyes of God every descendant of Adam is a serpent, full of poison. This poisonous person is the flesh. And Christ as the Son of God and as the Word of God became flesh. But this does not mean that Christ became flesh with the sinful nature. Christ became flesh having only the form and the likeness, not the nature. This is like the brass serpent. It had the form and the likeness but not the poison of the poisonous serpent.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Christ Made Sin on Our Behalf</h2>
<p>Second Corinthians 5:21 says that &ldquo;Him Who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf, that we might become God&rsquo;s righteousness in Him.&rdquo; Concerning this matter Romans 8:3 says, &ldquo;God sending His own Son in the <em>likeness</em> of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh.&rdquo; The Word became flesh but without the sinful nature, without the poison of the serpent.</p>
<p>You have to see that sin within us equals our flesh, even equals us. We, sin, and flesh are synonyms. You are sin, you are flesh, and you are you. Christ was made flesh in your sinful likeness, but without your sinful nature. He knew no sin. He had nothing to do with sin, but He was made sin. When He died on the cross He was at that moment a serpent in the eyes of God. But He was a serpent only in likeness and in form, not in nature. Don&rsquo;t forget that the serpent in the wilderness which was lifted up was a brass serpent. No one could say that a brass serpent has the nature of poison. But surely it has the form and the likeness of the serpent.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John there is the tabernacle and the first main offering, the sin offering. I doubt that Nicodemus, on the night that the Lord Jesus was talking to him, was so clear what the Lord Jesus meant when He referred to the brass serpent. But it may be after the Lord was resurrected, when the Spirit came, and through the help of the other brothers, that he found out the brass serpent referred to the Lord Jesus as his sin offering. It was through such a sin offering that he entered into the enjoyment of the Lord. But this entering into the enjoyment of the Lord might not have been in John 3. This might have come later.</p><h2 class="head2">Christ as the Trespass Offering</h2>
<p>John is a wonderful book. Firstly, it gives us an old gentleman, and following this a very immoral woman. Nicodemus had come to the Lord Jesus, but this immoral woman didn&rsquo;t come to the Lord Jesus. Rather the Lord went to her. We have to realize this is the portable, traveling tabernacle. You shouldn&rsquo;t laugh at this. Don&rsquo;t forget that Paul spoke of the Rock that followed them (1 Cor. 10:4). If you can say that the Rock followed them, surely you can say that the tabernacle followed them. In fact in the wilderness the tabernacle did follow them for at least thirty-eight years. So in the Gospel of John the tabernacle traveled from that old man in Judea to a thirsty, immoral woman in Samaria. The Lord&rsquo;s intention, the tabernacle&rsquo;s intention, was to attract her to enter into the tabernacle, to enter into Himself. But she didn&rsquo;t know this. She pretended to be so religious. She talked about worshipping God and religion. She was not only immoral but religious.</p>
<p>She had come to draw water, and the Lord spoke to her concerning the living water. When she asked that the Lord would give her the living water, He said to her, &ldquo;Go, call your husband and come here&rdquo; (John 4:16). What is the husband? This is one of the trespasses. The Lord touched her main trespass. That one trespass implied others. Then she lied to the Lord by telling part of the truth, making even another trespass. She said that she didn&rsquo;t have a husband, so the Lord helped her to confess: &ldquo;You have well said, I don&rsquo;t have a husband; for you have had five husbands, and the one you now have is not your husband; this you said truly&rdquo; (vv. 17, 18). What was this? The Lord Jesus helped this immoral woman who was full of trespasses to realize her sins.</p>
<p>When such a gentleman as Nicodemus came the Lord didn&rsquo;t ask him to call his wife. Nicodemus was a gentleman and very ethical. I am pretty sure he did not have more than one wife. So the Lord didn&rsquo;t need to touch him by his trespasses. Outwardly, perhaps he had few trespasses, but what about his nature? His nature had been bitten by the old serpent four thousand years ago. When Adam was bitten there in the garden, Nicodemus was also bitten, and that poisonous nature was in Nicodemus. The Lord&rsquo;s word was marvelous, indicating that although Nicodemus was moral and ethical and gentle and good outwardly, inwardly his nature was that of a serpent.</p>
<p>In the very next chapter, in dealing with the immoral woman the Lord didn&rsquo;t try to touch her sinful nature. The Lord touched her trespasses. The Lord knew that she was altogether immoral. She had had five husbands. Not one of her husbands had satisfied her, so she was still thirsty. His talk with her was to help her realize that she had a lot of trespasses, so she needed the One who was perfect to be her trespass offering.</p>
<p>In John 8 there is another case. The Pharisees, the self-righteous ones, brought another immoral woman to the Lord Jesus saying, &ldquo;Teacher, this woman has been caught committing adultery, in the very act. Now in the law, Moses commanded us to stone such persons. What then do you say?&rdquo; (John 8:4-5). Their intention was just to destroy the Lord&rsquo;s position and name. So the Lord gave them a little instruction. He said to them, &ldquo;He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.&rdquo; This means that the Lord even touched them not only by their outward trespasses, but also by their inward sinful nature. When all those self-righteous ones heard this word, it touched their conscience. They all went away from Him, but this one woman eventually laid her hands upon the real trespass offering.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Items of the Rich Grace</h2>
<p>All these cases show us that in John there is not only the tabernacle, but also the offerings. There is the sin offering and the trespass offering. And these are items of the rich grace. When the tabernacle came, it came full of grace. We all have received of the fullness of this grace and even grace upon grace (1:16). After all these cases, there is another case, that of death. In chapter eleven Lazarus got sick and died. But his death wound was healed.</p><h2 class="head1">A FEAST OF THE PEACE OFFERING</h2>
<p>In the very next chapter, chapter twelve, a feast was set up. Do you realize that feast was the feast of the peace offering? After nine cases had been covered up through chapter eleven, in chapter twelve they were enjoying Christ as their peace offering. They had already participated in Christ as their sin offering (John 1:29). They had already shared in the trespass offering (John 4). They had enjoyed the burnt offering (John 7:16-18) and the meal offering (John 7:45-46). Now in that little cottage they were enjoying the peace offering (John 12:1-11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WASHING OF THE LAVER</h2>
<p>The next chapter, chapter thirteen, is on the matter of the foot-washing. This is the laver to cleanse you. Then in chapter fourteen He had a wonderful talk with them to bring them all into the Holy of Holies. Up to now all the offerings had been applied to them. They had participated in all the offerings. They had shared and enjoyed all the offerings. Now they were brought into the Holy of Holies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FULFILLMENT OF THE PEACE OFFERING</h2>
<p>In 14:27 He said, &ldquo;Peace I leave with you; My peace I give to you.&rdquo; But they did not get the peace at that time because the offering had not yet been slaughtered. He had not been offered. He had not ascended to the heavens through resurrection. After He was crucified and buried and resurrected and ascended (John 20:17), He came to His disciples on the same day in the night and said, &ldquo;Peace be to you&rdquo; (John 20:21). In chapter twenty it was not a promise of peace. It was a fulfillment of His promise in chapter fourteen. He brought the peace with Him. Actually He Himself was the peace. When He came to them, He was peace to them. This is the peace offering.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GRACE AND PEACE</h2>
<p>In brief, John&rsquo;s Gospel is of twenty-one chapters. At the beginning you have grace, and at the ending you have peace. This is why many of the Epistles in the New Testament begin with &ldquo;grace and peace to you.&rdquo; Many of the Epistles also end with grace and peace to you or be with you. All these books are firstly books of grace, and then of peace. What is grace? Grace is just the incarnated God to be your sin offering, your trespass offering, your burnt offering, your meal offering. These four offerings are the very components of the divine grace. What then is the issue? What comes out? Peace comes out! This is the peace offering. The peace offering is the result of the enjoyment of all the other four offerings. And that enjoyment is grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING TO ENJOY CHRIST AS THE OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery we have talked very much in the past years about enjoying the Lord. But only recently has it become clearer and clearer how we can enjoy the Lord. Please don&rsquo;t take these messages as just doctrine. You must put all these things into practice. You must apply the Lord Jesus as the Lamb and as the brass serpent lifted up on the cross. You must apply Him as your sin offering and as your trespass offering every day. If you would practice, you would see this is the unique way for you to enjoy Christ. Only the enjoyment of Christ as the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and eventually the peace offering qualifies you to enter into the tabernacling God, to travel in Him, and to stay within Him. Only this enjoyment of Christ as the offerings qualifies you to enter in. The Gospel of John shows you the tabernacle and also shows you how to apply Christ as all the offerings so that you may participate in Him and you may be qualified to enter into God.</p>
<p>By reading the biographies or autobiographies of some of the Lord&rsquo;s children and by reading church history, you will realize that through the centuries all the dear ones who have enjoyed Christ have had these kinds of experiences. At that time they may not have used this kind of terminology, but they did have this kind of experience. They surely passed through the same way. Firstly, they confessed their trespasses, and then they confessed their sin. They may not have been so clear in their understanding as we are today, but actually they passed through this. Then they accepted and applied Christ as their trespass offering and their sin offering. Every day they made a thorough confession of their trespasses and of their sinful nature. As long as they made such a thorough confession of their trespasses, they enjoyed the Lord as the trespass offering. As long as they confessed their sinful nature, they enjoyed the Lord Jesus as their sin offering.</p>
<p>Every day the Lord Jesus became so dear, so precious, so lovable to them. They wanted to sacrifice everything for the Lord. They became one with the Lord, laying their hands upon the Lord Jesus as a burnt offering. By reading their history, you can realize that their enjoyment of the Lord was so rich. They enjoyed the Lord as the meal offering, so fine, so sweet, so perfect, and so rich. Then within them and among them there was a kind of peace as the environment. They enjoyed peace before God, in God, with God, and at the same time one with another.</p>
<p>This is the real situation presented in the Gospel of John. The disciples enjoyed Christ as all the offerings, and they entered into the tabernacle. Eventually they were in a peaceful situation and condition. This means they were in the full enjoyment of the Lord. This is why so many Epistles speak of grace and peace to us. This is to enjoy Christ as all the offerings that we may be qualified to enter into God and to dwell in Him and even to stay within Him as the tabernacle. This is the way to enjoy Christ.</p>
<p>How to enjoy Christ has never been made so clear to God&rsquo;s children as it is today. Why through all the years has no one taught in this way? You have to realize this is a kind of science. Science is not any kind of invention. Science is a matter of discovery. For example, hundreds of years ago people did not know what vitamins were, but they still enjoyed the benefits of the vitamins. They did not have the scientific knowledge, but they had the enjoyment. Today people talk a lot about vitamins and they also understand the vitamins scientifically.</p>
<p>I am presenting to you a scientific way to enjoy Christ. I am not just telling you in a general way that we have Jesus and that He is the bread of life from heaven. No, I am telling you that the Lord Jesus is the tabernacle of God, and He is God Himself tabernacling, and this God is enterable. Today God is enterable! The only thing that qualifies you to enter is to enjoy Christ as your sin offering, as your trespass offering, as your burnt offering, as your meal offering, and as your peace offering. Just as you have learned how to pray-read the Bible, now you must learn how to take Christ as your sin offering, as your trespass offering, as your burnt offering, as your meal offering, and as your peace offering.</p>
<p>Through practicing to take the Lord Jesus as their daily sin offering and trespass offering, many have found that the Lord Jesus has become more dear, more precious, more present, and even more practical to them. Their enjoyment of the Lord practically speaking has increased a lot. This surely has been my experience. I have been enjoying the Lord quite much for a long time, but never in such a practical and rich and clear way as in these days. The more I confess my trespasses and take Him as my trespass offering, the more I enjoy Him.</p>
<p>Don&rsquo;t consider these matters as simply doctrines. They are deep truths, but you need to put them into practice. No matter how busy you are, you must take the time, if possible in the early morning, to apply the Lord Jesus as your sin offering and your trespass offering. To do this you need to confess. Repent and confess. Repent and confess. Every day we need the repentance and the confession. Spontaneously you will apply the Lord Jesus as your trespass offering and sin offering that you may enter into the rich enjoyment of God as the tabernacle.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">HOW TO ENJOY CHRIST<br />
AS OUR PEACE OFFERING</h1>
<h1 class="title">(4)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 6:38; 7:16-18, 32, 45-46; 18:38b; 19:4, 6; 14:2-3, 6, 23</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS GOD&rsquo;S DWELLING PLACE</h2>
<p>The entire Bible of sixty-six books shows us a complete picture composed with the tabernacle, many offerings, and a high priest. Also this picture has an outcome, a result. In the Old Testament the central item of the history of the children of Israel was the tabernacle and later on the temple. The tabernacle and the temple are actually one thing in two stages. The tabernacle or the temple is the focus of the Old Testament history. The Old Testament is a book of history and its center, its focus, is God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<p>According to the teaching of the Old Testament, this dwelling place of God was not only for Him to dwell in upon this earth, but also for God&rsquo;s people to enter into so that they might enjoy God and experience God and even stay with God. This dwelling place was so that God&rsquo;s people might abide with God and might dwell together with God on the earth. It is not a small thing that firstly God would come to the earth to dwell among man, and secondly, that man can enter into God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Actually God&rsquo;s dwelling place is just Himself. On the one hand the tabernacle was God&rsquo;s dwelling place, and on the other hand it was just God Himself. In the New Testament according to John 1, God Himself incarnated to be such a dwelling place, not only for Him to dwell in, but also for His chosen ones to enter into and to dwell in with Him.</p>
<p>For God to come down to dwell among man on the earth is not a small thing. And for us, the fallen human race, to enter into God Himself as our dwelling place to abide with God is too great! How could we, the sinners, come to enter into God and to enjoy Him and to dwell with Him? There is no other way except by the offerings. And all the offerings are Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS ALL THE OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>According to the typology of the Old Testament, this wonderful Christ on the one hand is the tabernacle, and on the other hand is also the offerings. He is the offerings for us to partake of that we may share Him. All Christians know that the Lord Jesus is our Savior, our Redeemer. This is absolutely right! But we have to see that for Him to be our Savior and Redeemer He has to be all the offerings. He has to be our sin offering, our trespass offering, our burnt offering, our meal offering, and eventually, all-inclusively, our peace offering. If He is not all these offerings He could not be our Savior. Very few Christians realize that for Christ to be our Savior and our Redeemer He has to be the five basic offerings plus all the subordinate offerings, including the wave offering, the heave offering, and the drink offering. Some have been Christians for years and yet have not realized that our Savior is composed of all these offerings.</p>
<p>Our Savior, our Redeemer, Jesus Christ, is composed of all the offerings. This is typified by a complete picture in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament the history was mainly composed of a tabernacle or a temple with all of the offerings. Those people chosen by God in the Old Testament did nothing but contact this tabernacle or temple. The way for them to contact the tabernacle or temple was to offer something day by day. They offered the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the heave offering, the wave offering, and the drink offering. Their worship was nothing but the offering of these sacrifices to God. Then after offering these things, they shared and ate a part of the things they had offered to God.</p>
 <h2 class="head1">THE TABERNACLING OF GOD AMONG MEN</h2>
<p>That was a picture in the Old Testament. Now let us consider the entire Bible. What does the entire Bible portray? The entire Bible portrays just one matter: that the Second of the Godhead, the Second of the Trinity, the Son of God, became tabernacled. He became the flesh. John 1:1 and 14 tell us clearly that in the beginning was the Word and the Word was God and this Word became flesh and tabernacled among us. The Apostle John who wrote this Gospel used a word very meaningfully. He used the word tabernacled as a verb. Many translators, however, did not have the boldness to translate it in this way. Rather they translated this word for tabernacled into dwelt. It is right to say dwelt, but the dwelling of the incarnated God among man was not a common dwelling. That dwelling was something very particular. That dwelling was the tabernacle.</p>
<p>While He was on this earth dwelling among man, He was tabernacling. This verb indicates that the One who was the subject of the sentence was a tabernacle. He was God becoming a man. And this Man was a tabernacle. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, and this Word became flesh, and this flesh was the tabernacle!</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAMB OF GOD</h2>
<p>In the same chapter John declares that this One who is the Word and who is God and who became flesh and who is the tabernacle is also the Lamb of God (v. 29). He is both the tabernacle and the Lamb of God. The Lamb of God no doubt signifies the offering. The Lamb of God is the basic offering. Among all the five offerings the most basic one is the sin offering. The Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world is the sin offering. Here it says sin in the singular number, not sins in the plural number. In the New Testament the singular sin indicates something deeper within our nature, not just our outward conduct. Matters of our outward conduct are sins which are trespasses. But this is the sin which is the very source, the very root, of all our sins. It is in our nature. So the Lamb of God here is a sin offering. In the opening chapter of the entire Gospel of John you have the tabernacle, and you have the offerings. Both of these items are just one Person by the name of Jesus Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FULL OF GRACE</h2>
<p>When this Person came, grace came. Grace was not given as the law was given. The law in the Old Testament was given through Moses. But grace came along with this Person. When this Person came, grace came because He is just grace. He tabernacled among us full of grace and from His fullness we all received grace upon grace!</p>
<p>In the past we have pointed out that grace is just Christ Himself, but if Christ had never been the offerings, He could never be the grace to us. For Christ to be grace to us, He has to be the offerings.</p>
<p>Many Christians love John 3:16 which says, &ldquo;For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes in Him should not perish, but have eternal life.&rdquo; But few Christians have noticed that this verse begins with the little word &ldquo;for.&rdquo; In the New Testament &ldquo;for&rdquo; is a very important word. It indicates that something which has gone before needs further definition. This means you have to go back to verse 15. Verse 15 reads, &ldquo;That every one who believes in Him may have eternal life.&rdquo; A number of the different versions of the Bible use a paragraph sign between these two verses, indicating that verse 16 is a new beginning. But to separate verse 16 from verse 15 is a big mistake. Verse 15 begins with the word &ldquo;that&rdquo; which also indicates that you need to refer to something preceding. This means you have to go back to verse 14.</p>
<p>Verse 14 says, &ldquo;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&rdquo; To get the proper meaning you have to put all three of these verses together. The Lord Jesus came as the tabernacle among people, but if He had never been lifted up on the cross, He could never be grace to us. So grace is the incarnated Christ offered on the altar as our offerings. The incarnated Christ crucified on the cross became grace to us. If He had only been incarnated to be the tabernacle and was abiding among men, but had not been crucified, He could not be grace to us. If He were only incarnated and not crucified, how could we partake of Him? How could He be our portion?</p>
 <p>In chapter one you have the word grace, and in 3:16 there is the word gave. Giving is a gift, and a gift is a grace. The Greek word, <em>charis,</em> can be translated into both gift and grace. It is a gift, and the gift is grace. Grace is God&rsquo;s giving. God has given us His only begotten Son on the cross. Without being crucified Christ could never be given to us. Without His being crucified we cannot partake of Christ. Hallelujah! He was crucified! He was given. Actually, the giving was the crucifixion. It was on the cross that Christ became all the offerings. And all these offerings are grace to us. The sin offering is a grace. The trespass offering is a grace. The burnt offering is a grace. The meal offering is a grace. Eventually the peace offering also is a grace. And of this grace we all have received and grace upon grace.</p>
<p>In this same Gospel we see not only the sin offering but also the trespass offering. This is a wonderful Gospel! Actually this Gospel of John is just an abstract of the entire Bible. It portrays how God Himself became a man to tabernacle among men and how He in the flesh became all the offerings. And the first offering is the sin offering.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE SIN OFFERING</h2>
<p>The first case concerning the offerings in the Gospel of John is the case of Nicodemus. Nicodemus was a proper gentleman, full of qualifications. He was old with a high position as a ruler and teacher of the people. He was also a Pharisee. He came to the Lord Jesus not realizing that he had been bitten by the poisonous serpent. He never realized that he himself was a little serpent. Outside he was a gentleman and perfect, but inside he had a serpentine nature, so the Lord Jesus told him that he needed to be born again. Because he didn&rsquo;t understand rightly, the Lord Jesus explained to him that to be born again is to be born of the water and of the Spirit (John 3:5). Eventually he understood so he asked how this could be.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus then referred him to the story of the brass serpent in Numbers 21. The children of Israel had been bitten by the serpents and were dying. Then God designed a way of salvation. He told Moses to lift a brass serpent up on a pole and whosoever would look upon that brass serpent would live. This word should have indicated to Nicodemus that he was a serpent. He had been bitten by the old serpent. Satan had bitten his forefather Adam, and he was born of Adam. This was to help Nicodemus realize that he was a bonafide and typical sinner. So he needed the sin offering.</p>
<p>Christ knew no sin, but He was made sin for us. He came in the likeness of the flesh of sin. He was not a serpent, but He took the form of a serpent. He didn&rsquo;t have the nature or the poison, but He had the form of a serpent. This was the sin offering. This is not just a matter of washing away your sinful doings. This also is a matter of regenerating you. The problem is not mainly the outside wrongdoing. The main problem is the inside sinful nature. Inside you are a serpent. You need another life. You need to have another person, another nature. The only way to have another life is by Jesus Christ who died on the cross in the form of a serpent to terminate your serpentine being. If you believe into Him you receive the eternal life, the life of God. When you receive this life of God you will have another life. You will have another birth. You will be born of the life of God to be another person. You will be a re-born person, a new person with a new nature. This is Christ as the sin offering.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE TRESPASS OFFERING</h2>
<p>Following chapter three of John there is another case, that of the Samaritan woman. This person was not moral; she was immoral. The Lord Jesus did not talk to her about the brass serpent. She pretended to be very religious, although she was altogether immoral. She talked with the Lord Jesus about worshipping God. How good this seems to be! What a wonderful subject. But the Lord Jesus knew her story, and He had a way to attract her and to cause her to desire the living water. Once she thirsted for the living water, the Lord asked for her husband. Then she lied by telling the truth. She said, &ldquo;I don&rsquo;t have a husband&rdquo; (John 4:17). This sounds very good. The Lord agreed with her that she did not have a husband, but He said that she had had five already and that the one she had now was not hers. This was the Lord&rsquo;s confession of her sins, her trespasses. By changing from one husband to another she was living a life full of trespasses. So the Lord presented Himself to her as the trespass offering, while He presented Himself to Nicodemus as the sin offering. No doubt in these two chapters you have these two basic offerings&mdash;the sin offering and the trespass offering.</p>
<p>You have to realize that we all are Nicodemus inwardly; and we all are the Samaritan woman outwardly. Outwardly everything seems good, but inwardly we are sin. So we all are Nicodemus, needing Christ to be our sin offering. We also are the Samaritan woman needing Christ to be our trespass offering. Hallelujah! He is both the sin offering and the trespass offering to us. He has been given, and He has been offered on the altar. This is grace. We can surely lay our hands upon Him, taking Him as our sin offering and as our trespass offering. What a grace this is! Grace is not merely an unmerited favor. That is too vague. The real grace is very solid. Grace is Christ as all our offerings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE BURNT OFFERING</h2>
<p>In the initial cases in the Gospel of John, such as the case of Nicodemus and the case of the Samaritan woman, you have the sin offering and the trespass offering. In the following cases you have the burnt offering and the meal offering. The main and striking characteristic of the burnt offering is the matter of absoluteness. The burnt offering was absolutely for God. The whole offering was burnt unto God. Nothing was left for man. The entire burnt offering was burnt for God&rsquo;s food and for God&rsquo;s enjoyment and for God&rsquo;s satisfaction. That is a full portrait of Christ&rsquo;s absoluteness. Christ was not only for man; Christ was absolutely for God.</p>
<p>In John 7:16-18, you could see the absoluteness of Christ. Christ was so absolute for God. He was for nothing else. He did not care for what His flesh brothers thought. He didn&rsquo;t care for His own name or His own will. He only cared for God&rsquo;s will. These verses show us that Christ is not only the sin offering and the trespass offering, but also the burnt offering. He is not only the sin offering for sinners and the trespass offering for trespassers, but He is also the burnt offering for God Himself. He is not only for Nicodemus or only for the Samaritan woman; He is also for God absolutely.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE MEAL OFFERING</h2>
<p>Where then is the meal offering in the Gospel of John? The meal offering has a character of fineness, evenness, and perfectness. The meal offering was mainly made of fine flour which had been ground so fine, so even, and so perfectly. The Gospel of John shows us that the dear One portrayed is not only altogether absolute to God, but in the eyes of God He is altogether fine, even, and perfect. There is nothing coarse with Him. There is no defect, no imperfection. He is perfect; He is even; He is fine.</p>
<p>Among your friends you may seem to be very perfect because all your friends are for you. Your friends, your parents, your wife, or your husband would try their best to cover your shortcomings. But your opposers, your adversaries, would try their best to find your faults. In John 7 the Pharisees and the Jewish leaders were around the Lord Jesus seeking to find out His faults. But they couldn&rsquo;t find any faults. They sent deputies to arrest Him, but they came back empty-handed. When the Pharisee asked why they had not brought Him, the deputies answered, &ldquo;No man ever spoke as this man speaks&rdquo; (7:46). This shows how fine, how perfect, how balanced the Lord Jesus was.</p>
<p>By your speaking people may know how fine or how rough you are. A fine man always speaks in a fine way, and a rough man always speaks roughly. The speaking of the Lord Jesus was so fine, so even, so perfect, so convincing. This is the meal offering.</p>
<p>Later in chapters eighteen and nineteen Pilate judged the Lord Jesus. Three times he declared that he found no fault in this Man (18:38; 19:4, 6). Of course, these three verses could be applied to Christ as the Lamb of God. As the Lamb of God He had no blemish and no fault. But these verses also can be applied to the fine flour. He is fine, perfect, even, and fully balanced. With Him there is no fault. Pilate did not say that he could not find any sin; he said he could not find any fault. This means he could not find even the smallest wrongdoing. With Him there was absolutely nothing wrong. There was absolutely no fault. Before God He was absolute, and before man He was perfect, without fault.</p>
<p>The Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the picture in the Old Testament. The tabernacle is here, and all the offerings are here. The sin offering is here, the trespass offering is here, the burnt offering is here, and the meal offering is here. Christ as the sin offering for us is based on His absoluteness toward God. His being our trespass offering is based upon His perfection, His fineness, in the eyes of God and all men. He is absolute, so He can be the sin offering. He is perfect, so He can be the trespass offering. Hallelujah! Oh, we do partake of such a Christ who is all the offerings&mdash;the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, and meal offering.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE PEACE OFFERING</h2>
<p>Then you may ask, Where is the peace offering in the Gospel of John? In this Gospel as well as in other portions of the Bible, the fulfillment of such a thing as the peace offering needs two steps, the initial step and the consummate step. Let me illustrate with the matter of salvation. With salvation there is the initial step, and there is the consummate step. On the one hand we all have been saved. But on the other hand we still need to be saved. First Peter 1:5 and 9 indicate that when the Lord Jesus comes He will bring the consummate salvation to us.</p>
<p>In like manner the fulfillment of the peace offering has the initial fulfillment and also has the consummate fulfillment. The initial fulfillment is in chapter twelve, where there was a feast prepared in the home of Mary, Martha, and Lazarus. The Lord Jesus was there. Look at the picture. When they were feasting that was a miniature of the fulfillment of the peace offering. God was there, in the form of man, with His chosen people, and they were eating with Him. There was peace, there was enjoyment, there was satisfaction. Surely that was the peace offering. But that was only the initial fulfillment of the peace offering.</p>
<p>The consummate fulfillment of the peace offering was after His resurrection, after He was offered to God as every kind of offering. After His resurrection He came back and said to them, &ldquo;Peace be to you&rdquo; (John 20:21).</p>
<p>At the beginning of the Gospel of John you have grace. When the Lord Jesus came, grace came. At the end of the Gospel, peace comes to you. How could this be? This could be only because Christ was offered on the cross as all the offerings. Firstly, He became grace to us, and then in resurrection, He became the peace offering to us. When He met with His disciples after His resurrection, that meeting was a feast, and that feast was a peace offering. From that time on, even up until today, whenever we believers meet together with the resurrected Christ as our peace, we have a feast. Our Christian meeting must be a feast. This feast is the feast of the peace offering.</p>
<p>When we meet together we offer Christ as our sin offering, as our trespass offering, as our burnt offering, and as our meal offering. Eventually when all the offerings are added together, we also enjoy the peace offering for our satisfaction and also for His satisfaction.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ULTIMATE PEACE OFFERING</h2>
<p>You have to realize that John&rsquo;s Gospel does not stand alone. There are also John&rsquo;s Epistles and John&rsquo;s book of Revelation. In these books you could see that this peace offering was continuing. Eventually in Revelation there is the ultimate tabernacle. Today we are enjoying the initial tabernacle, but in Revelation 21 and 22 there is the ultimate tabernacle of God among men. This is all the offerings added together resulting in the ultimate peace offering. The entire new heavens and new earth with the New Jerusalem will enjoy the ultimate universal peace offering. The entire universe will be attending a feast of the peace offering.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOR THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Don&rsquo;t forget that we are talking about the meetings. This is how we must meet: enjoying Christ and offering Christ as all the offerings and eventually feasting with God and with one another.</p>
<p>In John chapter one through chapter twelve there are all the offerings. They are good to usher you into the tabernacle. The tabernacle begins in chapter fourteen. The Lord Jesus said that in His Father&rsquo;s house, which is the tabernacle, there are many abodes. The tabernacle is in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen. Between chapter twelve and chapter fourteen there is chapter thirteen with the laver for the washing of your feet. This is to get rid of all the earthly dirt and all the defilement from the earthly touch so that you may enter into the tabernacle. So you can see that the Gospel of John fits into the entire picture of the tabernacle and all the offerings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOR OUR DAILY PRACTICE</h2>
<p>We must look to the Lord for His grace to put all these points into our daily practice. Every day, again and again, we have to lay our hands upon Christ, taking Him as our sin offering and as our trespass offering. By taking Him as these two offerings we will be reminded of how lovely He is, how dear He is, how precious He is, how absolute He is toward God. We will be reminded of how even, how perfect, how fine He is in the eyes of man. Spontaneously His absolute life will be ours, and His fine living will be ours. Then we will enjoy Him as our burnt offering and our meal offering. We will have a lot of experiences seven days a week. We will accumulate a lot of the experiences of such a rich Christ. Then when we come together in the church meetings our hands will be full of Christ. We will come with the experiences of Christ. Then whatever we present will be a peace offering. In whatever we present there will be something of the sin offering, something of the trespass offering, something of the burnt offering, and something of the meal offering. These are the components of the peace offering. We will enjoy all these in the presence of God, and we will enjoy these with one another. So we will have the peace and the enjoyment and the satisfaction. This is the way to meet!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE RESULT OF ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
AS THE OFFERINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 14:2-3, 6, 10, 16-20, 23; 15:4-5; 16:13-15; 17:1-2, 12, 14, 17-18, 20-24</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FULFILLMENT OF THE TYPE</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle as a type. In the opening chapter it tells us that the Word of God came to be the tabernacle. The Word was made flesh and tabernacled among us. Even the tabernacle is the subject and focus of this Gospel. Such a One was full of grace and truth.</p>
<p>In the first chapter there is also the altar. We can say this based upon verse 29, which says, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!&rdquo; Where did the Lamb of God take away the sin of the world? We know that this was at the cross. That is the altar.</p>
<p>In the following cases from chapter two through chapter twelve there are all the offerings. In chapter three with the case of Nicodemus, there is the sin offering. In chapter four with the case of the Samaritan woman, there is the trespass offering. In chapters six and seven, there are the burnt offering and the meal offering. In chapter twelve there is the love feast, the feast of the peace offering. Those disciples and the Lord Jesus who were together in that house enjoying the feast were enjoying the peace offering.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WASHING OF THE LAVER</h2>
<p>It might seem that these dear ones were ready to enter into the tabernacle. They had enjoyed the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering. It seems that they were ready and qualified to enter into the tabernacle. Yet according to the typology in the Old Testament, before entering into the tabernacle, you need the washing. You need to go to the laver. This is why in chapter thirteen there is the washing of feet. This is the laver. After all the offerings are covered in the first twelve chapters, there is a laver in chapter thirteen. At first Peter rejected the foot-washing, but once he understood, he told the Lord to wash his whole body. But the Lord told him, &ldquo;He who is bathed has no need, except to wash his feet, but is wholly clean&rdquo; (v. 10). This is the function of the laver. According to Exodus 30:17-21 the laver is for washing the hands and the feet to prepare you to enter into the tabernacle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FATHER&rsquo;S HOUSE BEING<br />
THE TABERNACLE&mdash;THE TEMPLE</h2>
<p>After chapter thirteen covers the matter of the washing of the feet, the Lord Jesus began his most mysterious speech composed of three chapters. He opened by telling his disciples: &ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house are many abodes&rdquo; (14:2). You have to realize &ldquo;My Father&rsquo;s house&rdquo; is just the tabernacle. You have to forget about your traditional inheritance that told you &ldquo;My Father&rsquo;s house&rdquo; was a big heavenly mansion. This term &ldquo;My Father&rsquo;s house&rdquo; is used twice in the Gospel of John, once in chapter two and once in chapter fourteen. In 2:16 it is so clear that &ldquo;My Father&rsquo;s house&rdquo; refers to the temple of God. It should also be the same in chapter fourteen. How could the same term by the same writer in the same book after twelve chapters change in its meaning? The change was not with the writer, but with all the traditional teachers. They have taught the Bible according to their traditional concept, not according to the Word itself.</p>
<p>Even I myself was not so clear about this portion of the Word until 1958. While I was staying in an honorable guest house in London I was considering John 14, and the light came. By going back to chapter two you can be clear that the Father&rsquo;s house is the temple. In chapter two the Lord Jesus told the Jews that if they destroyed this temple, He would rebuild it within three days. He was, of course, referring to His physical body which was the tabernacle and the temple of God, even the Father&rsquo;s house. They would destroy this temple by crucifying Him on the cross. Yet in three days He would be raised up again. The raised-up house of the Father becomes the corporate Christ. The raised-up house becomes Christ and all His believers as His members. So in the Epistles we are told that the church is the house of God (1 Tim. 3:15), and we are told that the church corporately is the temple (Eph. 2:21).</p><h2 class="head1">A MUTUAL ABODE</h2>
<p>Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen of John are very mysterious! In these chapters the Lord Jesus disclosed a mystery to us: the Triune God wants to be our dwelling place. He wants to be our home, our tabernacle, that we may enter into Him and abide in Him and even dwell in Him. This is the first point. Secondly, after we enter into Him, making Him our home, spontaneously we also become His home. Firstly, we enter into Him and abide in Him, and then He enters into us and abides in us. So we have a mutual abiding. This mutual abiding is clearly described in chapter fifteen. In verse 4 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Abide in Me and I in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>In John 17:21 there is also the concept of the mutual abiding: &ldquo;That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us.&rdquo; In this verse it is really hard to tell who is in whom. But you have to realize that chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen plus the one chapter for the prayer, chapter seventeen, are on the Triune God being our home that we may become His home. There is a mutual abiding. This mutual abiding produces a mutual abode.</p>
<p>This word, abode, is used twice in chapter fourteen, once in the plural number and once in the singular number. Verse 2 says, &ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house are many abodes.&rdquo; Verse 23 says, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; In verse 23 abode is used in the singular number, so this means a mutual abode for the mutual abiding.</p>
<p>For a long time I understood the word, abide, according to the modern connotation, which mainly means to remain. At the time that the King James Version of the Bible was translated, the word mansion did equal the word abode. A mansion simply meant a dwelling place. That equaled the word abode in Greek. But today when people read the King James Version, they understand the word mansion according to the modern connotation.</p>
<p>In chapter fifteen to abide is not just to remain but to dwell. To abide in Me means to dwell in Me. This thought of dwelling and an abode is throughout chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen. Who is this dwelling place? It is the Triune God! This is too mysterious! It would take us many days to get into it. But by looking at some of the crucial verses, we can realize that this mysterious message given by the Lord has a basic thought, that the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, want to be our dwelling place that we may enter into and dwell in that He may also dwell in us. Eventually, we who are dwelling in the Triune God will spontaneously become His dwelling place. Eventually we dwell in Him, and He dwells in us. There is a mutual dwelling. This is not a simple matter. How could one person enter into another person and how could the second enter into the first? It is impossible! So there is the need of the matter of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO PREPARE A PLACE</h2>
<p>In 14:2 and 3 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house are many abodes; if it were not so, I would have told you; for I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be.&rdquo; These few verses have been misinterpreted by most Christians. They consider that the Lord Jesus went to the heavens after His resurrection to prepare a big mansion for them. I was taught this when I was young, but I had a question: Could this be the Lord&rsquo;s salvation? Could the Lord&rsquo;s salvation be that He died on the cross for our sins and that He was resurrected and that He ascended to the heavens and is now building a big mansion? As I mentioned before, in 1958 when I was in London the light came. No! this kind of interpretation is just religious. It is just traditional. Even it is like Buddhism, which teaches there is a kind of western heaven.</p>
<p>We all must see that to prepare the place means to die for our sins, to terminate our flesh, our natural life, our old creation, and to defeat the serpent and his serpentine nature within our being. This is to prepare the place.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COMING BACK AS THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In chapter fourteen when the Lord Jesus spoke of His coming back, He was not referring to His coming back the second time at the end of the age. He was referring to His coming back right after His resurrection. And He did come back. We know that on the day of His resurrection, early in the morning, He went to the Father secretly, and in the evening He came back to visit the disciples. At that time He breathed into them and told them to receive the Holy <em>Pneuma,</em> the Holy Breath, that is, the Holy Spirit (John 20:22). That was His coming back. He came back in another form.</p>
<p>When He was incarnated, He came in the flesh. But after resurrection He came back, not in the flesh, but in the form of breath, in the form of the <em>Pneuma.</em> He came back in the form of the Spirit, and by being the Spirit He got into the disciples. This was His coming back. In 20:16 the Lord indicated that He would ask the Father to give them another Comforter. Then in verse 18 He indicated that the other Comforter was just Himself. In verse 16 He used the pronoun He, but in verse 18 the He is changed to I. This proves that the other Comforter, the Spirit of reality who would come, is none other than Himself. This time He came as the Spirit, not to dwell among them, but to dwell within them forever. Since He came this time, He has never left His church.</p><h2 class="head1">A MUTUAL ABIDING</h2>
<p>In chapter fifteen He went on to tell His disciples that they should abide in Him, and that He would abide in them. They should make Him their home, and He would make them His home. This is a mutual abiding, a mutual home. You are His home, and He is your home. You take Him as your home, and He takes you as His home.</p>
<p>I believe we can all testify according to our daily experiences that we have the realization we are in the Lord, and the Lord is in us. Many times I have had this kind of sensation. Sometimes when I was on an airplane I realized I was not just on the plane, I was in Christ. While I was in Christ, He was in me. This kind of sensation comes spontaneously after you offer Christ as your sin offering and your trespass offering. Spontaneously you would sense that you are in Him, and He is in you. Eventually, you realize that Christ is not only your sin offering and your trespass offering, but also your abiding place. He becomes your abode. When you realize that He is your abode, you also realize that you are His abode. There is a kind of mutual abiding.</p>
<p>Then in chapter sixteen the Lord Jesus went on to say, &ldquo;All that the Father has is Mine; therefore I said that He receives of Mine and shall disclose it to you&rdquo; (v. 15). This means that whatever the Father has is embodied in the Son. Whatever the Son is, is realized through the Spirit. And whatever the Spirit is, is in us. This means that the Son is the embodiment of the Father, the Spirit is the realization of the Son, and we are the expression of the Triune God. The Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;is in us and we are His abode.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENTERING BY WAY OF LIFE</h2>
<p>Chapter fourteen tells us that there are many abodes and one Father&rsquo;s house. That means you and I can enter in and abide there. In chapter fourteen He also told us that He is the way. But this way is a life. This is why He is the way, and He is the life. If the Lord Jesus is not your life, you don&rsquo;t have a way to enter into God the Father. The way for you to enter into God the Father is the Lord Jesus as your life. When you have the life, you have the way. This is mysterious.</p>
<p>But we can illustrate by the food you eat. All the food and the nourishment you eat does not enter into you as lifeless matter. If you eat a small rock, it simply passes through you without giving any nourishment. Nourishment is something of life. It is something that can enter into your cells and even into your fibers. Once you take food in, it is digested and assimilated into your blood and into your cells and even into your fibers. Eventually, what has been assimilated by you becomes you. If you eat a lot of fish, you become a composition of fish, or a constitution of fish. This is how we can say that the Triune God becomes us. You are what you eat.</p>
<p>So in chapter fourteen you have the abode, and you have the way to enter in. The abode is the Triune God, and the way to enter in is life. If you don&rsquo;t have Christ as the life, you could never enter into the Father. But when you take Christ as your life, this life becomes the way for you to enter into the Father. So the Father becomes your abode, and eventually in chapter fifteen there is the mutual abiding with the mutual abode.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INCENSE ALTAR</h2>
<p>After these three chapters we come to chapter seventeen where the Lord Jesus prayed. Before we get into His prayer, I must point out that chapter seventeen is the incense altar. Chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen are the actual tabernacle which 1:14 mentions. &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; But where is this tabernacle? It is in chapters fourteen, fifteen, and sixteen. The laver is in chapter thirteen and following this are three chapters which are a full description and a full portrait of the tabernacle. Now we are in the Triune God, which means we are in the tabernacle. We have passed by the showbread table, the lampstand, and the ark. Now we have arrived at our destination. Our destination within the tabernacle is the incense altar.</p><h2 class="head1">GIVING US ETERNAL LIFE</h2>
<p>In chapter seventeen the Lord Jesus is at the incense altar. Here He offered a prayer. This prayer may be considered as a model prayer, and it is the focus of the Lord&rsquo;s intercession. Many Christians talk about the Lord&rsquo;s intercession. They say that He can save us to the uttermost because He is interceding for us. But not many have ever pointed out the focal point of the Lord&rsquo;s intercession. It is not for you to have a better car or a better job or a bigger house. Listen to His prayer: &ldquo;Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You; even as You gave Him authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him&rdquo; (vv. 1-2). Do you understand this kind of word? It is mysterious! He is giving you eternal life. When I was young I was told that eternal life simply means that we Christians will go to the heavens and enjoy a lot of blessings there which will last forever. They didn&rsquo;t use the term eternal life; they said everlasting life. This is altogether too natural! Eternal life is just God Himself as the divine life to us!</p>
<p>He was given &ldquo;authority over all flesh, that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him&rdquo; (v. 2). What a blessing to know that the Father has given all of us, the entire church, as a gift to the Son! The Father has given all the chosen ones as a gift to the Son, that the Son may give the Father&rsquo;s life to them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GIVING US THE WORD</h2>
<p>Following this the Son also has given the holy Word, the truth. This holy Word sanctifies. You have the eternal life, yet you still need to be separated from the world. You need to be sanctified with all the reality that is conveyed in the holy Word. Many Christians think that the Bible only gives teachings. When they read the Bible they pick up the teachings in their mentality. They don&rsquo;t realize that the holy Word conveys the reality of the divine Person. When we read the Bible all the reality should saturate our being. The Bible does contain teachings and doctrines, but the teachings and doctrines convey the riches of God&rsquo;s Person. This is why the Bible tells us that we should not only read the Word, but also eat the Word (Jer. 15:16). To read the menu is one thing, and to eat the food is another. The menu could never saturate you, but the food can.</p>
<p>When the Lord gives us eternal life, we have the Father&rsquo;s life. Now the Word saturates us with the Father&rsquo;s nature. This is sanctification. We may use teaification as an illustration. If you put a tea bag into a glass of plain water, it will teaify the water. This means the essence and the nature of the tea will saturate the water. After a few minutes the water will be teaified. This is a picture of sanctification. The word of the Bible is like the tea bag. You need to put the heavenly tea bag in your glass and keep it there all day long so that the essential element of the &ldquo;tea&rdquo; will saturate your entire being. This will even change your nature. Firstly, the Son gives us the eternal life, and secondly, He gives us the sanctifying Word. The Word of God is truth that sanctifies us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GIVING US THE GLORY OF THE FATHER</h2>
<p>This is not all. Eventually the Son also gives us the glory of the Father. This also is mysterious. What is the glory? The glory is just the expression of God. Electricity in a room is glorified by its expression through the light bulbs. The Son has given us the glory of God the Father so that we can express God. How marvelous!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE FACTORS OF ONENESS</h2>
<p>Suppose three brothers have been chosen by God the Father and given to the Son. The Son has given the Father&rsquo;s divine life, the eternal life, to all three of them. All three have the divine life, but one likes to go to the beach to play in the water, another likes to go to the mountains to play in the snow, and another likes to go to the theater. All are one in the divine life, but eventually they are divided by the world. But all three love the Word to some extent. Day after day they pick up the sanctifying Word. Eventually, the first would no longer go to the beach, the second would no longer go to the mountains, and the third would no more go to the theater. Spontaneously, they would no longer be divided. Firstly, they had the oneness in the divine life. Secondly, they had the oneness in the divine nature through the sanctifying Word.</p>
<p>But still there may be some problems. One of the brothers likes to make a show of how much he knows the spiritual things. The other likes to control things, and the third thinks he is so smart and able to give the best advice. In life they are one, in the sanctifying nature they are one, but in the intention, in the goal, or in other words, in the expression they are not one. But one day the Lord shows them the glory of the Father. He shows them that the church life is not to express how much they know, nor some kind of authority, nor anything else. The church life is just to express the very God. So all three give up their goals and their intentions to have one goal, to express the very God. Then the three are really one&mdash;one in life, one in nature, and one in the glory, that is, in the expression. What is this? This is the Son glorified. The Son is glorified in this kind of oneness.</p>
<p>The oneness in John 17 has three aspects. The first aspect is to take the Father&rsquo;s divine life as the factor. The second aspect is to take the Father&rsquo;s nature through the sanctifying Word as the factor. The third aspect is to take the Father&rsquo;s glory as the factor. By this the Son is glorified and as the Son is glorified, the Father is glorified in the Son&rsquo;s glorification.</p>
<p>In John 17:24 the Lord prayed, &ldquo;Father, I desire that those whom You have given Me may also be with Me where I am, that they may behold My glory which You have given Me, for You have loved Me before the foundation of the world.&rdquo; What does the phrase &ldquo;where I am&rdquo; mean? Where is the Lord? The Lord is in a situation that glorifies the Father all the time, and He wants us to be there. He wants to bring us all into this kind of glorifying situation, to glorify the Son that the Son may glorify the Father. This is the intercession at the incense altar.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ULTIMATE RESULT OF ENJOYING CHRIST<br />
AS ALL THE OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>We all need to see this. This is the ultimate result of enjoying Christ as all the offerings. When we enjoy Christ as the sin offering, as the trespass offering, as the burnt offering, as the meal offering, and as the peace offering, we enter into the Triune God as our tabernacle. Then we will arrive at the incense altar where we will be one with Christ to pray the kind of prayer that is recorded in John 17. We will pray that the Father will glorify the Son and that He would be glorified in the Son. We will pray that all His believers may realize that He has given the divine life, the sanctifying Word, and the Father&rsquo;s glory to them, that they all may be one in the Triune God to express Him. Then all the members of Christ will have a threefold oneness, and this is the proper church life. This proper church life is surely in the Triune God. It is by such a church life in this threefold oneness that the Son is glorified so that the Father might be glorified in the glorification of the Son. This is the result of enjoying Christ as all the offerings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GLORIOUS CONSUMMATION</h2>
<p>Eventually you do have a glorious consummation here. The believers are now in the Triune God, and the Triune God is now becoming the believers&rsquo; expression! So the believers and the Triune God, the Triune God and the believers, are all one. This is the living testimony of the Triune God even today on this earth. In eternity we will see this in full. This will transpire all the way by our enjoying Christ as our trespass offering and sin offering. This will lead us into the enjoyment of Christ as the burnt offering, as the meal offering, and as the peace offering.</p>
<p>This will usher us all into the practical tabernacle, the Triune God, where we will have a mutual abode. Then we will arrive at the incense altar where we, as the Body of Christ, pray with Christ for God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, that the Triune God would be wrought into the believers and that the believers would be one in God and one with one another in God to be His glorification.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BRINGING THESE MATTERS INTO THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>All of these matters should be brought into the meetings. How high this kind of meeting would be! We need to have this kind of meeting. This is the way to meet. The way to meet is to enjoy Christ as the initial offerings: the sin offering and the trespass offering. Then we enter into the full enjoyment of Christ, and we will be ushered into the tabernacle. There we will be one with the Triune God and with one another in the Triune God. We will be the church as a living testimony of the Triune God. Then the Lord&rsquo;s prayer in John 17 will be fulfilled. May the Lord have much grace upon us, and may He grace us with all that we need so that we could be ushered into such a condition that where He is, there we will also be with Him to glorify the Triune God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE REALITY OF THE FULFILLMENT<br />
OF THE TABERNACLE AND THE OFFERINGS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1; 14, 29, 31-33; 3:5-6, 34; 4:14, 23-24; 6:63; 7:37-39; 14:16-20; 15:26; 16:13-15; 20:19-22</h1>
<p>Some aspects of the truth concerning the matter of the meeting of God&rsquo;s people have been somewhat hidden and missed by Christians for centuries. Most Christian meetings today are mainly either traditional, natural, religious, or just according to people&rsquo;s taste. If I am a person who likes to be quiet, I would attend a quiet meeting. If I am a person who likes to be excited, I would attend some exciting meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MEETING AS A FEAST UNTO THE LORD</h2>
<p>In the previous thirteen messages we have covered three crucial and main points. First of all those messages have opened the veil to show us that in God&rsquo;s redemption His intention is to have a people on the earth who are meeting as a feast unto Him. According to Exodus 12:14 God ordained His redeemed people to meet together for a feasting unto Him. This means not only before Him, but also with Him.</p>
<p>Feasting, of course, mainly implies two things: meeting and eating. Firstly you need people coming together. You cannot have a feast by yourself or even with your wife. To have a feast you need to have a meeting, and the more people, the better. Also feasting implies eating. If you come together, but with nothing to eat, that is not a feast. That may be a kind of emptiness or vanity. When God&rsquo;s people came out of Egypt in the ancient time, there were probably two million. When they came together to feast, what a feast that was!</p>
<p>Such a feast was unto the Lord. This means they feasted before God and with God. Today in the church meetings we are feasting before God and also with God. When we are feasting before the Lord, God is happy, and we also are happy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A DWELLING PLACE AND THE OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>Secondly, for such a feasting&mdash;meeting before God and with God&mdash;there is the need of two things: a dwelling place and the offerings. In the record of Exodus they were firstly feasting in the wilderness. There were no houses or lodgings&mdash;just wilderness. So there was the need of a dwelling place, the tabernacle. The tabernacle was the dwelling place of God. God dwelt there, and His people also dwelt there.</p>
<p>According to the picture presented in Exodus, while they were in the wilderness, the children of Israel were either traveling or camping. When they camped, it was around God&rsquo;s tabernacle which was called the tent of meeting. There was the tent of meeting with all the camps. Their camping was also a meeting. While they were camping, God was camping among them.</p>
<p>As they were camping in the wilderness, they spent much time to build a wonderful tabernacle with all its furniture and utensils. That tabernacle signified not only Christ but also God&rsquo;s people in a collective sense to be a dwelling place for God and for all those who loved Him and served Him.</p>
<p>To enter into that dwelling place, there was the need of the offerings. The offerings were needed because God is God, and man is man. Because of the fall there is a gap between God and man. We need some offerings to bridge the gap, to bring us from the altar into the tabernacle. The main offerings, of course, were the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering. The subordinate offerings were the wave offering, the heave offering, the drink offering, the vows, and the free-will offerings. All these offerings are bridges to bring us to the other side, that is, into the tabernacle.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST BEING THE TABERNACLE<br />
AND ALL THE OFFERINGS</h2>
<p>The third crucial point we have covered is that Christ, the incarnated God, is both the tabernacle and the offerings. One book in the New Testament, the Gospel of John, points out that the incarnated God, Christ, is the tabernacle. John 1:14 reads, &ldquo;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, (and we beheld His glory, glory as of an only begotten from a father), full of grace and reality.&rdquo; In writing his Gospel John used the word tabernacled for dwelling. He used the word tabernacle in the verbal form to denote what the incarnated God intended to do. God incarnated intended to be the tabernacle.</p>
<p>Before the incarnation God was invisible and mysterious, but after the incarnation, there was something solid, visible, and touchable&mdash;the tabernacle. As the tabernacle, Christ is enterable! He is not only visible, solid, and touchable, but also enterable. We can walk into God as our tabernacle. I can testify that for so many years I have entered into God and even traveled in God. This is a wonderful fact! &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us&rdquo; (John 1:1, 14). How marvelous! The mysterious, invisible God became solid, visible, touchable, and enterable. You can dwell in Him as the tabernacle and travel through Him day and night.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FATHER&rsquo;S HOUSE</h2>
<p>In John 14:2 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house are many abodes.&rdquo; What or who is the Father&rsquo;s house? The Father&rsquo;s house is firstly the incarnated Christ. The incarnated Christ is the embodiment of God. He is the house of God. God did house Himself in Christ. The incarnation was God&rsquo;s housing. When Christ was on this earth, God housed Himself in Him. That was the Father&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in John 2:19 the Lord Jesus told the Jews, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up.&rdquo; This meant His physical body would be raised in resurrection. In resurrection Christ raised His own body, the destroyed house of God, with the church, His mystical Body.</p>
<p>The New Testament goes on to tell us in 1 Timothy 3:15 that the church is the house of God. We must connect this verse with John 14:2 which says, &ldquo;In My Father&rsquo;s house are many abodes.&rdquo; The many abodes of John 14 are &ldquo;the house of God, which is the church of the living God&rdquo; of 1 Timothy 3.</p>
<p>According to these verses God is so solid for us to enter into, but there is the need of some bridging instruments, the offerings. So John 1 which speaks of the tabernacling God also speaks of the Lamb of God (v. 29). On the one hand there is the tabernacle which is Christ, and on the other hand there is the Lamb of God indicating Christ as the offerings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REALITY OF THE FULFILLMENT</h2>
<p>Now we have to consider the reality of the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings. Yes, Christ is the tabernacle, and Christ is all the offerings. But we have to ask: Where is the tabernacle today? And where are all the offerings today? Without the reality these are empty doctrines and vain talk. There is the need of reality. This word, reality, is used very particularly and very specifically in the Gospel of John. John 1:14 says, &ldquo;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, (and we beheld His glory, glory as of an only begotten from a father), full of grace and reality.&rdquo; The tabernacle in the Old Testament was full of glory. The glory of God was upon the tabernacle. Then in the New Testament, Christ, the incarnated God, became the tabernacle, and the glory of God was upon Him. And He was full of grace and reality, so the word reality is used in chapter one.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WORSHIP IN SPIRIT AND IN REALITY</h2>
<p>Then in chapter four the Samaritan woman talked to the Lord Jesus about worshipping God. The Lord Jesus told her that &ldquo;an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality; for the Father seeks such to worship Him. God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality&rdquo; (vv. 23-24). The Father is seeking a certain kind of worship&mdash;a worship in spirit and reality.</p>
<p>In chapter eight the Lord Jesus spoke of reality again: &ldquo;And you shall know the reality, and the reality shall set you free&rdquo; (v. 32). Reality frees people.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF REALITY</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus continued to speak of reality in chapter fourteen: &ldquo;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality, Whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you&rdquo; (vv. 16-17). This Comforter whom the Lord would send is just the Spirit of reality. What is reality? Reality is just the Spirit.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate: suppose I have a book about electricity. From the first page to the last, it is concerning electricity, and I am teaching this book. I teach you many things about electricity. Eventually, if we don&rsquo;t have electricity, we don&rsquo;t have the reality. Only electricity itself is the reality of the book and of its teachings. If we only have the book about electricity, but no electricity, it is vanity. There is no reality until electricity is installed in a building. Once the electricity is actually installed, you have the reality of the book and the teaching.</p>
<p>In the same way the Bible teaches us many wonderful things. It teaches us that Christ is the tabernacle and the offerings. But what or who is the reality? It is the Spirit! If you don&rsquo;t have the Spirit, these are just terms. The tabernacle is just a term; the offerings are just terms. Without the Spirit as the reality, these are vain terms. Once electricity is installed into a building, you simply need to be taught where the switches are and what they operate. That is not a teaching of vanity; that is a teaching of reality. Christ is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings, but without Christ becoming the Spirit, these are vain teachings.</p><h2 class="head1">GOING TO PREPARE THE WAY INTO THE FATHER</h2>
<p>In John 14 the Lord Jesus suddenly told His disciples that He was going away from them (vv. 2-3). This bothered the disciples very much! The Lord Jesus had been with His disciples over three years, and they had had a wonderful time with Him. Now He told them that he was leaving them: &ldquo;For I go to prepare a place for you. And if I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, that where I am you also may be.&rdquo; If the Lord Jesus would not go away, the disciples would have no way to enter into God. His going was to prepare the way for them to be where He was, that is, in the Father. He was in the Father, but they were not.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF HIS INDWELLING</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the Lord Jesus was among them but not in them. He was not satisfied just to be among them. He wanted to be in them. They needed to be in God, and the Lord needed to be in them. How could these two steps be accomplished? It was only by the Lord&rsquo;s going away by His death on the cross and by His coming back in resurrection. It was expedient and profitable to the disciples for the Lord to go away (16:7). He was going away by dying on the cross as all the offerings. This would solve the problems and bridge the gap between them and God. This would cut the way and open the door, taking away all the obstacles that they might enter into God.</p>
<p>Also after three days the Lord would be resurrected to release all the divine riches within Himself into them. On that day, the day of resurrection, they would know that He was in the Father, and they were in the Lord, and the Lord was in them (14:20). How marvelous! Christ the Son is in the Father; you are in Christ the Son, so you are surely in the Father, too. Not only so, but the Son who is in the Father is in you! This is too wonderful!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus told His disciples He was going to take the way of death and resurrection. By this He would become another form, the life-giving Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45b says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; When He became such a Spirit, this Spirit is the reality of the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings. Christ, the very fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings, became the life-giving Spirit. The Word which was God, firstly became flesh, and this One, through death and resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE QUALIFICATIONS OF THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>What qualifications does the life-giving Spirit have? He has the qualifications of being the tabernacle and of being all the offerings. For instance, a professor needs the qualification of a Ph.D. in mathematics in order to teach mathematics. The life-giving Spirit is just the qualified Christ. Christ was qualified because he was the tabernacle and all the offerings. As such a qualified One, He became the life-giving Spirit. Today the life-giving Spirit is the reality of all that Christ is. This is very logical.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY PNEUMA</h2>
<p>The Greek word used for Spirit is <em>pneuma.</em> It also can be translated into air, breath, or wind, depending upon the context. On the day of His resurrection in the night He came to them where they were staying for fear of the Jews. Although the door was shut He came and stood in their midst. He showed them His hands and His side so that they might realize He was the crucified One and then &ldquo;He breathed into them and said to them, Receive the Holy Spirit&rdquo; or Holy <em>Pneuma</em> (John 20:22). What is the Holy <em>Pneuma</em> ? It is just Christ Himself as the life-giving Spirit!</p>
<p>At that time Christ entered into His disciples as the life-giving Spirit. From that hour He never left the disciples. Rather He remained in them and even lived in them.</p>
<p>I have been in the U.S.A. for the past twenty years and during this time I have given perhaps three thousand messages, most of which have touched this one thing&mdash;Christ is the life-giving Spirit. It seems I cannot finish this burden. Who is Christ? What is Christ? He is just this air, this breath, this Spirit, this <em>Pneuma</em> ! And where is He today? He is not only in the heavens; He is also in you and me! &ldquo;In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you&rdquo; (John 14:20). This &ldquo;I&rdquo; who is in you is the Spirit of reality. This is too wonderful!</p><h2 class="head1">CONCENTRATED IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John, in chapter one, has the Word, and it has God. From chapter one to chapter twenty are many other things. There is the Word becoming flesh as the tabernacle of God (1:14); there is the Lamb of God (1:29); there is the brass serpent (3:14); there is the living water (4:14); there is the bread of life (6:35, 51); there is the door (10:9); and there is the pasture (10:9). There are so many items. But the last item in this book is in chapter twenty&mdash;the <em>pneuma,</em> the breath. This Holy Spirit, this Holy breath, includes all the other items. The other items are all concentrated in the Holy <em>Pneuma,</em> the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>This Spirit today is in our spirit (2 Tim. 4:22; 1 Cor. 6:17)! How good it is that we have a spirit! As the Spirit He is so available like the air, and He is in our spirit. The tabernacle and all the offerings are in the Spirit. But how can you use Him? How can you apply Him? You have to exercise your spirit. You may know this, but to know it is one thing and to live it and practice it is another thing.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate once more. I have a lot of experiences of being defeated. I have known for years that such a wonderful Spirit is in my spirit, but even yesterday I had a lot of failure in this matter. Why? We have a spirit, and this wonderful life-giving Spirit is living in our spirit. This is a wonderful fact! With the fact there is no problem. Yet in nearly everything of our daily life we don&rsquo;t care for this fact. We do things, we say things, we act, we move, we walk, we do everything mainly in ourselves, by ourselves, and with ourselves.</p>
<p>For instance my wife asked me, &ldquo;Will you speak forty minutes or an hour this morning? Don&rsquo;t speak over forty minutes.&rdquo; Right away I was unhappy. I didn&rsquo;t say anything aloud, but within I said, &ldquo;You are too much!&rdquo; She didn&rsquo;t hear because I didn&rsquo;t utter it, but surely the life-giving Spirit in my spirit heard. Then I did say something: &ldquo;Maybe an hour.&rdquo; After I said this to her, I said, &ldquo;Lord, forgive me. I need You as my trespass offering.&rdquo; Why should I confess? Because, first of all, when my wife said something to me I shouldn&rsquo;t initiate the feeling. I should right away turn to the spirit: &ldquo;Lord, You answer. Lord, You face the situation. This is Your problem. This is Your business. It is not mine. Lord Jesus, You take care of this.&rdquo; This is the right way. But this is not easy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT GOING AHEAD OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When you hear a knock at the door, you need to say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You go to open the door. Spirit, You open the door.&rdquo; Most of the time we do not do this. When the knock comes, we go to the door by ourselves. Whatever comes to us, we go ahead right away like Peter did many times. In the four Gospels Peter was such a person, going ahead and leaving Christ behind (Matt. 17:24-27). We are the same. In our daily life we are nearly always ahead of the Lord Jesus. We don&rsquo;t use our spirit.</p>
<p>This is the secret: whenever anything comes to you, don&rsquo;t go ahead. Say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You go and I will follow. Lord, You take the lead, and I will follow.&rdquo; This is not so easy, but if you would practice this, you will touch the reality of the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings. I can testify if you would practice this, you are right away in the tabernacle, because you are in the Spirit. Not only so, if you are in the Spirit, Christ is all the offerings to you. He is your trespass offering, your sin offering, your peace offering, your meal offering, and your burnt offering. If you have the Spirit, you have the reality of all these things. We must see the matter of the Spirit! This is the ultimate point we should reach&mdash;the Spirit in our spirit.</p>
<p>This is very practical. For example I have to be careful about my eating. I like to eat more, but my wife knows how to restrict me. Sometimes when she asked me how much I would eat, I didn&rsquo;t feel happy. When she told me I should only eat so much I talked to her, making a bargain. Every time I bargained with her I regretted it. Why? Because I went ahead of the Lord Jesus. I went ahead of the Spirit. For many years I have been learning this one lesson. Now at least a number of times when my wife asks me how much I am going to eat, I don&rsquo;t have any feeling. I don&rsquo;t like to say anything. Rather I say, &ldquo;Spirit, this is Your job. You tell her. This is Your business.&rdquo; I am not joking. This shows you the secret of how to live Christ. This is how to be one spirit with the Lord.</p>
<p>If you would practice this daily you would experience the reality of the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings. I do hope that the Lord would grace you to put all that you have heard concerning the matter of the meetings into daily practice, that you would take the Lord as all the offerings&mdash;the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and eventually the peace offering. Through all the offerings you may enter into the Triune God as the tabernacle and dwell in Him to enjoy the life supply from the showbread table and the enlightenment from the lampstand and to have a strong testimony by the ark. Eventually you will be one with Christ at the incense altar to pray the prayer which He offered to the Father in John 17.</p>
<p>We all have to realize that the divine goal of the Triune God in the Gospel of John is to bring us all into Himself, that we may dwell in Him to enjoy all the riches in Christ, that we may take Him as our dwelling place and let Him take us as His dwelling place. By doing so, we can be one with Him to realize the eternal life with the holy name of the Father, and to experience the sanctification of the Word of God, and also to participate in the Father&rsquo;s glory that we will express only Him and nothing else&mdash;so that we all could be perfectly one in the Triune God, that the Son may be glorified in the church and that the Father may be glorified in the Son. This is the eternal goal of the Triune God.</p>
<p>Then we have the surplus of the experiences of Christ for us to come together to exhibit Christ, to offer Christ to God, and to enjoy Him with God one with another, that Christ may be fully expressed even in this age as a testimony, not only among the human beings, but also a testimony to the principalities, the powers, the authorities in the air, and all the angels. This will fulfill God&rsquo;s eternal purpose and satisfy Him and us for eternity.</p></body></html>
