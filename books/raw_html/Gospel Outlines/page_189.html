<h1 class="title">AFTER DEATH THE JUDGMENT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Heb. 9:27</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>It is reserved for men once to die
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Men deserve death.</li>
	<li>Death came from sin.</li>
	<li>No one can escape death. Give some examples to describe how man cannot escape death.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>After death comes judgment
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Death is not the end but a beginning. Man&rsquo;s life is short, and this short life is ended by death. But after death there is eternity. This eternity is ushered in by death.</li>
	<li>Whatever man does in this age will be judged in eternity. Many commit crimes and escape the punishment of the law and the shame of public opinion. Many think they will be safe from punishment once they die. But what man does cannot be resolved by his death. Actually death is not the end of all things. Everything will be judged in the coming eternity.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The results of judgment
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>There is not one who has never committed a sin in this age, so in eternity no one can escape God&rsquo;s righteous judgment and condemnation.</li>
	<li>The result of condemnation is perdition.</li>
	<li>Perdition means to go to hell.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The way to escape<br />
<span class="normal"><em>Give a strong conclusion on how to escape death and judgment.</em></span></li>
