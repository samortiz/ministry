   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Greetings, Sister X:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I arrived safely in Tientsin on February 11.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My mother's health is fairly good.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The brothers and sisters in Tientsin are living and growing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They wrote a letter inviting Brother Witness Lee to come here, but Mr. Lee said that he did not have a burden to come yet.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I also heard that the brothers and sisters in Peking invited Brother Philip Luan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Perhaps Mr. Luan will come soon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thank God, He is never wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brother Sia, one of the responsible brothers in Tientsin, mentioned that he wanted me to have a few days of sisters' meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I will be staying one or two months in Tientsin, so I will be praying with the sisters every Friday in the sisters' prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The rest of the time I will have much contact with the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Brother Hsia agreed to this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Sister Fu-ru also intends to come north.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have already asked others to look for a house that she can rent.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We will see how God leads and arranges.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peace in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Your sister,</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I received your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have already received one hundred copies of The Open Door and distributed them to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We prepared X dollars for the use of The Open Door a long time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, wiring it was a problem, so we did not send it until the twenty-first.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We sent it through the Shanghai Bank.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Please follow it up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The condition of the assembly is quite good for the most part.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thank and praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Please pray for the work here.</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Please send subsequent issues of The Open Door to the meeting hall for us to distribute to the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This will save you postage.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Brother Watchman:</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>May the Lord give you more spiritual gifts, power, and light, and may the number of believers increase and the work spread.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thank the Lord and thank you for your love.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Yesterday, I received the second issue of The Open Door which you sent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I read the article on the principles of the work and felt that Christians today really need principles like this concerning the truth of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It also inspired me to write this letter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thank and praise God that His faithful servant has already explained everything.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, I am sending a subscription form to order one copy so that I may read everything.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please send me a copy of the first issue as well.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am enclosing my subscription form and one dollar for postage.</S>
