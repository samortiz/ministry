   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A COMPLETE UNIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Together Adam and Eve made a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the same principle, Christ and the church make a complete unit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is Christ s other half.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Adam and Eve became one flesh, but Christ and the church are one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can say to the Lord, Lord Jesus, without the church, You are just a half.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You are not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Likewise, without You, we are not complete either.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Praise the Lord that when Christ and the church are joined as one, they make a complete unit!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the church there is no place for our natural life and fallen human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The human life and nature are not adequate to match Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In order to be His counterpart, we need to be one with Christ in life and in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that Christ and the church as one unit have the same life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, Christ and the church have the same image and stature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not merely know this as a doctrine, but see it as a heavenly vision.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to see why we must receive Christ as our life and partake of His divine nature and, furthermore, be transformed into His image from glory to glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We also need to see that we must attain to the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ because we are to be Christ s counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we see this vision, we shall be able to understand the type of Christ and the church in chapter five of Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>CHRIST NOURISHING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At this point we need to go on to consider how Christ nourishes and cherishes the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we are nourished, something enters into our being to meet our need.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Nourishment, therefore, must come out of a supply.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without a supply, it is impossible to have nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ nourishes the church with all the riches of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Hence, all the riches of God are in Him, and He enjoys these riches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then He nourishes the church with the very riches of the Godhead that He Himself has enjoyed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is proved by John 15.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this chapter the Lord Jesus says that He is the vine and that the Father is the husbandman.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Father is the cultivator, the planter, the farmer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We, the believers in Christ, are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The vine nourishes the branches with what the vine absorbs from the soil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God the Father is the soil, the water, and everything to Christ as the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The vine absorbs the riches from the soil and the water, digests them, and then transmits them to the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ nourishes the church with the riches of the Father which He has absorbed and assimilated.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By nourishing the church, Christ meets the inward need of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is correct to say that Christ nourishes the church with His life and with His word.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But neither life nor His word is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The source is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What Christ receives of the Father becomes the life and the life supply which are embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this reason, the Word is the word of life, even the bread of life or the supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If we would be nourished by Christ today, we need to abide in Him to absorb His content into our being as life and the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In order to experience this in a practical way, we daily need to contact the living Word, for the Word is the embodiment of life and of the life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The more we abide in the Lord and contact the Word, the more we experience His nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the way Christ nourishes the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the members of the church need to practice abiding in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There should be no insulation, no separation, between us and the Lord and no detachment from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As soon as we are detached from Him, the supply of nourishment is cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Along with abiding in the Lord constantly, we must daily come to the Word and take it in as our life and life supply.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we shall receive nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Furthermore, all the meetings of the church should be meetings of nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Morning watch and our fellowship with the saints should also be times of nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As we are nourished by the life and the life supply, we grow and we are purified.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In the following message we shall see that the nourishing word is also the washing word, the cleansing word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The water we drink cleanses the fibers of our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As we abide in the Lord to receive the riches of the Father and as we contact the Word to receive the life and the life supply, we are nourished by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way Christ nourishes the church He loves.</S>
