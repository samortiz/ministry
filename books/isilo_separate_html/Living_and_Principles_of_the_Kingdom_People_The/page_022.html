AND HIS RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2>
<p>The Lord said that we should not be like the Gentiles who seek what to eat, what to drink, and what to put on, but we should seek first God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness. Because God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness seem to be hidden, we need to seek and pursue them. God&rsquo;s kingdom is different from His righteousness. God&rsquo;s kingdom refers to His authority, but God&rsquo;s righteousness refers to His ways. To seek God&rsquo;s kingdom is to seek to obey His authority, but to seek God&rsquo;s righteousness is to seek to follow His ways. Both God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness are a matter of subjecting ourselves to God&rsquo;s ruling. The Lord&rsquo;s entire teaching on the mountain concerns allowing the kingdom of the heavens to rule. This is a matter of God&rsquo;s ruling. If we subject ourselves to God&rsquo;s authority, His kingdom will be with us, and if we follow God&rsquo;s ways, His righteousness will be with us.</p>
<p>For example, a young brother who is considering marrying a young woman in the world may have an inward sense of disapproval from the Lord. The brother understands that God disapproves of such a marriage, but because he likes her, he does not want to give her up. As a result, he marries her according to his own will, and he disobeys God&rsquo;s will. Hence, the brother overturned God&rsquo;s authority, and the kingdom of God is not with him. However, if this brother loves the Lord and is willing to obey the inward sense of disapproval from God by discontinuing his courtship, he will acknowledge God&rsquo;s authority and subject himself to God&rsquo;s ruling. As a result, the kingdom of God will be with him.</p>
<p>The emphasis with God&rsquo;s righteousness is on being in accordance with God&rsquo;s ways. For example, yet another brother&rsquo;s marriage may be of God and under God&rsquo;s ruling, and God&rsquo;s kingdom may be with the brother. However, the way in which the wedding is carried out may be full of the fashion and flavor of the world, not according to God&rsquo;s ways. As a result, God will not approve of the brother. Thus, in this matter the brother does not have God&rsquo;s righteousness.</p>
<p>When a worker of the Lord speaks for the Lord, he first needs to submit to the authority of God and confirm whether God is allowing him to speak. If God is not allowing him to speak, he should obey God and not speak. In this way the brother will not rebel against the Lord but rather allow the heavens to rule. The saints will see that the kingdom of God is with him. But even if he speaks for the Lord, he still needs to ask whether he is speaking according to God&rsquo;s ways. Are his attitude, expressions, utterances, and mannerisms compatible with the saints? Or are they exaggerated and inaccurate? If his attitude, expressions, utterances, and mannerisms are not compatible with the saints, but instead are exaggerated and inaccurate, he does not have God&rsquo;s righteousness even though he has God&rsquo;s kingdom.</p>
<p>Our entire living can be measured by God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness. On the one hand, we need to submit to God&rsquo;s authority; on the other hand, we need to be according to God&rsquo;s ways. God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness are indispensable to us. The Lord charged us to seek God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness so that we would allow God to rule in our living and conduct. Then people will see God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness in our practical living.</p>
<p>Many people overturn God&rsquo;s authority and His ways in order to take care of their daily needs of eating, drinking, and clothing. Many believers do not submit to God&rsquo;s authority and ignore God&rsquo;s ways because of their living. In the Lord&rsquo;s eyes these believers are foolish and pitiful; they have forgotten that their heavenly Father is able and willing to supply all their needs. Therefore, the Lord charged us to put God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness first. If we care first for God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness, God will take responsibility for our eating, drinking, and clothing. Some believers do not care about God&rsquo;s kingdom or His righteousness, because they are anxious about eating, drinking, and clothing. Therefore, they see matters related to eating, drinking, and clothing instead of seeing God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness. Some believers seem to not care about their eating, drinking, and clothing, but God adds the things that they need for their living. As a result, these believers fulfill God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness, and they are not lacking in their daily needs of eating, drinking, and clothing.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s word is clear and definite. The children of God do not need to store up treasures on the earth, nor should they serve mammon. If we seek God&rsquo;s kingdom and His righteousness, He will take care of our every need. This is the blessing that God gives to the people of the kingdom of the heavens.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
