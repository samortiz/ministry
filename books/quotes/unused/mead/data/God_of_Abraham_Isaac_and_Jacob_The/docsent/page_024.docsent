   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"THY SEED"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Genesis 15:5 says, "And he brought him forth abroad, and said, Look now toward heaven, and tell the stars, if thou be able to number them: and he said unto him, So shall thy seed be."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The word "seed" refers to his descendant.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is singular, not plural, in number.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is very strange because humanly speaking, if his descendants were to be as numerous as the stars in heaven, "seed" should have been plural.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But when God was telling Abraham of the multiplicity of his descendants, He used the word "seed" in the singular.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Why does He use the singular form of the word?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Who was the one seed?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Galatians 3:16, Paul said, "He does not say, 'And to the seeds,' as concerning many, but as concerning one: 'And to your seed,' who is Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, the seed that God referred to was not many people, but one person.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This person was not Isaac, but Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows us that the One who inherits the land is the one seed.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As far as Abraham was concerned, the seed was Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But in a wider context, the seed is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Isaac was just a shadow; the substance is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In other words, Christ will inherit the land and bless the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Both power and authority are with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's work of recovery is carried out by Christ, not by Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The matter of sonship is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If this matter of sonship and the seed is not settled, no one can carry out God's recovery work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If Abraham was not brought to the point of perfection, he could not have brought in Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Abraham first had to become a vessel before Isaac could be brought in. This means that the glorious Christ will be brought in only when a group of people believe as Abraham believed; only then will God's work be accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Isaac was merely a shadow; the reality is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the same way, Abraham was a shadow; the reality is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Just as Abraham became a vessel to bring in Isaac, so the church is a vessel to bring in the glorious Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God wanted Abraham to become a vessel to bring in Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The descendants of Abraham will fulfill God's purpose; Abraham himself did not fulfill God's purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, the church is nothing in itself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is important is that the church brings in Christ and expresses Christ on earth for the recovery of all God's work on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Abraham was a vessel to bring in Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today the church is a vessel to bring in Christ.</S>
