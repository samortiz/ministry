This is a type of us, God's New Testament elect, who are very much involved with the world in its many aspects. The nations in chapters forty-six through fifty-one typify nine different aspects of the world. Today the world has even more aspects. Jeremiah presents us such a picture so that we can live a church life that is not polluted by the different aspects of the world. We need to know how to have a clear separation from the world and not be wrapped up or mixed with any of its aspects. God will come in to judge the world in all its aspects and to make a clear distinction between the church as His elect and every aspect of the world.</P><P>According to Galatians 6:16, we are today's Israel. Around us are all kinds of aspects of the world. We need to ask ourselves what aspect of the world we are involved with. We may be involved with the desire to help others through humanitarian efforts, or we may be occupied with the enjoyment of worldly amusements. In either case, we are away from God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S VENGEANCE ON BABYLON&#151;<br>HIS NUMBER ONE ENEMY,<br>THE WORST NATION IN OFFENDING GOD</H2><P>Babylon was the nation that destroyed the nation of Israel, the people of Israel, the holy temple of God, the holy city of God, and the holy land of God. In addition, the Babylonian army under Nebuchadnezzar captured the holy vessels, which were used to serve God in the temple. Other people regarded those vessels as something holy, sanctified, and separated unto God and therefore did not dare to touch them. However, Nebuchadnezzar brought a great part of these vessels to Babylon and put them in the temple of his god (Dan. 1:1-2). This insulted God to the uttermost and was the reason that God's verdict on Babylon is described as His vengeance (Jer. 50:15), the "vengeance of Jehovah, the vengeance for His temple" (51:11).</P><P>Babylon was the worst nation in offending God, and its king was one with Satan (Isa. 14:4, 11-15). Babylon, therefore, is God's number one enemy, being both the beginning and the conclusion of human government on earth. Babylon will be thoroughly condemned, punished, and judged by God. God will judge Babylon to such an extent that nothing of Babylon will remain in the universe. Thus, when God destroys the restored religious and political Babylon the Great, He will rid the earth of His number one enemy, which rebels against God, exalts man, and worships idols.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>JEREMIAH PRESENTING GOD'S ECONOMY TO US<br>THAT WE MAY TURN BACK TO OUR SOURCE AND ORIGIN<br>THE TRIUNE GOD AS THE FOUNTAIN OF LIVING WATERS</H2><P>Jeremiah presents God's economy to us that we may turn back to our source and origin, the Triune God as the fountain of living waters (Jer. 2:13). Then we will enjoy Him and will receive His dispensing into us for the accomplishment of His economy. God will then take care to keep the world away from us.</P><P>Today in our church life there should not be anything Babylonian. We should clear away any rebellion against God, any exalting of ourselves, and any worshipping of idols. Then we will be God's elect under His dispensing to enjoy Him. Instead of enjoying Egypt as a good place for our living, we will enjoy the Triune God, and the church life will be our living. In such a situation we will be blessed by God.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_173.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_175.html">Next</a> </body></html>
