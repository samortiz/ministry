(THE PRIESTS)</h2>
<p>In 1:6&mdash;3:4 we have Jehovah&rsquo;s dealing with the sons of Levi, that is, His dealing with the priests.</p>
<h2 class="head2">A. The Degradation of the Priests</h2>
<p>Malachi 1:6-14 is a word regarding the degradation of the priests.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Despising Jehovah&rsquo;s Name and His Table</h2>
<p>The degradation of the priests was seen first in their despising Jehovah&rsquo;s name and His table (vv. 6-7, 12-13a). They cared neither for Jehovah&rsquo;s name nor for the enjoyment of His table.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Presenting to Jehovah<br />
Blemished Offerings</h2>
<p>The priests presented to Jehovah blemished offerings, offerings that were blind, lame, or sick (v. 8). They brought what was stolen, lame, and sick and offered it as a sacrifice (v. 13b). Thus, Jehovah said, &ldquo;Cursed be the deceiver who has in his flock a male, and when he makes a vow, he offers what is blemished to the Lord&rdquo; (v. 14a).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Jehovah&rsquo;s Abhorring of Their Offerings</h2>
<p>Jehovah did not have any joy in receiving their blemished offerings. On the contrary, He abhorred them (vv. 9-10).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. The Greatness of Jehovah&rsquo;s Name<br />
among the Nations</h2>
<p>In verses 11 and 14b we have a word concerning the greatness of Jehovah&rsquo;s name among the nations. In verse 11 He said that His name would be great among the nations, and in verse 14b He declared that His name was feared among the nations.</p>
<h2 class="head2">B. The Priests&rsquo; Breaking of<br />
Jehovah&rsquo;s Commandment and<br />
Their Corrupting of Jehovah&rsquo;s Covenant</h2>
<p>The priests broke Jehovah&rsquo;s commandment and they corrupted Jehovah&rsquo;s covenant. This brought Jehovah&rsquo;s curse to them (2:1-9).</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Treachery of Judah among the Brothers<br />
and Their Profaneness toward Jehovah</h2>
<p>Verses 10 through 12 speak of the treachery of Judah (actually the priests, who lived in Judah and served in Jerusalem) among the brothers and their profaneness toward Jehovah.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Jehovah&rsquo;s Hatred of the Treachery<br />
of Man toward His Wife</h2>
<p>In verses 13 through 17 we see Jehovah&rsquo;s hatred of the treachery of man (mainly referring to the priests) toward his wife.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Treachery of a Priest<br />
toward His Wife Damaging His Priesthood</h2>
<p>Verses 13 and 14 indicate that the treachery of a priest toward his wife damages his priesthood. Probably some of the mistreated wives came and wept at the altar (vv. 13a, 14). Because of this, Jehovah no longer regarded the sacrifices or received them with pleasure from the priests&rsquo; hands (v. 13b). Here we see a very important matter. If a servant of the Lord cannot have a proper life with his wife, his service will be annulled.</p>
<p>Every young person must consider his or her marriage very carefully. All the brothers and sisters are priests. If we cannot live well with our spouse, how can we serve the church? If our married life is improper, our priesthood will be finished; it will be brought to nothing.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_071.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_073.html">Next</a> </body></html>
