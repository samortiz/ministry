   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Jesus as God s Sabbath Rest</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In His economy, God always acts in a gradual way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Firstly, God had Adam and then, gradually, He had Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham with his descendants, and then the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But that was not the end. After this gradual development, Jesus, the second man, came.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When the Lord Jesus was baptized, God was happy and satisfied, saying, This is my beloved Son, in whom I am well pleased Matt 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When God said that He was pleased with His Son, it meant that He was satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time, the Lord Jesus was the Sabbath rest to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Not only did God rest in Him, but so many of those who followed Him also rested in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus was the Sabbath rest to God and His followers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Both God and His followers rested in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>C. The Church, the Enlargement of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>as God s Sabbath Rest</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Church is the enlargement and the expansion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If Christ was God s Sabbath, then how much more extensive should the church be as His Sabbath?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If Israel was God s Sabbath, then the church must be even more of a Sabbath to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If the Lord Jesus in the flesh was God s Sabbath, then the church, the Body of Christ, must be an even greater Sabbath to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although I have heard that when we come to the Lord Jesus we have rest, I have never heard that we also may have rest when we come to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today I want to announce to you the glad tidings that the church is your rest.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No place is as restful as your own home.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Is not the church your home?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the church is your home, then the church must certainly be your rest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is not the church God s house?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since the church is God s house 1 Tim 3:15 , then the church must be God s rest today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In this age, the age of the church, Christ is our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But do you not realize that the church is the enlargement of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If Christ is our rest, then what about the church as the enlargement of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If the individual Christ is our rest, then what about the corporate Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How can we forget the enlarged Christ or neglect the corporate Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Not only is the individual Christ our rest but also the corporate Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only the Head but also the Body is our Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Recently the Lord burdened me, saying, You must go and tell My people that the church is their rest today!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Never have I seen so clearly as in these days that the church is today s Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because the Church Is the New Man</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Let us now consider the reasons why the church today is the Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Firstly, according to Genesis 1 and 2, in order for God to have His Sabbath rest, He must have His expression and representation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, God s Sabbath needs a man in His own image with His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Immediately after the creation of the first man, the old man, God had a Sabbath because God had secured a man to express and represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Should God not also have a rest after the creation of the new man?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church is the new man Eph 2:15; 4:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If God enjoyed a Sabbath rest after the creation of the old man, He must have a greater rest after the creation of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are not in the age of the creation of the old man but in the new age, after the creation of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God has a new Sabbath because He has secured a new man to express and represent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>According to the principle established by the first mention of the Sabbath rest after the creation of man, there must be a new and better Sabbath after the creation of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are in this new Sabbath today.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Because God Rests in the Church</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Secondly, in Deuteronomy 12:9 we are told clearly that the land of Canaan was a rest to Israel because it was a rest to God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The land was God s rest because there He could have His habitation and there He could put His name Deut 12:5, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The name is just the person himself.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When God said that He would put His name there, it meant that He would put Himself there.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When God said that His name would be there, it seemed that He was saying, My name is just Myself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For My name to dwell there means that I shall dwell there.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I shall set Myself there and make My habitation there.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That place will be My dwelling place, and My dwelling place is My rest.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is not the church God s habitation today?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Is it not God s house?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Ephesians 2:22 says that God s habitation is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Ephesians 2:15 mentions the new man and Ephesians 2:22 speaks of God s habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For both the new man and the habitation there should be the Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Is not the church the new man?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As long as the church is the new man, we have the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Is not the church God s habitation?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>As long as the church is the habitation of God, we also have God s rest.</S>
