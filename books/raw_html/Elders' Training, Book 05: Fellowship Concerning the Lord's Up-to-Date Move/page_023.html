<h2 class="head1">DEVELOPING THE SKILL TO BECOME<br />
REPRESENTATIVES OF THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY</h2>
<p>A third big Protestant denomination today is the Church of Christ. Today it is bigger than either the Presbyterian or the Episcopalian denominations. Thirty years ago an American missionary of the Church of Christ who went to Taiwan told me that there were about one million in that denomination. Within thirty years their numbers have at least tripled. The Church of Christ&rsquo;s teachings concerning the church are very similar to ours. However, we cannot go along with their teaching of baptismal regeneration. Although this is a matter merely of doctrinal debate, their insistence on receiving only those who are baptized by them is serious and very sectarian. However, they have become powerful and are very dogmatic in their teaching. The members of the Church of Christ are trained with their teachings. They surely know their points of doctrine and their teachings are very logical. Therefore, those teachings have caught the higher class people because logical people like to know doctrines. Only doctrines can convince logical people. The Pentecostals who go to the campus today get little fruit. No scientific student of today would listen to these Pentecostal things. However, if you go there with the higher gospel, you will catch many.</p>
<p>The Church of Christ members were trained by their church to be their representatives. Once as I was speaking in Texas on the Spirit a woman from the Church of Christ stood up to question me concerning water baptism and to educate me with her Church of Christ doctrine. It is a shame that we have been here for twenty-three years and have given so many messages, but there are so few representatives of the church. Even the elders may have difficulty in speaking concerning the divine Trinity, a major point of the truth. Some of you have received all the messages and have attended the trainings. However, the trainings may have been like a cloud through which you passed for ten days, receiving little of a permanent deposit. Afterwards you may have bought the messages, but perhaps you have never read them. They may simply be on your shelves. How many of the elders could give a message on the Triune God dispensing Himself into the tripartite man from Romans 8? Could you debate with others concerning this? We have many treasures but few salesmen. On the campuses the Church of Christ is prevailing, not in holding meetings, but in catching four or five and forming a small group to study the Bible.</p>
<p>We must have a change. Our weapons are the best, but our skill is not up to the standard of our weapons. Likewise, we do not have the proper strategy. We have to change our strategy to fight the battle, and learn the top skills to use our top weapons. If you dear saints would be faithful to the Lord&rsquo;s up-to-date move by developing the skill to use the top weapons, the Word revealed to us, and by taking the top strategy, within a quarter century we will gain all of America. Not only will you go out to speak, but you will produce many speakers. I hope that the gospel team would produce many new teachers. Those who are converted will be the same as you are after two years. They will speak the high word, the high gospel, the high truth. This will be warmly welcomed by the highly educated people. The truths taught by you will remain solidly as a rock for the seeking Christians to work on, to live on, and to stand upon.</p>
<p>In the Acts the Spirit was working, but the Spirit worked only through the word. The word is the wire of the divine electricity, and the Spirit is the electricity. Actually, the word is the Spirit. The disciples preached the word, they spoke the word, they did everything with the word and eventually Acts says that the word grew and multiplied. I hope that after twenty years all the deep truths which are covered in our printed pages will grow and multiply. This is why I feel very sorrowful that some of you would pick up something else besides the rich word to bring into the Lord&rsquo;s recovery as a part of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. This is a real distraction and a frustration.</p>
<p>I would beg all the leading ones to get themselves into these deeper truths. By this you will become teachers and will be able to teach every saint in your locality to speak the same thing. Forget about being a leader. Forget about maintaining a little empire for your leadership. Do not do this. Just do one thing&mdash;get yourselves into the deeper truths. Then you must teach, in the big meetings and in the small meetings. Help all the saints to experience the same thing. This is what the Lord is depending upon today. Without this, the Lord could not have the victory. Be fully assured that if we would do this, the Holy Spirit would surely agree. He would honor this. If you would like to receive more of the Spirit, do this. You do not need to fast, to pray for the baptism of the Spirit, or to speak in tongues. Forget about these things. Simply go out to speak the high word from the Bible, and the Spirit will honor your speaking. Eventually the word spoken by you will become the Spirit. You will get the Spirit and others will get Him too. I know what I am speaking about. This is the real power.</p>
