 <h1 class="title">PREFACE </h1> 
 <p>Praise the Lord! You are now saved. This surely is the most important thing in your life. You have believed and are baptized. Now you have the life of God and are a beloved child of God. From now on this new life will be in you forever. It will enable you to live out a life full of grace and reality.</p>
 <p>The new life that is in you is like a seed that is sown into the ground. It has sprouted, but now it needs to grow, develop, blossom, and bear fruit before it will express all the riches of the life of God. However, this process of growth requires time and care in watering and cultivating.</p>
 <p>For this purpose we have selected the most important basic truths in the Bible and compiled them into a series of <em>New Life Lessons.</em> These lessons introduce to the new believers the keys to the Christian life and living in a simple, concise, and step-by-step way, with the intention that they will render new believers the proper guidance and help.</p>
 <p>We have the assurance that if you read through these lessons carefully and practice them diligently, you will know this new life more accurately and deeply. In this way, youwill live out a new life that is both spontaneous and overflowing, and will lay a good foundation for the future.</p>

This series of lessons may be used in new believers&#8217; meetings, and it is also quite suitable for use in small meetings or private fellowship.</p><h1 class="title">ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</h1>
<p>We are God&rsquo;s children. The salvation which we received from the Lord is precious and secure. This salvation was received at the moment we believed, and it will never be lost. Once we are saved, we are eternally saved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. KNOWING THAT YOU ARE SAVED</h2>
<h2 class="head1">BY BELIEVING</h2>
<p>John 6:47 says:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, he who believes in Me has eternal life.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<h2 class="head1">BY CALLING</h2>
<p>Romans 10:13 says:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;For, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<h2 class="head1">BY BEING BAPTIZED</h2>
<p>Mark 16:16 says:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo;</strong></p>
<p>Since you have <strong>believed, called,</strong> and been <strong>baptized,</strong> by the Word of God you can <strong>know</strong> assuredly that you are saved.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE ASSURANCE OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>Not only can we know about our salvation, but we can be assured of it as well.</p>
<h2 class="head2">* SAVED AT THE MOMENT WE BELIEVED</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and will not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life.&rdquo;</strong>  John 5:24</p>
<h2 class="head2">* WE CAN KNOW THAT WE ARE SAVED</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I write these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life.&rdquo;</strong> 1 John 5:13</p>
<h2 class="head2">* HOW TO KNOW THAT WE ARE SAVED</h2>
<h2 class="head2">1. THE INNER WITNESS&mdash;<br />
THE SPIRIT OF GOD</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 8:16</p>
<p>No wonder that when we call our God &ldquo;Abba, Father!&rdquo; we feel so natural and sweet.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And because you are sons, God sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father!&rdquo;</strong> Galatians 4:6</p>
<h2 class="head2">2. THE OUTER WITNESS&mdash;<br />
THE WORD OF GOD</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I write these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe in the name of the Son of God.&rdquo;</strong>   1 John 5:13</p>
<p>The words of the Bible are the title deed of our eternal salvation. They are our guarantee and surety. This is like buying a house. After you make your payment you obtain the &ldquo;title deed,&rdquo; and the house is yours. It is not a matter of feeling or opinion, but an accomplished fact.</p>
<h2 class="head2">3. THE PROOF OF<br />
THE EXPERIENCE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>(1) Loving the brothers</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;We know that we have passed out of death into life, because we love the brothers.&rdquo;</strong> 1 John 3:14</p>
<p>(2) Feeling sorry about our sins</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And if anyone sins, we have an Advocate with the Father, Jesus Christ the Righteous.&rdquo;</strong> 1 John 2:1</p>
<p>It is possible for regenerated believers to sin if they do not live by the divine life. When we sin, our fellowship with God is broken, and we will feel darkened, uneasy, and sorry.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE SECURITY OF SALVATION</h2>
<p>Our salvation is secure, because this salvation is safeguarded by:</p>
<p>1. THE LOVE OF GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Having loved His own who were in the world, He loved them to the uttermost.&rdquo;</strong>   John 13:1</p>
<p>The love with which God loves us is an eternal love; it is a love that loves us to the uttermost. It will not cease regardless of our condition.</p>
<p>2. THE POWER OF GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.&rdquo;</strong>   John 10:28</p>
<p>The hand of God is a mighty hand. It will keep us from falling.</p>
<p>3. THE REDEMPTION OF CHRIST</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;He is able to save to the uttermost those who come forward to God through Him.&rdquo;</strong>  Hebrews 7:25</p>
<p>The Lord lives forever, and He will save us to the uttermost. After we are saved, although our feeling and condition may change, the fact and position of our salvation will never change. Once we are saved we are <strong>eternally saved, eternally perfected, and will not perish eternally.</strong></p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. THE RESULT OF SALVATION&mdash;<br />
CLEARANCE OF THE PAST</h2>
<p>After a believer is saved, he should spontaneously terminate the things of the past. This is the practice of a believer who is clearly saved.</p>
<p>1. FORSAKING THE IDOLS</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;You turned to God from idols to serve a living and true God.&rdquo;</strong> 1 Thessalonians 1:9</p>
<p>Any idols or things related to idols must be thoroughly dealt with.</p>
<p>2. DESTROYING THE EVIL AND<br />
DEMONIC THINGS</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And a considerable number of those who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them before all.&rdquo;</strong>   Acts 19:19</p>
<p>All inappropriate items and improper books, pictures, and apparatuses should be properly dealt with.</p>
<p>3. RESTORING TO OTHERS WHAT WE OWE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor; and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusations, I restore four times as much.&rdquo;</strong>   Luke 19:8</p>
<p>Whatever we have obtained by way of extortion, cheating, stealing, or any other improper means must be returned or dealt with.</p>
<p>4. TERMINATING THE OLD WAY OF LIFE</p>
<p>We must pray to the Lord concerning our past conduct, behavior, and way of living. Anything that does not correspond to the grace of our calling, or anything that is not fitting for saints, should be terminated.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Walk worthily of the calling with which you were called.&rdquo;</strong>   Ephesians 4:1</p>
<p>Praise the Lord that at the start of your new life you can know clearly that you are definitely saved and be led to have a clear termination of your past so that you can have an entirely new living.</p><h1 class="msg">PRAYER</h1>
<p>To God, prayer is the channel through which God accomplishes His work on the earth. To a Christian, it is the means by which he contacts and absorbs God.</p>
<p>The purpose of this lesson is to help you to become a person of prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE MEANING OF PRAYER</h2>
<p>1. PRAYER IS THE CHARACTERISTIC<br />
OF THE CHURCH LIFE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.&rdquo;</strong>   Acts 2:42</p>
<p>After the early believers received the gospel and were baptized, they began to practice a life of prayer.</p>
<p>2. PRAYER IS THE CHARACTERISTIC<br />
AND INNATE ABILITY OF THE LIFE<br />
OF A CHRISTIAN</p>
<p>The life of a Christian bears a characteristic that it wants to pray and is able to pray. Prayer is the natural function of this life, just as <strong>breathing and speaking</strong> are natural functions of the human life.</p>
<p>3. PRAYER IS THE MEANS BY WHICH MAN CONTACTS GOD AND ABSORBS GOD</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE KEY TO PRAYER</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality.&rdquo;</strong>  John 4:24</p>
<p>If the meaning of prayer is to contact God, breathe in God, and obtain God, and if God Himself is Spirit, then our prayer should not be in the mind, emotion, or will; rather, it should be in the <strong>spirit.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But you, beloved, building up yourselves in your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</strong>  Jude 20</p>
<p style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/0736318194_02.jpg" width="266" height="129" border="0" alt="" /></p>
<p>We can learn to pray all the time in our spirit for the church, for our friends and relatives, and for our community and our nation.</p>
<p>The whole world is drifting away from God, and we are living in the midst of it. The only thing that will join us continually to God is <strong>prayer.</strong> Only this will make us <strong>those who stand against the tide</strong> of this perverted world.</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. THE PRACTICE OF PRAYER</h2>
<p>1. THE TIME OF PRAYER</p>
<p>The practical way to pray is to set aside a definite time (morning, afternoon, or evening) for prayer. After you have made this decision, you should keep that time every day, and each time should last at least ten minutes.</p>
<p>2. THE VOICE IN PRAYER</p>
<p>Private prayer should always be audible; you should be able to hear your own prayer. Silent prayers will not last long; your mind will tend to drift away.</p>
<p>3. THE POSTURE IN PRAYER</p>
<p>Should you be standing, sitting, or kneeling? Should your eyes be open or closed? Should you lift up your head or bow down your head? Should your hands be folded together or otherwise? There is no set posture for prayer. The main thing is to be concentrated, sincere, and with the proper exercise of the spirit.</p>
<p>4. FAITH IN PRAYER</p>
<p>The most important thing with respect to faith is that one must be simple. Do not analyze; rather, believe the Word of God in a simple way, and believe that God hears our prayers and accepts them.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Without faith it is impossible to be well-pleasing to Him; for he who comes forward to God must believe that He is, and that He is a rewarder of those who seek Him out.&rdquo;</strong>  Hebrews 11:6</p>
<p>5. HELP FOR PRAYER</p>
<h2 class="head2">(1) Pray-reading</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And receive...the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition.&rdquo;</strong>   Ephesians 6:17-18a</p>
<p>To take a verse or two and pray over them will help us very much to return to our spirit and will uplift our spirit of prayer. At the same time, when our prayers are based upon the Word of God and we pray with the Word of God, we will have full assurance concerning the will of God and will have the confidence that God hears our prayers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">(2) Singing</h2>
<p>Hymns contain many delicate spiritual feelings. They can help us very much to turn to our spirit and to touch the feeling of the Lord. They will develop our burden for prayer, and will deliver us from the entanglement of the thoughts.</p>
<p>6. PARTNERS IN PRAYER</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;If two of you agree on earth concerning anything, whatever they may ask, it shall come to them from My Father who is in the heavens.&rdquo;</strong>  Matthew 18:19</p>
<p>To have a prayer partner not only will help us to pray better, but also will sustain our prayer life.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE BASIS OF PRAYER</h2>
<p>Prayer is not based upon our condition, behavior, or anything of ourselves, but upon:</p>
<p>1. THE BLOOD OF THE LORD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Having therefore, brothers, boldness for entering the Holy of Holies by the blood of Jesus.&rdquo;</strong>  Hebrews 10:19</p>
<p>Only the <strong>blood of the Lord</strong> can satisfy God&rsquo;s righteous demands and can <strong>cleanse us</strong> that we may draw near to God with boldness.</p>
<p>2. THE NAME OF THE LORD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;If you ask Me anything in My [the Lord&rsquo;s] name, I will do it.&rdquo;</strong>   John 14:14</p>
<p>Our prayer must be in <strong>the Lord&rsquo;s name;</strong> this means that we must pray by depending on the Lord and by being <strong>joined to the Lord.</strong> Only then will we gain God Himself.</p>
<p>When we rely on the Lord&rsquo;s blood and are joined to the Lord&rsquo;s holy name, we will have a conscience void of offense. In this way our prayers will be unhindered.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Let us come forward to the Holy of Holies with a true heart in full assurance of faith, having our hearts sprinkled from an evil conscience.&rdquo;</strong>  Hebrews 10:22</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE SIMPLEST WAY TO PRAY&mdash;<br />
CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>To call on the name of the Lord is:</p>
<p>1. TO CALL &ldquo;O LORD JESUS!&rdquo;</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him. For, Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 10:12-13</p>
<p>2. SPIRITUAL BREATHING</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I called upon thy name, O Lord, out of the low dungeon. Thou hast heard my voice: hide not thine ear at my breathing, at my cry.&rdquo;</strong> Lamentations 3:55-56</p>
<p>We breathe out our burdens, sorrows, and sins, and we breathe in the Lord&rsquo;s strength, comfort, salvation, and rest.</p>
<h2 class="head2">* HOW TO CALL</h2>
<p><strong>(1) Call out of a pure heart</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;If I regard iniquity in my heart, the Lord will not hear me.&rdquo;</strong>  Psalm 66:18</p>
<p><strong>(2) Call with the saints</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.&rdquo;</strong>  2 Timothy 2:22</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE BLESSINGS OF PRAYER</h2>
<p>There are many blessings from God to the person who prays:</p>
<p>1. PRAYERS BEING ANSWERED</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.&rdquo;</strong> Matthew 7:7</p>
<p>2. RECEIVING THE GRACE OF GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Let us therefore come forward with boldness to the throne of grace, that we may receive mercy and may find grace for timely help.&rdquo;</strong> Hebrews 4:16</p>
<p>3. RECEIVING THE REVELATION OF GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;That the God of our Lord Jesus Christ, the Father of glory, may give to you a spirit of wisdom and revelation in the full knowledge of Him.&rdquo;</strong> Ephesians 1:17</p>
<p>4. ENJOYING THE PEACE OF GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But in everything, by prayer...and the peace of God, which surpasses all understanding, will guard your hearts and your thoughts in Christ Jesus.&rdquo;</strong> Philippians 4:6-7</p>
<p>Dear saint, after reading through this lesson, does not your heart long to build up your own prayer life?</p>
<p>You may start by practicing this:</p>
<p>I will pray every day from ____ to ____.</p>
<p>I will pray together with _______________ as my prayer partner.</p><h1 class="msg">READING THE BIBLE</h1>
<p>God has given us two great spiritual inheritances: the invisible Holy Spirit within us and the visible Bible in our hand.</p>
<p>This lesson will guide you into the rich treasury which God has prepared for you in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE IMPORTANCE OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;...the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.&rdquo;</strong> 2 Timothy 3:15-16</p>
<p>What God speaks to man today is based on what He has already spoken. Hence, if a believer desires to know God well, he must read the Bible.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;You search the Scriptures, because you think that in them you have eternal life, and it is these that testify concerning Me.&rdquo;</strong>  John 5:39</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is the subject and content of the Bible. The Bible is the explanation and expression of the Lord Jesus. Through the Bible, the Lord Jesus is known and understood by man in a concrete way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. WHAT THE BIBLE IS</h2>
<p>1. THE BIBLE IS THE WORD OF GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Knowing this first, that no prophecy of Scripture is of one&rsquo;s own interpretation; for no prophecy was ever borne by the will of man, but men spoke from God, being borne by the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</strong> 2 Peter 1:20-21</p>
<p>All the words of the Bible are spoken by men being borne by the Holy Spirit, just as a sailboat is propelled forward by the wind.</p>
<p>These words of the Bible explain:</p>
<p class="indent1"><strong>(1) The Triune God (the Father, Son, and Spirit)</strong></p>
<p class="indent1"><strong>(2) The economy of God</strong>&mdash;a. His plan, b. His work</p>
<p class="indent1"><strong>(3) The creation, fall, and redemption of man</strong></p>
<p class="indent1"><strong>(4) The history of the universe</strong></p>
<p>2. THE BIBLE IS THE REVELATION OF GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;In many portions and in many ways. God, having spoken of old to the fathers in the prophets, has at the last of these days spoken to us in the Son.&rdquo;</strong> Hebrews 1:1-2</p>
<p>The whole Bible is the complete revelation of God; every word and every sentence is inspired by God.</p>
<p>God has spoken, and has revealed Himself.</p>
<p>3. THE BIBLE IS THE BREATH OF GOD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness.&rdquo;</strong>  2 Timothy 3:16</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&rdquo;</strong>  John 6:63b</p>
<p>God is Spirit, and whatever is breathed out by Him must also be spirit. Therefore, the very element and substance of the Bible is <strong>Spirit,</strong> just as <strong>phosphorous</strong> is the basic substance of <strong>matches.</strong></p>
<p>We must use our <strong>spirit</strong> to strike the <strong>Spirit</strong> of the Bible to catch the divine <strong>fire.</strong></p>
<h2 class="head1">III. A SIMPLE INTRODUCTION<br />
TO THE BIBLE</h2>
<h2 class="head2" style="font-weight:normal">* THE BIBLE IS DIVIDED INTO<br />
TWO SECTIONS, THE OLD TESTAMENT<br />
AND THE NEW TESTAMENT</h2>
<p><strong>1. The Old Testament&mdash;</strong>It was written mostly in the Hebrew language. There are altogether 39 books, which took about 1100 years to complete. According to its structure it can be divided into (refer to the list of the books in the Bible):</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) The Pentateuch, consisting of five books</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) History: a total of twelve books</p>
<p class="indent1">(3) Psalms: a total of six books</p>
<p class="indent1">(4) The Prophets: a total of sixteen books</p>
<p><strong>2. The New Testament&mdash;</strong>It was written in Greek. There are altogether 27 books, which took over 50 years to complete. According to its structure it can be divided into: the four Gospels (a total of four books), Acts, the Epistles (a total of twenty-one books), and Revelation.</p><h2 class="head2" style="font-weight:normal">* A KEY VIEW OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p style="text-align:center">
<table border="0" cellspacing="0" cellpadding="4">
<tr><td style="vertical-align:top"><p><strong>GOD</strong> planned and created</p></td><td style="vertical-align:top"><p><strong>SATAN</strong> rebelled and destroyed</p></td></tr>
<tr><td style="vertical-align:top"><p><strong>MAN</strong> fell and became lost</p></td><td style="vertical-align:top"><p><strong>CHRIST</strong> redeemed and built</p></td></tr>
</table></p>
<h2 class="head2" style="font-weight:normal">* THE FOCUS OF THE BIBLE&mdash;<br />
CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;This mystery is great, but I speak with regard to Christ and the church.&rdquo;</strong>  Ephesians 5:32</p>
<p>The focus of the Old Testament&mdash;leading to Christ for redemption.</p>
<p>The focus of the New Testament&mdash;the church redeemed and built up in Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. ATTITUDE IN READING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>1. TO CONTACT GOD HIMSELF</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;You search the Scriptures...and you are not willing to come to Me [the Lord] that you may have life.&rdquo;</strong>  John 5:39-40</p>
<p>2. TO RECEIVE THE SUPPLY OF LIFE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Thy words were found, and I did eat them; and thy word was unto me the joy and rejoicing of mine heart.&rdquo;</strong> Jeremiah 15:16</p>
<p>3. TO RECEIVE ENLIGHTENMENT</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The entrance of thy words giveth light; it giveth understanding unto the simple.&rdquo;</strong>  Psalm 119:130</p>
<p>Therefore, every time you open up the Word of God, you should pray from the depth of your being:</p>
<p>O God, I am coming to read Your Word.<br />
I am coming to You,<br />
to contact Yourself;<br />
my heart longs for You,<br />
my spirit is also open to You,<br />
that I may be enlightened by Your Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">V. THE BEST WAY TO READ THE BIBLE&mdash;<br />
PRAY-READING</h2>
<p>Take in the Word of God by means of prayer, letting your reading and your praying be mingled together as one.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And receive the helmet of salvation, and the sword of the Spirit which is the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition.&rdquo;</strong>  Ephesians 6:17-18a</p>
<p>The best way to pray-read is to practice it together with other saints.</p>
<p>Four Keys:</p>
<p><strong>Quick!</strong> Do not hesitate.</p>
<p><strong>Short!</strong> Do not compose.</p>
<p><strong>Real!</strong> Be genuine, not pretending.</p>
<p><strong>New!</strong> Be fresh, not old.</p>
<h2 class="head1">VI. THE PRACTICE<br />
OF READING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>1. READ DAILY</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;They received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily, to see whether these things were so.&rdquo;</strong> Acts 17:11</p>
<p>2. READ CONSECUTIVELY&mdash;read both the Old Testament and the New Testament each time.</p>
<p>3. READ AT MOST ONE CHAPTER AT A TIME (IN PRINCIPLE)</p>
<p>4. LEARN TO PICK UP THE FACTS AND THE MAIN POINTS</p>
<p>5. MEMORIZE THE PRECIOUS VERSES</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly, in all wisdom...&rdquo;</strong>  Colossians 3:16a</p>
<p>6. MUSE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But his delight is in the law of the Lord; and in his law doth he meditate [muse] day and night.&rdquo;</strong>  Psalm 1:2</p>
<h2 class="head1">VII. THE MOST VALUABLE AID<br />
IN READING THE BIBLE&mdash;<br />
The Recovery Version<br />
of the Bible<br />
with the Life-study Messages</h2>
<p>The four functions of the Life-study messages are:</p>
<ol class="decimal" style="font-weight:bold">
<li>To release the truths</li>
<li>To supply life&mdash;<span class="normal">life-study means to study in life</span></li>
<li>To solve difficult problems in the Bible</li>
<li>To open up the treasures in the Bible chapter by chapter</li>
</ol>
<h2 class="head1">VIII. THE BLESSINGS<br />
OF READING THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>God has many blessings of life, most of which are received through man&rsquo;s reading of the Bible. Among them the main blessings are:</p>
<p>1. ENLIGHTENMENT</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Thy word is a lamp unto my feet, and a light unto my path.&rdquo;</strong>  Psalm 119:105</p>
<p>2. NOURISHMENT</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow unto salvation.&rdquo;</strong>  1 Peter 2:2</p>
<p>After reading through this lesson, you must be eager to become one who reads the Bible and knows God. If you do not yet have a plan and a life of reading the Bible, we hope that by the grace of the Lord you will make a resolution that from now on you will practice the following:</p>
<p class="indent1">Spend twenty minutes every day in the Word.</p>
<p class="indent1">Read one chapter in the Old Testament and one in the New Testament.</p>
<p class="indent1">Pray-read one verse.</p>
<p>If you would take care of the Bible given by God in this way, in time you will reap the highest blessings of life.</p><h1 class="msg">MEETING</h1>
<h2 class="head2">MEETING IS THE LIFE PULSE<br />
OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE AND<br />
THE CENTER OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<h2 class="head1">I. THE IMPORTANCE OF MEETING</h2>
<p>1. MEETING IS THE LORD&rsquo;S COMMAND</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another.&rdquo;</strong> Hebrews 10:25</p>
<p>&ldquo;Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together&rdquo; is the Bible&rsquo;s command, as well as God&rsquo;s command to His children.</p>
<p>If we cease <strong>meeting</strong> together, we interrupt the <strong>church life,</strong> because our meeting life is the church life. Meeting is to a Christian as water is to a fish, air to a bird, and breathing to a man.</p>
<p>2. MEETING IS THE CHARACTERISTIC<br />
OF CHRISTIANS</p>
<p>Christians, like sheep and bees,<br />
like to flock together.<br />
Since meeting is a demand of our inner life,<br />
it must be our way of living.</p>
<p>For this reason, not only must we meet often, but we must meet to such an extent that it becomes a habit, thus producing a <strong>meeting life.</strong></p>
<p>It is like the need to eat and drink daily in the human life.</p>
<p>3. RECEIVING THE CORPORATE GRACE IN THE MEETINGS</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s grace to man is twofold:</p>
<p class="indent1">The individual side&mdash;through one&rsquo;s own reading of the Bible, praying, seeking, and fellowshipping with God.</p>
<p class="indent1">The corporate side&mdash;through meeting together.</p>
<p>For example:</p>
<p>(1) Bible reading: The light we receive when we read the Bible by ourselves is limited, but in the meetings it is abundant.</p>
<p>(2) Prayer: Many matters that cannot be solved by individual prayers are readily solved by corporate prayers.</p>
<p>(3) Spiritual problems: Weaknesses and problems that are insurmountable individually are taken care of many times in the meetings.</p>
<p>(4) The Lord&rsquo;s presence: It was during a meeting that the Lord appeared to the disciples on the night of His resurrection.</p>
<p>All these blessings are given to us by the Lord in the meetings and only in the meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE KINDS OF MEETINGS</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.&rdquo;</strong>  Acts 2:42</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And day by day, continuing steadfastly with one accord in the temple and breaking bread from house to house...&rdquo;</strong>  Acts 2:46</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ.&rdquo;</strong>  Acts 5:42</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;How I did not shrink from declaring to you anything that was profitable, and to teach you publicly and from house to house.&rdquo;</strong>  Acts 20:20</p>
<p>The New Testament shows us that there are two kinds of church meetings, each having its function:</p>
<p>1. <strong>The big meetings:</strong> educational, as in a school</p>
<p>(1) Releasing the truth, supplying life</p>
<p>(2) Expounding the Bible, teaching the truths</p>
<p>Goal: That all the saints may know the truths and may live in God&rsquo;s New Testament economy</p>
<p>2. <strong>The home meetings:</strong> Home nurturing, as in a family</p>
<p>Method:</p>
<p>(1) Continuing in the apostles&rsquo; teaching and fellowship</p>
<p>(2) Breaking bread to remember the Lord</p>
<p>(3) Praying&mdash;calling on the Lord</p>
<p>(4) Preaching the gospel</p>
<p>(5) Speaking the truth</p>
<p>Functions:</p>
<p>(1) Upholding the saints&mdash;shepherding and caring for them</p>
<p>(2) Recovering the ones who have not been coming to the meetings&mdash;seeking and contacting them</p>
<p>(3) Bringing in the new ones&mdash;preaching the gospel to relatives, friends, and neighbors</p>
<p>Thus we can see that the home meetings are <strong>the foundation of the building of the church.</strong></p>
<p><strong>The heaven and the earth may pass away, but the home meetings must not be forsaken.</strong></p><h2 class="head1">III. THE CONTENT OF THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>1. CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;To...all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place.&rdquo;</strong> 1 Corinthians 1:2</p>
<p>Calling on the Lord&rsquo;s name is a sign of the believers in Christ.</p>
<p>2. SINGING AND PRAISING</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord.&rdquo;</strong>  Ephesians 5:19</p>
<p>A normal meeting life should be one that is overflowing with singing and praising.</p>
<p>3. PRAYING AND SUPPLICATING</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And they were continuing steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of the bread and the prayers.&rdquo;</strong>  Acts 2:42</p>
<p>Prayer is our cooperation with the Lord in the heavens to execute God&rsquo;s New Testament economy on earth.</p>
<p>4. TEACHING THE BIBLE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;They received the word with all eagerness, examining the Scriptures daily.&rdquo;</strong>  Acts 17:11</p>
<p>The purpose of teaching the Bible in the meetings is that all may come to know the truth and receive the life supply.</p>
<p>5. EXERCISING THE GIFTS</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us exercise them accordingly.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 12:6</p>
<p>Every believer has God-given gifts. Every one should enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s grace and function for the building of the church.</p>
<p>In all the activities in the meetings, Christ should be the center. He is the living Spirit. When we meet together, we should exercise our heart and our spirit and open our mouths to enjoy Him.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IV. FUNCTIONING IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Now you are the body of Christ, and members in particular.&rdquo;</strong> 1 Corinthians 12:27</p>
<p>The church is the Body of Christ, and the meetings are a manifestation of the function of this Body. Since every believer is a member of the Body of Christ, he should learn to participate and function in the church meetings.</p>
<p>1. EXHIBITING AND SHARING CHRIST WITH OTHERS</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation. Let all things be done for building up.&rdquo;</strong>  1 Corinthians 14:26</p>
<p>Before coming to the meetings, we should have some experiences of the Lord, some enjoyment from His Word, or some words received from the Lord through our fellowshipping with Him in prayer. We should bring all these to the meetings to share with others that they may receive the benefit, and the Lord may get the glory and be satisfied.</p>
<p>This is like the feast of tabernacles celebrated by the ancient Israelites. They brought the rich produce, the harvest of their labor on the good land, to the feast to offer to God. There they enjoyed fellowship with the Lord and with one another.</p>
<p>2. PROPHESYING</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Desire earnestly...that you may prophesy.&rdquo;</strong>  1 Corinthians 14:1</p>
<p>To prophesy is to speak for the Lord and to speak forth the Lord. It is also to minister Christ to others.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;For you can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn and all be encouraged. And the spirits of prophets are subject to prophets.&rdquo;</strong>  1 Corinthians 14:31-32</p>
<p>We are not like the prophets in the Old Testament who had to wait for the Spirit of Jehovah to fall upon them before they could prophesy. Today the Lord has become the Spirit, and this Spirit has been mingled with our spirit. Not only so, this spirit is also subject to us. Hence, we do not have to <strong>wait</strong> for the Spirit to fall upon us. Rather, we should just <strong>exercise</strong> our spirit to practice <strong>speaking the word of God</strong> in the meetings.</p>
<p>3. LEARNING TO COORDINATE</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Teaching and admonishing one another.&rdquo;</strong>  Colossians 3:16</p>
<p>To speak in the meetings, we must learn to follow the spirit of the meeting, to coordinate with one another, and to strengthen one another.</p>
<p>Now you see the importance of the meetings and understand what a proper meeting life is and how to function in the meetings.</p>
<p>From now on you need to have a proper daily life, that is, to walk according to the spirit. In addition, you should attend a few church meetings regularly, and <strong>exercise</strong> to function in the meetings.</p>
<p>In this way you will surely live a proper Christian life and church life.</p>
<p>We would like to know:</p>
<p class="indent1">Are you presently attending a home meeting?</p>
<p class="indent1">Which kind of meeting do you like the best?</p><h1 class="msg">PREACHING THE GOSPEL</h1>
<p>The greatest commission God has given to us is to preach the gospel. This was the Lord&rsquo;s final charge after His resurrection at the time of His ascension.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations.&rdquo;</strong>  Matthew 28:19</p>
<h2 class="head1">I. WHAT IS PREACHING THE GOSPEL?</h2>
<p>1. BEING THE LORD&rsquo;S WITNESSES</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;You shall be My [the Lord&rsquo;s] witnesses both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea and Samaria, and unto the remotest part of the earth.&rdquo;</strong>  Acts 1:8</p>
<p>The believers are those who know the Lord and have received Him. As such they are the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses.</p>
<p>2. BEARING FRUIT</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I [the Lord] am the vine, you are the branches; he who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit.&rdquo;</strong>  John 15:5</p>
<p>Every saved person is a branch in the true vine, which is the Lord Himself. The sole responsibility of a branch is to bear fruit. Hence, preaching the gospel is the result of the overflow of the inner life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">II. THE SECRET OF PREACHING<br />
THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>1. BE BURDENED</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I am debtor both to Greeks and to barbarians, both to wise and to foolish. So, as far as depends on me, I am ready to preach the gospel to you.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 1:14-15</p>
<p>We are all debtors in the gospel. To a certain extent we are all indebted to our relatives, friends, and schoolmates in the gospel.</p>
<p>2. HAVE THE SPIRIT OF THE GOSPEL</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;That I might by all means save some.&rdquo;</strong>  1 Corinthians 9:22</p>
<p>Concerning our debt in the gospel we need to <strong>pray much</strong> to kindle the fire of the gospel, that we would love men and be concerned for the sinners&rsquo; salvation.</p>
<p>3. BE BOLD</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;To make known in boldness the mystery of the gospel.&rdquo;</strong>  Ephesians 6:19</p>
<p>Only those who are burning in spirit and have no self-consciousness can preach the gospel for the Lord. For this reason we must exercise ourselves not to be ashamed and be bold to testify for the Lord.</p>
<p>4. SPEAK</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;For we cannot but speak the things which we saw and heard.&rdquo;</strong>  Acts 4:20</p>
<p>Preaching the gospel depends on the testimony of our daily life, and it also depends on the preaching of the word. The reason for this is:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;How then shall they call upon Him in whom they have not believed? And how shall they believe in Him of whom they have not heard? And how shall they hear without one who preaches?&rdquo;</strong>   Romans 10:14</p>
<p>Man&rsquo;s faith comes by hearing the word of the Lord. But his hearing the word of the Lord depends on someone&rsquo;s speaking.</p>
<p>Hence, to preach the gospel is not only to bring people to hear the gospel, but also to speak to them. Only by speaking continually will the gospel be spread. Furthermore, the more you speak, the more your daily walk will be changed.</p>
<p>5. HAVE FAITH</p>
<p>Regardless to whom, at what time, or in what place we preach, we must have faith to believe that:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;It [the gospel] is the power of God unto salvation to every one who believes.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 1:16</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;[God] desires all men to be saved and come to the full knowledge of the truth.&rdquo;</strong>  1 Timothy 2:4</p>
<h2 class="head1">III. BEING EQUIPPED<br />
FOR GOSPEL PREACHING</h2>
<p>1. KNOW THE BIBLE WELL</p>
<p>Memorize some suitable and effective verses, such as:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;And what if He [God] should make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory?&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 9:23</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo;</strong>  1 Corinthians 15:45b</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;He who has the Son has the life.&rdquo;</strong> 1 John 5:12</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But whoever drinks of the water that I shall give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I shall give him shall become in him a spring of water welling up into eternal life.&rdquo;</strong> John 4:14</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;But as many as received Him, to them He gave authority to become children of God, to those who believe in His name.&rdquo;</strong>  John 1:12</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;That if you confess with your mouth, Lord Jesus, and believe in your heart that God has raised Him from among the dead, you shall be saved.&rdquo;</strong>  Romans 10:9</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved.&rdquo;</strong>  Mark 16:16</p>
<p>2. READ MORE BOOKS ON THE TRUTHS OF THE GOSPEL</p>
<p>There are three basic books. They are: (1) <em>The Basic Truths of the Bible (Vol. 1),</em> (2) <em>Gospel Outlines,</em> and (3) <em>How to Lead Different Kinds of People to Receive the Gospel.</em> In addition, other gospel booklets such as <em>There Is a God</em> and <em>The Mystery of Human Life</em> are also very practical.</p>
<p>3. FAMILIARIZE YOURSELF WITH TWO KINDS OF HYMNS</p>
<p class="indent1">(1) <strong>Gospel hymns,</strong> such as hymn 1068, &ldquo;Oh, the love that sought me!&rdquo; and hymn 1024, &ldquo;You need Jesus!&rdquo;</p>
<p class="indent1">(2) <strong>Hymns on assurance of salvation,</strong> such as hymn 309, &ldquo;Since Jesus came into my heart,&rdquo; and hymn 322, &ldquo;Drinking at the fountain that never runs dry.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The best way to preach the gospel to others is by singing. When we sing with overflowing joy, it is difficult for others not to be attracted and moved.</p>
<p>4. USE GOSPEL TRACTS</p>
<p>Gospel tracts are not limited by time or space, for they can be distributed everywhere, and they are a very convenient means of helping people to be saved.</p>
<p>Since we have these tools for preaching the gospel, we should equip ourselves with them properly and utilize them skillfully to preach more.</p><h2 class="head1">IV. THE PRACTICE OF PREACHING<br />
THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>1. PRAY&mdash;BRINGING PEOPLE TO GOD</p>
<p>First, make a list of all the names of relatives, friends, schoolmates, colleagues, and contacts for whom the Lord has burdened you. Then pray for them one by one until they are saved.</p>
<h2 class="head2">* PRAY IN FAITH</h2>
<p>Faith is to receive God&rsquo;s promise without doubting during our prayer. Since it is God who desires that we pray, He has to answer our prayers. He said:</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Ask and it shall be given to you; seek and you shall find; knock and it shall be opened to you.&rdquo;</strong>  Matthew 7:7</p>
<p>2. PREACH&mdash;BRINGING GOD TO MAN</p>
<p><strong>(1) The principle</strong></p>
<p>The principle of preaching the gospel is to spread from Jerusalem to the remotest part of the earth, from the center to the circumference. For this reason, our preaching should start with our close relatives and friends and continue to spread out.</p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Go to your house, to your own people, and report to them the things the Lord has done to you, and how He has had mercy on you.&rdquo;</strong>  Mark 5:19</p>
<p>Please remember these points:</p>
<ol class="lower-alpha">
<li>Continue in a spirit of prayer.</li>
<li>Have a sincere and earnest attitude.</li>
<li>Present the truth wisely.</li>
<li>Avoid unnecessary debates.</li>
</ol>
<p><strong>(2) Preach in season and out of season</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;Preach the word; be ready in season and out of season; reprove, rebuke, exhort, with all longsuffering and teaching.&rdquo;</strong>  2 Timothy 4:2</p>
<p>Whenever an opportunity arises and you meet some people, you should follow the inner feeling and speak to them.</p>
<p><strong>(3) Distribute tracts</strong></p>
<p>Keep gospel tracts handy and pass them out at every opportunity.</p>
<p><strong>(4) Contact people regularly</strong></p>
<p>Schedule appropriate times, preferably one to two hours a week, for contacting people and preaching the gospel.</p>
<p><strong>(5) Invite people to come to hear the gospel</strong></p>
<p>By means of phone calls, letters, or invitations, contact at scheduled times those for whom you pray according to the list you made, inviting them to some meetings. You can also give them some Bibles, gospel booklets, or tracts.</p>
<p>Dear saint, since you have believed in the Lord, don&rsquo;t you desire to be the Lord&rsquo;s witness?</p>
<p>Put down twelve names of your close relatives, friends, and schoolmates:</p>
<p>      </p>
<p>      </p>
<p>      </p>
<p>      </p>
<p>      </p>
<p>      </p>
<p>If you will pray for them with faith and persevere in preaching the gospel, in due time you will bear fruit and glorify God.</p></body></html>
