   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HOW TO LEAD THE PRACTICE OF FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us speak briefly to the leading ones concerning how to lead the meeting for the practice of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we want to lead new believers into this kind of fellowship, we must first tell them all the main points.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not speak too much at one time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should save considerable time to allow them to ask questions.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes we can ask them to repeat what has been spoken to be sure they understand and are clear concerning those points.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Each point should be discussed in detail so that everyone can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After they are clear concerning the main points, we should ask them to commit to begin practicing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should ask, Brother So-and-so, how many minutes do you plan to use each day to practice, ten minutes or fifteen?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should discuss their schedule with them and give them suggestions, helping them to set aside a suitable time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The time should not be too early or too late, nor too long or too short.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a good way to fellowship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may ask, Brother, what time do you go to work?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What are the things you need to do at home?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He may respond, I am a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I go to work at eight o clock every morning.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Since there are things to be done at home in the morning, I cannot set aside a time in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is no way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In that case, we must help him find another time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must lead him in this way and help others one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, we should not get into unnecessary details or be too rigid.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Once we get into unnecessary details in the meeting or we are too rigid, everyone will lose interest.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must do this in a lively way, helping them one by one to set aside a time and promise to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should help them in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should reserve eight to ten minutes before the end of the meeting to ask them to pray for the Lord s blessing to carry out what they have purposed to do in order that they can learn to pray and fellowship with the Lord from that day onward.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is still a need at the beginning of the next meeting to ask them about the main points spoken in the previous meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we need to ask them whether they have practiced according to their schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they are practicing, we should ask them to give a testimony to see if they have encountered any difficulties or problems.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There may not be the opportunity to cover more items in this second meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We can review what was spoken in the first meeting concerning fellowship, make adjustments, give explanations and a supplementary word, and answer some questions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After speaking, we need to ask them to continue practicing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I believe it is relatively easy to lead new believers into practical experiences in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This will help them sense that they have a way to go on and a place to bring their questions and receive answers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way, the new believers and those answering questions will benefit, and we can research and pursue our growth together.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, this meeting will serve the purposes of speaking messages, fellowshipping, and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The entire meeting will be living and have God s blessing and presence.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>People will also be able to touch something and learn something.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everyone will have a good taste and will thus be willing to come to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whereas the first points concerning the practice of fellowship are theory, the last points concerning the time, place, and procedures of fellowship require our practice.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In particular, the point concerning prayer being the means of fellowship requires us to lead the brothers and sisters into a practice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It would be good to help the saints to be clear concerning these points over a period of five weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Only if the new believers are brought into such a living will the messages that they hear in the future have any effect on them.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If they do not enter into such a living, we cannot say that the messages they hear will be of no benefit to them, but they must be in fellowship with God in order for the word to have a definite effect on them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, we must concentrate our efforts to bring the brothers and sisters into fellowship, teaching them how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Perhaps not many of the seven or eight thousand brothers and sisters in the church in Taipei live in fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There may not be even three to five hundred saints who fellowship with God daily.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It would be a great thing if we could lead the saints to practice fellowshipping with God so that after a period of time there would be two to three thousand brothers and sisters who daily fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The result of this slow, fine work would be great and unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we want to be quick and use other means, any useful results will come even slower.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, it is worthwhile for the responsible brothers in every local church to pay full attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the one hand, we ourselves need to live in fellowship with more learning and practice.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>On the other hand, we need to try our best to help and lead others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It does not matter if there are only a few brothers and sisters initially.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A large number is not necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As long as we lead the saints in a living, practical, and enjoyable way, the number of saints will increase spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church will also be greatly blessed.</S>
