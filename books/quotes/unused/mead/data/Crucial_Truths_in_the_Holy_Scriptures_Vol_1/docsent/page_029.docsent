   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN CLEANSING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will consider the matter of cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible reveals that cleansing is a blessing in God s salvation that immediately follows forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God not only forgives us but also cleanses us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Forgiveness cancels the punishment of sin, and cleansing erases the trace of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When God forgives us, He spares us from the accountability that is related to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then He cleanses us as if we had never sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is similar to a friend paying all our debts.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although we are now exempt from the responsibility of the debts, the trace of the debts may still be in our record.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If the trace of the debts is obliterated, it will be as if we were never in debt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is God s salvation to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After He forgives us, He cleanses us, and it is as if we never sinned before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE NEED OF CLEANSING</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man s sin has not only made him a sinner with a record of sin before God, but it has also defiled and dirtied him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, man needs not only forgiveness but also cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who can say, I have made my heart clean; / I am pure from my sin?</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The heart of man is filthy, full of sin and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Who has a pure and sinless heart?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There is no one whose heart is pure and sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, there is no one who cleanses his own heart and purifies himself from his sin after his heart has been defiled by sin.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How then can a man...be pure?...How much less a man, a maggot...a worm!</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the people in the world are born of the flesh and are therefore filthy and abominable.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They love sin, they drink wrong like water, and they are like worms existing in filthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>How can such people be counted as clean before God without facing the requirement to be cleansed?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For just as you presented your members as slaves to uncleanness Rom 6:19 .</S>

   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Man s mouth is defiled because his heart is defiled.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since man s heart is full of all kinds of defilement, filthy and defiling things proceed from his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In the lusts of their hearts to uncleanness Rom 1:24 .</S>
