   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE NINE THE SOURCE OF FAITH Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>13, 14</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Faith has a source.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This source is not in the saints but in God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If the source of faith were in the saints, faith would be fragile.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Who could have faith?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many children of God sadly sigh over their lack of great faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some lack not only great faith but even small faith.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We often acknowledge that we have no faith.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We wish for greater faith so that we can trust God and He can perform daily miracles for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We wish for practical faith so that we can commit everything into the hand of God with ease and calmness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"If only we could have greater faith, everything would be fine."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is our wish.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"If only we could have faith like So-and-so, then everything would be all right."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is our word of admiration.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How often have we asked the Lord to increase our faith?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But why do we still lack faith?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Does faith only belong to a certain privileged class of saints?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Is there truly no way for us to obtain greater faith?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There is a way in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But only those who want faith can obtain it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The cry of the saints today is for greater faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But where does greater faith come from?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The saints aspire to have greater faith in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Is this a mistake?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yes, the mistake of saints is that they want to have greater faith in themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They seek faith from the wrong source.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No wonder they never get it!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We all ask ourselves, "Do I have faith?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>"Can I trust God regarding this matter?"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"Is my faith sufficient?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The answers to these questions are always "No" and "I cannot"!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What a great grief it is!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not ask these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are not the source of faith, so we cannot expect ourselves to have greater faith.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we ask ourselves and search, seek, and look within ourselves, the more we feel we have no faith or very little faith!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is the reason for this?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The reason is that we are not the source of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since the source of faith is not within us, we cannot obtain faith if we turn within ourselves to search for it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we must learn a lesson: we are not the source of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we examine ourselves, we cannot see or feel that we have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Word of God tells us what the source of faith really is: "Faith...not of yourselves; it is the gift of God" Eph 2:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This verse of the Bible is more than clear; faith is given to us by God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A similar word is found in Acts 3:16: "The faith which is through Him."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, we know that the source of faith is in God, not in us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This may seem very common, ordinary, and familiar to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But there are not many who really understand the importance of the source of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we really understood that God is the source of our faith, we would never ask ourselves, "Do I have enough faith?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do I have faith?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These questions indicate that we still do not understand that God is the source of our faith, because if we did, we would not ask these questions.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God is the Giver of faith; God is the source of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Nevertheless, the fact that God is the source of faith does not mean merely that He gives faith to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It means that men have faith or increase in faith through God because God is the source of their faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, men have faith or increase in faith because God possesses a nature that makes it easy for men to trust in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It means that we do not have to ask, "Do we have faith?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Is our faith sufficient?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These are not the most important questions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>These questions will keep us in darkness and discouragement.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We should ask, "Is God reliable?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Is God honest?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Is God trustworthy?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Will God break His promises?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Are God's power and love real?"</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Because we always pay attention to ourselves, the more we search, the more we are unable to find our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we pay attention to God, we will find that faith comes spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Faith does not originate in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No wonder faith cannot be found when we examine ourselves!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Faith originates with God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The more we look at God, look to God, and meditate on God, the more we will have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>An illustration may help us understand this teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Once a few brothers came to talk with me about the issue of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They felt that they had too little faith.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But I told them that it was not their faith that was too little, but their God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>If they wanted to have greater faith, they needed to have a greater God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>That day I told them that faith means committing ourselves and our things to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Believing in God means committing ourselves and our things to God and trusting in Him to accomplish these things for us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I asked, "When you commit your things to somebody else, do you ask, Do I have the faith to trust this person?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Is my faith sufficient to trust him?'"</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You never ask these kinds of questions.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Rather, you ask, "Can I trust him?"</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You do not ask, "Do I have faith in him?"</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Suppose you are an owner of a store, and you hire a manager and commit your business entirely to him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When you hired him, you did not ask, "Do I have faith in him?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Is my faith too little?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Do I have to increase my faith in him?"</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Instead, you asked yourself, "Can I trust him?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Is he honest?</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Is he faithful?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Is he reliable?"</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Since he was honest, trustworthy, and reliable, you spontaneously committed your entire business into his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>You did not have to ask yourself if you had faith or if your faith was great or sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Similarly you should trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>You do not have to ask, "Do I have faith?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Is my faith great and sufficient?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>How much more should my faith be increased?"</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>All you have to ask is, "Is God honest?</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Is God faithful?</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Is God reliable?</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Will God regret His promise and break His word?"</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If God is honest, faithful, and reliable, and if He promises and will not repent, then you do not have to search and examine yourselves to see if you have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>You will spontaneously commit yourselves and your things to the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Faith is not something produced from within.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>It is a trust that arises out of the fact that the other party is honest, stable, trustworthy, and reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Therefore, what is lacking is not greater faith but a greater God.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Most of the time, we do not dare commit ourselves and our things to God under the pretext that our faith is too small.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Actually, the reason we do not dare commit ourselves to God is neither the absence of our faith nor the smallness of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Rather, we think that God is not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If God is faithful, why do we not rely on Him?</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If God is trustworthy, why do we not put our trust in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If God is reliable, why do we not depend on Him?</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If God will not break His word, why do we not rely on Him according to His promise?</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We are afraid that our God is muddle-headed, unreliable, dishonest, and always breaking His promises.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This is the reason we do not have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Now is the time for us to confess our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>We know a bank is honest and reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>This is why we deposit our money in it.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We ask if the bank is trustworthy; we do not ask if we have faith in the bank.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>When a baby is in danger, his fear ceases and he is at peace when he just touches his father's hand or mother's face.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>He will not trust anyone else because they are not trustworthy to him.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>He trusts in his parents because they are trustworthy.</S>
