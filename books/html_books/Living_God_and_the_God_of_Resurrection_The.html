<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1> 
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in the Philippines. Chapters 1, 2, 4, 5, and 6 were given in Manila and were published in Chinese in <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> in 1959 and 1960. Chapter 3 has been previously published in English as the booklet <em>The God of Resurrection.</em></p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE LIVING GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Dan. 6:26, 19-22; 3:14-18; Jer. 10:10; Psa. 42:2-3, 10-11; Heb. 3:12; 10:31; 1 Tim. 4:10; 2 Cor. 3:3; Matt. 16:16; Isa. 49:4</h1>
<p>In 1941 and in 1948 I gave messages entitled &ldquo;The Living God.&rdquo; Recently, I have been considering the term <em>the living God;</em> hence, I believe that this title is of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD BEING A LIVING GOD</h2>
<p>The Bible uses many words to describe God. He is the holy God, the righteous God, the loving God, and the mighty God (cf. Heb. 2:11; 1 Pet. 1:15-16; Acts 3:14; 2 Tim. 4:8; 1 John 1:9; 4:8, 16; Matt. 26:64). These different words refer to God&rsquo;s characteristics, His attributes. God&rsquo;s being righteous speaks of His ways, for righteousness is His procedure in doing things. God&rsquo;s being holy speaks of His nature being distinct from everything else; hence, only He is holy. God&rsquo;s being mighty speaks of His power, and God&rsquo;s being love speaks of His heart.</p>
<p>The Bible also calls God the living God (Dan. 6:26; Psa. 42:2; Matt. 16:16; 1 Tim. 4:10; Heb. 10:31). We may understand this to mean that God is living, not dead. However, <em>the living God</em> has a much deeper significance. Our lifetime would not be long enough for us to fully understand and experience the living God.</p>
<p>Even though Christians are persecuted, afflicted, and martyred, the gospel continues to spread, and more believers are gained because Christians believe in and worship a living God. Many people think that being a Christian is mainly a matter of believing doctrines, but according to the Bible, being a Christian is not a matter of joining a religion or believing doctrines. Being a Christian is a matter of knowing and contacting the living God. God made us Christians in order for us to experience Him, testify concerning Him, and express Him as the living God.</p>
<p>Some may say that they already know and believe in the living God, but it is one thing to have knowledge and yet another to have practical experience. It is not easy to experience the living God, testify of the living God, or express the living God. A Christian might be zealous concerning dogma and yet not touch the living God. God does not want us to be Christians who are zealous concerning doctrine; He wants us to experience and express Him as the living God in our daily life. God is pleased when we testify concerning Him as the living God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING A LIVING RELATIONSHIP<br />
WITH THE LIVING GOD</h2>
<p>Every genuine Christian should have a living relationship with the living God. We may consider a person to be a good Christian if he reads the Bible, prays, and attends meetings, but in God&rsquo;s view he may merely be a religious Christian. A genuine Christian interacts with the living God every day and has a living relationship with God because he lives in God and lets God live in him.</p>
<p>There is a sister who loves the Lord and is zealous in her service, but for many years she felt that she was a sinner and that she had not fully given herself to the Lord. She testified that before she was saved, she was her own boss, but now that the living Lord is in her, she must let Him rule in every matter. This testimony shows that she has touched the living God and that He has touched her. It is not a matter of her praying in herself but of the living God leading her in prayer and causing her to sense her sins, to love Him, and to realize that He is ruling within her. This is not a matter of teaching, which gives only knowledge. This sister has touched the living God.</p>
<p>In order to have a living relationship with the living God, we must fellowship with Him in our spirit. We need to communicate with the living God every day and fellowship with Him every moment. When we draw near to Him, He draws near to us (James 4:8), lives in us, and speaks to us. Then He can get involved with our thoughts and actions, and He can touch both our daily walk and our service. He can rule over every item in our living. Although others may be loose in certain matters, we cannot be loose, because the living God does not allow us to be loose.</p>
<p>If we have a living relationship with the living God, we will be able to experience Him in our daily living. A brother may think that he will fall because he has encountered a situation that is beyond what he can bear. However, he discovers that within him there is a surpassing power that enables him to stand. This transcending power is connected to a person, the living God, and it supports the brother, causing him to stand. This power is the living God. We often marvel at and are puzzled by our ability to stand in difficult situations, even though we are so weak. We are able to stand because we are in the living God, and the living God is in us. We have experienced the support of the living God.</p><h2 class="head1">SETTING OUR HOPE ON THE LIVING GOD</h2>
<p>Some saints are afflicted by pain or are suffering great loss. Please remember that our hope is set on the living God. The extent of our difficulties varies. Some are severe, and some are not as severe. Paul says that we have set our hope on the living God (1 Tim. 4:10). The Holy Spirit has given me this feeling concerning the living God in order to strengthen the saints who are suffering.</p>
<p>I have served the Lord for over thirty years. During this time I have encountered many difficulties and suffered much pain. Once, after passing through a great trial, I told an older brother that we are too weak to withstand the trials. Before we pass through a trial, we think that we are strong and capable of withstanding any trial by means of our iron will and sober mind. But once trials befall us, we realize that our strong will is weak, our sober mind is confused, our ability to withstand disappears, and even our faith is lacking. However, even when we feel that we are incapable, our inner being continues to believe. The faith that we experience at these times is not according to our will, mind, or ability. That faith is the living God.</p>
<p>God not only allows turmoils in our environment, He even takes away what we treasure the most&mdash;His presence. We often experience that the more we pray, the more the heavens seem to close; the more we seek the Lord, the farther away He seems; and the more we read the Bible, the more we cannot touch His words. At such times, we must beware of Satan&rsquo;s attacks, lies, and deceit. All our situations are false and unreal. Anything that cannot last forever is false. God can change our situation at any time; hence, we should not set our eyes on our situation but on God. Our hearts should be turned to God because we have set our hope on the living God. Even though we cannot get through when we pray or worship, we must continue to pray and worship. When we are at our weakest point, our worship is the most precious to God. The weak prayers that we utter are pleasing to God. They are sweet to His ears.</p>
<p>However, we must not be superstitious. Sometimes our living Lord lets us suffer because of our wrongdoing. We cannot claim to have faith in Him if we stubbornly remain in our wrongdoing and are not willing to be enlightened and dealt with. Our living God is light, and in Him is no darkness at all (1 John 1:5). He is righteous; righteousness is the foundation of His throne (Psa. 89:14). He is holy, and He wants His people to also be holy (Heb. 2:11; 1 Pet. 1:16). Therefore, He shines on us and convicts us in order for us to accept His judgment, dealing, and correction so that we may walk with Him in the light. The faith that we experience after such an experience is not superstition.</p>
<p>After Daniel was thrown into the lions&rsquo; den, he said to King Darius, &ldquo;My God has sent His angel and has shut the lions&rsquo; mouth, and they have not hurt me, inasmuch as before Him innocence was found in me; and also before you, O king, I have done no harm&rdquo; (Dan. 6:22). Had Daniel been wrong, God would not have shut the lions&rsquo; mouth. Daniel had living faith in the living God because he was restricted by God, and he was guiltless before God and man. Similarly, whenever we fall into difficulties or distressing trials, we should not first seek our deliverance; rather, we should seek His shining. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, I prostrate myself before You and look to You for Your shining.&rdquo; The faith with which we believe in the living God is not superstition. Rather, it is genuine faith that comes from our being shined on, dealt with, and subdued in His hand. Only such faith can enable us to experience the living God in our sufferings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FEARING THE LIVING GOD</h2>
<p>We must learn to fear the living God. We must not be loose; God is not mocked (Gal. 6:7). Two thousand years of church history prove that a Christian who does not fear God will not have a good ending; such a Christian will have a miserable ending. God often lets the Gentiles be, but He is never loose with His children; He is not loose with those who belong to Him. He disciplines us so that we may partake of His holiness. The Bible says, &ldquo;Whom the Lord loves He disciplines, and He scourges every son whom He receives&rdquo; (Heb. 12:6), and it says that judgment begins from the house of God (1 Pet. 4:17). Hence, we must fear God. The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God,&rdquo; and &ldquo;our God is also a consuming fire&rdquo; (Heb. 10:31; 12:29). We belong to the living God. We should not think that He does not see when we are loose or that He does not hear the things we say. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. We must learn to fear Him.</p>
<p>In the fall of 1948 I gave a message concerning God being a living God whom we should fear. In the audience there was an educated brother who loved the Lord, but he sinned against God&rsquo;s government because he did not fear God. The brothers did not know how to help him. Later, this brother died in an accident. It is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God. The living God whom we serve is not mocked. He searches our intentions, thoughts, emotions, and everything about us; nothing can be kept hidden from Him. We must fear Him and know that He is a judging God and that judgment begins from His house. We must fear God in our intentions, thoughts, attitudes, living, and service because He is a living God who is not mocked.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIVING GOD MAKING ALL THINGS MANIFEST</h2>
<p>God is a living God. He does not overlook wickedness or unrighteousness. He not only judges man&rsquo;s condition but also makes man&rsquo;s situation manifest. His judging is for manifesting, and He will make all things manifest (1 Cor. 3:13; Eph. 5:13; 1 Tim. 5:24). Every time He judges something, He makes it manifest. His intention in judging is not to punish and not for man to suffer; His intention is to manifest all things. His manifesting of all things proves that He is a living God. He does not overlook anything. Hence, we must not remain in any condition that is incompatible with His nature. This is one aspect of God&rsquo;s manifesting all things.</p>
<p>There is another aspect to God&rsquo;s manifesting all things. If a man is God-fearing, sooner or later he will be manifested by God. It is not vain to fear God. He knows those who fear Him. In the Old Testament Joseph is an example. He feared God and dared not sin against God. Others falsely accused him and put him in prison (Gen. 39). Eventually, God came to make all things manifest. Joseph was manifested as a God-fearing man and was enthroned (41:38-44). God will manifest our faith and love toward Him. A brother who wants to make a show of his love for God will one day be exposed, that is, made manifest. If his intention is to make a show of his faith before men, God will make that manifest. Therefore, no one can pretend, for God will manifest whether he is wrong or right. Our God is the living God; He is not careless. If we know Him in this way, we will fear Him and trust Him. He is the Sovereign of the universe, and He has authority over all things in the universe. He is not loose and does not overlook anything. He is great as well as fine. There is not a matter that is so trivial as to escape His notice.</p>
<p>God makes things manifest according to His nature. He wants to be manifested as holiness, righteousness, light, and love. The Old Testament law portrays the nature of God. God judged His people in the Old Testament according to His law, that is, according to His nature. In order to manifest His nature, He must work on His people. He must be involved with our intentions, our thoughts, and our living and work lest we misrepresent Him. He will manifest whether we love Him, hate Him, fear Him, or mock Him. Our God is a great God, and yet He is broad. He is also very fine and not careless. He is bright, He is light, He is holy, and He is holiness. He wants us to be children of light, and He wants to be our God (Eph. 5:8; John 20:17). Every child of God must fear Him and be comforted by Him because He is the living God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIVING GOD AND<br />
THE GOD WHO HIDES HIMSELF</h2>
<p>Even though our God is a living God, His disposition is to hide Himself. Throughout the Old Testament, from Genesis to Malachi, God was hidden from man. In the New Testament, God came down from the heavens to the earth in order to manifest Himself so that man would know Him, but He concealed Himself in human flesh. He was manifested yet concealed, such that man could not recognize Him. God is a living God, but we cannot see Him, because He is a God who hides Himself (Isa. 45:15). He desires to express His glory, but unlike many who like to make a show of the things they have done, He will not make a show. Concerning the Lord, the prophet Isaiah says, &ldquo;He will not cry out, nor lift up His voice, / Nor make His voice heard in the street. / A bruised reed He will not break; / And a dimly burning flax He will not extinguish&rdquo; (42:2-3). This prophecy shows that He is a God who hides Himself.</p>
<p>Many people often ask why the living God does not discipline people who act recklessly and lawlessly and do works of unrighteousness. Even believers question why the living God does not seem to hear their prayers. The answer is simple: He is a God who hides Himself. When the Lord Jesus was crucified, God hid Himself. He did not judge the ones who crucified the Lord by striking them with lightening. God did not say a word; it was as if God did not exist. Hence, some of those present shook their heads and mocked the Lord. They said, &ldquo;He trusts in God; let Him rescue Him now if He wants Him&rdquo; (Matt. 27:43). The Lord Jesus trusted in God, but while He was hanging on the cross, it was as if there were no God in the universe. God was hidden when the Lord passed through this great trial.</p>
<p>God is a God who hides Himself. He often hides Himself in space and in time. It seems that we pray to Him but do not receive results and that we trust in Him but He ignores us. We must understand that it takes time as well as endurance to experience the living God. The day that the Lord was crucified, God hid Himself. But after three days, He raised Jesus from the dead (Luke 24:6-7). After another forty days, Jesus was lifted up into heaven (Acts 1:3, 9-10). After yet another ten days, on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit descended (2:1-4). We must say that God is real; He is a living God (1 Thes. 1:9), and He is also a God who hides Himself.</p>
<p>It seems as if God did not see the Roman Empire persecuting the church in the second century. The Roman Empire used every conceivable means to afflict and slaughter Christians, but God did not stretch forth His hand to stop it; rather, He hid Himself. However, a century later the Roman Empire was divided and eventually disappeared. In contrast, the believers of Christ have remained and have spread to various places because of the true and living God.</p>
<p>Sometimes it seems as if God is not in our situation, and it seems as if we love and fear Him in vain. But time proves that He is the living God. When it is time, He will make all things manifest. It is not vain to believe in Him, trust in Him, fear Him, or love Him.</p>
<p>Even though Joseph feared and trusted in God, he was hated by his brothers, sold in Egypt, and became a servant in the house of Potiphar, the captain of the guard (Gen. 37:2-36). Because Joseph kept himself pure before God and would not sin against God, he was resented by his master&rsquo;s wife and unjustly put into prison (39:7-20; 40:15). Eventually, God manifested Joseph&rsquo;s purity, obedience to God, fear of God, and unwillingness to sin against God. King Nebuchadnezzar is a different example. His heart was lifted up, and he conducted himself in pride and conceit. Then one day God came to make all things manifest. Nebuchadnezzar was deposed from his royal throne, and his glory was taken away from him; he was driven from among mankind, and his dwelling place was with the beasts of the field; he was made to eat grass like a bull, and his body was wet with the dew of heaven. This was his condition until he came to know that God the Most High is the Ruler over the kingdom of men and sets whomever He wills over the earthly kingdoms (Dan. 4:19-37; 5:20-21).</p>
<p>God is a God who hides Himself, and He is also the living God. There may be occasions when it seems like He does not exist, but time will prove that He is the living God. Temporary trials are but a process, not the final goal. God will make all things manifest in His time. Whether our situations are difficult or easy, we must always fear God, because He will make all things manifest one day. God is not mocked; hence, we must fear Him.</p>
<p>It is a blessing to believe in the living God. He is our life and our all; hence, we have set our hope in Him. He is a God who hides Himself, but He is also a God who makes all things manifest. No wonder the psalmist says, &ldquo;My soul thirsts for God, / For the living God... / The salvation of my countenance&rdquo; (Psa. 42:2, 11). The living God is awesome to those who mock Him. There is nothing that He does not search. There are no hidden thoughts, secret intentions, or dark deeds that He will not make manifest. Let me repeat, God is not mocked. Our God is a consuming fire, and it is a fearful thing to fall into the hands of the living God (Heb. 12:29; 10:31). May we live in Him and let Him live in us. May we also daily learn to trust in Him, wait on Him, love Him, obey His shining, accept His dealing, and walk before Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE GOD OF RESURRECTION</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 22:29, 31-32; Rev. 1:17-18; 3:1-2</h1>
<p>Our God is the eternal living God; from eternity to eternity He is the living God. Although He became flesh, lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years, and was crucified on the cross, He resurrected from death after three days. He entered into death as a man, but He lives forever and ever (Rev. 1:18). Hence, He is the God of resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOD OF RESURRECTION<br />
OVERCOMING DEATH</h2>
<p>Resurrection proves that God is a living God. There is no power that He cannot overcome. Death is an exceedingly great power in the universe. No one can withstand death. Apart from God, death is the greatest power in the universe. When death comes, no one can withstand it. Throughout history man has been searching for ways to overcome death, but no one has ever overcome it. Rather, all have been taken captive by death.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus overcame death and broke through death; He resurrected from death. He was incarnated not only to work but also to fight. He had to prevail over every opposing power in order to accomplish redemption. The four Gospels do not only tell us where the Lord went on earth and how He conducted Himself in the flesh; the Gospels also tell us of the battles that He fought while He was on earth. After the Lord was manifested among men, He encountered all kinds of attacks&mdash;from sin, man, the world, and demons&mdash;some were hidden, and others were obvious. No matter whether Satan used man to attack the Lord or whether he used the environment, the Lord overcame every attack. Therefore, the Lord could say, &ldquo;The ruler of the world is coming, and in Me he has nothing&rdquo; (John 14:30). The Lord overcame every attack of Satan, whether from man, the world, or sin. Then the Lord went into death and was resurrected from death to overcome death. The last enemy that the Lord overcame was death.</p>
<p>Death is the last enemy that God will abolish in the universe (1 Cor. 15:26). The last thing that the devil, who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14), used to attack the Lord Jesus was death. The Lord came to meet His enemy, who has the might of death. The Lord did not avoid death. If He had avoided death, it would have meant that He feared death and that He was unable to overcome death. The Lord did not avoid death, because He did not fear it, and He could overcome it. The Lord could overcome death because He is living. Death could not overcome Him. The Lord did not fear death; rather, He accepted the challenge of death.</p>
<p>The Lord entered into death in order to give it an opportunity to fight with all its might. Death has been operating and fighting in Adam&rsquo;s descendants for thousands of years. Except for the Lord, every person who has entered into death has been overcome by death. All who have entered into death have been swallowed up by death. As a result, everyone fears death. Our Lord, however, not only did not fear death, He also overcame death. He entered into death and emerged from death.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s entering into death and emerging from it testify to the fact that He is the living God and to the surpassing greatness of His resurrection power. The cross, the grave, and the power of Hades could not subdue the living Lord. He overcame death, the grave, and the power of Hades, and thus He resurrected. The Lord is the Lord of life. It was not possible for Him to be held by death (Acts 2:24). Satan utilized the world, the environment, the cross, the grave, and lastly, Hades to attack the Lord, but the Lord withstood every attack. The Lord willingly passed through the baptism of death and entered into Hades, letting them do whatever they wanted, because He is the living Lord, whom Satan cannot conquer. Death could not hold the Lord, the grave could not restrict Him, and Hades could not detain Him; He resurrected. Resurrection is deliverance from death. Resurrection is the overcoming of death.</p>
<p>Resurrection is different from being living. In order to be living, one does not need to pass through death, but in order to be resurrection, one must pass through death and emerge from it. Resurrection stands the test of death, that is, passes through and emerges from death. Hence, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the First and the Last and the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever; and I have the keys of death and of Hades&rdquo; (Rev. 1:17-18).</p>
<p>Hence, God is not only the living God but also the God of resurrection. He died, but He overcame death. Death fought the Lord with all its might, but it could not conquer Him. The principle of resurrection is overcoming death and emerging from death. The God of resurrection has been tested and proven to possess an unshakable life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE LIVING GOD<br />
AND THE GOD OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>There is a distinction between the living God and the God of resurrection. Before passing through death and resurrection, God was merely the living God; the human element was not in Him. At that time, man was on the earth, and God was in the heavens. After God passed through death and resurrected from death, something mysterious happened: God and man were fully mingled as one. Incarnation was a mingling of God and man, but it was God entering into man. Through incarnation there was a man on earth in whom was God. Incarnation brought God into man.</p>
<p>Through His resurrection from death, the Lord brought man into God. Since the time of the Lord&rsquo;s death and resurrection, there has been a man in heaven, and this man is God. After His resurrection the Lord said to His disciples, &ldquo;A spirit does not have flesh and bones as you behold Me having&rdquo; (Luke 24:39). This proves that He is still a man in resurrection. By ascending to the heavens after His resurrection, the Lord brought man into God.</p>
<p>The living God does not possess human nature, but the God of resurrection possesses human nature. The living God possesses only the divine element, whereas the God of resurrection possesses both the divine element and the human element. God is the God of resurrection not only because He was tested and overcame death but also because the human element has been added to Him; hence, He now possesses both the element of God and the element of man. In the God of resurrection, God and man have been fully mingled. God is in man, and man is in God. The two have been fully mingled as one.</p>
<p>The living God lives in the heavens and in man&rsquo;s environment. The God of resurrection took a further step in order to live in man. In ancient times, God performed various signs and wonders for the Israelites, but they experienced Him only as the living God. Today Christians have the living God within them so that they can experience Him as the God of resurrection. Many Christians are content with God doing things for them in their environment and experiencing Him as the living God. They do not know that in His salvation, God dwells in His people in order for them to experience Him as the God of resurrection. Not only does He do things in our environment in order to solve our problems; He also lives in us so that we may live one life with Him in order to overcome death and its factors.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE GOD OF RESURRECTION<br />
TO BECOME LIVING PERSONS</h2>
<p>God does not want to be the God of resurrection in Himself alone; He wants to live in man as resurrection. He wants to be mingled with man. Every genuine and living Christian must know God not only as the living God in the heavens and in his environment but also as the God of resurrection who lives in him. A Christian who does not know and experience the God of resurrection living in him is a dead Christian. Many people know that God is a living God, but they only know that He lives in the heavens and operates in their environment, not that He is in them as resurrection. A genuine Christian not only needs to know God as the living God but also needs to advance to experience God as resurrection. This is to be a Christian in the New Testament age. People in the Old Testament age merely knew that God lived outside of them in their environment and that He did things for them. In the New Testament age God is resurrection in us.</p>
<p>If God is resurrection in us, we will not fall asleep in the meetings. If God is resurrection in us, we will have the boldness to open our mouths to pray and the power to give testimonies in the meetings. Regrettably, until now many saints know God only as a person who is outside of them. They pray and ask God to keep them, but they do not know that God is resurrection in them. When we let God live in us as resurrection, we will be living within, both in our daily life and service. Our prayers and our testimonies will also be living. Not only so, even those who hear us and contact us will become living.</p>
<p>When the resurrected living God enters into man, He makes man a living person. Concerning God, the Bible says, &ldquo;He is not the God of the dead, but of the living&rdquo; (Mark 12:27; Luke 20:38). God is the God of resurrection. He hates not only unrighteousness and evil but also death. Many believers think that it is sufficient to be well behaved, law-abiding, faultless, and God-fearing. They do not know that it is not enough to be a faultless Christian; they do not know that God wants living Christians who experience Him as the God of resurrection and who live Him out. Although they might not commit any crimes or make mistakes, they are still dead. God hates every form of death; death is abominable to God. The Old Testament indicates that all dead things are unclean (Lev. 11:8, 11, 24, 27, 31-40). This shows how much God hates death and how abominable death is in His eyes.</p>
<p>God wants us not merely to be faultless Christians but to be living Christians. We may not express the flesh, but if we express death, God cannot accept us. Our God condemns not only unrighteousness and unholiness but also death, because He is not only the righteous God and the holy God but also the living God and the God of resurrection. Even though the church in Sardis had done no wrong, the Lord still condemned her. Revelation 3:1 says, &ldquo;These things says He who has the seven Spirits of God and the seven stars: I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and yet you are dead.&rdquo; In this verse the Lord seems to be saying, &ldquo;You should know that I am living because I have the seven Spirits; I am the Lord who is full of life.&rdquo; Being a Christian is not a matter of studying what is right or wrong but of being living. As long as we are living, everything is right.</p>
<p>God wants us to be living, which is different from what the world refers to as being lively. To be lively is an outward condition and can be compared to a performance on stage. To be living is to express the divine life by touching and experiencing the God of resurrection. God is not only the living God but also the God of resurrection. When we touch Him, we become living. Even if we are dead, as long as we are willing to touch the God of resurrection, we will immediately become living. The more we touch things that are related only to ourselves, the more death we have, but once we touch the living God, we will be living. If we contact the God of resurrection a few times during our day, we will be living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING TO THE GOD OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>When we pray, we need to first stop ourselves. A brother can come to God in prayer without stopping himself. As a result, he will not touch God; instead, he will stay in himself. The issue of such prayer is deadness. We do not pray in order to ask for things. We pray in order to touch the God of resurrection and in order to let Him touch us. We can pray to the God of resurrection when we stop ourselves in order for us to touch Him and let Him touch us.</p>
<p>The basic principle of prayer is to stop ourselves in order to touch God and to let God touch us. Then He can be resurrection in us, and we can live out His resurrection life. As a result, we will be living.</p>
<p>Being a faultless Christian is not enough. A person must be a living Christian because God is not the God of the dead but of the living. He will judge not only sin, the world, and Satan but also death. We must let the God of resurrection live in us daily so that we may be living because of Him. As Christians, our God is not only a living God but also the God of resurrection, who is in us to enable us to be living Christians.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE GOD OF RESURRECTION</h1>
<p class="indent1">We were excessively burdened, beyond our power, so that we despaired even of living. Indeed we ourselves had the response of death in ourselves, that we should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead. (2 Cor. 1:8-9)</p>
<p class="indent1">Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day. For our momentary lightness of affliction works out for us, more and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory. (4:16-17)</p>
<p class="indent1">They disciplined for a few days as it seemed good to them; but He, for what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness. (Heb. 12:10)</p>
<p class="indent1">We know that all things work together for good to those who love God, to those who are called according to His purpose. Because those whom He foreknew, He also predestinated to be conformed to the image of His Son. (Rom. 8:28-29)</p>
<p class="indent1">God...who gives life to the dead. (4:17)</p>
<p class="indent1">I am...the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever and ever. (Rev. 1:17-18)</p>
<p>Suffering is the lot of all the inhabitants of the earth. None can evade it. Some people imagine that if you believe on the Lord and live in His fear, you will be immune from all ills, yet numbers of Christians are grievously afflicted, and some who live in vital touch with God are in constant suffering.</p>
<p>The unsaved keep asking, &ldquo;If God loves the world, why does He allow all this sorrow?&rdquo; And the saved keep asking, &ldquo;If God loves His children, why does He let so much trouble befall them?&rdquo; Others go still further and inquire, &ldquo;How does it come about that the more spiritual you become, the more hardship you meet?&rdquo; These are practical questions, not mere theoretical quibbles, and we have to face them.</p>
<p>Why should man, who has been created by God, be subject to suffering throughout the whole course of his life? Why should men still continue to suffer after they become children of God? And why should men&rsquo;s sufferings increase with the increase of their devotion to God?</p>
<p>In my early days I spent a considerable amount of time looking into this problem of suffering, but because my knowledge of the Lord was superficial, I was only able to draw these conclusions from my studies: (1) Man is prone to error; therefore, suffering is necessary for his correction. (2) Suffering is needful if we are to comfort others, for only they who themselves have suffered can truly help other people. (3) The discipline of suffering is essential if we are to acquire endurance, for, as Romans 5:3 says, &ldquo;Tribulation produces endurance.&rdquo; (4) Suffering is inevitable if we are to be molded into vessels that will be of use to God.</p>
<p>I admit that these four conclusions that I came to in my youth are all correct, but they come short of the mark. The ultimate object of all suffering is the accomplishment of God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. That purpose has been revealed to us through the Scriptures, but it can be realized in us only through suffering. And its realization involves an experiential knowledge of God not only as the living God but also as the God of resurrection.</p>
<p>The experience of every saved person provides at least some evidence that God is the living God, but comparatively few of the saved realize that the God who dwells within them is the God of resurrection. If the distinction between the living God and the God of resurrection is not clear to us, many problems will arise in our experience as we seek to press on. Let me explain this distinction quite simply.</p>
<p>The incarnation marked a mighty crisis in the universe. Prior to the incarnation, God was God and man was man. There was no human element in God, nor was there any divine element in man. The two were quite separate. But one day &ldquo;the Word became flesh,&rdquo; and that day marked a turning point in the history of the universe. It brought one dispensation to an end and ushered in another. (Of course, we are talking from our human standpoint as creatures of time, not from God&rsquo;s standpoint in a timeless eternity.)</p>
<p>With the incarnation a dispensation began in which God and man, man and God, were blended into one. The Scriptures declared that the Word that became flesh would be called &ldquo;Immanuel,&rdquo; which means &ldquo;God with us.&rdquo; That name does not merely signify the presence of God in the midst of a multitude of men; it signifies His entry into humanity. What took place at Bethlehem was the birth of One who possessed a dual nature. God and man were united in that one person. Up to that time all the descendants of Adam had possessed only one nature; after that time there was One who possessed two natures, the human and the divine. He was truly man, and He was truly God. That One, Jesus of Nazareth, who was both divine and human, became a source of perplexity to many people. They asked Him, &ldquo;Who are You?&rdquo; (John 8:25). And they asked one another, &ldquo;What kind of man is this?&rdquo; (Matt. 8:27). They recognized clearly that He was a man, yet because there was so much about Him that was divine, He was a problem to His contemporaries. &ldquo;Immanuel&rdquo;&mdash;God &ldquo;manifested in the flesh&rdquo; (1 Tim. 3:16)&mdash;is the meaning of the incarnation!</p>
<p>But the incarnation is only one-half of the mystery. The other half is the resurrection. The incarnation is God coming into man; the resurrection is man coming into God. The incarnation brought divine content into human life; the resurrection brought human content into divine life. After the incarnation it was possible to say, &ldquo;There is a man on earth in whose life there is a divine element.&rdquo; But not until after the resurrection was it possible to say, &ldquo;There is a God in heaven in whom there is a human element.&rdquo; That is the meaning of the resurrection.</p>
<p>But why do we stress the distinction between the living God and the God of resurrection? It is because while the living God can perform many acts on man&rsquo;s behalf, the nature of the living God cannot blend with the nature of man. When, on the other hand, the God of resurrection works, His very nature is wrought into the nature of man. Brothers and sisters, please note carefully that even when the living God has performed some act on your behalf, after that act as before it, He is still He and you are still you. His working on your behalf does not impart anything of His nature to you. The living God can work on behalf of man, but the nature of the living God cannot unite with the nature of man. On the other hand, when the God of resurrection works, He communicates Himself to man by that which He does for him. Let me cite two illustrations.</p>
<p>When the children of Israel were in a hopeless plight, the living God opened a way for them across the Red Sea. The dividing of the Red Sea was a miracle that demonstrated to them that God was the living God, yet that miracle performed for them did not bring any measure of the life of God into them. They witnessed many other divine acts in the wilderness&mdash;for example, God gave them bread from heaven and water out of the rock&mdash;but despite those and other wonders performed by God for them, nothing of God Himself was thereby imparted to them.</p>
<p>In contrast to this, the apostle Paul testifies to knowing not only the living God but also the God of resurrection. Paul was so sorely tried that he despaired even of living, but it was thus that he learned to trust in the God who raises the dead. When the God of resurrection acted on his behalf to raise him from the dead, that divine act not only accomplished something for Paul; it also communicated God&rsquo;s own nature to Paul.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, do discriminate here. The miracles wrought for Israel in the wilderness were acts of the living God; however, despite the many miracles wrought for them, nothing of God was wrought into their constitution. The miracles wrought for Paul were wrought by the God of resurrection, and each fresh miracle wrought a fresh measure of God Himself into the life of Paul. Alas! Though generations have passed since the resurrection, many Christians are almost ignorant of the God of resurrection and are interested only in the living God. Let me try and bring this matter home to our daily life.</p>
<p>A brother becomes seriously ill. His case is considered hopeless, but God has mercy on him and works a miracle on his behalf so that he recovers. Thereafter, he testifies to the fact that God is the living God. Yet within a short time of his recovery, he plunges right into the world. Even when he is living in the world, he still remembers that God is the living God and that God preserved his life from death. But he has experienced no increase of divine life; he has experienced only a miracle of healing.</p>
<p>Another brother becomes ill. Day after day passes without a vestige of improvement. For a long time he keeps hovering at the edge of the grave. Then, when he has completely despaired of living, in the depths of his being he gradually becomes aware of God. Resurrection life begins to work within, and he awakens to the fact that this resurrection life is a life that can overcome all affliction and can even swallow up death. He is still conscious of much weakness and is sorely tested; nevertheless, the realization deepens that God is not working to make His might known in external acts but is working to impart Himself. Light breaks upon him gradually, and gradually health returns. This brother does not just experience a healing; he comes into a new experience of God. The other brother could testify to a miracle wrought in his body and, shortly after, could plunge right into the world. However, if this brother gives a word of testimony, there is nothing sensational about it, and there is no stress on the healing, yet you meet God in his life.</p>
<p>Let me tell a story to illustrate this further. A brother who was engaged in an export business had arranged to send a consignment of goods by a certain ship. Somehow the goods were delayed and were forwarded by a later ship. Shortly afterward, he learned that the boat by which he had originally planned to send the goods had been sunk. How he praised God for His overruling grace! &ldquo;O God,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;how perfect Your guidance was! You are indeed the true and living God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Some time later this same brother contracted tuberculosis, and to complicate matters, he developed digestive trouble as well. The tuberculosis called for a nourishing diet, but the digestive complaint forbade it. He was in a sore plight, but his wife comforted him and said, &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t you remember the episode of two months ago when God saved that consignment of goods? Oh, our God is the true and living God!&rdquo; But on this occasion God seemed neither true nor living, for the more that the couple prayed, the more the brother hemorrhaged; the more they prayed, the worse his digestive complaint became. He was perplexed. Finally, he gave way to doubt, and his wife began to question too. A few months later his business came to a standstill. His health steadily deteriorated, and his financial resources steadily dwindled until both he and his wife reached the verge of despair. In their extremity they rallied all their unified faith and prayed once again, &ldquo;O God, You are the living God. We believe that You will yet be gracious to us.&rdquo; But the next day the patient had a further hemorrhage, and neither he nor his wife could exercise faith anymore. The living God vanished from their horizon. Friends and neighbors pronounced the brother&rsquo;s case to be hopeless, and the doctor&rsquo;s verdict confirmed theirs.</p>
<p>However, that was not the end of the story. A crisis took place in the inner life of that brother. It began to dawn upon him (although he could not then define it as we are defining it now) that while he knew God as the living God, he did not know Him as the God of resurrection. He knew the doctrine of resurrection, but he did not know the reality of resurrection. He knew in experience that God had come into his life, but he did not know in experience that he had come into the life of God. It became clear to him that, from his conversion right up to that time, he possessed the life of God, but he had not been living in the life of God. Even while he had been praying to God, he had been living in independence of Him. He saw that even his faith in God had been his faith, and his reliance upon God had been his reliance. He saw all his efforts to please God as something apart from God. He was filled with remorse. He abhorred himself. His healing ceased to be a question. His circumstances ceased to be a question. His one question was himself. He became overwhelmingly aware that what he had regarded as his most spiritual service had been something apart from the divine life. No one preached to him, but the Holy Spirit gave him a deep registration of his individualism. He judged himself unsparingly and ceased to entertain any thought of improvement in health or circumstances. At that point a strange thing happened&mdash;his health began to improve. No one knew when or how the healing took place. There was just a gradual increase of strength until he was quite well. At an earlier date he could bear witness to God as the living God but all the while be living his life in independence of God; from that date he knew the God of resurrection and began to live in dependence on resurrection life.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, do remember that God allows us to go through all sorts of distresses for the very reason that we may know Him as the God of resurrection. He constantly leads us into death because only in death can we experience resurrection life.</p>
<p>The Bible speaks of two creations, the old and the new. The divine nature does not indwell the old creation, and that is why it has become old. Where God is, there is always newness. The Jerusalem above is called New Jerusalem because it is full of God. The first creation, even though it is the creation of the living God, has no divine content, but what the God of resurrection raises from the dead has a divine as well as a human content. The new creation combines created and uncreated life. The first creation, though brought into being by God Himself, is allowed by God Himself to pass into death so that it may emerge in resurrection as a creation of dual nature, that is, combining the natures of God and man.</p>
<p>This principle has to be applied to us personally and to all our relationships. It is possible for fellow workers, who love one another and work together harmoniously, to imagine that their mutual love and their cooperation are a spiritual thing, and others too may regard this relationship as such. Yet it may simply be a human relationship without any divine content. But one day the hand of God falls upon it, and the cooperation comes to an end. For some indefinable reason those fellow workers can no longer get on together. They are distressed about it and pray and yearn for a restoration of their former harmony, but the more they pray, the more it evades them. Then one day, when they have really died to their old experience, they find themselves in a new relation&mdash;not just a oneness of human nature but a oneness that is both human and divine.</p>
<p>Though the old creation has come into being by the mighty hand of the living God, He Himself does not reside within it. It is created by Him and it displays His might, but it does not display His presence. How can the old creation be transformed into the new? It is by the incoming of God. But how can His incoming be secured? This is the point at which a major difficulty arises. The old nature must be shattered to make way for Him. Brothers and sisters, everything in your life must pass the supreme test of death to make a way for the God of resurrection. If you only know the living God, your knowledge will be too objective. God will be God; you will be you. You need to know the God of resurrection, and it is only through death that He can cleave a way for Himself into your life.</p>
<p>Prior to my coming here, I visited a large textile factory in Manila. There I watched a process whereby certain materials were produced. But after the perfect fabric had been created, I saw a second process take place. That perfect fabric was plunged into a bath of dye where it lost all its beauty. It was a sorry sight. However, it was in that state that the dye permeated the fabric, and a new element was added to it. So it is with the old creation. It must pass through a devastating process if it is to be permeated by the presence of God.</p>
<p>I was deeply impressed as I stood in that factory watching the two processes and comparing the fabrics that emerged from the first and the second. They were not actually different fabrics, but some of them, passing through a state that temporarily destroyed their loveliness, had a new and permanent beauty imparted to them.</p>
<p>What is the significance of suffering? It is this, that the devastation it brings to the old creation provides an opportunity for the God of resurrection to impart Himself into His creatures so that they emerge from the death process with a divine element in their constitution. The primary purpose of suffering in this universe, particularly as it relates to the children of God, is that through it the very nature of God may be wrought into the nature of man. &ldquo;Though our outer man is decaying, yet our inner man is being renewed day by day&rdquo; (2 Cor. 4:16). Through a process of outward decay, an inward process is taking place that is adding a new constituent to our lives.</p>
<p>Beloved brothers and sisters, through hardship and pressure a divine element is being wrought into the very fabric of our being so that we cease to be colorless Christians but have a heavenly hue imparted into our life that was lacking before. Whatever else suffering may effect in this universe is incidental; this is primary&mdash;to bring those whom the living God has made possessors of created life into the uncreated life of the God of resurrection. It is in the death experiences, which come through suffering, that the life of the creature is blended with the life of the Creator. We may know the living God without such drastic experiences, but only through death can we come to an experiential knowledge of the God of resurrection.</p>
<p>Suffering is the God-appointed lot of the Christian. The Christian&rsquo;s happiness is not to be found in external things but in learning to enjoy God Himself in the midst of trial. Paul and Silas could rejoice and sing His praises while they were in prison because their happiness did not come from outer circumstances but from an inner enjoyment of God (Acts 16:22-25). In Paul&rsquo;s short letter to the Philippians, written during his imprisonment, there are over a score of references to joy. In deep distress he could still be joyful because in his affliction he was learning to know Christ, to appropriate Him, and to enjoy Him. Paul&rsquo;s outward circumstances were all conducive to sorrow, but it was in sorrow that Christ was imparted to him as the source of his joy.</p>
<p>Beloved brothers and sisters, do you want to be partakers of the new creation? Do you want to know perennial newness? Then you must give your consent to God when He seeks to lead you through devastating processes. And you need have no fear, for God knows how to apportion suffering. He is an expert at matching our suffering to our state. He measures all things with unfailing accuracy and selects the particular trial suited to the particular need. He invariably chooses the lot of each one with this goal in view&mdash;an increase of the divine content in our life. If He chastises us, it is always &ldquo;what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness&rdquo; (Heb. 12:10). &ldquo;All things work together for good to those...who are called according to His purpose&rdquo; (Rom. 8:28). What good? It is this, that we may be &ldquo;conformed to the image of His Son&rdquo; (v. 29).</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">REVERENCE AND GODLINESS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Job 1:1, 8; Psa. 25:12, 14; Prov. 1:7; Eccl. 3:14; 8:12-13; 12:13; 1 Tim. 3:16; 4:7-8; 2 Tim. 3:5, 12; Titus 1:1; 2:12</h1>
<p>The verses listed above can be divided into two groups. The first group is from Job, Psalms, Proverbs, and Ecclesiastes in the Old Testament and is concerning the experience of the holy people of God in the Old Testament. The second group is from 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus in the New Testament and was written by the apostle Paul at the time of the church&rsquo;s desolation. The verses from the Old Testament speak of revering God, which includes fearing God, and the verses from the New Testament speak of godliness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIVING GOD AND THE GOD OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>In the previous chapters we saw that, on the one hand, God is the living God and that, on the other hand, He is the God of resurrection. The Old Testament presents the living God, and the New Testament presents not only the living God but also the God of resurrection. The Old Testament presents the signs and wonders performed by the living God in Israel&rsquo;s history. Adam was driven out of the garden of Eden immediately after he sinned (Gen. 3:24). Nadab and Abihu were consumed by fire and died because they had offered strange fire before God (Lev. 10:1-2; Num. 3:4). When Aaron and Miriam spoke against Moses, they were rebuked by God, and Miriam became leprous (12:1, 4-5, 10-15). This proves that God is the living God who is not mocked.</p>
<p>In regard to the church, in the New Testament God is not only the living God but also the God of resurrection. The relationship between the God of resurrection and man is more advanced than the relationship between the living God and man. The living God manifests Himself outside of man. The God of resurrection, who has put on humanity and has entered into man, manifests Himself from within man. The living God is manifested objectively, outside of man, without being mingled with man. The God of resurrection is manifested subjectively, by being mingled with and expressed from within man. In the Old Testament God is manifested objectively as the living God. In the New Testament He is manifested subjectively as the God of resurrection by mingling Himself with His people.</p>
<p>The God whom we serve is not only the living God, who is manifested outside of us, but also the God of resurrection, who is lived out from within us. Hence, our relationship with Him should be in resurrection as well as living. We should know and experience Him as the God who is in us as resurrection. We need to express not only the living God but even more the God of resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REVERING GOD AND EXPRESSING GODLINESS</h2>
<p>We express the living God and the God of resurrection; hence, we must make a distinction between reverence and godliness. God&rsquo;s people in the Old Testament revered Him, but in the New Testament His people have a godly living. With respect to the living God, man should have reverence, but with respect to the God of resurrection, man should express godliness. In the Old Testament God was manifested as the living God; hence, His people needed to revere Him. In the New Testament God is manifested as the God of resurrection; hence, the New Testament believers need godliness. Let me repeat: reverence is toward the living God, and godliness is toward the God of resurrection. As God&rsquo;s New Testament people, we need not only reverence but also godliness. This means that in our living we should not only express the living God but also the God of resurrection.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REVERENCE AND THE LIVING GOD</h2>
<p>To revere God means to fear offending Him. Reverence is an indispensable attitude that fallen man should possess. If it were not for the fall, man would have no need for reverence. When man fell, three things happened to him. First, sin entered into man. Second, the human nature became corrupt, and man became flesh. The flesh caused further evil in fallen man. Third, the world, which resists God, was produced. When Adam was created, he was without sin and the flesh, and the garden of Eden was not contaminated. Adam did not have anything that opposed, resisted, or offended God. Hence, there was no need of reverence. In contrast, today man is fallen because sin has entered into man, human nature has become flesh, and the world has been produced. Sin, the flesh, and the world are incompatible with God. If man is slightly careless by giving room to sin, the flesh, or the world, he sins against, offends, opposes, and resists God. Therefore, there is a need for man to revere God.</p>
<p>Nadab and Abihu died because they were careless; they were not fearful or reverent in their worship (Lev. 10:1-10). When we are defiled by sin, the flesh, or the world, we are exposed before God. This is a fearful matter that requires us to revere the living God.</p>
<p>In Joshua, Achan sinned by coveting the world and stealing what was devoted for destruction; hence, he was judged by God (7:1, 18-26). After their exodus from Egypt, the children of Israel were to submit to God&rsquo;s authority and fight for God, but one man, Achan, coveted a mantle of Shinar, which represented worldly glory and adornment. The land of Shinar is Babel, also known as Babylon (Gen. 11:2, 9). It is the place where men forsook God, exalted man, and assumed authority to rule over others. Achan acted contrary to God&rsquo;s commandment. He coveted things from the God-opposing Shinar, rebellious Babel, and stole them. God made this manifest and judged Achan.</p>
<p>When David killed Uriah and took his wife, God came and immediately manifested it (2 Sam. 11:2&mdash;12:14). God cannot tolerate the defilement of sin in those who belong to Him. Even though David later confessed his sin and was forgiven by God, God was not loose with David: Absalom rebelled against David, there was fornication in the house of David, and the sword remained in David&rsquo;s kingdom (15:1&mdash;19:8; 13:1-22). This was how God manifested, exposed, David&rsquo;s sin.</p>
<p>Sin, the flesh, and the world are enemies of God. As long as we must deal with these three matters, God is the living God. We need to fear living by the flesh and the self, and we must be cautious of the defilement of sin and of the world. This is reverence. The living God does not tolerate sin. Around the hem of the robe worn by the high priest were pomegranates and bells of gold (Exo. 28:33-35). Pomegranates indicate that the high priest needed the divine life in his living, and the bells of gold signify that he needed to be cautious, not loose. If the high priest was loose in his service in the temple, the bells of gold would give a sound of warning. The high priest could not afford to be loose before God. This is reverence.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GODLINESS AND THE GOD OF RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>In the New Testament God is not only outside of man; He lives in man and is mingled with man. When God lives outside of man, He is the living God, but when He lives in man, He is the God of resurrection. As such, God not only requires that we fear Him but also that we cooperate with Him in order to express Him and be His living image. The expression of God is godliness. First Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;Great is the mystery of godliness: He who was manifested in the flesh.&rdquo; Godliness is God expressed by man (1 Cor. 14:25). This is a great mystery. Godliness is not related to the negative items of sin, the flesh, and the world. It is related to the positive item of expressing God.</p>
<p>To revere God is to deal with sin, the flesh, and the world in our living. To be godly is not only to have the absence of sin, the flesh, and the world but to be mingled with and to express God. Some believers revere God, but others possess godliness. Such believers do not exhibit sin, the flesh, or the world. On the contrary, they exhibit something mysterious, something that is both man and God. This is God being manifested in man. This is godliness.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;Exercise yourself unto godliness&rdquo; (1 Tim. 4:7). This means that, on the one hand, we should revere God and not touch sin, the flesh, or the world. On the other hand, we should follow God and express Him in our living. If God does not move, neither should we. We should move only when God moves. This is a great lesson that needs much learning and exercise.</p>
<p>Many young saints have a heart to learn the lesson of revering God. Although they see the faults of older saints, they dare not talk about them loosely. This is very pleasing to God. Noah had three sons, and the youngest did not fear God but spoke loosely of his father&rsquo;s mistake. The other two sons dared not look at their father&rsquo;s nakedness but covered him with a garment because they feared God. Eventually, the youngest son, Ham, was cursed by God (Gen. 9:20-27). Therefore, we must learn to fear God. The young saints also need the element of God in their behavior and attitude. They need to be mingled with God and to express Him. This is to exercise oneself unto godliness.</p>
<p>In this age of the church&rsquo;s desolation, the apostle teaches us to pay particular attention to godliness and to measure everything by godliness. Even preaching the gospel should be measured by godliness. Titus 1:1 says that the full knowledge of the truth is according to godliness. Every truth in the New Testament age was produced by God being mingled within man. Hence, all truths are according to godliness.</p>
<p>Many things that are spoken in so-called Christianity are winds of teaching (Eph. 4:14). In order to determine whether a teaching is a wind of teaching, we need to determine if it is according to godliness, that is, God mingled with man. God&rsquo;s people in the New Testament need not only reverence but also godliness. Godliness is to live out God, to flow out God, and to express God.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE JUDGING GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 12:23, 26-29; 1 Pet. 4:17; Rev. 19:11-12; 2 Tim. 4:1; Matt. 25:19; 1 Cor. 4:4-5; Rom. 14:10, 12; 2 Cor. 5:10-11; 1 Cor. 11:31-32; John 16:8; Isa. 57:14-15; Psa. 51:17</h1>
<p>The Bible uses various words to describe God. These various words indicate His characteristics, His attributes. A believer&rsquo;s condition often depends on his knowledge of God, which is derived from the Word of God. Many passages in the Bible reveal God to us so that we may know Him and His works. These portions focus on the kind of God we have. Hence, in order for us to know God, we must understand the Bible and pay particular attention to the words that describe God. Through these words the Bible reveals various aspects of God&rsquo;s character.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CREATING GOD AND THE JUDGING GOD</h2>
<p>The progression of the revelation of God in the Bible is very significant. First, the Bible presents the creating God (Gen. 1:1) and then the redeeming God (3:21). In addition, the Bible says that He is the living God (2 Sam. 22:47), the righteous God (Psa. 7:9), and the God of lovingkindness (Neh. 9:32). He is light (1 John 1:5), He is power (2 Cor. 13:4), and He is the God who hides Himself (Isa. 45:15). He is the God of resurrection (2 Cor. 1:9). He is also the God of grace (Heb. 4:16), and He gives His rich grace to man by giving man all that He is, all that He has, and all that He has done. He also gives man His fullness, His life, and His might. The Bible further reveals that He is a judging God (Rev. 19:11; 2 Tim. 4:1). The beginning of the Bible speaks of creation, showing that God is the creating God, and the end of the Bible speaks of God&rsquo;s judgment, showing that He is a judging God.</p>
<p>The <em>creating God</em> speaks not only of the work of creation but also that God is a person who creates. He is the creating God not only at the beginning of time; He has not ceased His work of creation. Sometimes He creates a new environment for us, and at other times He creates a new mood. Everything about us was created by God for us. This shows that our God is a creating God.</p>
<p>The Bible also says that God is a judging God. This does not mean He is waiting until the end of the age in order to execute His judgment. He has been the judging God since the first fall of man. In Genesis 3 God judged the serpent for seducing man, and He judged Adam and Eve for acting contrary to His command. In chapter 4 God judged Cain for rejecting His salvation. Chapter 5 shows that under God&rsquo;s judgment, the destiny of fallen man is death. In chapter 6 the wickedness of man was so great in the earth that his iniquities reached the heavens; hence, God came to judge man. Except for Noah and his family, God judged all mankind with the flood (chs. 7&mdash;8). In chapter 11 the descendants of Noah rebelled at Babel, and God judged them by confounding their language and scattering them over the surface of the earth. In the rest of the Old Testament God judges His elect, Israel, in the wilderness and in Canaan and also in their desolation, captivity, return, and restoration. When God walks among His people, He blesses and keeps them and also judges them. Even the Gentile nations are judged by God (Dan. 5). He is a judging God. Hence, in Romans 3:19 the apostle Paul says that all the world, including Jews and Gentiles, is under the judgment of God.</p>
<p>In the New Testament, the church age, the Bible further reveals that whenever something goes wrong in the church, God comes in to judge, such as in the case of Ananias and Sapphira (Acts 5:1-11). In the beginning of Acts the church was blessed, but this couple had crooked hearts, deceived the Holy Spirit, and were immediately judged by God. God continues to judge the church. When the church became desolate, the apostles wrote the Epistles with a judging tone. For instance, Hebrews 12 says that we have come forward to God, the Judge of all (vv. 22-23), that God is a consuming fire (v. 29), and that He will shake not only the earth but also heaven (v. 26). God&rsquo;s shaking is His judging. Anything that is incompatible with His nature will not last and will be shaken, destroyed by fire. Only that which is of God is compatible with His nature and will not be shaken but will remain.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s appearance in Revelation is frightful. He has eyes like a flame of fire, His feet are like shining bronze, His voice is like the sound of many waters, and out of His mouth proceeds a sharp two-edged sword (1:14-16). His eyes &ldquo;bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:5; Luke 2:35). On the day of judgment no one will be able to escape His observing and judging. Hence, in Revelation He appears mainly as the judging God. Today He is the Word of God, He is our Savior, and He is sitting on the throne of grace. But at the end of the age He will be the judging God sitting on the throne of judgment (4:2; 6:16). &ldquo;Each one of us will give an account concerning himself to God&rdquo; (Rom. 14:12).</p><h2 class="head1">EXPERIENCING THE CREATING GOD<br />
AND THE JUDGING GOD</h2>
<p>God is the creating God and the judging God not only to human beings in general but also in the personal experience of the believers. In every believer He is first the creating God. He created the situation for us to hear and to obey the gospel and to be saved by grace. After we are saved by grace, He continues to work in us and in our environment so that our hearts would incline toward Him and love Him, thereby enabling us to set our hearts to follow Him and to fully offer ourselves to Him. The creating God initiates and creates every detail in the process of His giving us grace.</p>
<p>After giving us initial grace, He goes on to reveal, to manifest, the various aspects of His person so that we can receive grace according to the various aspects of what He is. He wants us to know Him as the mighty God, whose power transcends all things. He wants us to know Him as the living God; hence, we should not follow doctrine, but we should experience and express Him as the living God. He wants us to know Him as the God who hides Himself. He seems to turn a deaf ear to the corruption and evil on earth and to the things that contradict and offend Him, but He tries those who fear Him. He wants us to know Him as the living God who makes all things manifest in time. He manifests His light so that we may know Him as the God of light. He manifests His holiness so that we may experience Him as the holy God. He makes His various attributes known to us, such as His lovingkindness and His long-suffering. He also makes Himself known to us as the God of resurrection. It was not possible for death to hold Him, Hades could not overcome Him, and He destroyed the devil, who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14). As the God of resurrection, He wants to live in us as resurrection (John 14:19-20) and be mingled with us. Finally, God wants us to know Him as the judging God who executes judgment in the church and in the individual believers. After we are saved, we will gradually begin to know and experience God according to His characteristics, His attributes.</p>
<p>Both church history and our personal experience show that God works in His saints as the creating God, the revealing God, and the judging God. His work of creation within the believers begins their life of grace. Then He gradually reveals the kind of God that He is so that they may experience His various aspects. Furthermore, He judges. His judging always follows a revelation of Himself. After one cycle is completed, He begins anew to create, give grace, manifest Himself, and judge. After the completion of a cycle, God brings in another beginning. This is how the divine life grows in the churches and in the believers. Every new cycle begins with God&rsquo;s creation and ends with His judgment.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REVERENCE AND GODLINESS</h2>
<p>God creates, gives grace, and judges so that His people can serve Him in reverence and godliness, according to His pleasure. Reverence is the fear of offending God, that is, of having anything that offends, opposes, or provokes God, such as sin, the world, the flesh, pride, and the will of man. Godliness is to be mingled with God in our daily life and in our service so that God is lived out of us. Reverence and godliness are two aspects of a life that every believer should have. Reverence rejects anything other than God, and godliness is God mingling with every part of our being so that we may be filled with God and be like God in order to express God. God&rsquo;s plan in the universe can be accomplished only by our living a life of reverence and godliness.</p>
<p>Our problem is that in our daily living we do not revere God nor do we express godliness. We are often loose, without restraint; we let the world usurp God&rsquo;s place within us, and we live by the flesh and the self. We often set God aside; hence, we are short of being mingled with God, and we cut off the way to receive grace. This is the reason that God judges us. God&rsquo;s judging is a purging that removes our irreverence and ungodliness. His judging also shakes everything that can be shaken within us, including the world, the flesh, the self, and the natural man.</p>
<p>God uses various means to judge and purge His people. Sometimes He allows us to suffer from sickness or poor health. Sometimes He lets our business fail, or He may allow troubles to arise in our family. Examples of God&rsquo;s judging are beyond enumeration. Before God stretches forth His hand of judgment, we live in peace and security, seemingly serving God, but in reality there is not much reverence and dependence on Him. Although we are for Him, we also are full of the self. Once His judging hand comes upon us, all our excuses and wrong concepts fall away. When we are subdued under His hand, we will abhor the self.</p>
<p>I had a schoolmate who loved the Lord and was reverent, godly, and blessed by God. Later, he became wealthy and lived an affluent life, but his heart toward the Lord became cold. Eventually, he stopped attending the meetings. When several brothers visited him, he was not aware of his condition and even justified his actions. One day he was captured by the Japanese military government and suffered much in prison. After his release he asked the brothers to pray that the Lord would forgive him, because he had failed the Lord&rsquo;s grace. He also confessed his sins with much weeping. This was God&rsquo;s judgment upon him in order to give him a new beginning. After this experience he and his whole household once again attended the meetings and resumed their service. This example shows that God not only gives us grace; He also judges us. When His grace is blocked from reaching us, He clears up the blockage by judging us so that we may receive more grace.</p>
<p>Only a person who has fallen short of God&rsquo;s grace and has been judged by God knows the meaning of reverence and godliness. Such a person does not have excuses or wrong concepts. Those who have not been judged do not know reverence or godliness and have many wrong concepts. A believer who is full of arguments, murmurings, excuses, and wrong concepts does not know reverence or godliness. He has not passed through God&rsquo;s judging hand, and he is short of grace. If God has mercy on him, he will be judged by God. God shakes everything that is incompatible with His nature so that His children can serve Him with reverence and godliness.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S JUDGING AND GIVING GRACE</h2>
<p>Even though God&rsquo;s judgment is to clear out the negative things within us, His purpose is to give us grace so that we may have a new beginning. God does not stop with judgment. His judging puts an end to everything that is old in order for Him to gain new ground and begin a fresh work. He wants to create more and to give more grace. God judges in order to give grace, and He gives grace after He judges.</p>
<p>Concerning the Holy Spirit, John 16:8 says, &ldquo;When He comes, He will convict the world concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment.&rdquo; This is the judging God executing His judgment through the Holy Spirit. God judges His people in order to convict them and to open the way for them to receive His grace. If we ignore His shining and reject His judging, we will close the way to God&rsquo;s grace, and as a result, we will lose His blessing. If we are willing to accept His judging and be convicted by it, we will open the way for Him to give us grace so that His blessings can reach us. God judges us in order to bring us into His grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">COOPERATING WITH GOD&rsquo;S JUDGING</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s intention in judging man, especially His people, is to open a way for His work of grace; hence, we should have a proper attitude toward His judging. We should be humble and bow down to God&rsquo;s judgment; we should judge ourselves according to His judgment. Then He will open a way for His rich blessings to come upon us. The more thoroughly we receive His judgment, the more we will receive His grace. However, if we are insensitive to God&rsquo;s judgment or even defy it and remain in darkness, His judgment will become our loss. The effect of God&rsquo;s judging us, whether it is a gain or a loss, depends on how we receive it.</p>
<p>In order to do any work of grace in man, God needs man&rsquo;s cooperation. God&rsquo;s judging is not an exception. God&rsquo;s goal is not to judge us; He wants us to receive His judging light so that we can be blessed. The more thoroughly we receive His judgment, the more grace we will receive, and the more we will grow in the divine life. Those who do not act upon God&rsquo;s judging light cannot receive grace.</p>
<p>In order to be regenerated, man must receive God&rsquo;s judgment. The Spirit convicts man concerning sin and concerning righteousness and concerning judgment. When a person judges himself according to the conviction of the Holy Spirit, he is immediately saved by grace. Otherwise, God has no way to save that person. This shows that in order for us to receive grace from God, we must cooperate with His judging.</p>
<p>Isaiah 57:15 says that God will dwell with the contrite and lowly of spirit. A person with a contrite and lowly spirit is a person who receives God&rsquo;s judging. Verse 14 says, &ldquo;Cast up, cast up; prepare the way; / Take up the obstacle out of the way of My people.&rdquo; From the context, <em>the obstacle</em> in this verse refers to those who are proud and unwilling to judge themselves according to God&rsquo;s light. They are proud, self-righteous, and unwilling to examine themselves; hence, they are filled with obstacles and fall into desolation. God says that we should take the obstacle out of the way.</p>
<p>Our present need is still to remove the obstacles if we want God to give us grace. A believer who is proud and conceited will condemn and criticize others, looking only at the splinter in their eye but not considering the beam in his own (Matt. 7:3). He is stumbled by pride and self-conceit, and the way for him to receive grace is blocked. Furthermore, he can become an obstacle, frustrating others from receiving God&rsquo;s grace. If we are considerate of the Lord&rsquo;s heart, we will learn to be humble and judge ourselves according to His light. Instead of being proud, we will see our poor condition and our weakness, and we will realize our need for the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and rebukes. When we are willing to place such a demand on ourselves, rather than on the saints, our contriteness and humbleness will open the way to receive God&rsquo;s grace.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;If we discerned ourselves, we would not be judged&rdquo; (1 Cor. 11:31). David said, &ldquo;The sacrifices of God are a broken spirit; / A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise&rdquo; (Psa. 51:17). In order for the Lord to revive our locality, many of us must humbly accept the Lord&rsquo;s rebuke in His judging light. This is the way for us to receive grace, and it is also the way for the church to bring in God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSUMMATE JUDGMENT OF GOD</h2>
<p>Let me repeat: our God is a judging God, and we need to revere Him. God&rsquo;s judging is a serious matter. If we do not revere and express Him, we will face His ultimate judgment.</p>
<p>God ends every age with judgment. He has judged every age in human history. Eventually, there will be a consummate judgment, which will include the church. The churches are always being judged by God and will eventually face a consummate judgment. This also applies to individuals: we are judged by God during our lives, and eventually we will face a consummate judgment.</p>
<p>The Lord said, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens is just like a man about to go abroad, who called his own slaves and delivered to them his possessions. To one he gave five talents, and to another two, and to another one, to each according to his own ability. And he went abroad...Now after a long time the master of those slaves came and settled accounts with them&rdquo; (Matt. 25:14-15, 19). On the one hand, we are God&rsquo;s children and members of His household (Eph. 2:19). On the other hand, we are His slaves, and one day He will come to settle accounts with us. The settling of accounts is His judging. Everything we have&mdash;whether it be a healthy body, a sober mind, material riches, or spiritual gifts&mdash;was given to us by God. Since He gave us these things, we have a responsibility, and with it comes judgment. One day He will ask how we used the gifts that He gave us: did we hide them in the earth, or did we use them to do business? He gave us light. Did we give it to those who were short of light? He gave us power. Did we sustain the weak with it? He gave us material riches. Did we use them to care for those in need? God will inquire concerning the things He gave us. As much as He has given us is as much as He will demand from us. Grace comes with a responsibility, which brings in judgment. God&rsquo;s judgment begins from the house of God (1 Pet. 4:17). The Bible shows that at the end of time God will judge all things. Now, God is judging us at the end of every stage of our Christian life.</p>
<p>The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;I am conscious of nothing against myself; but I am not justified in this, but He who examines me is the Lord. So then do not judge anything before the time, until the Lord comes, who will both bring to light the hidden things of darkness and make manifest the counsels of the hearts&rdquo; (1 Cor. 4:4-5). In Romans Paul says that we will all stand before the judgment seat of God and give an account concerning ourselves to God (14:10, 12). Each one of us will come under God&rsquo;s great judgment. Today we may criticize and judge our brothers, but in that day God will make us explain our words of criticism and judgment. The Lord said that we will render an account of every idle word on the day of judgment, for by our words we will be justified or condemned (Matt. 12:36-37). The day of judgment is awesome. Regardless of who we are, in that day &ldquo;we must all be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ, that each one may receive the things done through the body according to what he has practiced, whether good or bad&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:10).</p>
<p>We revere God because He is the living God, and we express godliness because He is the God of resurrection. But He is also the judging God. On the day of judgment His eyes will be like a flame of fire, His feet will be like shining bronze that has been fired in a furnace, and out of His mouth will proceed a sharp two-edged sword (Rev. 1:14-16; 19:12). He will indeed be frightening. If on the day of judgment we still have things that are not of God or are incompatible with God, such as sin, the flesh, natural affections, the world, and the self, they will be searched out by the flaming fire in His eyes, cut off by the sharp sword from His mouth, and trampled on by His feet of shining bronze.</p>
<p>We thank the Lord that today He is judging us in the course of our life in order to give us new opportunities and new beginnings before His consummate judging. This is His mercy; otherwise, we would be condemned along with the world. In this process every judgment is a reminder and a deliverance. With each new beginning, God gives us fresh grace. If we do not receive His judging, we will face His judgment on the ultimate day of His judgment. May the Lord have mercy on us so that we would know Him as the judging God who is not mocked.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE GOD OF BLESSING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Job 42:3, 5-6, 10, 12; Ruth 1:19-21; 4:13-14; 2 Cor. 7:9-11; James 4:6</h1>
<p>The various words used to describe God in the Bible are revelations of His attributes. We must pay attention to these descriptions if we are to know the kind of God that He is and His relationship with us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOD OF BLESSING</h2>
<p>The Bible calls God the creating God (Gen. 1:1; Psa. 100:3; Isa. 45:18), the redeeming God (Job 19:25; Psa. 19:14; 78:35), the judging God (Gen. 18:25; Psa. 7:11; 9:7), and the God of blessing (Gen. 1:22, 28; Psa. 115:13). These four attributes represent the four stages of God&rsquo;s relationship with man. In Genesis the creating God created the heavens, the earth, everything in between, and man. When man fell, God came to redeem man not merely as the creating God but as the redeeming God. Since people reject God&rsquo;s redemption, they are under His judgment, and thus He is also the judging God. Sometimes the redeemed have problems that hinder God from giving them grace. As a result, He judges them too. God&rsquo;s primary goal in judging man is not punishment but the giving of grace. The Bible says, &ldquo;He gives greater grace&rdquo; (James 4:6). Thus, God is also the grace-giving God.</p>
<p>The result of God&rsquo;s judgment is the giving of His grace so that those who are judged may know Him better as the One who is full of grace and lovingkindness. This is the experience of every believer. At the end of Revelation He is sitting on the throne of judgment in order to carry out His final judgment on the universe. This judgment brings in the new heaven and new earth with the New Jerusalem, which is wholly God&rsquo;s presence and blessing (20:11&mdash;21:3). After all creation passes through God&rsquo;s judgment, it will be brought by God into blessing. The new heaven and new earth will be full of God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>God creates, redeems, judges, and then blesses. In this process God judges in order to bless man, not to punish man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MAN&rsquo;S COOPERATION</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s blessing needs man&rsquo;s cooperation. God judges man in order to bless man; however, if those who are being judged do not cooperate with God&rsquo;s judging but rather despise and resist it unrepentantly, God has no way to give them grace or to bless them. In such a situation nothing is beyond God&rsquo;s judgment because God cannot bless an unrepentant man. A believer who is willing to judge, condemn, and convict himself according to God&rsquo;s judging can receive God&rsquo;s blessing and more grace. In this situation God&rsquo;s judging brings in blessing. Such a believer experiences God as the God of blessing.</p>
<p>The first step to being blessed by God is for a believer to judge himself. When God comes to us, the first thing that He does is to judge us. If we judge and convict ourselves according to His light, He will bring us into His blessing. The more we receive grace, the more we judge ourselves. A person who is self-righteous is short of God&rsquo;s grace and presence. A person who is visited by God is constantly under God&rsquo;s judging.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF JOB</h2>
<p>The experience of Job is a good illustration. According to the Bible, Job was perfect and upright, and he feared God and turned away from evil (Job 1:1). God even testified concerning Job (v. 8). However, Job was a self-righteous man who lacked a contrite and lowly spirit; hence, God could not bless him. When he was struck by God, his self-righteousness was impregnable. Job said, &ldquo;I would speak to the Almighty, / And I desire to argue with God&rdquo; (13:3), and &ldquo;Oh that I knew where I might find Him, / That I might come to His seat! / I would present my cause in order before Him, / And I would fill my mouth with arguments&rdquo; (23:3-4). In the debate between Job and his friends, Job said that he wanted to reason with God. He was self-righteous and in darkness.</p>
<p>After Jehovah answered Job (chs. 38&mdash;41), Job saw God with his eyes, he met God&rsquo;s light, and he abhorred himself and repented in dust and ashes (42:3, 5-6). Job saw that he was wrong and filthy. This self-righteous man fell before God, and he convicted himself and repented according to God&rsquo;s judging light.</p>
<p>Job saw light and was able to judge himself because of God&rsquo;s judging. Formerly, Job seemed to be enclosed in an impregnable fortress in which was complete darkness; he was without light. Therefore, God had to judge him, striking his environment, his family, and his body. Eventually, everything was taken away. Job had severe boils from the sole of his foot to the crown of his head (2:7). Then God&rsquo;s judging broke through this impregnable fortress. Job was exposed before God and shined on by God. As a result, he judged himself in God&rsquo;s light, abhorred himself, and repented in dust and ashes.</p>
<p>Once Job judged and convicted himself in this way, God&rsquo;s blessing came in, and he received grace. &ldquo;Jehovah gave Job twice as much as he had before&rdquo; (v. 10). Job also prayed for his three friends, and his prayer was accepted and blessed by God (vv. 8-9).</p>
<p>Job&rsquo;s case shows that the purpose of God&rsquo;s judging man is not to cause man to suffer but to bring man into peace and blessing. God is a judging God in order to bless us and give us grace. Judging precedes blessing, and blessing follows judging; judging paves the way for blessing, and blessing accomplishes the purpose of God&rsquo;s judging. However, we must cooperate with God&rsquo;s judging in order to find grace and receive His blessing. As soon as we judge ourselves according to His judging, we can receive His blessing.</p>
<p>The Scriptures say, &ldquo;God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble&rdquo; (James 4:6). &ldquo;The proud&rdquo; are self-righteous persons who always condemn others, not themselves. Their convicting finger always points to others, their condemning lips talk only of others, and their eyes are clear when looking at others&rsquo; weaknesses and shortcomings but blurred when looking at themselves. They are like the self-justified Pharisee; while praying in the temple, he condemned others yet expected God&rsquo;s blessing (Luke 18:9-12). God resists such proud persons and does not give them grace, for He cannot be a God of blessing without first being a judging God.</p>
<p>God blesses those who tremble in His presence because of His word and convict themselves according to His shining. They look at their wrongdoings, not the wrongdoings of others. Whether or not others are wrong, they do not know. They are like the tax collector, who would not even lift up his eyes to heaven when he prayed, but beat his breast, and said, &ldquo;God, be propitiated to me, the sinner!&rdquo; (v. 13). Such believers are humble persons. It is not a wonder that God can give them grace, because they give Him the opportunity, that is, open the way for Him, to give grace. God&rsquo;s grace can reach them, and God can be a God of blessing to them.</p>
<p>God gives grace to the humble. When Job insisted on his self-righteousness, God could only strike his pride and self-righteousness, until Job condemned and abhorred himself. Once Job humbled himself and felt unworthy of God&rsquo;s grace, then grace reached him, and he experienced God as the God of blessing.</p><h2 class="head1">THE STORY OF NAOMI</h2>
<p>The principle of God&rsquo;s blessing is also seen in the case of Naomi in the book of Ruth. Elimelech, his wife Naomi, and their two sons left Canaan, the land blessed by God, and went to the country of Moab (1:1). The Moabites were descendants of Lot who were produced through an improper union (Gen. 19:30-37). They were abominable to God and accursed by Him: &ldquo;A Moabite shall not enter the congregation of Jehovah; even to the tenth generation, no descendant of theirs shall enter the congregation of Jehovah forever&rdquo; (Deut. 23:3). Elimelech, Naomi, and their two sons went astray; they left the blessed land and went to an accursed land. This brought in God&rsquo;s judgment. Naomi&rsquo;s husband and two sons died, leaving Naomi with her two daughters-in-law, Orpah and Ruth (Ruth 1:1-5). God&rsquo;s hand upon Naomi was indeed severe.</p>
<p>If, instead of being subdued under such a severe judging, Naomi had made excuses and complained to God, she would have closed the door to receiving grace from God. However, she was subdued, and upon hearing that God had visited His people by giving them food, she rose up to return to the land of Judah from the country of Moab with Ruth (vv. 6-7). Naomi was subdued, not hardened, by God&rsquo;s judging. All the city of Bethlehem was stirred because of them, and Naomi said, &ldquo;Do not call me Naomi; call me Mara; for the All-sufficient One has dealt very bitterly with me. I went out full, but Jehovah has brought me back empty...The All-sufficient One has dealt harshly with me&rdquo; (vv. 19-21). <em>Naomi</em> means &ldquo;my pleasantness,&rdquo; but <em>Mara</em> means &ldquo;bitterness.&rdquo; This shows that she was bitter within; she condemned and convicted herself under God&rsquo;s judging hand and willingly suffered humiliation without argument or resentment.</p>
<p>Since Naomi was humbled and subdued under God&rsquo;s judging hand, God&rsquo;s blessing was brought in. Boaz married Ruth and bore a son, Obed, but the women neighbors said, &ldquo;A son has been born to Naomi&rdquo; (4:13-17). Obed was the grandfather of David, who was according to God&rsquo;s heart. The Lord Jesus came from the line of Obed. What a blessing this was that came upon Naomi after she was judged and stricken by God! Because she was humble and accepted God&rsquo;s judgment, He became the God of blessing to her. This case shows that God&rsquo;s heart is to bless, but man&rsquo;s questionable condition requires God&rsquo;s judging hand first. God&rsquo;s judging hand comes because His blessing heart wants to bring man into His blessing. Whoever is willing to judge and condemn himself under God&rsquo;s judging will meet grace and receive blessing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HUMBLY JUDGING ONESELF<br />
AND RECEIVING GOD&rsquo;S BLESSING</h2>
<p>The God of blessing blesses us according to one principle. We receive His blessing when we humbly judge ourselves according to His judgment. For instance, a worker of the Lord might labor diligently but not see results, just like when the disciples toiled through the whole night but did not catch any fish (Luke 5:1-5). A co-worker who finds himself in such a condition should realize that this is the Lord&rsquo;s judging hand. This worker either needs God&rsquo;s dealing and discipline, or he needs God&rsquo;s purging and purifying. If the co-worker is enlightened by this dealing and is subdued under God&rsquo;s hand to judge, convict, condemn, and deal with himself, God&rsquo;s blessing will surely come upon him, and the effect of his labor will be manifested. However, if the co-worker remains hard&mdash;complaining, criticizing, or rebuking others&mdash;or is self-satisfied, God&rsquo;s blessing will not come to him. He will know God only as the judging God, not as the God of blessing.</p>
<p>Such experiences apply not only to the co-workers but also to everyone who has been saved by grace. A businessman or an entrepreneur who has incurred a great loss or has suffered frequent disasters should not think such occurrences are coincidental. We must see God&rsquo;s judging hand, be subdued, and ask Him to shine. If we would accept His discipline and His shining by judging ourselves in His light, He will have a way in us, and we will come out of our bitter circumstances.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to the sisters who have a family. Children are often naughty and unruly even when disciplined or admonished. It seems that the more a mother disciplines them, the worse they become. Many sisters worry to the point of tears concerning their children. This is also God&rsquo;s judging. A child&rsquo;s condition often reflects his parents&rsquo; condition before God. If the sisters are willing to be subdued in this matter, God will shine and let them know their condition. The sisters will see how unrestrained and hard they have been in not loving God, not wanting Him, and despising His salvation. If they would repent and judge themselves in this light, God would bless them so that they experience Him more, and their children would change. This is often the way that God blesses Christians.</p>
<p>A great principle for God&rsquo;s children to learn is that in order to be blessed by God, there is a need to be humble. God judges us in order to make us humble so that we may be blessed by Him. God resists the proud but gives grace to the humble (James 4:6). A humble person, that is, a person who can inherit God&rsquo;s grace, judges and convicts himself according to God&rsquo;s judgment and repents (2 Cor. 7:9-11). God is continually doing a judging and disciplining work within us. If we cooperate with His judging, we will bring in His blessing. Blessed are the humble, for God will give them grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S MANIFOLD BLESSINGS</h2>
<p>There are manifold blessings that issue from God&rsquo;s judging. First, we gain more of God when He judges us through His shining; that is, God&rsquo;s element increases in us, and we partake of His nature. Second, through God&rsquo;s judging we are forgiven by God, experience His grace, and are filled with peace. Third, God&rsquo;s grace and blessing change our environment, and we turn from our bitter circumstances to enjoy more of His care.</p>
<p>We are thankful that He is the God of blessing. Although He is also the judging God, He judges in order to bless. In order for God to be the God of blessing, He must first be the judging God so as to open a way for us to receive His blessing. May we all touch the way to receive God&rsquo;s blessing and judge ourselves in humility. Then we will experience the God of blessing.</p></body></html>
