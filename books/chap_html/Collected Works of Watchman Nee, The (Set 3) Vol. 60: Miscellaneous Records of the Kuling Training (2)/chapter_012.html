A fallen man has no heart for God whatsoever. This is the testimony of the Bible. A fallen sinner belongs totally to this world and is totally sold to sin. He has nothing good to say about God's word whatsoever. Hence, in order to preach the gospel to a sinner, our first objective should not be to make him understand the gospel. Rather, our first objective should be to help him grasp one or two of God's words. We should create a feeling of need within him. Our job is not merely to relate some gospel stories, truths, or news. The purpose of our preaching is to create a sense of need for the gospel in a sinner. We are not here merely to make him understand the gospel or to be clear about the doctrines. Even if he knows and understands the gospel in his mind, he still may not feel the need for God Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">TWO FEELINGS A SINNER MUST HAVE<br />IN ORDER TO BE SAVED</h2><p>In order for a sinner to be saved, he must have two feelings. The first is a sense of need, and the second is a sense of sin. A gospel preacher's primary work is to stir up a sense of need and a sense of sin in man. In preaching the gospel to the Samaritan woman, the Lord did not first show her the gospel or her own sin. He awoke a sense of need within her. She came to fetch water because she was thirsty. The Lord Jesus began by speaking about her outward thirst and went on to speak about her inward thirst. The Lord kept stirring up a sense of need within the woman. Eventually, she said, "Sir, give me this water so that I will not thirst nor come here to draw" (John 4:15). However, the Lord did not give her a drink immediately, but instead asked for her husband. This awakened a sense of sin within her. The Lord was wise. He pointed out her sense of need with the water and then led her to the sense of sin by referring to her husbands. In the end she was saved. Every gospel preacher should read all the gospel messages in the Bible carefully at least once. From these messages he should pick up the principles for preaching the gospel.</p><p>We know that every sinner dwells in darkness. He has no thought for God and surely does not want God. His thoughts are altogether in darkness. In order to preach the gospel to him, we must first cast light upon the darkness of his mind. We should shed light on his thoughts through God's word. In announcing the Lord's redemption to sinners, our emphasis should be to create a sense of need within them for the gospel; we have to create such a need in their heart. After they sense this need, we can explain the gospel to them in detail. In preaching the gospel, we must first cause our listeners to be dissatisfied with their present condition; we must impart a sense of hunger in them. They will want God's salvation only after a sense of need has been awakened in them.</p><p>A sinner is in total darkness as far as his relationship with God is concerned; he cannot respond to God in any way. Our job is to lead him to salvation. Therefore, in preaching the gospel we have to impart God's word into his heart with a very strong spirit. As a consequence of this, God's word will not leave; it will take root in his heart. Then we can say what we want to say. By lodging God's word within man, we have a handle with which we can pry open his heart and awaken a sense of need within him. A sinner is often saved by the kind of word we deposit within him. In preaching the gospel, we impart a thought within a sinner and then create a need within him based on this thought. In His preaching to the Samaritan woman, the Lord made a few quick turns before bringing the woman to her salvation. First, He created within her the sense of need. Next, He showed her her sins, and then she was saved. Our Lord is not only the Savior; He is a Savior who is good at saving. No other person can preach the gospel as well as the Lord did in the four Gospels.</p>
