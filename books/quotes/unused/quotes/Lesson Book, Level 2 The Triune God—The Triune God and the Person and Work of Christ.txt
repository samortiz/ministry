The God who became incarnated to die for us so that we might be redeemed, forgiven, washed, justified, and reconciled is one
In Matthew 28:19 the Lord Jesus says, 'Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
Although we cannot understand this mystery of the Trinity of the Godhead, we can receive and enjoy this mysterious God
Although we cannot fully understand it, we may, according to all that is declared in the Bible, accept whatever is said and enjoy Him
In Lesson One we saw that there is only one God, yet mysteriously this God is Triune the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
Praise the Lord, we can simply receive and enjoy this mysterious One according to what the Scriptures have said!
The Bible does not say that the Father existed for a certain period of time, then the Father became the Son so the Father stopped existing
Neither does it say that after a certain period of time the Son no longer existed because He became the Spirit
The people teaching this think that God exists in three successive modes or stages: first the Father, then the Son, and finally the Spirit
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit not only coexist but also coinhere, which means that they live within one another
He was God in the beginning ; He was God when He lived as a man two thousand years ago; He is God today and will be God forever
In 14:26 He says that the Father will send the Spirit; later in 15:26 He says that the Son Himself will send the Spirit
We must say that the Spirit was sent by both the Father and the Son because, as we saw in the last lesson, the Father and the Son are one
You should have learned from Lesson Three that the Greek word for 'from' means 'by the side of,' and often means 'from-with'
Let us look at the following verses: John 1:1 says, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God'
As we all know, the Word that was God became flesh and that flesh is just our Lord Jesus Christ; this Jesus is also the everlasting Father
When you feel that your friends are tempting you to do things not of the Lord, you should call more, call louder
The Spirit, the Triune God, will come to save you out of your present trouble, out of yourself, and out of your situation
Praise the Lord that He went through a process to become the Spirit, and that He has given us His name, 'Lord Jesus'!
In order to carry out this tremendous purpose, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit each have a distinct function
Having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will
In Whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace
These verses tell us that it was God the Father who planned in eternity past how everything would work together to produce the church
To accomplish this required the work of the Son 'in Whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses'
We know that His death was all-inclusive : it crucified our sinful nature, crushed the Devil's head, and released God's divine life
Now all that God is, all that Christ is, and what Christ has accomplished, obtained, and attained is made real to us by the Spirit
On the other hand if the Father, Son, and Spirit were three Gods but not one, we could receive only the Spirit, one of the Three
He as the Father has planned, He as the Son has accomplished, and He as the Spirit is now ready to apply the Triune God to us
At the same time that the Triune God entered into us through our believing and calling on His name, He also put us into Himself
Ephesians 4:6 tells us that the Father is in us: 'One God and Father of all, Who is over all and through all and in all'
The Son Jesus Christ is also in us as revealed by Galatians 220 Christ lives in me and Colossians 127 Christ in you the hope of glory
Before His crucifixion, the Lord Jesus pointed out to His disciples that the Spirit would be in them: 'Even the Spirit of reality
John 2:23 says, 'Everyone who denies the Son does not have the Father either; he who confesses the Son has the Father also'
The Father is in the Son, and the Son is the Spirit who comes into us that we may have and enjoy such a Triune God
In Matthew 2819 the Lord commanded His disciples to baptize new believers into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit
When we were baptized through believing in the Lord, not only did the Triune God come into us, but we were also put into the Triune God
These verses clearly show us that not only the Father and the Son are coinhering; even we the believers are coinhering with the Triune God
Specifically, the Bible tells us in 1 Corinthians 1:30 that we are in Christ: 'But of Him you are in Christ Jesus'
Satan cannot touch you, the world cannot influence you, the whole creation will be under you, and your friends will thank you
Certainly we cannot cover everything in the Bible in six lessons, but we will mention some of the crucial points
The Old Testament is full of the Triune God for our experience; it is just that He is still somewhat hidden and presented in symbols
With the help of the New Testament to explain the pictures in the Old Testament, we will see how excellent and experiential our God is
In the Hebrew language the subject 'God' is triple in number, whereas the verb 'created' is singular in number
After mans fall God again uses the plural pronoun for Himself The Lord God said Behold the man is become as one of us to know good and evil
In Genesis 11, men had become so rebellious against God that they built the tower of Babel and the city of Babel
We can see clearly that when God uses the plural pronoun in speaking about Himself, it is always in His relation to man
In Genesis 1 when God was creating all the other things He never used the plural pronoun for Himself though the word God is triple in number
In Exodus 3:6 the Lord said to Moses, 'I am the God of thy father, the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob'
By the experiences of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, we can see something of the Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit
With Abraham we see one who was called out of a godless background to participate in God's blessing and purpose
We cannot understand this symbol in a shallow way: it is not just an object that holds some lamps to give light in the dark
In Lesson Twelve we will see how the lampstand in Revelation shows something even more wonderful about the expression of the Triune God
Moses' striking the rock shows us that when Christ died on the cross, He was judged by the authority of God's law
The Israelites could not have the water without the smitten rock, and we cannot have the Spirit without the judged Christ
We hope you realize by this lesson that the Old Testament is not just some stories about the children of Israel
The pictures in the Old Testament greatly help us appreciate and enjoy the Triune God; each one is surely worth a thousand words
Beginning with the Gospels of Matthew, Mark, Luke, and John, the New Testament reveals the Triune God to us in a further and clearer way
The Gospel of John goes much further to show us that this Jesus is the Triune God who comes to be our life essentially
In the four Gospels the Son, portrayed as the good shepherd, comes first to accomplish redemption, the foundation of God's salvation
The Father is waiting for us to return , and eventually He brings us back into His house , which is the church
Immediately after Saul of Tarsus was caught by the Lord, Ananias charged him to be baptized, calling on the name of the Lord
In Matthew 28:19 the Lord charged the disciples to baptize the believers into the name of the Father, of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit
To be baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus is the same as being baptized into the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit
When you were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus you were put into the Person of the Lord, the Triune God
Verses 9 through 11 say 'the Spirit of God dwells in you'; 'And if Christ is in you'; and 'His Spirit Who indwells you'
Because God is essentially one, we only sense one in us; but God is economically three because He wants to get into us
The love of God is the source, the grace of the Lord is the course, and the fellowship of the Spirit brings the grace with the love into us
Christ the Son's coming is for the accomplishment of salvation and our full enjoyment of God, so he said, 'the grace of the Lord'
That is absolutely right; but you should always remember that God's dispensing is for producing His expression
The people in the world express unrighteousness, but because of experiencing God's dispensing you express God as righteousness
We need to pray, call on His name, and read the Word so that He could dispense more of Himself into us so that we could express Him
Ephesians 2 starts by showing that we were fallen into sin and death and that we were even walking in the realm of sin and death
God, because of His great love, came to enliven us, to raise us up from the dead, and to exalt us and seat us in the heavens
Christ is the means, the element, and the sphere for God to enliven us, to raise us up, and to seat us in the heavens
The Father came to us through the Son in the Spirit, and now the Spirit brings us back to the Father, through the Son
To be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith'
With such help we hope you will want to read more of the Epistles to enjoy and experience the dispensing of our wonderful God
In Revelation the book which reveals things in an ultimate way we see something deeper higher richer and sweeter concerning the Triune God
All the features of the holy city that John describes are wonderful signs showing us the Triune God and His economy
On the east three gates, and on the north three gates, and on the south three gates, and on the west three gates'
The three gates on each side signify that the Triune God the Father, Son, and Spirit works together to bring people into the holy city
We should greatly appreciate such a three-one God for our threefold existence; He is our Creator, Redeemer, and Regenerator
Although we cannot understand how our God can be three-one, we have seen that He is three-one in order to dispense Himself into us
The lampstand that symbolized the Triune God has now become the seven lampstands which are the seven churches!
The branches of the vine are its body; if you cut off all the branches you would be left with just a bare stem
The ultimate intention of the Triune God is that He might be worked into us and mingled with us until He and we become a mutual abode
As we receive the dispensing of the Triune God into us, we should dispense Him into others to bear them as fruit
The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Triune God into His chosen and redeemed people
Verse 11 says that the light of the New Jerusalem 'was like a most precious stone, as a jasper stone, clear as crystal'
God's eternal desire is to get a group of people who are fully mingled with Him to be His universal expression and mutual dwelling place
God wanted many more such men, so in Acts we see Him as the Spirit propagating Himself into tens of thousands of believers
In Revelation we see the final product, the ultimate consummation, of the Triune God's dispensing the New Jerusalem
It begins with God's image for His expression, and it ends with a vast, immense, splendid corporate expression
Many people throughout history have not been clear about this matter, so they have developed many heresies about Christ's Person and work
Lessons Thirteen through Twenty-Four present the major points about Christ and His work which we see from the pure revelation of the Bible
These verses clearly tell us that Christ is the Creator of all things; all things have been created and have come into being through Him
Some people teach that Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the Firstborn before all creation and that He is thus not a creature
Christ is a creature because He became 'flesh' , took part of 'blood and flesh' , was born a 'child' , and became a 'man'
Christ did this not only to become our Savior, but more importantly to bring God into man, divinity into humanity
A proper realization of Christ's incarnation is the first and crucial step for our understanding of the Person and work of Christ
When Jesus was to be conceived, God sent the angel Gabriel who said, 'He will be great, and will be called, Son of the Most High
As we shall see in a later lesson it was necessary for Christ to know no sin and to be without sin in order for Him to accomplish redemption
Although He cared very much for their salvation, He always contacted them in a way which gave no appearance of evil
We as the church must be very different from todays constantly degrading society so that God can be expressed through the highest humanity
Today, when you see that you are short of the standard of Jesus' humanity, you can open to Him, call on Him, and receive the Spirit
Having lived an excellent human life for thirty-three and a half years after His incarnation, the Lord Jesus went to the cross
On one hand the Lord was crucified by men, but on the other hand He went to the cross willingly in order to accomplish God's eternal purpose
In order to see this, we will take the next two lessons to look at five things that the Lord was when He died on the cross
The Bible tells us that He died as the Lamb of God, the brass serpent, the last Adam, the peacemaker, and the grain of wheat
In John 1:29 when John the Baptist saw Jesus, he proclaimed to everyone: 'Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world'!
Because of His love, God told the people they could substitute lambs and other cattle as sacrifices for their sins
By believing in the Lord Jesus, we are completely forgiven of our sins and are freed from God's penalty of death!
Sinning can frustrate our fellowship with the Lord, but Christ's death as the Lamb of God fully takes care of this problem
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous that He may forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
In the Old Testament, when the children of Israel sinned against God, many of them were bitten by serpents and died
In John 3:14 the Lord said, 'As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up'
Galatians 5:24 says that 'they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with the passions and the lusts'
Adam failed God to the uttermost; instead of taking in God, he took in Satan, and thus brought all of mankind into a fallen condition
God wanted man to express Him in oneness, but man became separated into many races, nationalities, and classes
There are often hatred and fighting among these groups between black and white, German and French, rich and poor
People always talk about ending wars and ending prejudice, but without the cross it is impossible to end anything
When we believed and called on the Lord Jesus, He came into us and we became His multiplication, the many grains!
If we had been at the Lord's crucifixion watching with 'spiritual' eyes, we would have witnessed a tremendous scene
God was there working out His eternal purpose, and Satan and all the powers of hell were there battling, trying to frustrate Him
Heretical teachings about Christ come from having an inadequate understanding of the Bible's description of Him
He had the Spirit essentially for life at His birth and He received the Spirit economically for power at His baptism
When Jesus was crucified on the cross, the sins of the human race were put on Him; He was made sin on our behalf
We read in 1 Peter 3:18 that, on the cross, Christ was 'being put to death in flesh, but made alive in spirit'
Not only so but as the resurrected One He is also in us to live for us a life that can be justified by God and is always acceptable to God
When Christ was in the flesh during His thirty-three and a half years on the earth, He was exactly like the flower seed
By being sown into death and growing up in resurrection, He blossomed that is, the divine life within Him was fully displayed, glorified
Since Christ was already the Son of God, why did He need to be designated the Son of God through resurrection?
Although the Lord Jesus was resurrected with a physical body, a body with flesh and bones , He was also resurrected spiritually
We cannot explain how He could both have a body and at the same time become the Spirit, but that is what the Bible says
Christ's resurrection is not just a historical event; it is very much for our inward experience and enjoyment of Christ
It was through His resurrection that the Lord was able to impart Himself as the life-giving Spirit into all His disciples
Many Christians speak a great deal about Christ's death on the cross, but rarely do they talk about Christ's resurrection
There He is crowned with glory and honor , has been exalted far above all, and has received the name above all names
In His ascension, Christ was made the Lord , the Ruler of the kings of the earth , as well as Head over all things
Through incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, the Lord fully accomplished the work of redemption
From studying world history we can see that the course of events has been arranged for the spread of the gospel
Even atheistic countries like Russia and China use this calendar, thus implying that they are under Christ's sovereign ruling
If you had been in Moscow, the opportunity to be saved and now to be reading this lesson might not have come to you
We should have many experiences of being reminded, comforted, strengthened, and even carried by our great High Priest
He is controlling every event on the earth from the rise and fall of nations to the teacher you get for English
As the Spirit, He can live in us and supply us inwardly; and at the same time He can empower us and work with us outwardly
Fifty days later on the day of Pentecost, the ascended Christ on the throne poured Himself out upon the disciples
Christ's living will become ours, the negative things in us will be killed, and our life will be a life in resurrection
The disciples were already filled with the Spirit for life, but they needed to be 'clothed with power from on high' for the work
That would be His multiplication and spreading His propagation for the producing of the churches over the entire earth
God's desire is for a universal expression of Himself, a corporate man that is filled with His life and nature
To produce this expression, God has ordained that it be carried out by mortal men on the earth cooperating and coordinating with Him
When we exercise our faith in this way we will find that hell, Satan, and the demons cannot prevail against our ministry
Clothed with Him economically, we dispense Him to others that they may also enjoy Him as their life essentially
Knowing that we have the Spirit as our 'uniform,' we should carry out God's work of spreading and multiplying Himself into others
These overcomers are the believers on the earth who have kept themselves from the defilement of worldly things
The majority of Christians who are alive at that time will have to go through all or part of this great tribulation
These are the Christians who did not fully give themselves to be separated from the world in order to be filled up with Christ
Before the end of the great tribulation, Christ will have descended to a place in the air to set up His judgment seat
To be mature in life means that the Christ who came into us has fully grown up till every part of our soul is filled with Him
These include preaching the gospel for others to be saved, serving in the church, and functioning in the church meetings
To meet the Lord, we must be proper and balanced in these two areas --life essentially and service economically
Matthew 25:10 says, 'The bridegroom came, and those who were ready went in with him to the marriage feast, and the door was shut'
In His secret coming to the air He will be clothed with the cloud, but in His open coming to the earth He will be on the cloud
When you would prefer staying in bed rather than getting up a few minutes early to enjoy Christ in the Word, remember the principle
After this judgment, the old heaven and the old earth will pass away and eternity will begin with a new heaven and a new earth
By then, Christ will have eliminated every negative thing in the universe including Satan, his followers, and the world
Through Christs work man will have been fully redeemed transformed glorified and built up into the corporate expression of the Triune God
The New Jerusalem is not a physical city; rather it symbolizes what God is to His people and how His people will be fully mingled with Him
In the center of this symbolic city is the throne of God and of the Lamb, out from which flows a river of water of life
We were condemned to be in the eternal lake of fire; but instead, for eternity we shall thank the 'Lamb-God' that He saved us
The river, as typified by the rivers in Genesis 2:10-14, Psalm 46:4, and Ezekiel 47:5-9, signifies the abundance of life in its flow
It is one river, flowing through the four directions of the holy city like the four heads of the one river in Genesis 2:10-14
The water of life is a symbol of God in Christ as the Spirit flowing Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply
Eventually, in the new heaven and new earth, for eternity, all God's redeemed will enjoy Christ as the tree of life as their eternal portion
He is qualified to be such a husband to marry the wife, who is the consummation of all the redeemed and regenerated people of God
The processed tripartite man will match the processed Triune God forever for His full expression and satisfaction
