   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Son has a more excellent name than the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hebrews 1:4 speaks of Christ having become as much better than the angels as to have inherited a more distinguished name than they.</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>with the Oil of Exultant Joy above His Partners</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hebrews 1:9, which is addressed to Christ the Son says, You have loved righteousness and hated lawlessness; therefore God, Your God, has anointed You with the oil of exultant joy above Your partners.</S>

   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ was appointed in eternity past and anointed in time Heb 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That anointing was the initial heavenly, divine inauguration.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God initially inaugurated His appointed Heir into office by anointing Him.</S>

   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Verse 8 says, Of the Son, Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Here the Son is addressed, O God.</S>
