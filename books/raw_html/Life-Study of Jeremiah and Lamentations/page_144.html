<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Murder</H2><P>In the seventh month Ishmael of the royal family, one of the chief officers of the king, and ten men with him came to Gedaliah and ate bread together in Mizpah. Then Ishmael and his ten men struck down Gedaliah with the sword and put him to death (41:1-2). Ishmael also struck down all the Jews who were with Gedaliah as well as the Chaldeans, the men of war. No one knew about it. On the next day eighty men came from Shechem, Shiloh, and Samaria with meal offerings and incense in their hands to bring to the house of Jehovah. Ishmael went down to meet them and asked them to come to Gedaliah. When they came into the midst of the city, Ishmael and his men slew them and cast them into the pit, except ten who had hidden stores of wheat, barley, oil, and honey in the field. Then Ishmael took captive all the remnant of the people who were in Mizpah: the king's daughters and all the people whom Nebuzaradan the captain of the bodyguard had committed to Gedaliah. Then he went to cross over to the children of Ammon (vv. 3-10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Johanan's Victory over Ishmael</H2><P>When Johanan and all the leaders of the forces with him heard of all the evil of Ishmael, they took all the men and went to fight with Ishmael. When all the people who were with Ishmael saw Johanan and all the leaders of the forces with him, they rejoiced and turned around and came back to Johanan. Ishmael escaped from Johanan with eight men and went to Ammon (vv. 11-15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. The Direction of Johanan<br>and the Remnant of Judah</H2><P>Johanan and all the leaders of the forces with him took all the remnant of the people from Mizpah whom he brought back from Ishmael: mighty men, men of war, women and little children, and eunuchs. They went and stayed in the lodging place of Chimham (cf. 2 Sam. 19:38, 40), near Bethlehem, in order to go and enter into Egypt, for they were afraid of the Chaldeans because of the murder of Gedaliah by Ishmael (Jer. 41:16-18).</P>
