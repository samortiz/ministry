As fish must live in water and birds must exist in the air, so we must maintain our spiritual existence and living by the church meetings
In order to be a sheep which shares in the blessing of the flock, we must meet together with the flock, the church
The basic principle of the meetings of the church is that the meetings are a gathering of the believers by the Lord into His name
In gathering us together in His name, the Lord rescues us from all kinds of worldly and earthly distractions and occupations
For every church meeting we need the Lord to bring us out of everything other than Himself and to gather us together into His name
According to the original language, Matthew 18:20 says that the Lord Jesus gathers us not in His name but into His name
In 18:20 the Lord especially promises that where two or three are gathered together into His name, He will be 'in their midst'
To break bread is to eat the Lord's supper, to participate in the Lord's table, remembering the Lord who died for us
In 1 Corinthians 10:21 Paul uses the term 'the table of the Lord,' and in 11:20 he uses the term 'the Lord's supper'
In such a meeting we should think of the Lord in our hearts and behold the Lord in our spirit that we may be inspired concerning Him
The bread denotes life , the life of God, the eternal life, and the cup denotes blessing , which is God Himself as our portion
We testify of His rich and marvelous salvation to the entire universe and display His redeeming and life-imparting death
According to this fact, after we have broken bread in remembrance of the Lord, we should be led by the Lord to worship the Father
The Father surely is worthy of our worship, for He has made His Son one with us, and He has made us sons with His Son
That kind of prayer caused them to be filled outwardly with the Holy Spirit and to speak the word of God with boldness
In this message we shall continue to consider the different categories of the gathering, and then we shall go on to see the way of gathering
Corinthians 14:26 indicates that the gathering for edification by exercising the spiritual gifts is a gathering in mutuality
Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation, has a tongue, has an interpretation
We must labor on Christ, our good land, that we may reap some produce of His riches to bring to the church meeting to offer
In 1 Corinthians 1426 one has a psalm another has a teaching another has a revelation another has a tongue and another has an interpretation
Every saint should have the equal right and opportunity to speak concerning Christ, to speak for Christ, and to speak forth Christ
Corinthians 14:26 indicates that when the whole church comes together in one place, we should practice mutuality
There is not a hint in the New Testament that in a church meeting there should be just one or two persons speaking
The gathering for edification by exercising the spiritual gifts in mutuality and by speaking should be kept in peace
If they desire to learn anything, let them ask their own husbands at home; for it is a shame for a woman to speak in the church'
According to 11:5, women can prophesy with their head covered, and Acts 2:17 and 18 and 21:9 confirm that there were women prophesying
According to the teaching of the entire New Testament, sisters may prophesy, but they do not have the authority to define doctrines
On the other hand, the sisters should be careful to stay within the boundary and not presume to teach in the sense of defining doctrine
To teach here means to teach with authority, to define and decide the meaning of doctrines concerning divine truth
Every day, in the temple and from house to house, they did not cease teaching and bringing the good news of Jesus as the Christ'
The way of gathering in the church is to be gathered by the Lord into His name for the enjoyment of His presence
We must link Matthew 18:20 with 1 Corinthians 12:3, which says, 'No one can say, Lord Jesus, except in the Holy Spirit'
The Christian way of meeting together is fitting to God's New Testament economy, differing from the Judaic way of meeting in the synagogues
According to Acts 5:14, 'believers were all the more being added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and of women'
There should be two kinds of meetings: small meetings in the homes of the believers and large meetings in a larger meeting place
On the one hand we need to meet in the homes on the other hand when the need arises we should hold large meetings in a larger meeting place
In the larger meeting place, we should not have any definite speaker with all the congregation listening to this speaker
We must meet in the way of mutuality, with all the attendants participating in the building up of the church through their functions
As we consider the status of the church, we shall see the reality concerning the church and the real definition of the church
The Greek word translated 'church' in these verses is ekklesia, composed of two words: ek, out, and kaleo, called
According to the literal sense of the word, the church is the assembly of those called out of the world by God
In ancient times the mayor of a city would sometimes call the people together as a congregation, as an assembly, for a particular purpose
The point we would emphasize here is that the word ekklesia, according to biblical usage, refers to the church as a called out congregation
The Brethren teachers insisted on this, and the congregations among the Brethren were known as the Brethren assemblies
Although there is no plain mentioning of the church in the Old Testament, there is a picture concerning the church as the assembly
On the one hand, they were called out by God from Egypt ; on the other hand, they were the congregation gathering before God
If believers live in a particular city but do not assemble, then in a practical way there is no church in that city
The church is not a physical building without lifethe church is an assembly of living persons called out of the world by God for His purpose
Since fallen man is in the world and has even become the world, how can God fulfill His purpose with man and through man?
Because the church as the assembly is separated from the world, we may say that the church is composed of the real Hebrews
Just as our forefather Abraham was called out of the land of Chaldea, so we have been called out of the world by God to be His assembly
There must be a great and thorough separation between the church as the ekklesia and the world as the system, the cosmos, of Satan
As the assembly, the church is separated entirely for God so that He may have a means to carry out His eternal purpose
Another verse that speaks of the called ones is Romans 1:7a: 'To all who are in Rome, beloved of God, called saints'
The One who foreknew us, chose us, and predestinated us from the foundation of the world one day came to visit us
The God who purchased the church with His own blood is the processed God, the God who became a man called Jesus and Emmanuel, God with us
Because the church is composed of those who have been called by God and because the church has been purchased by God, the church is of God
To say that the church is of God means that the church is constituted of God, that it is constituted of the divine and spiritual essence
Christ's loving the church and giving Himself up for the church was for redemption and for the impartation of life
The blood was for redemption, and the water was for the impartation of life so that the church might come into existence
In Ephesians 5:25 we have the church coming into existence through Christ's loving her and giving Himself up for her
Because the church is sanctified in Christ and is loved by Christ who gave Himself up for it, the church becomes of Christ
In 1 Corinthians 1:2 Paul says, 'To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints'
According to grammar, 'to the church of God' is in apposition to 'to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints'
Paul says in 2 Corinthians 4:5, 'We do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus' sake'
To say that the church is the church of the saints means that the saints are the owners, the possessors, of the church
The elders are the servants of the saints, the apostles are the slaves of the saints, and the saints are the owners of the church
The church is of Christ, because Christ loves the church and gave Himself up for the church and because the church is in Christ
The church is also of the saints, because the saints are the components of the church and the owners of the church
Such a church is altogether an entity separated from the world unto God for the carrying out of His eternal economy
The church is the assembly, the ekklesia, a congregation called out of the world by God and separated from the world
Jacob 'took the stone that he had put for his pillow, and set it up for a pillar, and poured oil upon the top of it
The Lord referred to this word of His when He spoke to Peter in Matthew 16:18 about the building of the church
It must have been from that word that Peter obtained the concept of living stones for the building of a spiritual house which is the church
Ezra's return to Jerusalem was for the rebuilding of the temple, but Nehemiah's return was for the rebuilding of the city
Eventually, at the end of the Bible, in the book of Revelation, the house will be enlarged to become the city of New Jerusalem
Eventually, in the New Jerusalem, this pair becomes a single entity, for the entire kingdom will be God's house
Three verses which reveal that the church is the house of God are 1 Timothy 3:15; Hebrews 3:6; and 1 Peter 4:17
In Old Testament times, the house of God was the house of Israel , symbolized by the tabernacle or the temple among them
In our meetings service and ministry we should give people the impression that the living God is living moving speaking and acting among us
Christ is not separate from the members of the Body, for, as the Head of the Body, Christ dwells in all the members
For this reason, Christ should not be counted as a separate member of the Body, because He is in all the members of the Body
Paul is saying that the local saints, the saints in Ephesus, were being built together in Christ into a dwelling place of God
If you look at a person's house, you will be able to tell what kind of person he is, because a person's house is his expression
God not only desires to make home in the church and to have a resting place there; He also wants to express Himself in the church
All that He is, all that He is doing, and all that He wants to obtain are to be manifested, expressed, in the church as His dwelling place
Feeding on Christ by the nourishing milk in the word of God is not only for growing in life but also for building up
Gods building is not an ordinary building on the contrary it is the sanctuary of the holy God the temple in which the Spirit of God dwells
The church is a composition of the believers, and the believers are children of God, born of Him and having His life and nature
God's household is a matter of life and enjoyment; all believers were born of God into His household to enjoy His riches
The members of God's family added together become the household of God, which is the house, the dwelling place, of God
God does have a great family, the largest family in the universe, composed of those who have been born of Him to be His children
For this reason, after God separated us from the world, He put Himself into us, germinating us, begetting us as His children
Intrinsically speaking, therefore, the church as God's household is in our God-created, God-regenerated, and God-indwelt spirit
In 1 Timothy 3:15 Paul tells us that the church as the house of the living God is 'the pillar and base of the truth'
Truth refers to the real things revealed in the New Testament concerning Christ and the church according to God's New Testament economy
A local church should be such a building that holds, bears, and testifies the truth, the reality, of Christ and the church
God's New Testament economy is composed of two mysteries: Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ
Timothy 3:15 and 16 indicate that the church as the house of God is also the manifestation of God in the flesh-the mystery of godliness
God is manifested in the church, the Body of Christ and the house of the living God, as the enlarged, corporate expression in the flesh
Timothy 3:15b and 16 say, 'The house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth
The conjunction 'and' at the beginning of verse 16 indicates that Paul's speaking about the church in verse 15 is not finished
According to the context, godliness denotes the living of God in the church, that is, God as life lived out in the church to be expressed
The mystery of godliness is the living of a proper church, and such a living is the manifestation of God in the flesh
Ephesians 219 says You are no longer strangers and sojourners but you are fellow citizens of the saints and members of the household of God
All the believers, both Jewish and Gentile, are citizens of God's kingdom, which is a sphere wherein God exercises His authority
God's house is a matter of life and enjoyment; all believers were born of God into His household to enjoy His riches
On the one hand, we are members of God's household; on the other hand, we are citizens of God's nation, of God's kingdom
Although the church today is God's kingdom, we are in the kingdom in reality only when we live and walk in spirit
Whenever we behave according to the old man or live in the flesh or the self, we, in a practical way, are out of God's kingdom
When we are in the flesh, we are in the old realm of the fallen human nature, which has been fully usurped by Satan to form his kingdom
The church as the house of God is a corporate person because this house is the family of God, the household of God
Whether we are living in the church as the house of God or as the kingdom of God depends on whether we are living as members or as citizens
Although the kingdom is the reality of the church, we cannot say that the church is the reality of the kingdom
In 14:17 Paul does not say that the kingdom of God shall be; he uses the present tense and says that the kingdom of God is
According to the context of Romans 14, which speaks of receiving the believers, the kingdom is today's church life
In a sense, it is correct to say that the present age is the church age and that the coming age will be the kingdom age
In another sense, the kingdom of God is here today, for the kingdom is the reality of the church and the living of the church
Since the church is the kingdom today, it is not correct to say that the kingdom has been suspended altogether until the coming age
In Romans 14:17 we see that the kingdom of God as the living of the church is righteousness, peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit
When the authority of God's kingdom operates in us, righteousness, peace, and joy will characterize our daily life
When Christ is expressed, He is our righteousness toward ourselves, our peace toward others, and our joy with God
Whenever we live righteously toward ourselves and peacefully toward others, we shall live joyfully to God in the Holy Spirit
In 1 Corinthians 6:9b and 10 Paul speaks of different kinds of persons who will not inherit the kingdom of God
In Galatians 5:21 Paul, referring to the works of the flesh, says, 'Those who practice such things shall not inherit the kingdom of God'
Inheriting the kingdom of God refers to the enjoyment of the coming kingdom as a reward to the overcoming believers
Those believers who practice the works of the flesh listed in Galatians 5:19-21 will not inherit the coming kingdom as a reward
In Ephesians 5:5 Paul once again speaks of those who have 'no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God'
The believers have been regenerated into the kingdom of God and, in the church life, they are living in the kingdom of God today
The virtue in verse 5 refers to that mentioned in verse 3, where Peter speaks of the One who has 'called us to His own glory and virtue'
When we partake of the divine nature, the different aspects of the riches of what God is, these riches become our virtues
In verse 6 Peter continues, 'And in knowledge self-control, and in self-control endurance, and in endurance godliness'
As to ourselves, we must have self-control, and as to our circumstances, no matter what they may be, we need endurance
The Greek word for love in verse 7 is agape, the word used in the New Testament for the divine love, which God is in His nature
Such a love needs to be developed in brotherly love, to govern it and flow in it for the expression of God, who is this love
For this reason, at the time of the manifestation of the kingdom, they will have no participation in the kingdom
Those who grow and develop in the divine life to the full extent will be supplied with a rich and bountiful entry into the coming kingdom
We all need to grow in the divine life in the church life so that in the coming age we may have a rich entrance into the kingdom of God
As the Body, the church receives everything from Christ; everything of Christ, therefore, is expressed through the church
The two, Christ and the church, are mingled and joined as one, with Christ being the inward content and the church, the outward expression
John also told us that the Lord Jesus is not only the Lamb of God but also the One who baptizes in the Holy Spirit and fire
Those who truly repent and believe in the Lord will be baptized by Him in the Holy Spirit that they may have eternal life
Those who do not repent and believe in Him will be baptized in fire and thereby be cast into the lake of fire for eternal punishment
As the Bridegroom, Christ will have the bride, who is the totality of God's people ultimately consummating in the New Jerusalem
We shall see much more concerning Christ's person as we view Him in relation to the formation of the church as His Body
Before Mary and Joseph came together, she was found to be with child, and this child was out of the Holy Spirit
The Lord's two names-Jesus and Emmanuel-indicate that He is unique, for He is not merely God nor merely man but the God-man
The Triune God, who created everything, entered into the womb of a human virgin and remained there for nine months
When He was baptized by John, 'the heavens were opened to Him, and He saw the Spirit of God descending as a dove and coming upon Him'
As the One who was begotten of the Holy Spirit in the womb of a virgin to be the God-man, He, with the Spirit upon Him, began to minister
There on the mountaintop 'He was transfigured before them, and His face shown as the sun, and His garments became white as the light
Following this He went to Jerusalem where He was judged by the Jewish religion and the Roman government and then He was crucified and buried
In the evening of the day of His resurrection, He appeared to the disciples in a very mysterious way, in a way that we cannot understand
The wonderful One, who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God, had become, through death and resurrection, a life-giving Spirit
As a result, the processed Triune God as the all-inclusive Spirit was mingled with His chosen people to become one entity with them
For a period of forty days, the Lord Jesus appeared to the disciples and spoke to them concerning the kingdom of God
The exalted Christ's receiving of the promise of the Holy Spirit was actually the receiving of the Holy Spirit Himself
After His resurrection and ascension, He still needed to receive the Spirit economically again that He might pour Himself out upon His Body
That outpouring was the baptism in the Holy Spirit and it accomplished the second stage of the formation of the church as the Body of Christ
As the embodiment of the processed Triune God becoming the life-giving Spirit, the Lord breathed the Spirit into His disciples essentially
In Christ's ascension, the all-inclusive, compound Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God descended upon His chosen people
As a result, within them they have the embodiment of the processed Triune God, and upon them they have the consummated Spirit
We shall grow until we are 'filled unto all the fullness of God' to express the processed Triune God in His embodiment
We all need to see that the Body of Christ is the totality of the processed Triune God mingled with transformed, tripartite man
Now a third stage is needed for the increase of the Body unto all the fullness of God, unto the fullness of the One who fills all in all
In this stage we who have believed into Christ to have an organic union with Him need to drink of Him as the one Spirit
After the Lord breathed Himself into Gods chosen people and poured out Himself as the Spirit upon them He gave them to drink the one Spirit
From this we see that the first stage involves breathing; the second stage involves outpouring; and the third stage involves drinking
The basic aspect of the church revealed in Ephesians is that of the Body; all the other aspects are subsidiary
Some Bible teachers say that, in the New Testament, the Body of Christ is merely a parable illustrating how close we are to Christ
It is not correct to teach that the Body of Christ is a parable, for the Body is a fact, a reality, not a parable
We may consider the vine in John 15 a parable, but we should never say that the church as the Body of Christ is a parable
None of the believers as members of the Body is a complete entity; rather, every believer is a member of the Body
In Romans 12:6a Paul says, 'And having gifts that differ according to the grace given to us, let us exercise them accordingly'
Grace, therefore, is the element of the divine life which is wrought into our being and which gives us some skill or ability
As we enjoy the processed Triune God receiving and assimilating His element into us out of this element proceeds some skill gift or ability
These gifts differ according to the divine element which we have enjoyed and which we have assimilated into us
The fact that the gifts in Romans 12 are according to grace means that these gifts are granted according to the measure of life
Baptism ushers the believers into an organic union with Christ and the Triune God, making them living members of the Body of Christ
Positively, we have been baptized into the Triune God and into Christ; negatively, we have been baptized into the death of Christ
The destination of such a baptism is not the Triune God, Christ, or the death of Christ; the destination is the Body of Christ
After being baptized in one Spirit, we need to drink of the one Spirit to be saturated and permeated with the Spirit
To be baptized in the one Body is to experience something once for all, but to drink one Spirit is a continuing experience
We have baptism as the procedure to receive and accept the fact, and we have the drinking as the moment-by-moment experience
The Body is mentioned before the Spirit because the oneness among us is related to the Body and is for the Body
Eventually, because the Body is the constitution of the one Spirit, we can say that the one Body is one with the Spirit
Paul preached the unsearchable riches of Christ that the church as the Body of Christ might come into existence
Along with the term 'the unsearchable riches of Christ,' the book of Ephesians speaks of 'the fullness of the One who fills all in all'
When we experience and enjoy the riches of Christ dispensed into us, we become, in a real and practical way, part of the proper Body life
Experiencing and enjoying the riches of Christ is related to apprehending the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of Christ
Ephesians 3:18 speaks of the believers being 'strong to apprehend with all the saints what is the breadth and length and height and depth'
The dimensions of Christ-the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth-are the dimensions of the universe
When we enter into the new heaven and new earth to dwell in the New Jerusalem, we shall realize that Christ the Lord is our universe
At present, in the Body life, we can apprehend with all the saints the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of Christ
Christ in His universal dimensions and in His immeasurable love is a vast, limitless ocean for us to experience in the Body and for the Body
The Body is under the transmission of Christ in His resurrection, ascension, and transcendency to be the Head over all things
The church as the Body comes out of this transmission, for the little word 'to' indicates the source of the church
Christ is Head over all things to the church, and the surpassing greatness of the power that operated in Him is toward us who believe
Just as in ones physical body the head and the body are one so Christ the Head and the church His Body are joined and therefore are one
All that Christ has accomplished, obtained, and attained as the Head is not only for the Body but also to the Body
The fact that Christ is the Firstborn from among the dead indicates that He is the Head of the Body in resurrection
In both the old creation and the new creation, Christ is the first and occupies the first place, the place of preeminence
Because Christ is the first both in the universe and in the church, He must be all things in the universe and in the church
According to our estimation, if Christ is the first, then something else should be the second, third, and others in sequence
For Christ to be the Firstborn from among the dead means that He is everything in the new creation, the church, which is His Body
Because Christ is the Head of the Body, we need to hold the Head so that the Body may grow with the growth of God
Corinthians 1212 says As the body is one and has many members but all the members of the body being many are one body so also is Christ
Now in the church life we enjoy not only God, the Redeemer, and the life-giving Spirit but also the Christ who is the Body
The church can be the Body of Christ only as the members are constituted of Christ, possessing His life and nature
If we consider our physical body, we shall realize that anything that does not have our life and nature cannot be part of our body
Because the reality of Christ is the Spirit, the way to be constituted of Christ to be His Body is to drink the Spirit
The baptism into the one Body has positioned us all to drink, and by drinking of the Spirit we are constituted to be the Body
By drinking the Spirit we experience the dispensing of the divine Trinity into our being and are constituted to be the Body
The more we drink the one Spirit, the more the divine element becomes our constituent to make us the one Body, the corporate Christ
The book of Ephesians reveals that the church is the Body of Christ, the kingdom of God, the household of God, and the dwelling place of God
From this, Paul goes on to the aspects of fellow citizens of the kingdom of God and members of the household of God
The church is not merely an assembly of believers, a kingdom of heavenly citizens, a household of God's children, nor even a Body for Christ
As the Body of Christ, the church needs Christ as its life, but as the new man, the church needs Christ as its person
Because the new man has Christ as all the members and in all the members, there is no room for race, religion, culture, or social status
The members of the new man continue to exist, for Christ not only is all the members but is in all the members
He died on the cross and descended into Hades, ascended in resurrection from Hades to earth, and then ascended to the third heaven
To arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is to arrive at the full building up of the Body of Christ
When in our experience we are filled unto all the fullness of God, the church comes into being in a practical way
According to this rendering, the fullness of God would have to be the element, the essence, with which we are filled
Paul is saying that we shall be filled unto all the fullness of God, that is, we shall be filled to be the expression of God
Christ must make His home in our hearts, occupying all the parts of our inner being and saturating them with His riches
Following this, we must grasp the dimensions of Christ, experiencing Christ in His universal dimensions both horizontally and vertically
Being filled unto the fullness of God is the outcome of the deeper, higher, and richer experiences of Christ described in Ephesians 3
In Colossians 2:2 Paul speaks of the mystery of God, which is Christ, and in Ephesians 3:4, of the mystery of Christ, which is the church
The fact that Christ and the church are one spirit , as typified by the husband and wife being one flesh, is the great mystery
As Eve was Adam's increase, so the church as the bride, the wife, of Christ as the Bridegroom, the Husband, is Christ's increase
In Revelation 19:7 and 8 we see that Christ and His counterpart, His bride, will be married at His coming back
God's economy in the New Testament is to obtain for Christ a bride, the church, through His redemption and divine life
By the continual working of the Holy Spirit through all the centuries, this goal will be attained at the end of this age
The Gospel of John reveals that Christ is the Lamb who came to take away sin and also the Bridegroom who came that He might have the bride
The righteousness we received for our salvation is objective so that we may meet the requirement of the righteous God
The fine linen with which the bride in Revelation 19 is clothed is equal to the marriage garment in Matthew 22:11 and 12
We also need the second garment, which is the wedding garment in Matthew 22:11 and 12 and the fine linen in Revelation 19:8
The consummation of the church as the counterpart of Christ will be the New Jerusalem in the new heaven and the new earth for eternity
The Spirit, who is the totality of the processed Triune God, becomes one with the believers, who are now fully matured to be the bride
The Spirit is the ultimate expression of the processed Triune God and the bride is the ultimate expression of the transformed tripartite man
By the time of Revelation 2217 the processed Triune Godthe Spiritand the transformed tripartite manthe bridewill be one and speak as one
In the Old Testament God told His redeemed people Israel that He was their Husband and that they were His wife
Ultimately, the New Jerusalem will be the consummation of God's counterpart, the aggregate of all His redeemed and perfected people
The Bible begins with the marriage of Adam and Eve in Genesis and ends with the marriage of the Spirit and the bride in Revelation
For eternity this universal couple will be the full manifestation of the Triune God expressed in all His glory
The transformed tripartite man will match the processed Triune God forever for His full expression and satisfaction
If we have the spiritual vision from Ephesians 5, we shall see that Eve in the garden was a type, a prefigure, of the church
Adam's need for a wife as his counterpart typifies and portrays Christ's need to have the church as His counterpart
The first couple in the Bible, Adam and Eve, presents a significant and complete picture of Christ and the church
After creating man, God declared that it was not good for the man to be alone and that He would make a counterpart for him
Just as Eve, the counterpart of Adam, was a part of Adam, so the church, the counterpart of Christ, is a part of Christ
After the woman had been built from his rib and brought to him, Adam exclaimed, 'This time it is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh'
A member of Christ is a person produced with the element of Christ, who is the life-giving Spirit in our spirit
When this Christ in His believers is added together, the sum equals the church, His counterpart, which is actually a part of Christ Himself
The bone in Genesis 2 is a type of the Lord's resurrection life, which is unbreakable and which was released through His death
Eve was a type of the church produced with Christ's resurrection life, which was released out of Him through death
As Eve came out of Adam's bone, so the church comes out of Christ's resurrection life, typified by Adam's bone
In typology this indicates that the church, which is a part of Christ and which has come out of Christ, returns to Christ
Only that which comes out of Christ and which is actually Christ Himself can be one with Him as His counterpart
Genesis 2:24 says, 'Therefore shall a man leave his father and his mother, and shall cleave unto his wife: and they shall be one flesh'
In this union, which will last for eternity, redeemed, regenerated, and transformed humanity is one with divinity
If we see this as a heavenly vision, we shall realize why we need to be 'transformed into the same image from glory to glory'
Eventually, the church returns to Christ and becomes one with Him, possessing His life, nature, image, and form
The blood was for redemption, and the water was for the impartation of life so that the church might come into existence
In Ephesians 525 we have the church the counterpart of Christ coming into existence through Christs loving her and giving Himself up for her
The purpose of Christ in giving Himself up for the church and in giving Himself to the church is to sanctify her
To be sanctified is not only to be separated from what is common but also to be saturated with the element of Christ
In these verses Paul is saying that husbands should love their wives as Christ loved the church and gave Himself up for her
Christ's purpose in loving the church and in giving Himself up for the church was to sanctify her by the washing of the water in the Word
In the sight of God, it does not matter whether we are good or bad, for the only thing of value in His economy is Christ Himself
It is this element alone that causes us to be sanctified so that we may be the counterpart of Christ for His satisfaction
Christ's work of sanctifying the church is accomplished by cleansing her with the washing of the water in the Word
According to the divine concept, the water in Ephesians 5:26 refers to the flowing life of God typified by flowing water
In sanctifying the church, the Lord first washes away our sins with His blood and then washes away our natural blemishes with His life
All the spots and wrinkles in the church will be washed away through the inner cleansing of the water in the Word
As the church is washed organically and metabolically in this way, the church is renewed and is without blemish
On the one hand, we have the addition of Christ; on the other hand, we have the subtraction of the natural disposition
After Eve had been prepared for Adam by being built out of Adam's rib, she was presented to Adam, the source from which she came
Eventually the church presented by Christ to Himself will be a God-expressing one; it will be the expression, the manifestation, of God
Because Christ's sanctifying of the church causes her to be saturated with the essence of God, the church will become the expression of God
When God glorifies us, He will not need to send the glory from above; rather, He will cause Christ to shine forth from within us
As we behold His glory, we are transformed from glory to glory, that is, from one degree of glory to another degree
The glorious church Christ presents to Himself will be a church 'not having spot or wrinkle or any such things'
The spots and wrinkles must be removed in order for the bride, Christ's counterpart, to be prepared for Christ
The church will be separated to the Lord from all common things and then saturated and permeated with the divine nature with all that God is
If we would be pure, we must be without mixture; that is, we must not have anything other than God in our being
The church will be the expression of the processed Triune God Himself mingled with the resurrected, uplifted, and transformed humanity
Today, however, the church is undergoing the process of Christ's sanctifying with His nourishing and cherishing
Because we are what we eat, the more we eat Christ, receiving His nourishment, the more we are constituted of Christ
Through Christ's work of nourishing the church we are transformed, becoming new persons with a new element and substance
To be nourished is to have something imparted into us inwardly, whereas to be cherished is to be warmed and comforted outwardly
As a mother cherishes a child by holding the child close to her breast, the Lord Jesus cherishes us by holding us close to Him
In preparing the church to be presented to Himself as His counterpart, He surely is the nourishing and cherishing One
Apart from Ephesians 5, there is no way for the bride to be prepared, and hence no way for Revelation 19 to be fulfilled
It is crucial, therefore, that we experience Christ's nourishing, cherishing, sanctifying, and cleansing to remove our defects and oldness
For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh'
Ephesians 4:24 says, 'And have put on the new man, which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth'
Colossians 310 says And having put on the new man which is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him
The church is not just an assembly of believers, a kingdom of heavenly citizens, a household of God's children, nor even a Body for Christ
The emphasis on the church being the Body of Christ is on life, whereas the emphasis on the church being the new man is on the person
In the old creation man was created to have God's image to express Him and also to have His dominion to represent Him
Gods positive intention is that man would express Him whereas Gods negative intention is that man would deal with Gods enemy Satan the Devil
The new man in God's new creation does fulfill the twofold purpose of expressing God and dealing with God's enemy
In the creation of the one new man, however, God's nature has been wrought into man to make His nature one entity with humanity
In the old creation God did not create millions of men; on the contrary, He created one man, Adam, who includes all men
God's life and nature are not wrought into the old creation, but the new creation does possess the divine life and the divine nature
Although the old creation came into being through the work of the mighty God, He Himself does not reside in it
We can receive the divine life and the divine nature only by believing in the Lord Jesus Christ and being regenerated by the Spirit
Corinthians 5:17 says, 'If anyone is in Christ, there is a new creation; the old things have passed away; behold, they have become new'
The old things of the flesh have passed away through the death of Christ, and all has become new in Christ's resurrection
The believers are a new creation, not according to the old nature of the flesh but according to the new nature of the divine life
Anything in our daily life that does not have God in it is the old creation, but what has God in it is part of the new creation
On the cross Christ created the new man in Himself by abolishing in His flesh the law of the commandments in ordinances
When Christ died on the cross, not only did He deal with sins, the old man, Satan, and the world; He also dealt with the ordinances
Due to man's fall, among mankind there are many ordinances, many customs, habits, ways to live, and ways to worship
Not only was there a partition between the Jews and the Gentiles; there were also partitions between every nationality and race
Christ who has accomplished full redemption for both Jewish and Gentile believers is Himself our peace our harmony in that He made both one
Because of the fall of mankind and the call of the chosen race, there was a separation between Israel and the Gentiles
The commandments regarding circumcision and the eating regulations were ritual commandments, not moral commandments
Because mankind became flesh and was thus kept from God and His purpose, God ordained His chosen people to be circumcised from the flesh
Christ brought all the races and nationalities with their different kinds of ordinances, habits, and regulations, to the cross
In this message we shall first see that the new man was created according to God and in righteousness and holiness of the truth
Ephesians 4:24 says, 'And have put on the new man, which according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth'
Because the new man has been created in Christ and with Christ according to God, the new man bears the image of God
Righteousness and holiness here refer to the two main characteristics of the life of Jesus in His humanity as indicated in verse 21
It was in the righteousness and holiness of this truth, which is God realized and expressed, that the new man was created
Today the church as the new man bears the image of God that is the new man bears Gods righteousness and holiness and also His love and light
Ephesians 2:16 says, 'And might reconcile both in one Body to God through the cross, slaying the enmity by it'
Through the redeeming death of Christ, God has justified us, the sinners, and has reconciled us, His enemies, to Himself
We, the believers, both Jews and Gentiles, were reconciled not only for the Body of Christ but also in the Body of Christ
Of thinking that we have been reconciled individually, we need to see that we have been reconciled to God corporately in one Body
Now there is no longer a separation between the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers nor between us and God
For this reason, Paul said that the middle wall of partition has been broken down and that the Jewish and Gentile believers must be one
Eventually, however, the new man created by the creating death of Christ equals the Body formed in Christ's resurrection and ascension
Ephesians 2:16 clearly indicates that the new man created out of two collective peoples, the Jews and the Gentiles, is the Body of Christ
The New American Standard Version makes this very error in Ephesians 4:24 by adopting the rendering 'put on the new self'
In the church as the new man there is no room for Greek and Jew, circumcision and uncircumcision, barbarian and Scythian, slave and freeman
Vincent says that in the Greek language the words translated 'cannot be' are very strong and mean that there is no possibility
In the new man there cannot be Greeks, who are for philosophical wisdom, and Jews, who are for miraculous signs
Circumcision refers to the observers of the Jewish religious rituals; uncircumcision refers to those who do not care for the Jewish religion
No matter what kind of person we may be, as far as the new man is concerned, we must regard ourselves as nobodies
It is a great mistake, therefore, to translate the Greek here as 'the new self,' as is done in the New American Standard Version
Because Christ is all the members of the new man, there is no room in the new man for any race, nationality, culture, or social status
If Christ is the living of all the saints, all the members of the new man, then in reality only He will be in the new man
If Paul did not say that Christ is in all, only that He is all, we may think that in the new man Christ is needed and that we are not needed
On the one hand, Paul does say that in the new man there is no place for the natural person because Christ is all the members
Before our salvation, we were living in the old man, in the old society, but now we are members of Christ, living in His Body
The spirit in Ephesians 4:23 is the regenerated spirit of the believers mingled with the indwelling Spirit of God
As this process takes place, the mingled spirit spreads into our mind, takes over our mind, and becomes the spirit of our mind
The way to put on the new man is for the spirit, which is mingled with the Spirit, to become the spirit of our mind
For the spirit to become the spirit of our mind means that the spirit directs, controls, dominates, and possesses our mind
It is in this spirit of our mind that we are renewed, and by means of this spirit we put on the new man experientially
It is crucial for us to see that the new man has already been created and, by regeneration, has been put into our spirit
If our spirit is the spirit of our mind, then all our living will be by the spirit, and whatever we do will be according to the spirit
Now day by day we need to put on this new man by permitting the spirit to control our being and renew our mind
Ephesians 2:15 says that the new man was created, but Colossians 3:10 says that the new man is 'being renewed unto full knowledge'
Although Ephesians and Colossians are sister books, what they say concerning the new man is not exactly the same
How can we say that, on the one hand, the new man has been created and that, on the other hand, the new man is being renewed?
Before the new man was created in our spirit in resurrection, we did not have the Spirit of God or the life of God within us
When the new creation took place in our spirit in resurrection, the Holy Spirit with the divine life was added into our being
On the one hand, in our spirit the new man was created with new elements, the elements of the divine life and the Holy Spirit
In Colossians 3:10 Paul says that the new man is being renewed unto full knowledge 'according to the image of Him who created him'
Colossians 3:10 reveals that the new man is being renewed unto full knowledge, which is according to the image of God
In our experience the new man must be renewed unto the full knowledge that is according to the image the expression of God who created him
The more we put on the new man the more we are renewed according to what God is and the more we bear His image the expression of what He is
The more we are renewed in the spirit of our mind, the more the new man with the divine element will spread from our spirit into our soul
The new man in the new creation also has the twofold obligation of bearing God's image to express Him and of fighting against God's enemy
Because of the working of Satan, who is the authority of darkness, the earth and its atmosphere have become 'this darkness'
Truth refers to God in Christ as reality in our living, that is, God in Christ realized and expressed by us as our living
Ephesians 6:14 also speaks of 'the breastplate of righteousness,' which covers our conscience, signified by the breast
In fighting against Satan, our accuser, we need to have our conscience covered with the breastplate of righteousness
The modifier 'by means of all prayer and petition' actually is related to all six items of the armor in verses 13 through 17
Paul specifically says that we are to pray in our spirit, that is, in our regenerated spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God
Pauls charge to pray in spirit implies that we should pray in the Spirit of God for the Spirit and our regenerated spirit are mingled in us
In Ephesians 6:18 Paul speaks of 'watching unto this in all perseverance and petition concerning all the saints'
As the new man, we must watch and pray so that we may fulfill the negative side of God's purpose to fight against His enemy
In this message we shall begin to consider the final aspect of the status of the church-the church as the golden lampstands
In Exodus 25 the emphasis is on Christ being the lampstand as the divine light, shining as the seven lamps with the Spirit
With Christ, with Israel, and with the church the golden lampstand is a portrayal of the embodiment of the Triune God
As a type of Christ, the lampstand portrays Christ as the resurrection life growing, branching, budding, and blossoming to shine the light
With the lampstand as a type of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God there are three important things the gold the stand and the lamps
Gold is the substance with which the lampstand is made the stand is the embodiment of the gold and the lamps are the expression of the stand
If we consider this substance, this element, of the lampstand, we shall see that it signifies the divine nature
Gold is the substance of the lampstand, and within the gold there is an intrinsic nature, which is its essence
According to typology, this signifies the divine nature, the nature of God, in which is the essence of the divine Being
Substantially the lampstand is one, but expressively it is seven, because it is one lampstand with seven lamps
We can prove from the Scriptures that the seven lamps of the golden lampstand signify the Spirit expressing Christ
As we proceed from Exodus to Zechariah, we see that the seven lamps are the seven eyes of Christ, the seven eyes of Jehovah
As we continue to Revelation, we see that the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven eyes which are the intensified Spirit of God
As seven is the number for completion in God's operation, so the seven Spirits must be for God's move on earth
In substance and existence God's Spirit is one; in the intensified function and work of God's operation God's Spirit is sevenfold
In substance and existence God's Spirit is one, but in the intensified function and work of God's operation, God's Spirit is sevenfold
God will touch the earth by the seven lamps, by His seven Spirits, which are for burning, shining, observing, searching, and judging
In Exodus 25 and Zechariah 4 the seven lamps, signifying the enlightening of the Spirit of God in God's move, are for God's building
In Revelation 4:5 the seven lamps are for God's judgment, which will issue in the building of the New Jerusalem
While God executes His judgment His sevenfold intensified Spirit will carry out His eternal building by searching enlightening and judging
The enlightening, searching, exposing, judging, and burning of the seven lamps of fire are for the carrying out of God's administration
Today God is administrating His government by means of this enlightening, searching, exposing, judging, and burning
The seven lamps also signify the Spirit as the seven eyes of the Son to express the Son as the embodiment of the Triune God
The lamps are for enlightening and burning; the eyes are for watching and observing and also for infusing and transfusing
As the redeeming Lamb, Christ has seven watching and observing eyes for the carrying out of God's administration
These seven eyes are also transfusing all that the Lamb is into our being so that we may become the same as He
Economically speaking, the Spirit of God in God's administration is the eyes of the administrating Son, the seven Spirits
Christ is the Executor of God's economy; nevertheless, He needs the seven Spirits as His eyes to carry out God's economy
God the Father as the divine gold is embodied in Christ the Son and then is fully expressed through the Spirit
The seven eyes of Christ, which are the seven Spirits of God, are Christ's expression in God's move for God's building
God, the divine Being, is first embodied in Christ and then expressed through the sevenfold intensified Spirit
Now we not only have the Triune God; in the lampstand we have the Triune God substantially and solidly embodied and expressed
In the proper church life, God the Father is the substance, God the Son is the embodiment, and God the Spirit is the expression
In Exodus 25 the lampstand signifies Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God but in Revelation the golden lampstands signify the churches
The second is in Zechariah 4:2, where the lampstand represents the children of Israel who are in the position of receiving grace
In the foregoing message we considered the lampstand as a type of Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God
In the coming millennium, the restored nation of Israel will once again be God's testimony symbolized by a golden lampstand
In Exodus 25 we only have the lampstand with the seven lamps; there is no mention of what the seven lamps refer to
Since the seven lamps are the seven eyes and also the seven Spirits, then the seven eyes in Zechariah 4:10 are the seven Spirits
The seven eyes, the seven Spirits, of Jehovah are the seven eyes of Christ, who is the Stone-Savior for God's building
The Lord Jesus as the building stone, was engraved, dealt with, by God on the cross for the iniquity of God's people
In Revelation 4:5 the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God, and in 5:6 the seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God
We have a further development over Zechariah for the seven eyes are not only the seven eyes of the stone but also the seven eyes of the Lamb
All the local churches as the many lampstands are the reproduction of Christ and the Spirit as the one lampstand
Eventually, in Revelation both the stand and the lamps, that is, both Christ and the Spirit, are reproduced as the local churches
The seven golden lampstands signifying the seven local churches have Christ, as the Son of Man, walking in their midst
The Lord Jesus appears in Revelation as the High Priest walking among the lampstands to snuff the burned out wicks and to add more oil
The burned out wick signifies something that is not according to God's purpose, and the oil is the sevenfold Spirit
Christ today is trimming the lampstands, dealing with the churches, to make all the golden lampstands pure and shining
The fact that the church is a golden lampstand indicates that we should not bring anything other than God into the church life
Even good things such as ethics, culture, education, and proper religion are dross, because they are not God Himself
Although the church is composed of humanity with divinity, humanity should not be the basic nature of the local churches
To say that the church is the embodiment of the Triune God is not to make the church a part of deity or an object of worship
Now we may enjoy this life and nature day by day and learn to live not by our natural life but by the divine life and nature
As we live this way and are transformed, there will be the fullness, the expression, the form, the appearance of Christ
The specific, particular characteristics of the apostate church in Thyatira were Jezebel, idol worship, fornication, and adultery
The characteristic of the church in Sardis was deadness , and the characteristic of the church in Laodicea was lukewarmness
All the local churches as the embodiment of Christ and the reproduction of the Spirit should be exactly the same
On top of this mountain is a throne, from which the street spirals down to the bottom to reach the twelve gates
Since gold signifies the divine nature, the nature of God, the city being pure is altogether of the divine nature
As a golden mountain, the New Jerusalem is the ultimate, unique, and eternal golden lampstand, absolutely composed of God's nature
Revelation 21:23a says, 'The city has no need of the sun nor of the moon that they should shine in it, for the glory of God illumined it'
The glory of God, with God as its substance, essence, and elements, is the light of the New Jerusalem, which shines in the Lamb as its lamp
Because such a light will illumine the holy city, it will not need any other light, whether created by God or made by man
Jasper, a precious stone, signifies the expression of the Spirit in His transforming work with all the unsearchable riches of Christ
As the consummation of the golden lampstands, the New Jerusalem will express the processed Triune God in eternity
The New Jerusalem will be a mountain of gold with pearl gates and with a jasper wall built upon twelve layers of precious stones
