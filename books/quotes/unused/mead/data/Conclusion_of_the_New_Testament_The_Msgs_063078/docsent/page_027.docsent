   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Speaking the Father's Word</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus never spoke His own word.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whatever He spoke was the Father's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>On one occasion He said, "My teaching is not Mine, but His who sent Me" John 7:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In not speaking from Himself the Lord did not seek His own glory but the glory of the One who sent Him v. 18 . Instead of speaking His own words, He spoke God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When He spoke God's word, God was expressed through His speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God came forth from Him through His words.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He lived a life of speaking God, a life of expressing God for His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 12:49 and 50 the Lord Jesus says, "I do not speak from Myself, but the Father who sent Me has Himself given Me commandment what I should say and what I should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>And I know that His commandment is eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The things therefore that I speak, even as the Father has said to Me, so I speak."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This clearly reveals that in His ministry the Lord spoke the Father's word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In particular, the commandment that the Father gave Him to speak was eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, He came with living words, and whoever receives His words will have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In John 14:10 the Lord Jesus goes on to say, "The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once again the Lord makes it clear that He did not speak His own word but the Father's word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While the Son was speaking in this way, the Father was working.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Son's speaking was the Father's working.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>19.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Doing the Father's Will</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A number of times the Lord Jesus declared strongly that He did not do His own will, but that everything He did was the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One day He said to His disciples, who had returned with food and were urging Him to eat: "My food is to do the will of Him who sent Me, and to finish His work" John 4:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord's food was to do the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In John 4 this means that, in particular, His food was to save and satisfy sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus had come to Samaria with a purpose to find a sinful Samaritan woman and satisfy her.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In doing this He did God's will, and doing God's will was His food and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In John 6:38 the Lord Jesus says that He came down from heaven not to do His own will but the will of the Father who sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In John 5:30 He says that He did not seek His own will but the will of the Father who sent Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These verses indicate clearly that in His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus did not carry out His own will but the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>20.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Expressing the Father</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We know from the Gospel of John that Christ the Son came in the Father's name, did the Father's will, spoke the Father's word, and sought the Father's glory 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He also expressed the Father John 14:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He did not express Himself but expressed only the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>During His earthly ministry the Lord Jesus spoke much concerning the kingdom of God and the dispensing of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But in all that He spoke He expressed the Father, not Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The fact that the Son expresses the Father is proved by the exchange between the Lord Jesus and Philip in John 14.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 7 the Lord pointed out to the disciples that if they had known Him, they would have known the Father also.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then He said, "Henceforth you know Him and have seen Him."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, Philip replied, "Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us" v. 8 . To this the Lord Jesus answered, "He who has seen Me has seen the Father" v. 9 . In the Son the Father is expressed and seen, for the Son is the expression of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Son does not express Himself; instead, He expresses the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Son's expression is the Father's expression.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, when we see the Son, we see the Father.</S>
