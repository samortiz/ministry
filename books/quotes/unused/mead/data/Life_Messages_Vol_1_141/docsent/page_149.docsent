   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ONENESS IN JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For centuries that unique center, Jerusalem, kept the children of Israel in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The males were required to appear there before the Lord three times a year; otherwise, they would be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose I lived in those days and had a quarrel with my neighbor about his barking dog.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I would tell him the dog had kept me awake all night.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Did not God say, through Moses, that we should love our neighbor as ourself?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Didn't he care that I couldn't get any sleep all night?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The result of the quarrel was that we stopped talking to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Two months went by.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was now the seventh month; the feast of tabernacles was coming up.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both my neighbor and I had to go or we would be stoned to death.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We both went, he along one lane and I along another.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we reached the foothill of Mount Zion, there was only one way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We had to go up together, singing the songs of ascent.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How could we sing, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is for brethren to dwell together in unity!"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Psa 133:1 when we were still not at peace with each other?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was the older one.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>My heart was softened.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I greeted him, saying, "Hi, brother.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I still love you."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>ONENESS IN THE CHURCH LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do you see how this unique center forces us to be one?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the worship in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the New Testament the worship is in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We know this because Ephesians 2:22 says that God's dwelling place today is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our spirit is the center where we worship God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The children of Israel were divided into many groups, but whenever they came to Jerusalem they were one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The same is true of us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When we are in our emotions, or in the mind, or in our will, we are divided.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Not only can the emotional sisters not be one with the strong-minded brothers; these same brothers cannot be one with each other.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Suppose there is a service group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you do not go in your spirit, be prepared for arguing.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Within ten minutes you will all be expressing your concepts, even if you are only discussing the best time to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The problem is not with your heart; you all love the Lord and have a heart for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The problem is with your head.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You cannot be one with others in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The best way to come together to serve in oneness is to avoid talk.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Pray instead.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we were in Elden Hall in Los Angeles in 1965 to 1967, the serving brothers could not work together.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When they met, they began to discuss.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They called it fellowship!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The more they "fellowshipped," the more opinions they had.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then they would begin to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In 1966 pray-reading came in, and then in 1968 calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>After that there was no more "fellowship."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the service groups met, they would pray-read and call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This brought them all into one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>That was the end of their opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Where did they become one?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Where are Christians divided?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In their mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do not keep ourselves in the spirit, but indulge in using our mind, we shall soon be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All of us in the recovery must be on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must have a holy fear of our opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul told the divisive Corinthians that they should be perfectly attuned to the same opinion 1 Cor 1:10, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>. How can we be attuned to one opinion?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is only by exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If I do not remain in my spirit, I can give you several opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We all are opinionated.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As long as we are living, we have opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>While we are listening to a message, we may be thinking about what the speaker is wearing, or why some brother's hair is cut a certain way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our opinions are always critical of others.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What shall we do about these critical opinions?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Let us turn to our spirit; just a little turn, and all criticisms stop.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you try to eliminate the opinions of the saints by teaching or admonishing, that very teaching is an opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It does not help to try to adjust others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do not make comments about how they dress.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Your business is to turn to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Don't talk about the Scripture verses that you interpret differently.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The best church is the one where opinions are not heard.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Everyone practices turning to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Many times we are unaware that we are criticizing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We may ask a simple question right after the meeting, like, "How was the meeting this morning?"</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Such a question unlocks the door to opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The reply will be, "Oh, the message was all right, but ."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is always a but.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We must learn to answer such questions with "Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It is not safe to express any opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Whether the meeting is living or dead, have no idea.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Exercise not to discuss how it is.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>It is not easy to stay out of our mind or our emotions and remain in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In this place there is no vain talk, no unnecessary fellowship, and no opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Rather, there is prayer, singing, and praising.</S>
