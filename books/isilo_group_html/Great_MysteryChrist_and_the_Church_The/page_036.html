<p>Second, we need to be purged so that we are clean and pure. Our natural old man is not pure; hence, we need to ask the Lord to purge us daily until we are clean and pure, just like gold and silver that are purified of dross. When our heart, motives, and aims are pure, we will ask for nothing other than the Lord. Our greatest fear in serving the Lord should be to serve without a vision. If we have a vision, our greatest fear should be that our heart is not pure. If we have a vision but are not pure in heart, we are finished as far as the work is concerned. An impure motive is a worm that will poison everything within us. Therefore, we must ask the Lord to purge us daily. When I began to serve the Lord, every morning I prayed specifically about this. I prayed, &ldquo;Lord, purge me. Examine me.&rdquo; Evil deeds are not necessarily of much significance, but an evil intention in our heart is terrible. I prayed for the Lord to purge and examine me for two to three years. Looking back, I realize that the Lord heard my prayer. We need to be purged. This is the second basic condition for serving the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Broken</h2>
<p>Third, we need to take the cross and be broken. It is easy to break a glass cup, but it is hard for us to be broken. A glass cup breaks when it is dropped just once, but one experience of being broken is not enough to fully break us. After an experience of breaking we often return to our previous condition. I can testify that it is possible to experience the Lord&rsquo;s breaking at least ten times in one day. We should not think that an experience of being broken in the morning will carry us through the day. This is not possible. A person who experiences being broken by the Lord in the morning is likely to revert to his previous condition before evening. When he rises the next morning, he is &ldquo;whole&rdquo; again; it is as if he had never been broken. We constantly need to receive the breaking of the cross within us.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Enjoying Christ</h2>
<p>Fourth, we need to enjoy Christ. We must get into the Bible and genuinely enjoy Christ in a spirit of prayer. This does not refer only to reading the Bible or praying at set times; we need to become persons living in the words of the Bible. Others might not see us reading the Bible, but we should live in the words of the Bible. Others might not know that we pray all the time, but we should live in a spirit of prayer. We must be in the words of the Lord and in the Spirit of the Lord. We should practice reading the Bible and praying, until our whole being enters into the Lord&rsquo;s words and into prayer.</p>
<p>It would be good if we could consistently read the Bible and pray every day, but our environment and time may not allow us. Therefore, we must be persons in the Word and in a spirit of prayer. There are many good Christians who preach the gospel, but regrettably, they do many spiritual things without reality. They do not read the Bible in a genuine way, nor do they pray in a solid way. We do not want to read the Bible according to the letter, nor do we want to pray according to the letter. We need to read the Bible until our whole being enters into the Lord&rsquo;s word, and we need to pray until our whole being enters into a spirit of prayer. Being living, rich, and fresh depends on our entering into and remaining in the Lord&rsquo;s word and entering into a spirit of prayer and staying before the throne. This is the way to enjoy the Lord. In order for our work to produce results, we must pay attention to our enjoyment of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Having Insight without Opinions</h2>
<p>Fifth, we need insight without opinions. A person who serves the Lord must have insight but not opinions. Insight is related to vision. If we do not have a vision, we will not have insight. Insight enables us to minister Christ and build up the church. As long as we minister Christ and build up the church, we should have no opinions. Having no opinions means that we have no problem with the way things are carried out as long Christ is ministered and the church is built up. We should have no opinion about building a large meeting hall, a small meeting hall, a beautiful meeting hall, or a shack. Our only concern should be to minister Christ and build up the church. We should have no opinion concerning when to meet separately in districts and when to meet corporately. We should have no opinion concerning one person speaking or everyone sharing. We should have no opinions, because we have only one vision and one goal, which is to minister Christ and build up the church. As long as we can minister Christ and build up the church, we should not have any opinions concerning how things are carried out. In order to serve the Lord, we must minister Christ. Whether we are in a shack or a beautiful meeting hall, we should care only to minister Christ and build up the church. Then we will not insist or argue in our coordination and service, and there will be no display of our temper. May we all remember that we need insight without opinions.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Great Mystery-Christ and the Church &nbsp; pg 36</div><br></body></html>
