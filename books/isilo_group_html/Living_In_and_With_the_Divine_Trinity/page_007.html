First Corinthians 12:28 reveals that [the Triune] God has placed some in the church: firstly apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers...administrations. Ephesians 4:16 says that out from Christ the Head [the Son], all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love. Acts 20:28 says that the Holy Spirit placed overseers in the church, and 9:31 says that the church went on in the comfort of the Holy Spirit. Finally, Ephesians 4:4 says, "One Body and one Spirit." The Spirit is the reality of the Body of Christ. Hence, if there were no Spirit, there would be no Body of Christ, no church. The reality of the Body of Christ is the Spirit whom we have received, experienced, and enjoyed in many aspects, and the reality of the church life is the very Spirit in whom we live and according to whom we walk.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN ETERNITY WITHOUT ENDING</H2><P>The vision of the Divine Trinity in eternity without ending can be seen in the last two chapters of the book of Revelation. Revelation 21 shows that the New Jerusalem as the tabernacle of [the Triune] God will be with men (v. 3); the tabernacle of God will be the wife of the Lamb [the Son] (v. 9); and [the Triune] God will be the light, and the Lamb [the Son] will be the lamp of the city (v. 23). Revelation 22 says that the Spirit will be with the bride (v. 17) and that from the throne of [the Triune] God and of the Lamb [the Son] will proceed the river of water of life [the Spirit] with the tree of life [the Son] producing twelve fruits (vv. 1-2).</P><P>The Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;was in eternity without beginning, in creation, in incarnation, in the living and work in Jesus' humanity, in His crucifixion, in His resurrection, and in His ascension. He is also in His salvation, in the Christian life, in the church life, and in eternity without ending. In order for us to live in and with the Divine Trinity, we need to have a vision concerning the Divine Trinity. If we have the Son, we have the Spirit and the Father. If we worship the Father, we also worship the Son and the Spirit because the Three are one. We need to live in and with the Divine Trinity, having Him as the very substance and element of our living.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Living In and With the Divine Trinity &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
