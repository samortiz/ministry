<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. The Fruitful Land Becoming a Wilderness</H2><P>The fruitful land becomes a wilderness, and all its cities are torn down. The whole land is a desolation (vv. 26-27). This desolation is caused by the Babylonian army.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. She Becoming the Desolate One</H2><P>Israel becomes the desolate one. Although she dresses in scarlet, is adorned with ornaments of gold, and enlarges her eyes with paint, she beautifies herself in vain. Her lovers despise her; they seek her life (v. 30).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>13. Her Cry Being like That<br>of a Woman in Travail</H2><P>Israel's cry will be like that of a woman in travail, and her anguish like that of a woman bringing forth her first child. Her voice will gasp for breath, and she will stretch out her hands, saying, "Woe is me, / For my soul is fainting before murderers" (v. 31).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Jehovah the Husband's Correction<br>Being His Reaction<br>to His Wife Israel's Wickedness</H2><P>Jehovah the Husband's correction is His reaction to His wife Israel's wickedness (vv. 4, 17-18, 22). His chastisement is His reaction to her sinfulness.</P>
