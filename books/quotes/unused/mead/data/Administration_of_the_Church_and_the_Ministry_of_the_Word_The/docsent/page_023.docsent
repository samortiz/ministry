   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE ONENESS IN JOHN 17 Scripture Reading: John 17 THE PROCESS OF THE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>John 17 is the Lord s prayer in which He asked the Father to fulfill all that was spoken in chapters 14 through 16.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In chapter 14 the Lord spoke of the coming Comforter; in chapter 15 He spoke of the vine, showing that our relationship with Him is like the union of a vine and its branches; and in chapter 16 He said that the unique factor in this union is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Holy Spirit comes not only to convict us that we may have a union with the Lord in love but also to transmit all that the Father and the Son have into us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 17:1 begins with these things Jesus spoke.These things refers to the contents of chapters 14 through 16.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After speaking the things in chapters 14 through 16, the Lord prayed to the Father: Glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You v. 1 . The Lord prophesied that He would be glorified and that the Father would be glorified in Him 12:23; 13:31-32 . In 12:24 the Lord said that He would die as a grain of wheat in order that the shell of His humanity could be broken and the divine life within Him would be released and dispensed into many people and expressed through them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because this divine life is the divine element of God the Father, the Father is glorified in the Son through the Son s glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The phrase I am coming to You in 17:11 confirms the Lord s words in chapter 14 that He was going to the Father and that His going was His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the Lord s prayer in chapter 17 reveals the significance of what was spoken in chapters 14 through 16.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord desired all His believers to be one even as the three of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Chapter 14 verses 20 through 24 say, In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Judas, not Iscariot, said to Him, Lord, and what has happened that You are to manifest Yourself to us and not to the world?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Jesus answered and said to him, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He who does not love Me does not keep My words; and the word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father s who sent Me. These verses show how the oneness comes into being.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through His death and resurrection, His going, the Lord entered into God and brought man into God, making God man s dwelling place and making man God s abode.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is how the oneness came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This oneness is the result of building, the result produced by the Lord Jesus going to prepare a place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The preparation of a place is building; this preparation work is the work of building, which results in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>ONENESS BEING THROUGH BUILDING</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In a physical house all the materials are in oneness because they have been built up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This also applies to the spiritual building.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a brother is not experiencing the building, it is difficult for him to be one with the brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A stone or a plank of wood must pass through building to become part of a house.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ephesians 4:11-13 shows that God gave apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers as gifts for the perfecting of the saints unto the building up of the Body of Christ, until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The oneness is the issue of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The oneness is not merely a matter of having the same views and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The oneness is a matter of being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before the Holy Spirit descended on the day of Pentecost, the one hundred and twenty in the upper room were in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They all continued steadfastly with one accord in prayer Acts 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Their oneness did not come instantly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Prior to praying in one accord, the disciples had received the Holy Spirit John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This became a factor of their oneness, enabling them to pray in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They had also been under His leading for three and a half years and had been taught by the Lord for a period of forty days after His resurrection Acts 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The extent of building up determines the extent of our oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, even if the brothers and sisters in the church in Taipei have no opinions and do not disputes, we cannot say that this is oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Genuine oneness comes from being built up.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There might not even be oneness among the serving ones.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The absence of disputes does not necessarily mean that we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is one thing to have no disputes, but it is another thing to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For oneness, we must be built up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this reason, we cannot stay away from the church; we cannot stay away from the brothers and sisters with whom we are to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A piece of wood may be good material, but if it is not built into a house, it is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Merely being good material is useless.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Only when the materials are built into the house can there be the genuine oneness.</S>
