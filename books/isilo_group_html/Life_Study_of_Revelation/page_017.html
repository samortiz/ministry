The Seven Eyes of the Lamb</h2><p>The seven Spirits of God are the seven eyes of the Lamb (5:6; Zech. 3:9; 4:10). Our eyes are for our moving. If we are blind, it is very difficult to move. In God&rsquo;s move today, Christ as the Lamb of God has seven eyes. The seven eyes of the Lamb are also for watching, observing, and transfusing. When I look at someone, something of me is transfused into him. We often talk about loving one another, but how can you realize that someone loves you? Love is transfused through the eyes. If you look at me in a loving way, your eyes will transfuse your love into me. When Christ looks at us with His seven eyes, we may be terrified at first. Eventually, however, these seven eyes will transfuse Christ&rsquo;s element into us.</p><p>The Holy Spirit today is the seven eyes of Christ. Many Christians argue that the Holy Spirit of God is separate from Christ, but the Bible says that the Holy Spirit is the eyes of Christ. Do you think of your eyes as being separate from you? It is ridiculous to say this. When I look at your eyes, I look at you, and when you look at me with your eyes, you look at me. The eyes of a person express that person. To say that the Holy Spirit is separate from Christ does not correspond with the pure revelation of the Holy Word. How can we say that a person&rsquo;s eyes are separate from the person himself? There is no room to argue about this. We have seen that the Bible says that the Spirit of God today is the eyes of Christ. This simply means that the Spirit is Christ. My eyes are me. When I look at you, my eyes look at you. If I had no eyes, I could never look at you. Hence, the Spirit, the eyes of Christ, is not separate from Christ. He is the eyes of Christ looking at us. Our experience proves this. Day by day, we sense that Someone is looking at us. This Someone is the Spirit, who is Christ Himself. If the Spirit were not Christ, we would sense that two, the Spirit and Christ, were looking at us. To say that the Spirit is separate from Christ is to pluck out the eyes of Christ and to separate them from Him. It is not scriptural to say that the Spirit is separate from Christ and that Christ is not the Spirit. Just as we and our eyes are one, so Christ and the Spirit are one. Our Christ is not a blind Christ. He is the Christ with the seven eyes. Often, He transfuses His element into us. At other times, He observes us like a flashlight, saying, &ldquo;What are you doing? Are you fighting with your husband? Stop!&rdquo; Have you not had this kind of experience? Day by day we experience this watching, observing, and transfusing Christ. This watching, observing, and transfusing take place through His eyes. His eyes are the Spirit, and the Spirit is simply Himself. If you do not believe it, you will miss the blessing.</p><h2 class="head2">C. The Seven Lamps of Fire<br />before the Throne of God</h2><p>The seven eyes are also the seven lamps of fire before the throne of God (4:5; Zech. 4:2). This is difficult to understand. Christ carries out God&rsquo;s administration by the shining of the seven lamps of fire. This is true in the churches today. When Christ looks at and through us, He shines upon us and executes God&rsquo;s administration. Many times as the elders in the churches are discussing matters with one another, they have the sense that the seven lamps of fire are shining upon them. This is Christ&rsquo;s carrying out of God&rsquo;s administration through the shining of the seven lamps of fire.</p><h2 class="head2">D. Sent Forth into All the Earth</h2><p>The seven Spirits of God have been sent forth into all the earth (5:6). Wherever we go, the seven eyes will follow us. In fact, they will go before us and be waiting for us at our destination. Many dear saints who are unhappy with the church in a certain locality have moved to another locality, thinking that it would be much better for them in another place. But when they arrived at their new locality, they found that the Spirit was waiting for them. Some of us have gone places where we should not have gone, and when we arrived there, we were greeted by the Spirit, who said, &ldquo;Go back. Don&rsquo;t stay here.&rdquo; Today the Spirit has been sent forth into all the earth. He now pervades every corner of the earth. This is the wonderful Spirit of the Triune God.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Revelation &nbsp; pg 17</div><br></body></html>
