<p>When I began the work in America, I was clear that my burden was not to do a Chinese-speaking work, because if I did such a work, the English-speaking work would be neglected. If we wanted to do a Chinese-speaking work, we should not have gone to America. Since we went to America, we needed to carry the Lord&rsquo;s testimony to the English-speaking world. Hence, for the past twenty years I have worked only among the English-speaking. Praise the Lord that we have seen the Lord&rsquo;s blessing in this matter. The American government changed its immigration laws two years ago and increased the quota for Chinese people immigrating to the United States from twenty thousand per year to forty thousand per year; hence, the number of Chinese immigrating to America has drastically increased. When I observed that many brothers and sisters who immigrated to the United States were not receiving any care, I fellowshipped with the Chinese brothers and told them that we had to begin to pay attention to the work among the Chinese-speaking. There are now five or six highly educated Chinese brothers in America who left their successful careers to serve the Lord full time and work mainly on the university campuses.</p>
<p>The many students from Taiwan who go to the United States to study are on almost every campus in the country. Because these students do very well in their studies and get excellent grades, they have improved the reputation of the Chinese people. The second-generation Chinese children, who grew up in America, are also top students in elementary school, junior high school, and high school. It is difficult to compete with the Chinese students. Even in Great Britain there are Chinese professors in the math department of most universities. In other words, math departments have become the domain of Chinese professors. Two-thirds of the graduate students in the department of computer science are Chinese. A weekly news magazine in America published an article last year saying that America and Japan are competing with each other across the Pacific Ocean in the field of computer technology; however, the competition is not between America and Japan but between the Chinese and Japanese people, because most of the computer people in America are Chinese.</p>
<p>Since we began the Chinese-speaking work by visiting the students on the university campuses, we have discovered that all the campuses have Chinese Christian associations. Every university in America that has Chinese Christians also has a Chinese Christian association. Since most of the leaders in these Chinese Christian associations were raised up among us, when we visit these associations, we are warmly welcomed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOSPELIZING AND TRUTHIZING TAIWAN</h2>
<p>The church in Taipei has been blessed financially and with many competent saints. In addition, the country and society are in a good condition. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, we have been on this island for more than thirty years, and our brothers and sisters are in all levels of society. Taiwan today is densely populated; there are almost two million people in the city of Taipei. The people in Taipei can be compared to two million fish swimming around us. We should go out to catch the fish. We have a rare opportunity. All the young saints and middle-aged saints should go out to catch fish.</p>
<p>Our first step is to spread the Lord&rsquo;s recovery all over Taiwan. We should pray and ask the Lord to gospelize Taiwan. The gospel should not be spread merely in Taipei. It should also spread to every town. The entire island of Taiwan must be evangelized, and it must be truthized. We must spread the truths that the Lord has shown us to all the people in Taiwan. We must spread the truth until every household in Taiwan knows the truth. We must let the truth saturate the entire island of Taiwan. According to our calculations, it will take five to ten years to gospelize and truthize Taiwan.</p>
<p>The Gospel Book Room is established and has been publishing books for more than thirty years. Our books are pure; they speak only of the gospel and the truth. These are what the human race needs. We truly believe that the gospel and the truth are two strong factors that will cause God to bless this country and to gain thousands of believers from this country.</p>
<p>The brothers and sisters who want to spread the gospel in northern and southern Europe should not be impatient. We must concentrate our efforts on Taipei. Taipei is our Jerusalem. We must be the Lord&rsquo;s witnesses in Jerusalem and then all of Judea, Samaria, and the uttermost part of the earth. We cannot skip Jerusalem and go to the land of Judea. No, we must begin here and then spread out. We believe that one hundred saints going to Africa or three hundred going to South America will not be sufficient. The need in every place is great.</p>
<p>All five continents are open to the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, mainly because of the truth in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. Our greatest need is to produce a model in Taiwan for our spreading. Therefore, we must begin in Taiwan and spend three to five years to develop a model. Then we can take this model to other places. Hence, our first step must be in Taiwan, and we must begin with Taipei.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> </body></html>
