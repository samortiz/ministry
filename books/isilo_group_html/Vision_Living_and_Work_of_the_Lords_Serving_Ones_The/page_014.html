<h1 class="title">LEADING NEW BELIEVERS<br />
TO EXPERIENCE CHRIST AS LIFE</h1>
<p>There are several basic matters that we must know and practice in serving the Lord. These basic matters include preaching the gospel, helping new believers to have the assurance of salvation, and leading them to live the Christian life. Although it cannot be said that this is a fixed rule, we should not neglect these matters when we shepherd new believers. We must begin with preaching the gospel. After we bring forth new believers through the gospel, we should help them to know the assurance of salvation. We must use solid proofs so that they know clearly, without a doubt, that they have been saved by grace, they belong to Christ, and they are children of God. Following this, we need to lead the new believers to live the Christian life by helping them with items such as praying, reading the Bible, walking according to the spirit, and knowing the anointing. If we are well equipped in these three basic matters, we will have results when we contact people with the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING CORRECTION<br />
AND LEARNING TO BE ACCURATE</h2>
<p>Before we continue our fellowship, let me first say a word about the training. The brothers and sisters in the training must arrive on time; you must not be late. Being late to a meeting is the worst habit that a Christian can have; it indicates disrespect to the Lord and indifference toward the meeting. If the president were to come to the meeting or if he were to invite us to attend a gathering, we would never be late. Being late shows indifference toward the gathering and disrespect to the one who invited us. In the present atmosphere of so-called religious freedom, Christians have become accustomed to arriving late to meetings and leaving early without any feeling. We must realize that the Lord&rsquo;s presence is in the meetings; the Lord Himself is in our midst. Hence, we should demand of ourselves that we arrive five minutes before the scheduled meeting time. Since we have the desire to serve the Lord, we should set a good example by not arriving late to any meeting.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in the training there is no so-called honor or shame. Therefore, we should not be afraid of making mistakes. When we do something right, we can miss an opportunity to be adjusted. If we do something wrong, we learn by being corrected. If we do not make mistakes now, we will make a mistake later in our life, but by then it may be too late to be adjusted. However, if we are corrected now, we will receive the benefit.</p>
<p>In 1931 I wrote articles for <em>The Morning Star</em> magazine in my locality. Two years later I went to Shanghai and was placed by Brother Nee in the literature work. After a short time I was asked to be the chief editor of <em>The Christian</em> magazine when publication was resumed. I learned many things, and I also taught others. Many of the brothers and sisters who came to serve were either high school graduates or were studying in college. I needed to train them before they could copy or proofread the manuscripts. Through this kind of training I learned many lessons.</p>
<p>We must learn to be accurate in our service. A little mistake can have serious consequences. This is true in knowing the Bible, in expounding the truths, and in spiritual experiences. It is also true in shepherding people and in administrating the church. I advise the young people to be serious in their learning while they are still young and in the stage of learning.</p>
<p>We must also be accurate in listening to others. We should not only listen accurately to what they say but also correctly understand what they mean. Generally, when people listen to others, they often inaccurately hear what is spoken, and their understanding is not according to what others mean but according to their own consideration and concept. As a result, they completely misunderstand others. In our service to the Lord we must understand those whom we shepherd. Otherwise, we may think that someone does not have a problem when he has a problem, or we may think that someone has a problem when he does not have a problem. Our helping others in spiritual matters may be likened to the diagnosis of a medical doctor. If the doctor&rsquo;s diagnosis is inaccurate, his prescription will be wrong. We must learn to be accurate. In the character training that I held in 1953, I listed thirty items of the character of a serving one. The first group of character items consists of being genuine, exact (or, accurate), and strict. In order to serve the Lord, our character needs to be trained in many aspects. We should not think that the education we received included our character. The education that we received was rather shallow. In order to serve the Lord, we must be trained in our character.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_013.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_015.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Living and Work of the Lord's Serving Ones &nbsp; pg 14</div><br></body></html>
