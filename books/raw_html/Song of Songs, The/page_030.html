<P>The palanquin, the pillars, the bottom of the palanquin, the covering, and the love belong to Solomon and to her. Moreover, Solomon, who is in the midst of all these things, is also hers. These things do not just belong to her; they are the maiden herself. This is a grand union. These two sentences show us the complete union between the maiden and Solomon. This is why the question concerns the maiden, but the answer concerns the King.</P><P>Verse 11 says, "Go forth, O ye daughters of Zion, and behold king Solomon with the crown wherewith his mother crowned him in the day of his espousals, and in the day of the gladness of his heart." By 3:11 we have a proper relationship of love. Prior to this, the King and the maiden were only friends, but now there is an espousal between them.</P><P>The "daughters of Zion" may denote the overcomers. They can identify themselves with others' experiences. The crown here is not a crown of glory, nor a crown in the millennium. This crown does not denote authority (kingship). It is a crown given by his mother, in addition to the other crowns he has. This crown is given to him for his marriage and is for the joy of his heart. There are two kinds of crowns in the New Testament. One denotes glory and authority, and the other denotes joy (1 Thes. 2:19). The crown of Solomon belongs to the second kind. It is a crown of joy. Hence, the crown denotes the person he will marry. The King will gain the maiden in a way that is comparable to gaining a crown; it will give joy to his heart. From this point on, he considers the maiden as a most precious crown, as if she is his boast and glory.</P><P>There are different explanations for the word "mother"; none of them is satisfactory. All of the explanations have their basis, but none of them can be linked to a spiritual line. In comparing these explanations, my personal view tends to consider the word "mother" as referring to humanity in general. The father of the Lord Jesus is God, and His fleshly mother is human. This seems to indicate that the Lord Jesus has now secured one from among the human race who can satisfy His heart.</P><P>From this point on, there is a marriage relationship between the maiden and the King. The marriage love and joy come only after there is a complete union. The Bible shows that the enjoyment of our marriage with the Lord is a result of the experience of our union with Him.</P><P>This is the end of the speaking by the third party.</P>
