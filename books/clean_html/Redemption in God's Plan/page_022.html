<h2 class="head2">The Cross of Christ Dealing with Man</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He not only bore man&rsquo;s sins; He also bore our humanity. In His incarnation He put on humanity. He died on the cross as a man; hence, our human nature was crucified with Him. In the eyes of God, when Christ was crucified, He was not alone; we were all crucified with Him (Rom. 6:8). He is the last Adam (5:14; 1 Cor. 15:45). We are included in the first Adam, and his sin is our sin; similarly, we are included in the last Adam, and His death on the cross is our death (Rom. 5:18). Just as we are constituted sinners in the first Adam, we have been crucified in the last Adam. Just as Adam&rsquo;s sin involved all those who are included in him, Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion involved all those who are included in Him. Hence, when Christ was crucified on the cross, we were crucified with Him. His crucifixion was our crucifixion.</p>
<p>Noah&rsquo;s ark is an example. The ark passed though the flood with Noah&rsquo;s family and the living creatures (Gen. 7). Noah&rsquo;s family and the living creatures passed through the flood with the ark because they were in the ark. This example applies to those who are in Christ. We are joined to Christ; hence, God considers us as being in Christ. God does not see us apart from Christ; He sees us in Christ. In God&rsquo;s eyes we died with Christ (Col. 2:20). The Word of God reveals that the flesh, the old man, and the self of those who are in Christ have been crucified with Christ (Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; 5:24). We have been crucified with Christ, and we have died with Him. In addition to our sins, the cross of Christ dealt with our person as well.</p>
<p>Many believers know that the Lord Jesus dealt with their sins on the cross, but they do not know that they also were dealt with on the cross. They know that the Lord died on their behalf, but they do not know that they died with the Lord on the cross. They know about the Lord&rsquo;s vicarious death on the cross but not of their co-crucifixion with Him on the cross. The Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross was not only a vicarious death; it was also a co-crucifixion. If the Lord had only vicariously died for our sins on the cross, the cross would have dealt only with our sins but not our person. We had to die with Him.</p>
<p>When the Lord died on our behalf, the record of our sins before God was wiped away in order to deliver us from the punishment of sin. When we died with the Lord, our old man was crucified so that we might be delivered from the power of sin (Rom. 6:6). If the Lord had accomplished only a vicarious death and we had not died with Him, we would have been delivered from the punishment of sin but not from the power of sin. We would have been delivered from the result of sin but not the bondage of sin. In other words, the salvation of the Lord&rsquo;s cross would not have been complete. On the cross the Lord accomplished a vicarious death, and we also were crucified with Him. Hence, we can now receive the forgiveness of sins and be delivered from the punishment of sin and from the bondage of sin itself.</p>
<p>Without our co-crucifixion with the Lord on the cross, even His vicarious death would not be effective for us. The Lord brought us into His death so that we might be joined to Him. We can partake of His death because His death is our death, and His death was a substitute for our death. His crucifixion enabled Him to die for us; hence, His dying was our dying. We died with Him; we died in His dying.</p>
<p>May the Lord enlighten us to see that He died a vicarious death on our behalf and that we also died with Him. Just as our sins were dealt with by the Lord on the cross, our person also has been dealt with by the Lord on the cross. How we need to see that our sins were on the cross and that we also were on the cross. Our sins have been judged on the cross, we also have been crucified on the cross.</p>
<p>We must know that we have died with Christ. This does not mean that we will die, but that we have died. We do not need to die in ourselves, because we have died with Christ. We died when Christ died, and we even died where He died. Christ died more than nineteen hundred years ago on the cross at Golgotha, and we also died more than nineteen hundred years ago on the cross at Golgotha. Although we were not yet born, we were included in Christ.</p>
<p>As the Firstborn of all creation, Christ is all-inclusive (Col. 1:15). Therefore, His death is all-inclusive and eternal; it transcends time. All creation is included in Christ. Hence, when Christ died, all creation died with Him and in Him. This is a fact. From our point of view, we are still alive, but from God&rsquo;s point of view, we have died. God considers that we died in Christ, and we also believe that we have died in Christ. Everyone who believes in the Lord is joined to the Lord and needs to be baptized into His death in order to be buried with Him and to terminate the old man and everything related to the old man (Rom. 6:4-6). This is the second accomplishment of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross for us.</p>
