<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Righteous Man's Rejoicing in Jehovah<br>and Taking Refuge in Him</H2><P>"All men will fear/And declare God's doing,/And they will ponder what He has done./The righteous man will rejoice in Jehovah and take refuge in Him,/And all the upright in heart will boast" (vv. 9-10). This indicates that the psalmist considered himself not only perfect but also righteous and upright in heart. Like the previous psalm, this psalm is lacking in content. It is hard to find anything here that is of some greater spiritual value.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XIV. THE PSALMIST'S PRAISE TO GOD<br>FOR HIS ENJOYMENT OF GOD IN HIS HOUSE<br>AND FOR GOD'S GOODNESS TO THE EARTH FOR MAN</H2><P>In Psalm 65 we first have the psalmist's praise to God for his enjoyment of God in His house (vv. 1-4), and then the psalmist's praise to God for His goodness to the earth for man (vv. 5-13).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Psalmist's Praise to God<br>for His Enjoyment of God in His House</H2><P>In his praise to God, the psalmist says, "Iniquities prevail against me;/As for our transgressions, You make propitiation for them./Blessed is he whom You have chosen and bring near/To dwell in Your courts./We will be satisfied with the goodness of Your house,/Of Your holy temple" (vv. 3-4). Literally, the Hebrew word translated "iniquities" means "instances of iniquities" or "matters of iniquities." Here David is saying that God should remember the iniquities of David's enemies but should propitiate his transgressions. The word about dwelling in God's courts and being satisfied with the goodness of His house is good, but once again we need to ask the question, "For what do we dwell in God's courts?"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Psalmist's Praise to God<br>for His Goodness to the Earth for Man</H2><P>In his praise to God for His goodness to the earth for man, the psalmist says, "You visit the earth and water it;/You enrich it greatly:/The river of God is full of water./You provide men grain, for so You have prepared the earth./Saturating its furrows, settling its ridges,/You soften it with showers;/You bless its sprouting out" (vv. 9-10). What is meant by the poetic expression "the river of God"? This may refer to the water in the air, to the source of the rain that falls upon the earth so that it may produce grain for the benefit of man.</P><P>What do you get from Psalm 65? Some may appreciate the good poetry, but what do you receive from the psalmist's word about grain, ridges, and furrows? The content of this psalm cannot compare with chapter four of Ephesians, which speaks of keeping the oneness of the Spirit and which reveals that the Body is an entity mingled with the Triune God.</P>
