   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-SEVEN FELLOWSHIP AND EXHORTATIONS 1 CO-WORKERS' MEETING 14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Date:6:30 a.m., Wednesday, April 21, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Hardoon Road, Shanghai</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Nature:Testimonies and questions by the co-workers, and exhortations by Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>INDIVIDUALS HANDING OVER</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>RESULTING IN THE BODY TAKING OVER</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brother Du Chung-chun asked: What occupations are considered proper?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Brother Nee answered: Brother Chu said something once: "If I hand something over to the Body, I do not have to take care of it any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is no longer my own business, but the Body's business."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is rightly put.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Your burden is no longer on your shoulders, but on the shoulders of the brothers and sisters and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If you hand yourself over, everything becomes the Lord's. If you make money, it is God who is making the money; and if you lose money, it is God who is losing the money.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our principle is to let the dead bury the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to know that to serve God is not just a matter of serving God alone, but to serve Him in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today, by the grace of God, we have handed ourselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you merely say with your mouth that you are serving God, nobody knows when you have stopped this service.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This kind of service is not definite.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, if you hand yourself over, you cannot turn back even if you want to.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may say that you cannot walk, but many others will carry you; they can move you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If our service is for the church, we will be able to give up even the things that we could not otherwise give up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not a matter of my own arrangement, but a matter of the Lord's arrangement in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is a tremendous thing for a person to decide to consecrate himself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, this thing is not done individually, but in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Brother Chow asked: In the future, should the brothers engage in business by using the name of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No answer from Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>SISTER RUTH LEE'S FELLOWSHIP AND TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Sister Ruth Lee: I have asked for permission already from the other brothers concerning what I am about to say.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It all happened about thirteen years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time I wanted to have an apartment, but I could not go into detail about the reason for having it...Although I have been negative in recent years, there was still a supply from the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brother Chu gave me ten thousand dollars, and when Brother Chang Tze-che came from Tsingtao, he gave me a few thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>From that time on, I decided to set aside a certain amount from what I have received...When I moved back from the countryside, I saw many more white-haired people in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The next time I came back, there were even more white hairs...The sisters had given up all their savings, and some sisters had to stay in the hospital and could not go home...What I have can only become less; it will never become more.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All the money that I have is enough to feed one more person for a month only; it will be gone by the second month.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I can sleep on the floor and let others sleep on my bed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But others will not feel comfortable sleeping this way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we have to provide a place for others to rest, it should be a place where others can rest comfortably.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I felt that somehow I have to have a place that is like a home, that others will not feel ashamed or burdensome to live in, and which is close to the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only then will such a place be able to render others some spiritual help...When a person gets older, she tends to develop her own peculiarities.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Others say that living together provides fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Actually, living together provides frustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is why I have hoped all the time to have a place that can provide hospitality for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brother Lee said that perhaps they can provide a place for me in Chefoo.</S>
