   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. A SYMBOL OF THE TOTALITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF GOD S PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is difficult to understand the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we would rightly interpret this book, we need all the other sixty-five books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Hence, in order to understand who this woman is, we need the whole Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some Christian teachers have held the concept that this woman is Mary, the mother of Jesus, and that the man-child is Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This concept, however, does not suit the context of this chapter because Jesus ascended to the heavens nearly two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But in 12:5 and 6 we are told that the man-child will be raptured to the throne of God and that, following this, the woman will be nourished for a thousand two hundred and sixty days v. 6 . These twelve hundred sixty days are three and a half years or forty-two months 12:14; 11:2-3; 13:5 , which will be the period of the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This proves that the man-child is not the Lord Jesus and that the woman is not Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Mary was just a single woman on earth, but this woman is universally corporate and is revealed in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Others say that this woman is Israel, the Jewish race.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some of those who hold this view take Genesis 37:9 as their basis.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to this verse, Joseph had a dream in which the sun and the moon and the eleven stars made obeisance to him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since the woman wears the sun and the twelve stars and stands upon the moon, apparently corresponding to Joseph s dream concerning his family, it is said that the woman in Revelation 12 must signify Israel, the Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But 12:17 proves that this woman does not only comprise those who keep the commandments of God, but also those who have the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who keep the commandments of God are Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, those who have the testimony of Jesus must be New Testament believers, not Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is a strong proof that the woman is not only composed of Jews but of two classes of people: the Jews who keep the commandments of God and the believers who have the testimony of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, to say that this woman is merely Israel does not fit the whole context of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The woman in this chapter is the totality of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the vision, this totality is in three sections: the section of her head with the twelve stars, the section of her body clothed with the sun, and the section of her feet on the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, this woman is universal, composed of the twelve stars, the moon, and the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Joseph s dream, the sun, the moon, and the eleven stars plus Joseph himself signified the total composition of God s people on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Based upon the principle of that dream, the sun, the moon, and the twelve stars here must signify the totality of God s people on earth, which in this chapter is symbolized by a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Most of her being is clothed with the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The sun signifies God s people in the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Before Christ came into the world, it was the dark night of the Old Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Christ came, it was the sunrising from on high Luke 1:78 KJV, margin , the beginning of the age of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before that, it was the age of the moon, which signifies God s people in the Old Testament time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The moon is under the feet of the woman, for the age of the moon was the age of the law, which should not be exalted as the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The stars, which signify the patriarchs, God s people before the law was given, are on her head as a crown.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>All God s people in these three ages, who together constitute this woman, are light bearers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, she is the bright woman shining throughout all generations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A. The Patriarchs Symbolized</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>by the Twelve Stars</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we read the Bible carefully, we shall see that God s people are grouped into three sections.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Firstly, there are the patriarchs, who lived from the time of Adam until the time of Moses; secondly, there are the people under the law, from Moses until Christ s first coming; thirdly, there are those from Christ s first coming to His coming the second time, the believers who compose the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those in the third category are the majority of God s people in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The patriarchs are symbolized by the twelve stars Dan 12:3 shining individually in the night with heavenly light.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All the patriarchs were individual stars.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They dwelt in the nighttime because, in their age, Christ had not yet come and day had not dawned.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As individual stars, they are a crown for this universal woman, symbolizing the glory of God s grace and His economy exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The number twelve signifies completion in God s eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The patriarchs, who are in the principle of God s grace, were not under the law; hence, they were a crown exalted above the head of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>All the patriarchs, such as Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob, are considered to be a crown.</S>
