In the Bible there are three levels to the divine revelation and the kind of person we are determines what we receive when we read the Bible
Some people who look for filial piety from their children find the Bible to be a book on honoring one's parents
The sisters who want their husbands to love them find the Bible to be a book about husbands loving their wives
Those who expect their wives to submit to them find the Bible to be a book on wives' submission to their husbands
The Lord Jesus said, 'I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life'
In John 14 17 we have the Lord's word of farewell to His disciples and His prayer on the night of His betrayal
God promised Adam that the seed of the woman, Christ, who would be born of a virgin, would bruise the head of the serpent, Satan
At the fullness of time, Christ Himself took on a body of flesh and blood to destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the devil
The second is the blessing of the Son: the Lord Jesus makes His face to shine upon us and is gracious to us; He is light and grace to us
When we come to the New Testament, we see another threefold blessing of the Divine Trinity given by God to the believers
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
The love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit speak of the Triune God being with us as our blessing
In the New Testament also, God promises blessing and longevity to those who honor their parents: 'Honor your father and mother
It makes known to us the mystery of God's will, which from the ages has been hidden in God, who created all things
At the time of David and Solomon, God gained His permanent habitation on earth, the temple, for the full expression of His glory
For this reason we must help the brothers and sisters to allow the element of Christ to increase in them day by day
May we have Your flow within and Your word without, so that we can have the proper expression and the utterance to speak You forth
The first layer is God's gospel and salvation, the second is God's blessing and prosperity, and the third is God's economy and dispensing
After he hears the gospel and receives God's salvation, he is made alive, and he enters into the first layer of the divine revelation
Later, he may experience the Lord's blessing and prosperity and may enter into the second layer of the divine revelation
At the time of David and Solomon the temple was built as Gods permanent and expanded habitation on earth to express His glory in a full way
At the end of the Old Testament, the temple was rebuilt and continued to be God's habitation on earth for the expression of His glory
In order to accomplish the economy of working Himself into man, God has to pass through the means of dispensing
On the other hand, He was the brass serpent, which shows that He became flesh, that is, He was sent in the likeness of the flesh of sin
As soon as we believe into Him, the Spirit of life in resurrection enters into our spirit and abides in our spirit
When our mind is renewed, our will and our emotion as the other parts of our soul will spontaneously be renewed also
In this way God's life and nature will be added into us, and we will be metabolically transformed into His image to express Him
In the end, He will transfigure our bodies, so that our three parts will be saturated with the Spirit and will be like Christ in every way
The Triune God, who has been processed and is dispensed into us, has Himself become the law of the Spirit of life
The processed Triune God has been put into us; He is now operating in us according to a law and not according to an activity
He is not operating in us merely as the Almighty God, but is operating in us spontaneously as a law that is transforming us
Lord, although the condition of each one of us is different, may You grant each one of us a special word through the same message
Although God loves us and chose and predestinated us to be the objects of His grace, we became fallen soon after we were created
The sealing of the Spirit, which is the anointing of the Spirit in us, is not something that happens once for all
When we received the seal of the Spirit, this piece of paper or cotton ball began to be saturated and permeated
Today, the sealing Spirit as the seal is sealing everything of the all-inclusive Christ, all that He has attained and obtained, into us
These gifts, and especially the gifts that are for the building up of the church, require the growth in life and even the maturity in life
Through the joints the whole Body will then receive the rich supply, which is the rich dispensing of the life of Christ as the Spirit
In Revelation He said that the overcomers will eat of the tree of life in the paradise of God , and of the hidden manna
At the end of the Bible, the Spirit and the bride are still calling the thirsty sinners to drink of and be satisfied by the water of life
Through man's eating, drinking, and enjoying of God, God is dispensed into man to be his constituent and element
For this reason, we must eat, drink, and enjoy God, and we must absorb Him into us so that He becomes our life and everything
We know that a few hours after we eat, the food will be digested and assimilated and will become our nutrients
Peter 2:2 says, 'As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow unto salvation'
The eternal life spoken of in John 316 and Romans 623 and the words of comfort spoken in Matthew 1128 are examples of the good word of God
For a plant to grow, first, there is the need of sunlight; second, there is the need of air; and third, there is the need of water
Through this kind of pray-reading, we bring the words that we read into the Holy Spirit, and the words will become spirit
When we speak it out to others, it becomes the word again, and when others receive this word, it again becomes the Spirit in them
By receiving the Lord's word in reading the Bible, and by contacting the Lord's Spirit in prayer, we receive and enjoy Christ
It is not healthy to stuff ourselves with food for three days and then go without food for the next three days
If we do this we will become one who enjoys and receives the Lord through His word and our spiritual life will surely be healthy and living
After this, we saw that the first supply in this dispensing is the supply to the believers in their growth in life
If the Bible taught only morality and ethics, then the classical books of the Chinese would be just as good as the Bible
Based on the Bible, he said that both good and evil belong to the same tree, the tree of knowledge of good and evil
He said, 'I am the bread of life; he who comes to Me shall by no means hunger, and he who believes in Me shall by no means ever thirst'
He said, 'I am the living bread which came down out of heaven; if anyone eats of this bread, he shall live forever
When we believe in Him with our heart and call on Him with our mouth, He enters into our spirit and enlivens our spirit
May our eyes be opened to see that what God truly desires is for Christ to be life in us and to be lived out of us
He includes all the rich ingredients of Christ's divinity, humanity, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
Since man was created in the image of God, within man there are human virtues, such as love, light, holiness, and righteousness
When we believe in Christ and receive this pneumatic Christ, He enters into us to be our life within, and He lives Himself out from us
We do not love by our own love; rather, we love by the Christ who is living in us and who is our bountiful supply
With all boldness, as always, even now, daily, Christ will be magnified in our bodies, whether through life or through death
If we want to receive and to enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, first we must love the Lord with all our hearts
In such a condition we live in the fellowship of the eternal life of Christ and enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
The more we set our mind on the spirit, the more we will abide in the Lord, and the more the Lord will live Himself through us
Since God is both the Spirit and the word, He created for us a mind to understand and also a spirit to receive
Finally, if we desire to receive and enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, we must also walk only according to spirit
Our walk, our speaking, our actions, and our attitudes must be conducted according to spirit and not according to flesh
In this way, we will daily receive and enjoy the dispensing of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Under this dispensing, we will spontaneously receive the supply of Christ within and will live a life that expresses Christ
As the Spirit He is the flow that brings the source with the course into us, so that the riches of the Divine Trinity will become our supply
Incarnation was the initiation of the divine dispensing; it was the first step of God's dispensing of Himself into us
When we come to Jesus and call upon His name, within His name there is a fullness; this fullness is grace and reality
He is dispensing Himself as grace and reality to His believers so that all His believers can receive Him again and again every day
It may seem as if we are merely praying, but actually we are receiving the living Lord as our water, food, air, and everything we need
Between us and the Lord there will be a transmission, and that transmission will enter into others and they will receive Christ
In resurrection He as the last Adam changed His form again, from the form of the human flesh to a life-giving Spirit
In eternity past, God had only divinity; He did not have humanity, and He did not have the elements of death and resurrection
As such a Spirit, He is compounded with the elements of divinity, humanity, the all-inclusive death, and the powerful resurrection
All these elements were compounded with the Spirit of God as the base, as the oil, to produce the compound Spirit
Into this base were added four kinds of spices, which, when compounded with the oil, became an ointment for anointing
When this ointment anointed, all the elements of the compound ointment were applied to the objects that were anointed
In painting, one layer of paint is painted upon another until the painted article is covered with all the elements of the paint
Day by day and moment by moment, as they are under this anointing, they will experience the 'painting,' layer upon layer and coat upon coat
The Spirit of God has been compounded with the elements of Christ's humanity, death, and resurrection to become the Spirit of Jesus Christ
Many of them do not realize that to be filled with the Spirit is to be filled with the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ
To be filled with the Spirit is to be filled with the compound Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, who is the bountiful supply
In Greek, the word for bountiful supply denotes the supplying of all the needs of a musical group by the leader of the group
Whatever the group needs, whether it be musical instruments, clothing, uniforms, food, or medicine, is supplied by the leader
As the life-giving Spirit, who is the compound Spirit, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, He has the bountiful supply to meet all our needs
The new way is not merely to knock on the doors of people's houses; it is to knock on the door of their heart and to touch their spirit
As the Spirit within us, He has passed through the great processes of incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension
We should not merely preach to others; we should give them with assurance the command and the order to believe and be baptized
In the Christian life, from the day we are regenerated, He waters us, feeds us, and flows out from within us every day
The first item of the gospel work is fruit-bearing, that we may dispense the riches of the divine life to others
In feeding the lambs, we dispense further the riches of the divine life to the new believers for their growth in life
The way to carry out the gospel work and the feeding work is to dispense the life of Christ into the unbelievers and the believers
Today, the processed and consummated Triune God has a fullness, which is His grace as our enjoyment and His reality as our gain
When we remain in the spirit, we abide in Christ, and Christ has the ground to abide in us to carry out His divine dispensing in us
In this way His word will enter into us and will abide in us, and will dispense all the riches of Christ into our being
When we come to the Bible, we must realize that we are coming to the living God, the living Christ, the living Spirit, and His life
We should also eat Christ with the drinking of Him; that is, we should receive His word by prayer , by pray-reading His Word
We do not do these things by ourselves, but by the One who lives in us and who is now dispensing His riches into us all the time
We will be supplied and will be able to grow in life, live Christ, preach the gospel with authority, and do the divine work
It tells us that God wants us not only to have life, but also, after receiving life, to be supplied by this life day by day and hour by hour
To eat, drink, and breathe is to take food, drink, and air into us and have them dispensed into the different parts of our being
When we eat and drink the Lord in this way, we are joined to Him and abide in Him, and He in turn abides in us
In such an abiding, the riches of the tree are transmitted to the branches, and eventually, the branches bear much fruit
The other three Gospels Matthew, Mark, and Luke also contain records of the Lord's commissioning us to preach the gospel
In John chapter one we see that the Triune God became flesh in the Son for the purpose of dispensing Himself into man as grace and reality
The Lord's incarnation, birth, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension are all for the dispensing of the Triune God as life into us
John 7 says that out of the innermost being of those who drink of the living water from Him will flow rivers of living water
Some Bible teachers have said that 1 Corinthians was written with the purpose of solving many serious problems in the church
Corinthians 1:9 says, 'God is faithful, through whom you were called into the fellowship of His Son, Jesus Christ our Lord'
We have been called by the faithful God into the fellowship of His Son for the purpose of participating in and enjoying Him
Corinthians 1:24 says, 'But to those who are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ, God's power and God's wisdom'
Let us therefore keep the feast, not with old leaven, nor with leaven of malice and evil, but with unleavened bread of sincerity and truth'
Christ as the Passover lamb dispenses to the believers the life of the lamb, to be their initial supply of life and power
We must not only eat Christ as our Passover lamb, but must also go on to eat the unleavened bread of the Feast of Unleavened Bread
In order to run the race, we need to eat the same spiritual food and drink the same spiritual drink as our daily life supply
The water of life that flows out from Christ as the riven rock carries with it the tree of life, which is Christ as our life
As far as the human body is concerned, the head supplies all the riches to the body and meets the needs of the body
He supplies His divine life and element to every member that they may have the life capacity to be the many gifts in His Body
Baptism ushers us into an organic union with Christ and the Triune God, making us living members of the Body of Christ
Whatever race or nationality we belong to, and whatever social status we may have, we should all be part of this Body
We should pay our attention only to Him and should not pay attention to any person, event, or thing apart from Him
Though the gifts are varied, they all issue from the operation of the Spirit and are distributed to each one individually as He purposes
At the time a baby is born, he may be complete in all his organs, but his feet cannot walk, his hands cannot work, and his mouth cannot talk
If we do not receive the nourishment and the supply we will not grow the life capacity will not develop and the gifts will not be manifested
Many Christians have been listening to sermons for decades, but they cannot speak with clarity concerning a truth as basic as justification
If we need love, hope, or faith, Christ as our supply will spontaneously be expressed from us as love, hope, and faith
When we come to 1 Corinthians 14 Paul begins by saying Pursue love and desire earnestly spiritual gifts but rather that you may prophesy
The pursuing of love must be accompanied by an earnest desire for the most profitable gift, the gift of prophecy
To practice the new way today is to apply this life-dispensing of Christ practically to our meetings and service
It is by opening to the Lord to fellowship with Him constantly in our daily life and to abide in Him unceasingly
In this way we will have a deposit, a saving, of the Lord's word and will have the spiritual sight to discern all things
It is by this way that our meetings and service can be one with our inner life and can have Christ as their content and reality
According to the New Testament revelation, economy is a particular term used by God to unveil His eternal plan
When we put the two words together, the result, oikonomia, means a household regulation, household government, or household administration
In a love feast we may have an abundance of food, but there is the need for some 'dispensers' to distribute the food to everyone
After digestion, there is also the process of assimilation, through which we assimilate what has been received through digestion
Everything that is mentioned in the New Testament concerning God has to do with His dispensing for His economy
Not only do we have John 3:16; we also have another wonderful verse, John 1:14: 'And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us
He is rich in the person of the Father, He is rich in the person of the Son, and He is rich in the person of the Spirit
It is true that God is rich in light, power, life, love, holiness, righteousness, and thousands of other items
In order for us to be the proper material for God's building, we must be processed; we must pass through a number of steps
In John 14:16-17a, the Lord Jesus told us that the Spirit as the third person of the Godhead is the reality of the second
We need to realize that every day and all the time, the three divine persons as the Divine Trinity are right within us
The dispensing of the Triune God has only one goal, which is to transform us, to change us metabolically with His divine element
The church of God is not a group of so-called Christians gathering together in a fleshly, worldly, or soulish way
While He is holding and supporting, He is dispensing and imparting His divine element of life into all the members
Whenever we say, 'Lord Jesus,' with a purpose, we have the feeling that He is imparting something to us and that a dispensing is going on
Since Christ's redemption has imparted something of God into our being, we have something of God Himself within us
The redemption of Christ has worked something of God into our tripartite being through the dispensing of the divine life and element into us
Once the transmission of electricity stops, the lights in the building will go out, and all the electrical appliances will cease to function
The church has at least these three functions: to be the Body of Christ, to be the new man, and to be the dwelling place of God
There are parts of this Body in England in Brazil in Iceland in China in Mongolia in India in Tibet and in all other parts of the earth
The church is the dwelling place of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit who is now consummated as the Spirit
Through His all-inclusive death, He was released from the shell of His humanity, and whatever was in that shell flowed out
In the Old Testament type, the living water flowed out of the smitten rock to quench the thirst of the people of Israel
The old way is to sit down and talk with people about God for a long time with no authority, power, or presence of Christ
When they are fed, they will grow and will begin to understand the spiritual and divine things concerning God and Christ
When the life of Christ grows within a person, this life will issue in a blossoming, and the blossoming will issue in fruit-bearing
At that time we did not understand very well who the Lord Jesus is, but we believed in the Lord, called on His name, and were baptized
The dispensing of the divine life in the preaching of the gospel is like the giving of an injection to a patient
A nurse does not need to explain very much to a patient; she only needs to inject the medicine into the patient's arm
Whenever a person is baptized, he is put into Christ, and at that moment Christ comes into such a one to enliven him
Through the preaching of the gospel, Christ is infused into his being, and he is made alive together with Christ
In Ephesians 2 we are told that the believers are first enlivened and then seated with Christ in the heavenlies
After a person is enlivened by Christ in His resurrection, he may have the realization that he is in the heavens with Christ
After we baptize a person, we need to go back to that person to build him up by feeding him with spiritual milk
We may say that we do not know what is going on, but all the time much dispensing and spiritual feeding is taking place within us
We may have no sensation regarding this, but we should not trust in our feelings; we should trust in our dispensing God
The Bible does not say that the new man needs to be built up; but it tells us repeatedly that the Body of Christ needs to be built up
For the church to exist and to stand properly in a living way, there is the need for the apostle's stewardship
At the same time, through the ministering of the rich word, it distributes the untraceable and immeasurable riches of Christ to the church
Recently, in Columbia, South Carolina, and in London, England, the churches came together to have conferences in mutuality
They took the outlines and the verses of the messages given at the end of the 1990 Summer Training and spoke to one another in a living way
He bowed his knees to the Father, who is the source of all the families in this universe, and offered a very proper and complete prayer
The result of this total dispensing of Christ is His settling in our entire being, making our entire being His home
In the previous two chapters we covered the first half of the book of Ephesians, from chapter one through chapter three
Within this wonderful body there is something even more mysterious; it is an abstract, invisible, and untouchable matter called life
The plants and flowers in the Amazon River region of South America have many beautiful colors, shapes, and designs
Through faith in Christ, we the believers are organically united with the Son and with one another to become a living organism
Formerly, we might have been a person who loved dancing, going to nightclubs, dressing up, and wearing make-up
We need to exercise our spirit and our faith to give others the command to believe in Christ and to be baptized
Each gifted person has a measure, and the divine grace is given, or dispensed, to him according to that measure
Christ died on the cross not merely to take away our sins, but also to destroy Satan and to capture us, the captives of Satan
Before being perfected, they were not able; but they are made able through the perfecting of the gifted persons
My speaking of these messages also is a perfecting that enables the saints to build up the Body of Christ directly
The perfecting by the gifted persons is for the direct building of the organic Body of Christ by the members of the Body
Although some of us may love the Lord very much, we may still hold on to many things that the Lord does not want
As we are being perfected, and while we contact the Lord day after day, He will require that we give up some of these things
Before we go to the barber shop, put on a dress, make any decision, or do anything, we need to pray to the Lord first
We can stretch our arms and legs in a flexible way because of the many joints in our arms, hands, fingers, legs, feet, and toes
Although the arm may have a large measure and the little finger may have a small measure every member functions according to its own measure
In the same way, in the Body of Christ, there are many joints of the rich supply who are joined closely together
When we return from all the distracting things to our spirit, Christ will have the opportunity to settle Himself in our heart
In 4:17-32 it shows us in a very detailed way the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity in the believers' living
From these three verses we see that the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity is the base for our daily living
The third verse concerning the divine dispensing is verse 30, which admonishes us not to grieve the Holy Spirit, in whom we have been sealed
The contents, the elements, and the essence of the sealing ink are the divine life plus Jesus' practical humanity
The life of God, the truth in Jesus, and the sealing of the Holy Spirit are the three sources of the divine dispensing
Electricity may be installed in a building, but if even a thin piece of paper is inserted between the wires, the electricity will be stopped
In Him we can see the wonderful excellent divine attributes such as the divine love light and patience lived out through the human virtues
To have the truth that is in Jesus is just to have God the Father as the reality living through our own humanity
We do not live according to the old habits and the old manner of life, but live according to the present, up-to-date divine dispensing
We should not 'lose' to the sunset, but should 'beat' the sunset by letting our indignation go before the sun sets
If we let go of our anger before the sun goes down, we will be free and will be able to sing and praise the Lord
A teacher may bring home a piece of chalk from school, and a worker may bring home some things from his office
If we do this, we will give grace, another form of what God is, in the dispensing of the divine life, to the hearers
If we are not sealed and permeated by the sealing ink of the Holy Spirit today, we cannot expect to be redeemed on that day
The sixth point is that we must abstain from all bitterness, anger, wrath, clamor, and evil speaking, with all malice
We should abstain not only from all bitterness, but also from all anger, all wrath, all clamor, all evil speaking, and all malice
Sometimes two husky persons would occupy so much space that it became impossible for the other three to sit comfortably
There will be peace, and we will have a proper church life that is good for the building up of the Body of Christ
