<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST'S RESURRECTION WITH ITS POWER IN<br>THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT BEING THE SUFFICIENT GRACE<br>OF THE PROCESSED AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>Christ's resurrection with its power in the life-giving Spirit is the sufficient grace of the processed and consummated Triune God (2 Cor. 12:9; 13:14; 1 Cor. 15:10, 45b, 58). We may also say that the Spirit as the realization of Christ's resurrection and its power is the sufficient grace. The sufficient grace is the compound Spirit as the reality of resurrection.</P><P>First Corinthians 15 proves this. This is a long chapter of fifty-eight verses on Christ's resurrection. In this chapter, Paul presents a rebuttal to those who say there is no resurrection (vv. 12-19). In verse 10a Paul also said, "But by the grace of God I am what I am." Grace here is the resurrected Christ as the life-giving Spirit. Paul went on to say, "I labored more abundantly than all of them, yet not I but the grace of God which is with me" (v. 10b). Paul labored more abundantly than all of the apostles by the grace which operated in him. The grace of God with him was the consummated Spirit, the consummation of the Triune God.</P><P>In verse 58 Paul said, "Therefore, my beloved brothers, be steadfast, immovable, always abounding in the work of the Lord, knowing that your labor is not in vain in the Lord." We should not be dismayed or disappointed. Instead, we should labor. We need to labor not by our self, not by our power, not by our strength, and not by our capacity, but by the compound, all-inclusive Spirit who is the reality of the divine resurrection, which is the Triune God Himself. Then our labor will never be in vain. This is the walk and the work of the Christian life. Actually, our work is our walking, our living.</P><P>Some people wonder when I will retire. I will retire only when I go to be with the Lord. This is because I have something within me making me "crazy." The Triune God, the resurrection, and the compound Spirit are my enjoyment. This is the experience of the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Spirit being with us (2 Cor. 13:14). The consummated God, the resurrection, and the all-inclusive, consummated Spirit are our portion in the divine fellowship.</P>
