In that place there will be the <sup>4</sup>weeping and the gnashing of teeth.</p><h2 class="uhead1">Portions from Life-study Messages</h2><p>Verses 45 through 51 are concerned with faithfulness and prudence.…Faithfulness is shown toward the Lord, whereas prudence is exercised toward the believers. Watchfulness is for being raptured into the Lord’s presence (v. 42); faithfulness is for reigning in the kingdom (v. 47).</p><p>The household spoken of in verse 45 refers to the believers (Eph. 2:19), who constitute the church (1 Tim. 3:15). To give them food is to minister the word of God and Christ as the life supply to the believers in the church. We all must learn how to minister the life supply to the household of the Lord at the appointed time.</p><p>[Matthew 24:46-47 says], “Blessed is that slave whom his master, when he comes, will find so doing. Truly I say to you that he will set him over all his possessions.” Here to be blessed is to be rewarded with the authority to rule in the manifestation of the kingdom. In the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, the Lord will set the faithful slave over all His possessions. This will be a reward to him.</p><p>The evil slave [in verse 48] is a saved believer, as seen in the fact that (1) he was appointed by the Lord (v. 45), (2) he called the Lord “my Master,” and (3) he believed that the Lord was coming. Verse 49 says that the evil slave beats his fellow slaves and eats and drinks with the drunken. To beat the fellow slaves is to mistreat the fellow believers, and to eat and drink with the drunken is to keep company with worldly people, who are drunk with worldly things.</p><p>Verses 50 and 51 say, “The master of that slave will come on a day when he does not expect him and at an hour which he does not know, and will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites. In that place there will be the weeping and the gnashing of teeth.” The problem with the evil slave is not that he does not know that the Lord is coming, but that he does not expect Him. He does not like to live the kind of life that is prepared for the Lord’s coming. Therefore, when the Lord comes back, He will cut him asunder and appoint his portion with the hypocrites.
