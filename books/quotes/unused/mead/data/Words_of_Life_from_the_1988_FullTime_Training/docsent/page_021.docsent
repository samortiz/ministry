   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>RECEIVING REVELATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This teaching concerning first dying and then living for the experience of the resurrection power is quite deep.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are not many Christians who know these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As a result, few people have this kind of experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although the New Testament mentions this matter several times, due to the lack of this kind of concept, people do not see this when they read the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Chinese especially, who are full of the concept of good and evil, have no idea or feeling concerning the matters of life and death as mentioned in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When they read them, it is as if there was not such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When I first studied the Bible, I also was unfamiliar with this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Later, I gradually received the enlightenment and tried to release the light concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I believe that after you have listened to my speaking on this subject for a while, you will know, more or less, how to speak a little.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, you still need to receive the light and to have revelation concerning this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Only then will this become reality to you.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>According to the revelation in the Bible, when Christ was crucified on the cross, He included us all in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then He brought us, who were dead in Him, into His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We were crucified together with Him, buried with Him, and also resurrected with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In resurrection, His divine element, that is, the Spirit and life, was mingled with our humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this way, our resurrected humanity is uplifted in His divinity and is thus transformed and sanctified.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>REMAINING IN THE DEATH OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>My burden in this chapter is to show you that for every saved person, the more he loves the Lord, the more he likes to remain in the Lord s death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus mentioned this in John 12:26: If anyone serves Me, let him follow Me; and where I am, there also shall My servant be.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord always put Himself in the place of death so that He would lose His soul life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we want to serve the Lord, we should follow Him to walk on this pathway of losing the soul life and living in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we truly follow the Lord, we will definitely encounter sufferings and persecutions, and there will also be the distraction of the world and the pride of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only by remaining in the Lord s death can we overcome these trials and difficulties.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to my observation, we who serve the Lord have another serious problem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is our natural affection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To those who fit our taste, we are drawn closer; those who do not fit our taste, we will dislike and even separate ourselves from them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Leviticus 2 says that with all the meal offerings offered to Jehovah, there should not be any honey with leaven; rather, they should be mingled with salt vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Honey here signifies natural affection, virtues, or excellencies; salt denotes the death of Christ, or the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our natural affection can only bring in corruption and decay, but the death of Christ is effective in killing germs and preserving against decay.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the church life, regardless who treats us well, we should not become sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should consider all the saints to be the same; all are brothers and sisters in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The more we love the Lord, the more we need to learn to live in the Lord s death so that we can be delivered from our natural affection, taste, and opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Hence, the basic principle set up by the Bible for us believers is neither self-improvement nor the rejection of evil and the practice of good, but the putting of ourselves into the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we love the Lord and enjoy Him, we abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As such, His first operation is to put to death all the fleshly things in us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His salt with its germ-killing effectiveness will kill all the germs which come out of our naturalness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whoever has had the experience can confirm this word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A. B. Simpson, who wrote Hymns, #481, knew this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the second stanza he said,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Tis not hard to die with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When His risen life we know;</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Tis not hard to share His suff rings</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When our hearts with joy o erflow.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In His resurrection power</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He has come to dwell in me,</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>And my heart is gladly going</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the way to Calvary.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The more we die with Christ this way, the more His resurrection power will be manifested in us.</S>
