   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST AND GOD CHAPTER ONE THE SEARCH FOR GOD THE FIRST QUESTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We will look at the Christian faith from its very foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first subject we are confronted with is God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Let us read a few verses from the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Psalm 14:1 of the Old Testament says, "The fool has said in his heart,/There is no God."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This sentence may also be translated as "The fool does not want God in his heart."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The result of saying this can be found in the second sentence of the same verse: "They are corrupt; they do abominable deeds."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Let us also take a passage from the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hebrews 11:6 says, "For he who comes forward to God must believe that He is."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THREE KINDS OF PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whether you claim to be a Christian, a non-believer, or a seeker after truth, we will start by examining the subject of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this respect the world is divided into three camps.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first is that of the atheists who do not believe in a God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The second consists of the agnostics.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have no sure knowledge about the deity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>On the one hand, they dare not say there is no God, but on the other hand, they are not clear if God does exist.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We belong to the third category of those who believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>PROSECUTION</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Is there a God?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I will not try to say yes or no to this question.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, I will make this place a law court.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I will ask you to be the judge, and I will be the prosecutor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The work of a judge is to make decisions, to approve or disapprove the truth of statements; the work of a prosecutor is to present all the evidence and arguments that he can possibly gather.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before we proceed, we have to be clear about one fact: all prosecutors are not eyewitnesses of crimes.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They are not policemen.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A policeman may personally witness an event, whereas a prosecutor obtains his information only indirectly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He places all the charges, evidence, and arguments collected before the judge.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the same way, I shall present before you everything that I can possibly find.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you ask whether I have seen God or not, I would say "no."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I am reading or demonstrating what I have gathered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>My job is to search for facts and to call for witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are to arrive at a conclusion yourself.</S>
