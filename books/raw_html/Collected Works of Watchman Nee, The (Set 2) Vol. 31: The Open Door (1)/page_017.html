<h2 class="head2">Two Letters from Hangchow</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Dear Brother X in the Lord:</p><p>I received your letter a long time ago. Because of a boil on my hand, it has been difficult for me to write, and I was delayed in replying to your letter. I have to ask the Lord to show me what position I should stand on and what gift I have been given in the Body of Christ so that I may be faithful to the end and so that I may not overstep or restrict the gift of the Spirit. X is still sympathetic to us and still has us in his heart. There is hope for him to turn. May the Lord accomplish the work of unity. Your prayer before the Father will certainly be remembered. Jin Dong-chu is working in Shanghai at present. Brother Wu Sen-rong is safe in Hangchow. My family has returned to Ju-jih's house.</p><p>Brother Ma Di-seng<br />October 25<br />(Brother Ma has left Hangchow now. His correspondence address is yet unknown.)</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Dear Mr. X, my brother in the Lord:</p><p>Since I preached the gospel at the temples, my inward being has been more in darkness. I have no confidence about anything pertaining to the present situation, and I feel that a multitude of believers is being tested generally in faith. The gold has changed its color, but perhaps God will grant us faith that is more precious than gold. He has promised "the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes though it is proved by fire." In another place He says, "God is mindful of sending woes to men." In another place He says that in the last days, "because lawlessness will be multiplied the love of many will grow cold." God is testing the believers to see whether they meet the standard of "cast down but not destroyed." In other words, He is finding out whether believers will pass the test when they are put through a certain environment. Formerly a life of faith was required only of the workers. Now every believer has to live by faith. It seems that my prayer has done nothing except bounce off a blank wall, but I still insist that I will find my way out through prayer. Concerning the condition of the meeting, Brother X has been most zealous. He goes with some other brothers to the Army Casualty Hospital and the Refugee Camp often to preach the gospel. He is also faithful in his material offerings. Greetings to you.</p><p>Yours,<br />Si Meng-yu<br />October 29<br />(We do not know where Brother Si has moved to now&mdash;Editor.)</p><h2 class="head2">Lan-Si, Chekiang Province</h2><p>Dear respected older brother X in the Lord:</p><p>Jia-Shing and Soochow have capitulated, and ninety percent of the residents of Hangchow have fled. Brothers Chiu and Ma, together with brothers Jun-dao, Ming-jin, Lin-guei, Fang-chen, and Chen-yi, have left. Their families have also been sent to various places up the river. Brother Chiu's family is temporarily staying in Jien-Deh and Brother Ma's family has settled in Ju-Jih. Hu's family and my family are now in Lan-Si. Ah-lai, my sister-in-law, will go to Chou-Jia-Pu. The mother of Huang Tsai-ching and Si's mother have gone to Ju-Jih also. Brother Hsu Tseng-rong has gone to Chou-Jia-Pu. Mr. and Mrs. Feng-tien have come to Lan-Si with me. Senior Brother Ruan Chi-yu had not left Hangchow as of a few days ago. Perhaps he has gone to Chou-Jia-Pu already; I have no idea about it. Senior Mrs. Chang has taken the little ones in Ruan's family to Chou-Jia-Pu. Hou-ran went to Chang-Kou from Lan-Si yesterday and resumed classes at the new address in Hwei-Lan. We have given written notice that we will give up our rented meeting hall as of December 1. The furniture does not need to be moved out yet and can still be kept in Dong-Chie Road. Eventually we may have to pay a little storage fee. Brother Ma's and my belongings have been placed in storage already. We do not have time to move out Sister Miao's and your belongings. We are retreating with the very limited amount of money we have, and our future living is in the Father's hand. The business in the company has stopped, and in a few days we will gather together in Jien-Deh to consider any further move. My wife gave birth to our sixth child about fifteen days ago. Now I have two boys and four girls. May the Lord be gracious to us. Please keep us posted of your whereabouts. Peace be to you.</p><p>Your younger brother,<br />Yang-deh<br />November 23<br />[Address omitted]</p>
