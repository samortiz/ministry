   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Matthew 10:38 through 39 the Lord Jesus says, "And he who does not take his cross and follow after Me is not worthy of Me. He who finds his soul-life shall lose it, and he who loses his soul-life for My sake shall find it." These verses call us to lose our soul-life for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The soul-life spoken of here is man's original life, that is, the organic life that makes us a living creature.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This life is the life commonly shared by all men created by God and is different from the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This life is the life that we brought with us when we came out of our mother's womb.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is absolutely different from the spiritual life which we received at the time of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The spiritual life is the very life of God Himself; it is divine, supernatural, and is not possessed by man before his regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For His sake the Lord Jesus calls us to give up the soul-life and to crucify it on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have said that the soul-life includes our love, emotion, mind, will, and so forth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The soul-life that the Lord Jesus mentions here includes all these things, but in Matthew 10 it seems that the Lord Jesus is paying particular attention to the matter of love.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the previous verses the Lord Jesus mentions an enemy being of one's own household.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He mentions how the son will be set against the father, and the daughter set against the mother, and the daughter-in-law set against the mother-in-law.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When God's will is contrary to the opinion of our own household, we can do nothing except set ourselves against our most loved ones for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a cross.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is a crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to our soul-life, we love those whom we want to love.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We like to listen to them and act according to their will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When those we love rejoice in their hearts, do not our hearts rejoice with them?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But here the Lord Jesus is calling us and charging us not to disobey Him for the sake of man's love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At times, God's will may conflict with man's will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although a certain person may be our most loved one or may be the one who loves us the most, and although hurting such a one is something that we would normally be most reluctant and unhappy to do, for the sake of the Lord we should take up our cross and crucify our love.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should never forget the meaning of bearing the cross; it is not just a suffering but an advance toward the place of crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The end of bearing the cross is crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord Jesus calls us this way in order to remove from us our natural love for men.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, in verse 37 He says, "He who loves father or mother above Me is not worthy of Me; and he who loves son or daughter above Me is not worthy of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Luke 14:26-27 He says, "If anyone comes to Me and does not hate his own father and mother and wife and children and brothers and sisters, and moreover, even his own soul-life, he cannot be My disciple.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whoever does not carry his own cross and come after Me cannot be My disciple."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord used the word hate to show the disciples the kind of attitude they should hold toward the love that issues from the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Strictly speaking, when believers love their kinfolks, their relatives, or their lovers, they should not love them because they are their loved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They should not love others just because these are their lovers or their father, mother, brothers, sisters, wife, or children.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This kind of natural love comes from the soul-life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord Jesus wants to remove all of our direct love toward men.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord has no intention that we would not love men.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His intention is that we would not exercise our own love to love men, but that we would love with His love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It means that we should not love men because they are the ones we would love or because we have some special relationship with them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We cannot love someone just because he is a parent, wife, child, brother, or sister.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This kind of natural love should be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>From now on when we love these people, it should be because of a new relationship in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We should love them only because the Lord loves them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not love them because we love them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For the Lord's sake, we should love others only through His love received from His hand.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Simply put, the Lord's teaching here is that our love toward others should be under His control.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the Lord wants us to love, we should love even someone who is our enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If the Lord has not told us to love, we should not love even if someone is our closest relative.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To experience this, the soul-life must pass through death.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This bearing of the cross, obedience to Christ, and rejection of our natural affection will cause the believers' natural love to suffer and to feel pain.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This suffering and pain is the way to lose the soul-life with respect to its activities of love.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When, on the cross before God, the soul-life loses its own love, it will indeed give room for the love of God to be poured out in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Subsequently, all of our love will be out of God who is abiding in us.</S>
