We are the issue of the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, which is the &#8220;inking&#8221; of the Triune God into us. The Father&#8217;s life and nature, the Son&#8217;s element, and the Spirit&#8217;s essence are dispensed into our being to saturate us thoroughly. Then we become the issue of the dispensing of the Triune God. We are the issue of the essence, the element, and the source. We are the issue of the Triune God, and this issue is the church, the Body of Christ. The Father is in the Son, the Son is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the essence of the Body. Our Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-is in the Body.<p>We, the church as the issue of the Triune God, are the same as He is in the sense that we have His life, His nature, His element, and His essence. We are absolutely the same as He is in this respect, but not in His Godhead. We do not possess any part of the Godhead, but we do possess His life, His nature, His element, and His essence. We are divine in the sense of the divine life, the divine nature, the divine essence, and the divine element, but not in the sense of the Godhead.<p>We all need to understand the church and know the church to such an extent. This knowing and understanding of the church is what keeps us in the recovery. If we see this, we will never make any division and nothing will shake us. The church as the organic issue of the organic Triune God is altogether one. This is the oneness that no one can divide. The church is of God&#8217;s economy and is of God&#8217;s good pleasure. Furthermore, the church is constituted of God the Father&#8217;s nature and life, God the Son&#8217;s element, and God the Spirit&#8217;s essence through the sealing. The church is the issue of the Triune God to be the organic Body of Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING THE CHURCH OF GOD, THE CHURCH OF CHRIST, AND THE CHURCH OF THE SAINTS</h2><p>The organically divine church is the church of God (1 Cor. 10:32), the church of Christ (Rom. 16:16b), and the church of the saints (1 Cor. 14:33b). In this church there is God, so the church belongs to God. In this church there is Christ, so the church belongs to Christ. In this church there are many saints, so the church belongs to the saints.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING UNIVERSAL AS THE UNIQUE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>The church is universal as the unique Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23). The Body is not an organization but an organism constituted with all the regenerated believers for the expression and activities of the Head.<h2 class=head1>THE CHURCH BEING ALSO LOCAL AS THE CHURCHES IN DIFFERENT LOCALITIES FOR THE UNIVERSAL EXPRESSION OF CHRIST</h2><p>The church is also local as the churches in different localities for the universal expression of Christ (Acts 8:1; 13:1; 1 Cor. 1:2; Rev. 1:4, 11). The church is universal and also local. The local churches in different localities are not merely for a local expression, but for the universal expression of Christ. All the churches express the same person-Christ. The local churches should express Christ universally, not just locally. If the church in a locality expresses only their locality, that is terrible. That makes them a local sect, a local division. They are a local church, but they do not express a &#8220;local&#8221; Christ. Christ is not a local Christ. God, Christ, the Spirit, and the Bible are not local. Some make the Bible local, they make God local, they make Christ local, and they make the Spirit local. They make everything local. In this case they have become local divisions, local sects.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
