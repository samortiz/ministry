May grace and peace be added to you from our Father, amen.</p><p>I received good hospitality some time ago in Shanghai and was given many gifts which were really a sweet savor, an acceptable sacrifice, well-pleasing to God. My God will fill your every need according to His riches, in glory, in Christ Jesus (Phil. 4:18-19).</p><p>It has been four weeks since I returned to P'u T'ien. I have been able to combine my work with my private affairs. I met with Brothers Ke San and Tsai Sheng in P'u T'ien, Han Chiang, and Yu Hsi. We will meet together for about four weeks. It is a good opportunity; thank the Lord for His grace. I apologize for not writing a letter of greeting sooner! Please forgive me in the Lord! (Parts omitted.)</p><p>Please let me know about the condition of the work in Shanghai and Brother Nee's health. May you be blessed with peace, joy and victory!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Faithful Luk</p><h2 class="head2">Two</h2><p>Greetings to my beloved brother, Witness:</p><p>May the Lord's grace be with you, amen!</p><p>I received your letter and read it all. I heard that Brother Teng Ming was seriously sick; how is he now? I am very worried about him. May the Lord heal him!</p><p>Brother Nee is away, so your burden must be greater and heavier, but the grace of the Lord is sufficient for you. May the Lord use you much to edify many believers. I am ashamed that I am so useless. Please pray for me much.</p><p>Last night I hurriedly translated several short stories. I enclose them to meet my responsibility. Please do your best to edit them. There are places that are not fluent. I know that I cannot avoid them. I would not mind if you laughed at them, because you are beloved to me in the Lord. Please forgive me!</p><p>When can you come to P'u T'ien to lead a meeting? There are seven or eight brothers from Amoy who have all signed their names to a letter asking me to come with my family to work in Amoy. My future is unclear, and I do not know where to go. I am sure that the Lord who created me will lead me step by step.</p><p>I am not sure about my trip to Hong Kong. I can only place this matter in the Lord's hands. I believe that when it is the appropriate time for the Lord, He will lead us. Has Miss Lee returned to Shanghai? Did Brother Chiang go ahead to Amoy to work? May you have peace!</p><p>Your brother,<br />Faithful</p><h2 class="head1">A LETTER FROM AMOY, FUKIEN PROVINCE</h2><p>To our dear brother in the Lord, Witness:</p><p>How is Brother Teng Ming's illness? I hope you can keep me informed so that I will not worry.</p><p>When will the second issue of The Christian be published? How much will it cost to order one thousand copies? When can it be sent to me? I hope you will answer me so that I can wire the appropriate amount to you.</p><p>Brother Faithful Luk can come to Amoy to work tomorrow. Please pray for this time of work! I will tell you the rest later. May you have peace!</p><p>Your brother,<br />James Chen<br />February 8, 1935</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> </body></html>
