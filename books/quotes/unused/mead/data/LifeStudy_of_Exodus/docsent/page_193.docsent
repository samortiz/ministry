   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Y. Keeping, Observing, Practicing, and Doing It</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At least twenty-eight times in Psalm 119 we are encouraged to keep, observe, practice, and do the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, verse 33 says, Teach me, O Jehovah, the way of thy statutes; and I shall keep it unto the end Heb .</S>

   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Through such an enjoyment of the Word, we shall worship God, talk to Him, pray to Him, and converse with ourselves before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes we may shout or cry; at other times we may delight ourselves in the Word or give ourselves a command.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We shall enjoy the Word of God not only in the Lord s presence, but also with His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should never separate the Lord s Word from the Lord Himself.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have seen that God s intention in the book of Exodus was to bring His people into such an enjoyment of Himself and to such a condition before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God brought them to the Mount of God so that they could receive His word.</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God gave the law to His people in such an intimate way, again and again referring to Himself as Jehovah your God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, as we consider the day aspect of the law, we see that God gave the law to His people in the way of enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because it is God s word, it is God s breath.</S>
