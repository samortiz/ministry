In previous Life-studies we have covered six books written by Paul: Romans, Hebrews, Ephesians, Colossians, Galatians, and Philippians
In this sovereign arrangement, the four books of 1 Timothy, 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon are put together as a group
In these Epistles Paul shows us our hope, the hope of glory, that is, the appearing of our dear Lord Jesus Christ
When Gods dispensation is put together with these four matters we see that 1 Timothy does in fact reveal Gods economy concerning the church
Paul's purpose in writing 2 Timothy was to inoculate the church against decline, degradation, and deterioration
The truth the reality of the contents of the faith as mentioned in 1 Timothy 24 7 315 43 65 2 Timothy 215 18 25 37 8 44 Titus 11 14
Godliness a living that is the expression of God as mentioned in 1 Timothy 22 10 316 47 8 54 63 5 6 11 2 Timothy 35 12 Titus 11 212
Healthy teachings, healthy words, and healthy speech are the ministry of the truth, ministering to people the reality of the divine truths
If we put this Epistle together with 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, we shall know how to have a proper local church life
The problem among Christians throughout the centuries has always been the differing teachings versus God's revelation
How pitiful that Christians have argued over the type of water used in baptism, but have altogether neglected God's dispensation!
According to the New Testament, the one ministry is to minister Christ to God's chosen people so that the church may be formed
God's economy certainly is not a matter of head covering, foot-washing, and regulations about eating or the keeping of days
Paul opens 1 Timothy with the words Paul an apostle of Christ Jesus according to the command of God our Savior and of Christ Jesus our hope
Paul's word about 'going into Macedonia' must refer to his travels after his liberation from the first imprisonment in Rome
Probably he wrote this Epistle from Macedonia, which is made up of what is today northern Greece and southern Bulgaria
His ministry completes the revelation concerning the all-inclusive Christ and His universal Body, the church as His fullness to express Him
Now, from 1 Timothy through Philemon, a detailed revelation concerning the practice of the church is presented
It refers to words, speeches, and conversations concerning such things as rumors, reports, stories , and fictions
The myths and unending genealogies give occasion for questionings and vain talking rather than God's dispensation
The myths and the unending genealogies give rise to vain talking and cause people to misaim from the goal of the charge of love
To carry out the apostle's charge, love, which is out of a pure heart, a good conscience, and unfeigned faith, is needed
Unfeigned faith, connected with faith in verse 4, is faith without pretense or hypocrisy, that purifies the heart and works through love
In order to deal with the differing teachings when the trend of the church is toward decline, all these attributes are required
Law teachers, teaching people what to do and what not to do, are different from the minister of Christ , who ministers His riches to others
In contrast, the differing teachings of the dissenting ones in verse 3 sow the seeds of death and poison into others
The dispensation of God is a matter in faith, that is, in the sphere and element of faith, in God through Christ
As a result, we have the divine life and the divine nature to become God's sons, members of Christ, and parts of the new man
He was a blasphemer of God, a persecutor of man, and an insulting, destructive person with respect to the church
Saul of Tarsus persecuted the church in an insulting, destructive way , just as the insulting Jews persecuted the Lord Jesus
Because Paul was a blasphemer of God and a persecutor of man, God's mercy reached him first rather than the Lord's grace
The Lords grace following Gods mercy visited Saul of Tarsus and not only abounded but superabounded in him with faith and love in Christ
The uncreated life of God is the ultimate gift and topmost blessing given by God to those who believe on Christ
Saul of Tarsus as the foremost among sinners became a pattern to sinners, who can be visited by God's mercy and saved by the Lord's grace
In verse 17 Paul says Now to the King of the ages incorruptible invisible the only God be honor and glory unto the ages of the ages Amen!
In this message we shall consider 1:18-20, verses which indicate that faith and a good conscience are needed for the keeping of the faith
With this principle as our basis, we need to consider Paul's use of the word charge in verse 18 in the context of the chapter as a whole
On the positive side, the main point of these verses is God's dispensation; on the negative side, it is the differing teachings
The charge given by the apostle to his spiritual son concerns the dispensation of God positively and the differing teachings negatively
In verse 18 Paul says that he committed the charge to Timothy 'according to the prophecies previously made' concerning him
Although Philemon is grouped with 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, it was actually written earlier, during Paul's first imprisonment
Paul was imprisoned the first time because of the Jews, not because of persecution carried out by the Roman Empire
We know from Acts that Paul appealed to Caesar and this caused him to be sent to Rome, where he was imprisoned
In chapter four he indicates to his dear child Timothy that he was ready to depart, to be martyred, to be poured out as a drink offering
In Acts 2:42 we see that at the beginning of the church life, the believers continued in the teachings of the apostles
By coming to the Word, we are infused with God, and spontaneously faith operates within us to bring us into an organic union with God
Especially in Colossians we see that certain isms-Judaism, Gnosticism, asceticism- had crept into the church life
Paul charged his faithful co-worker to fight the good fight against the differing teachings and fight for God's dispensation
In verse 19 Paul continues, 'Holding faith and a good conscience, which some thrusting away have become shipwrecked regarding the faith'
The word faith in the expression 'holding faith' refers to our believing act; hence, it denotes subjective faith
As we have indicated, this faith rises up in us when we come to the Word and are infused with God through the Word and by the Spirit
A good conscience accompanying faith is needed for warring the good warfare against the dissenting teachings in a troubled local church
It is difficult to say whether the relative pronoun 'which' in verse 19 refers just to conscience or to both faith and conscience
Faith and a good conscience can be compared to a married couple: faith is like a husband, and conscience is like a wife
Being more careful or 'spiritual' or 'heavenly' than Paul, we may not be willing to mention names under any circumstances
In 2 Timothy 4:14 Paul says, 'Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to me; the Lord will repay him according to his works'
Paul tells Timothy that he has delivered Hymenaeus and Alexander to Satan 'that they may be disciplined not to blaspheme'
How utterly different this is from saying that he committed them to the Lord's gracious hand that they may receive His mercy
In 21 he goes on to say I exhort therefore first of all that petitions prayers intercessions thanksgivings be made on behalf of all men
Romans was written to all the believers in Rome, and Hebrews was written not to individuals, but to believing Hebrews addressed corporately
Ephesians, Philippians, Galatians, Colossians, 1 and 2 Corinthians, and 1 and 2 Thessalonians were all written to churches
After you pray about the matter, if the Lord leads you to visit that one, simply follow the Lord and visit him
Visiting a backsliding saint is a presumptuous sin if it is done in ourselves apart from prayer and the Lord's leading
If we touch Paul's spirit in 2:1-7, we shall sense his burden that those who take the lead in the church life must have a prayer life
In these verses Paul seems to be telling Timothy I have shown you a clear picture of Gods economy and how it is versus different teachings
Often when we hear good news about certain churches, elders, or saints, we praise them instead of giving thanks to God for them
In mentioning petitions, prayers, intercessions, and thanksgivings, Paul's spirit was very burdened concerning the importance of prayer
Gravity is a qualification of human character which is worthy of utmost respect; it implies dignity and inspires and invites honor
Our Christian life should express God toward man with an honorable character that invites man's utmost respect
The second Epistle stresses that the word of the truth should be rightly unfolded , and that the deviated ones should return to the truth
In 1 Timothy 2:5 Paul continues, 'For there is one God and one Mediator of God and men, the Man, Christ Jesus'
He is qualified to be the Mediator between God and man, not only in His divine and human Person, but also in His redemptive work
Faith here refers to the faith in Christ , and truth refers to the reality of all the things revealed in the New Testament
Although God has such a desire, a heart, to save people, He can fulfill His desire only through the principle of incarnation
Concerning the brothers Paul says in verse 8 I will therefore that men pray in every place lifting up holy hands without wrath and reasoning
If you pray in every place, your living will be transformed, and the church in your locality will be transformed also
The only way for the church in your locality to be satisfying to you is for you to pray at every time and in every place
It may also indicate that Paul's word about praying in every place applies to the sisters as well as to the brothers
The sisters in a local assembly should clothe themselves with these two virtues-shamefastness and self-restraint-as their demeanor
Godly reverence is reverence toward God; it is the revering and honoring of God as those who worship Him should
To teach here means to teach with authority, to define and decide the meaning of doctrines concerning divine truth
In verse 14 Paul goes on, 'And Adam was not deceived, but the woman being quite deceived was in transgression'
In verse 15 Paul concludes, 'But she shall be saved through childbearing, if they remain in faith and love and holiness with sobriety'
The reason Paul changes from a singular to a plural pronoun was that in referring to Eve he was including all women
Not all women are included in the pronoun 'she,' but none can deny that they are included in the pronoun 'they'
As we have pointed out the Greek word rendered modesty in 29 is literally shamefastness that is bound and made fast by an honorable shame
When a sister speaks in a church meeting, she should do so with modesty, with a certain amount of shamefacedness
If the women working in an office have the virtue of modesty, they will be free from any improper involvement with the men who work there
A sister needs to have a head covering, not only physically, but also psychologically, ethically, morally, and spiritually
In such fellowship it is necessary for the sisters to wear a moral, ethical, and spiritual covering known as modesty
As a sister exercises herself to be quiet and not to overstep her position, she needs a keen discernment within
The two titles refer to the same person: elder, denoting a person of maturity; and overseer, denoting the function of an elder
For the Lord's recovery and for the building up of the local churches, there is the need of the proper leading ones
On the one hand, we condemn ambition; on the other hand, we appreciate the fact that many brothers have the aspiration for oversight
It keeps an elder in a simple and pure married life, free from the tangle of a complicated and confused marriage
On the one hand, he should not talk too long; on the other hand, if his conversation is too brief, he may offend others
Because the requirements of an elder are so many and so difficult, it is surely vain for anyone to be ambitious for eldership
If a brother does not have a genuine aspiration with a pure motive for the Lord's recovery, he should not desire to be an elder
Of being disappointed by their situation, they should be glad that their father has consecrated his life and time to the Lord's recovery
They are not elected, and they are very different from those who may be called elders in different denominations
The principle of hospitality is giving without receiving; it is suffering without requiring anything in return
In verse 3 Paul lists other qualifications: 'Not an excessive drinker, not a striker, but forbearing, not contentious, not fond of money'
When Paul says that an elder should not be an excessive drinker, he, of course, has in mind not an excessive drinker of wine
It is clear that anyone who does not know how to manage his own household cannot take care of the church of God
Pride here is likened to smoke that beclouds the mind, making it blind, besotted with the self-conceit of pride
According to the context, an elder must be right in intention, in motive, in character, in attitude, in words, and in deeds
An elder should be alert not to be proud on the one hand and not to be reproachable on the other that he may avoid the Devils entanglement
In verse 8 Paul says, 'Deacons must similarly be grave, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not seeking gain by base means'
A deacon in a local church rendering service to all the saints may easily be double-tongued in contacting them
A deacon in a local church should hold this mystery with full understanding in a pure conscience for the Lord's testimony
In order to have a pure conscience, the deacons need to behave according to their knowledge of the mystery of the faith
The expression 'a good standing' refers to a firm and steadfast standing as a believer and a saint before God and man
A sister who is a deaconess, a serving one in a local church among many other sisters, should flee slander, the evil act of the Devil
Now in verse 15 Paul tells us that the church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth
In order to reach this standard, the church must have all the characteristics described in the first two and a half chapters of 1 Timothy
Not only was the Lord Jesus the manifestation of God in the past; the church today should also be the manifestation of God
We in the Lord's recovery can testify of the great difference between the recovery and today's organized Christianity
All the saints should be encouraged that the situation in the Lord's recovery is heading toward God's standard
The church is different; it is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and the manifestation of God in the flesh
There should be no decline; rather, we should maintain God's standard until the glorious appearing of our Head, the Savior, Jesus Christ
A local church should be such a building that holds, bears, and testifies the truth, the reality, of Christ and the church
The church as the house of the living God is both the pillar which bears the truth and the base which upholds the pillar
The church is not only the house of the living God and the pillar and base of the truth, but also the mystery of godliness
If the demons trembled at the presence of the Lord Jesus, will they not also tremble at the manifestation of the living God in the church?
No doubt when the church is living out God and manifesting Him, the demons and the evil angels will be terrified
It may come as a surprise that in verse 16 Paul suddenly uses the relative pronoun 'who,' when he says, 'Who was manifested in the flesh'
The transition from 'the mystery ' to 'Who' implies that Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh is the mystery of godliness
The portion of verse 16 from 'Who was manifested' to 'taken up in glory' may have been a church song in the early days
The fact that he uses the relative pronoun 'Who' implies that the mystery of godliness is a person and not merely a matter
Christ as the embodiment of God in the flesh has been believed on, received as Savior and life, by people in the world
According to the sequence of historical events, Christ's ascension preceded His being preached among the nations
It implies that not only Christ Himself as the Head, but also the church as the Body, is the manifestation of God in the flesh
Many in today's Pentecostal movement follow the Old Testament way of prophesying and say, 'Thus saith the Lord'
Now after the death and resurrection of Christ, it is possible for Him to be one spirit with those who believe in Christ
We have seen that the principle of incarnation means that divinity is brought into humanity and works with humanity
As we read 1 Timothy, we must exercise our spirit to listen to the Spirit speaking from within the spirit of the Apostle Paul
He believed that the church was the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth, and even the mystery of godliness
On the other hand deep within his spirit he knew that certain socalled believers would depart from the faith from Gods New Testament economy
These are the fallen angels who followed Satan in his rebellion and became his subordinates, who work for his kingdom of darkness
In verse 2 Paul continues, 'In the hypocrisy of men who speak lies, seared in their own conscience as with a branding iron'
These hypocrites work together with evil spirits and demons to bring in deceitful teachings and demonic doctrines
In the case of these lying Christians, it seems as if their conscience has been seared and has lost its function
Our conscience testifies that we in the Lord's recovery surely believe the truth revealed in the Bible, perhaps more than other Christians
We must see the sharp contrast between the situation at the end of chapter three and that described at the beginning of chapter four
We need to be discerning, sober-minded, and clear concerning the difference between today's Christianity and the Lord's recovery
We should thank the Lord for our food not only before we eat it, but also while we are partaking of it and when we have finished our meal
The foods God has created should be partaken of with thanksgiving 'by those who believe and have fully known the truth'
To have fully known the truth is to realize God's purpose in His economy and to grow unto maturity in the spiritual life
According to Paul's word, we should not reject anything created by Him, but receive all things with thanksgiving
All the food we eat can be sanctified, separated unto God for His purpose, through the word of God and intercession
Such prayer separates our food from being common and sanctifies it unto God for His purpose, that is, to nourish us that we may live for Him
Many versions do not have the boldness to use the word intercession, even though this is the meaning of the Greek word
A minister of Christ is one who serves others with Christ, ministering Christ as Savior, life, life supply, and every positive thing
A minister of Christ does not mainly denote a minister who belongs to Christ, but a person who ministers Christ to others
In today's Christianity there are a great many ministers who belong to Christ, but very few of them minister Christ to others
To be a minister of Christ does not primarily mean to preach Christ, teach Christ, or tell others about Christ
It is significant that here Paul does not say 'being taught,' but 'being nourished' with the words of the faith
While you are teaching them, you need to exercise your spirit to minister spiritual food that they may be nourished
If we turn from the ministry and seek to produce something different, we may give place to differing teachings
If the leading ones in a local church lay before the saints the riches contained in the Lifestudies the saints will be abundantly nourished
It is a fact of history in the Lord's recovery that any church which follows the ministry is strong and blessed
To minister Christ to others requires that we ourselves first be nourished with the words of life concerning Christ
If you want to see the focal point of God's economy, study the book of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians
In verse 7 Paul goes on to say, 'But the profane and old-womanish tales refuse, and exercise yourself unto godliness'
By our spirit with the indwelling Spirit we must exercise ourselves unto this goal, unto the expression of God
All things' refer not only to one part of our being, but to all parts- physical, psychological, and spiritual-both temporal and eternal
The promise of the present life which is in this age is like that in Matthew 6:33; John 16:33; Philippians 4:6-7; and 1 Peter 5:8-10
The promise of the coming life which is in the next age and in eternity is like that in 2 Peter 11011 2 Timothy 212 Revelation 27 17 2167
We must be a living testimony of those who refuse the old-womanish tales and who continually exercise themselves unto godliness
From within we should be nourished with Christ, and then we should have a living which is the expression of God
It is not a miraculous gift, such as speaking in tongues or healing , but the gift of grace, such as teaching and exhorting
Laying on of hands has two functions: one for identification, as in Leviticus 1:4, and the other for impartation, as here
Through the laying on of the hands of the elders and the Apostle Paul , the gift of grace was imparted to Timothy
The laying on of the hands of the elders signifies that the Body of Christ participated with God in imparting the gift of grace to Timothy
On the one hand, in the church life we must have the divine standard; on the other hand, we must care for matters on the human level
The requirement that priests and nuns not be married not only is contrary to humanity, but has its source in demons
The reason demons and fallen angels forbid marriage and command people to abstain from foods is that their intention is to destroy mankind
In relation to brothers who are a generation older than they, the younger brothers should deal with them as fathers
Paul also tells Timothy to entreat 'younger men as brothers; elderly women as mothers; younger women as sisters'
If a young brother assumes some kind of elevated position in relation to an elderly man, the relationship between them will be damaged
If he would contact him as a son speaking to a father, their fellowship will be intimate, loving, touching, and even inspiring
The brothers will talk to brothers in a way appropriate to brothers, but they will speak to sisters in a way appropriate to sisters
For this reason, a brother and sister who are close to the same age should not talk privately in a closed room
He spoke to Nicodemus in a house alone at night, but He talked to the Samaritan woman out in the open during the day
Many have fallen into a snare because they were careless and failed to exercise purity in their contact with others
As we have indicated, our contact with all the saints, brothers and sisters, elderly and young, must be pure in every way
Realizing the need for all the saints to do their duty, Paul tells Timothy not to allow a widow to be enrolled who is under sixty years old
Paul's word in verse 14 about younger widows marrying is somewhat of a contrast to what he says in 1 Corinthians 7:8
For centuries there has been a debate among Christians over the kind of administration there should be in the church
Verses 17 and 18 say Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor especially those who labor in word and teaching
All the elders should be able to take the lead in a local church, but some, not all, have a special capacity in teaching
The word in verse 17 denotes the general speaking of doctrines, and teaching denotes instructions concerning particular things
In verse 19 Paul goes on to say, 'Against an elder do not receive an accusation, except on the word of two or three witnesses'
According to the Greek here, the accusation made against an elder should not merely be verbal; rather, it should be put in writing
According to those who are in favor of a hierarchical system in which the bishops are over the elders, Timothy is regarded as a bishop
We would expect such an accusation to come to the apostles because they were the ones who had appointed the elders
If the elders lead others astray or if they are wrong in some way, accusation against them can be made by the saints to the apostles
Among all the saints in a local church, certain brothers, by comparison, are more qualified and mature than others
Paul's use of the term 'chosen angels' indicates that here he is dealing with administration, government, authority
Paul's charge to Timothy in verse 21 was to 'guard these things without prejudice, doing nothing by way of partiality'
Prejudice refers to prejudgment, condemnation, before hearing the case, and partiality refers to inclination, favor, or bias
On the other hand, Timothy was not to be partial, not to show perverted favor, to the elder against whom the accusation was made
No credit should be given privately to the accusers, and there should not be any perverted favor toward the one accused
According to the context of the previous verses, here the laying on of hands refers primarily to laying hands on the elders
In verse 23 Paul goes on to say, 'No longer drink water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent weaknesses'
In verses 24 and 25 Paul says, 'The sins of some men are manifest beforehand, going before to judgment, and some also they follow after
What is mentioned here concerning the judging of sins is a principle applicable both to man's judgment and God's
The words 'some also they follow after' refer to the sins of others now being hidden, but later manifest, going to judgment later
Do not show prejudice in receiving an accusation, and do not show partiality in defending anyone against accusation
We do not practice dictatorship, but we do recognize the divine authority, the divine life, and the divine light
As the snow melts and exposes the rocks hidden beneath it, so either a person's sins or his good deeds will eventually be brought to light
In the Lord's recovery today, there are approximately four hundred churches in addition to those in mainland China
About three hundred seventy of these churches have been established directly by the ministry in the past thirty-one years
The use of these words at the beginning of these verses indicates that they are a continuation of the foregoing verses
These words not only enable us to see the continuation in thought; they also afford a way for light to come in
In the theology departments of some secular colleges and universities, religion and theology are regarded merely as part of man's culture
Although Scofield adopted nearly all the teachings of the Brethren, he rejected the Brethren way to practice the church life
Anyone who calls himself a theologian but who is not familiar with the writings of Darby is not a theologian of the highest caliber
According to history, the Bible was opened more to the Brethren teachers than to anyone who had gone before them
When he tried to tell her that he had been regenerated she said that simply by looking at his face she knew that he had not been regenerated
The next morning when this lady evangelist saw him, she looked at his face and said, 'Praise the Lord, you have been regenerated'!
Another Pentecostal minister claimed that in a certain meeting a person in the congregation miraculously spoke in Chinese
In 5:23 Paul tells Timothy, 'No longer drink water, but use a little wine for the sake of your stomach and your frequent weaknesses'
They merely teach the Word according to the black and white letters, perhaps also giving out information about geography or history
To teach differently is to teach things that differ from the apostles' teaching centered on Christ and the church
When the Lord's words of life are taught, particularly in certain aspects, they become the teaching according to godliness
The living words of the Lord always bring forth godliness-a life that lives Christ and expresses God in Christ
Teachings differing from the healthy words of the Lord always issue from people's pride with self-conceit which blinds them
These wranglings are carried on by men corrupted and depraved in mind and deprived, bereft, destitute, of the truth
The Greek word for 'deprived' implies that these are ones who once possessed the truth, but now it has been put away from them
Concerning the expression 'contentment,' Vincent says, 'An inward self-sufficiency, as opposed to the lack or the desire of outward things
Paul's mention of gain in verses 5 and 6 brings him to the matter of dealing with money lovers in verses 7 through 10
We can testify that by the Lords mercy and through the help of great Bible teachers who have gone before us the Lord has shown us much light
In 6:7 Paul goes on to say, 'For we have brought nothing into the world; it is evident that neither can we carry anything out'
A man of God is one who partakes of God's life and nature and thus becomes one with Him in His life and nature and thereby expresses Him
Timothy 6:11 says, 'But you, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, meekness'
On the one hand, Paul charges Timothy to flee certain things and, on the other hand, to pursue certain other things
As we shall see, in verse 12 Paul does not charge him to fight for his theology or to lay hold on the doctrinal knowledge he has accumulated
Righteousness is a matter of being right with people before God according to God's righteous and strict requirements
We should pursue endurance the ability to bear sufferings and persecutions and also meekness which is a proper attitude in facing opposition
We were born of the human natural life, but we were reborn of the divine eternal life when we were called by God in Christ
The words 'confessed the good confession before many witnesses' may refer to Timothy's confession of the faith at his baptism
In contrast, the beasts in Revelation 13 and the lake of fire in Revelation 20 cannot compare with these essential aspects
Even in the matter of buying a pair of shoes, we should live according to the eternal life to which we have been called
Having been called to eternal life, we now should lay hold on this life, live this life, and have our whole being according to this life
Paul's concept in verse 13 is that God gives life and that when Christ was on earth, He lived the eternal life
In verse 14 Paul continues, 'That you keep the commandment spotless, without reproach, until the appearing of our Lord Jesus Christ'
Although the Father dwells in unapproachable light, we not only can approach Him in Christ, but we also can have fellowship with Him
Because Paul deals with God's dispensation concerning the church, he cannot avoid speaking about the problems of rich people
In their fund-raising activities, many Christian leaders give glory to those rich people who donate large sums of money
Doing good here refers to the ready distribution of material things to the needy and the willing communication with such needs
Those who are rich in this age should use their riches in such a way that they lay away as a treasure a good foundation for the future
By 'what is falsely called knowledge' Paul means the teachings of the false teachers, teachings which were called knowledge
It was a discouraging and disappointing scene, especially to his young fellow-worker and spiritual child, Timothy
With and upon this unchanging life the firm foundation of God has been laid and stands unshaken through all the tide of degradation
By such a life those who seek the Lord out of a pure heart are able to stand the trial of the church's decline
Paul was an apostle according to the life which God had promised, which Paul had received, and which dwelt within him
Because Paul was indwelt by this life, not even the whole Roman Empire was able to prevail over him in its dealings with him
Nowhere else but in the opening of this Epistle does Paul say that he was an apostle according to the promise of life
The reason Christians emphasize the will of God but not the promise of life is that they themselves do not see this matter of life
Whatever we do and whatever we are in the Lord's recovery today must be according to eternal life and by this life
In a time of degradation, a pure conscience, a conscience purified from any mixture, is needed if we are to serve God
The more we testify in an honest way that we have a pure conscience the stronger will be our realization that our conscience is in fact pure
Do not believe the enemy when he says that you are weak, or when he accuses you of being impure and not having a good conscience
Faith refers to the organic union with the Triune God in which we receive God's infusion through His Word and in His Spirit
The more we touch the Word by exercising our spirit, the more we shall contact the Lord and be infused with Him
It may refer to a particular spiritual function or ability something burning within Timothy that enabled him to function in a particular way
All the saints need to be encouraged with the fact that they have eternal life, a pure conscience, and unfeigned faith
In verse 7 Paul continues, 'For God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of a sober mind'
In our physical body we usually do not have any feeling with respect to our internal organs unless there is something wrong with them
We have the reason Paul charged Timothy in the two preceding verses to fan into flame the gift of God which was in him
Not to be ashamed of the testimony of our Lord is to stand against its downward current in the declining churches
In order to strengthen Timothy, the apostle identifies their ministry with this eternal grace, the sure foundation
Because this grace was manifested through the appearing of Christ, Old Testament saints like Abraham and David did not experience it
The last part of verse 10 says of Christ, 'Who nullified death, and brought life and incorruption to light through the gospel'
Christ nullified death, making it of none effect, through His Devil-destroying death and death-swallowing resurrection
The eternal life of God is given to all believers in Christ and is the main element of the divine grace given to us
Such a cause should also be an encouragement and strengthening to Timothy in facing the deterioration of the declining churches
In verse 13 Paul continues, 'Hold a pattern of healthy words which you heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus'
Having such a marvelous inoculation, we should be able to declare that in the Lord's recovery there is no decline
The grace to reach God's goal was given to us in Christ Jesus 'before times eternal,' that is, before the world began
The grace which came through Jesus Christ is nothing less than the Triune God dispensed into us for our enjoyment
Today, in the church life grace is nullifying death and bringing life and incorruption to light through the gospel
In verse 13 Paul charges Timothy, 'Hold a pattern of healthy words which you heard from me, in faith and love which are in Christ Jesus'
The more we consider all the matters covered in verses 1 through 14, the more we realize what riches these verses contain
In 1:15 Paul says, 'This you know, that all who are in Asia turned away from me, of whom are Phygelus and Hermogenes'
In spite of such desertion, the apostle grew stronger in the grace that was in Christ, who was the same and would never change
Paul specifically names Phygelus and Hermogenes, two who must have taken the lead to desert the apostle because of his imprisonment
Probably they were not ordinary believers; they must have been either co-workers or leading ones among the saints
It is not the person himself who is important; it is the ministry carried on by a person which is of extreme importance
When at our invitation he came the second time he did so with the intention of correcting us with respect to the practice of the church life
According to his concept, whenever two or three believers meet in the name of the Lord Jesus, there is the reality of the church
The Bible speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ and refers to the fullness of Christ, but there is no mention of a 'full Christ'
They claimed that they had no problem with the ground of the church, and they continued among us for seven years
At one time a group of Christians who emphasize speaking in tongues wanted to join with us for the practice of the church life
After a certain time, he was distracted from the church life and came to believe that the church ground is too narrow
He claimed that Brother Nee had seen the line of Jerusalem and the line of Antioch, but that he had come to see the line of Ephesus
According to him, the way to build a local church is with the children both from families in the church and of families in the neighborhood
In recent years certain ambitious ones looked upon the Lord's recovery as an opportunity for them to gain power
My point in relating these facts of history is to say that we should not think that everyone who comes into the Lord's recovery will remain
The recovery also proves that, although some turn away like Phygelus and Hermogenes, others like Onesiphorus stand firm
After we went to Taipei from mainland China, we built a meeting hall that could accommodate about five hundred people
The first Lord's Day after the building was completed, the new hall was filled, mainly with Christians who had fled the mainland
Some of these churches will marry you; others will assist you with your medical problems; and still others will help you find employment
As the church here, we care only to preach the pure gospel, to teach the Bible, and to help people receive Christ, love Him, and grow in Him
Based upon what he has just written to Timothy, Paul now goes on to encourage him to be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus
Paul realized that Timothy had received a good deposit, that he had been taught and nourished with the riches of grace
He charged Timothy to commit these things to others who would be faithful and competent to carry on the same ministry
In 2:1 and 2 Paul is burdened to charge Timothy, one who had received such a good deposit, to pass on the riches of grace to others
We should not only be teachers committing the deposit to others, but we should also be soldiers fighting for God's interests
Verse 4 says, 'No one serving as a soldier entangles himself with the affairs of life, that he may please the one who enlisted him'
The matters of our material, physical life should not entangle us as we are endeavoring to minister Christ to others
On the one hand, the priestly service is a ministry to God; on the other hand, it is a warfare against God's enemies
As the priests were bearing the ark of testimony, they had to be prepared to fight against those who might attack this testimony
Just as a soldier must win the victory and an athlete must receive the crown, so a husbandman must partake of the fruits, the food
The word 'raised' in verse 8 indicates Christ's victory over death by His divine life with its resurrection power
The expression 'seed of David' indicates Christ's dignified human nature exalted and glorified along with His divine nature
Based on this, Paul says that if we die with Him, we shall live and that if we suffer with Him, we shall reign with Him
In verse 15 Paul says, 'Be diligent to present yourself approved to God, an unashamed workman, cutting straight the word of the truth'
Just as a carpenter has the skill to cut wood in a straight way, so the Lord's workman needs the skill to cut straight the word of truth
Concerning these things, many have not cut the word of truth straightly, but cut it in a way that is curved and biased
We should be not only teachers, soldiers, contenders, and farmers, but also workmen, carpenters, cutting straight the word of the truth
The truth here does not merely denote biblical doctrine; it refers to the contents and the reality of God's New Testament economy
Arranging the Word into dispensations is not what Paul means in 2:15 about cutting straight the word of the truth
If we consider these books carefully, we shall see that truth here denotes the reality of the contents of the New Testament economy of God
To cut straight the word of the truth is to unfold without bias or distortion the reality of God's economy revealed in the New Testament
Concerning Christ in His incarnation, John 1:14 says, 'The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us full of grace and truth'
As a contrast to verse 15, Paul goes on to say in verse 16, 'But avoid profane, vain babblings, for they will advance to more ungodliness'
The word profane denotes that which touches worldliness and is touched by it; it refers to what is contrary to being holy
In verse 18 Paul also says that by having misaimed concerning the truth Hymenaeus and Philetus overthrew the faith of some
Some among us can testify of having had this organic union temporarily cut off by hearing the words of those who taught differently
No matter what kind of heresies may come in or how extensively the gangrene may spread, this firm foundation stands
Had the Lord's recovery been founded on something other than the divine life, the eternal life, it would have collapsed long ago
Because it is built on the indestructible and unconquerable eternal life, the firm foundation of the truth stands
In this great house there are not only gold and silver vessels but also wooden and earthen ones and some unto honor and others unto dishonor
Just as many unclean birds lodge in the big tree, so in the great house there are vessels unto dishonor, wooden and earthen vessels
The word 'these' in verse 21 denotes the vessels unto dishonor, including those mentioned in verses 16 through 18
Unto honor is a matter of nature, sanctified is a matter of position, useful is a matter of practice, and prepared is a matter of training
Verse 22 continues But flee youthful lusts and pursue righteousness faith love peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart
Timothy should beware not only of outward corruption among the churches, but also of inward lusts within himself
The word ignorant denotes that which is uninstructed undisciplined untrained that is not subject to God but following ones own mind and will
In verse 24 Paul goes on, 'And a slave of the Lord must not contend, but be gentle toward all; apt to teach, bearing with wrong'
Paul's use of the word repentance indicates that with the opposers of the truth it is the heart and conscience which are in question
The heart should be turned to Him, directed solely to Him, and the conscience must be pure and void of offense before Him
It is possible that those who repent 'may return to soberness out of the snare of the Devil, having been caught by him, unto His will'
The enemy of God occupies their reprobate mind with error and shuts God out, just as he did with the Pharisees
The one who raised the question about the church in Los Angeles admitted that we should not join any of those so-called churches
It is right for them to say that they are the Jones family, even though many of the members of the family have gone away and live elsewhere
In 2:1-15 Paul speaks of the inoculator, indicating that he must be a teacher, soldier, contender, husbandman, and workman
In the second half of chapter two he tells us of the spread of the decline, a spreading likened to that of gangrene
If we consider the outline of 2 Timothy, we shall see that it is not merely a pastoral book, a book for so-called pastors
At least God would have a remnant of those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart and pursue righteousness, faith, love, and peace
It began from the end of the so-called apostolic age, in the latter part of the first century, and will last until Christ's second appearing
The long duration of this period was not revealed to the apostles ; they expected the Lord to return in their generation
Christ's coming began a new period, regarded as the last days, which will continue until Christ's second coming
In Mark 1332 the Lord Jesus said But of that day or that hour knoweth no one not even the angels in heaven neither the Son but the Father
Later, after the Lord's resurrection, the disciples asked Him, 'Dost thou at this time restore the kingdom to Israel'?
To this the Lord replied, 'It is not for you to know times or seasons, which the Father hath set within his own authority'
We simply do not know the duration of time the Father has set in His administration between the Lord's ascension and His second coming
Not only those who indulge in worldly entertainments are selfish; even those who attend the chapels and cathedrals may be selfish
Of whatever one is a lover, that is what his whole heart, even his entire being, is set on, occupied, and possessed by
To maintain the victorious standard of the church, we must be lovers of God and lovers of the good which pertains to God's economy
In verse 2 Paul speaks of those who are boasters, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, and unholy
The Greek word for arrogant also means haughty, and the word rendered revilers is literally blasphemers, as in 1 Timothy 1:13
However, it does not refer to blasphemers of God, but to revilers or railers, those who speak evilly and injuriously of men
To be implacable is to be irreconcilable, to be a traitor is to be a betrayer, and to be reckless is to be headstrong
By the Lord's mercy and grace, we in His recovery must reject the situation portrayed here and be the very opposite of it
Verses 6 and 7 speak of those who are 'always learning and never able to come to the full knowledge of the truth'
They hear sermon after sermon and study the Bible, but they do not know the reality of the contents of God's New Testament economy
According to Jewish tradition, Jannes and Jambres were the Egyptian magicians who opposed Moses, as mentioned in Exodus 7:11 and 22
In verse 10 Paul reminds Timothy, 'But you have closely followed my teaching, conduct, purpose, faith, longsuffering, love, endurance'
Conduct refers to manner of life, and the Greek word for purpose is used in Paul's Epistles in relation to the purpose of God
In John 16:2 the Lord Jesus said that the time is coming when those who kill the disciples will think they are serving God
Out of their zeal for God, they will kill the followers of the Lord, simply because these do not follow the traditional way
In verse 13 Paul concludes, 'But evil men and impostors will grow worse and worse, deceiving and being deceived'
We thank the Lord that, in His mercy, He has brought us into the recovery where we can hear honest and healthy words
Timothy 3:14 says, 'But you, continue in the things which you have learned and have been assured of, knowing from whom you have learned'
Verse 16 says, 'All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, for instruction in righteousness'
The Greek words rendered All Scripture is Godbreathed and profitable may also be translated Every Scripture Godbreathed is also profitable
The Spirit is therefore the very essence, the substance, of the Scripture, just as phosphorus is the essential substance in matches
According to verse 16, all Scripture is profitable for teaching, for reproof, for correction, and for instruction in righteousness
Correction denotes setting right what is wrong, turning someone to the right way, or restoring a person to an upright state
Complete here means complete and perfect in qualifications, and equipped denotes being fitted out, furnished, made ready
We need to know the Bible not merely according to letters in black and white but also according to the divine revelation and heavenly wisdom
For a proper understanding of this book, and for the Bible as a whole, we need a spirit of wisdom and revelation
We thank the Lord that for more than fifty years we have been receiving such a spirit of wisdom and revelation
We honor, respect, and treasure the holy Word under the shining of the heavenly light which comes by a spirit of wisdom and revelation
Those who regard the Bible as a book of teaching, reproof, correction, and instruction often ignore the life essence of the Word
Our person is composed not mainly of the outward part, the body, but of the inward parts, the spirit and the soul
The Bible has not only a 'body' of letters in black and white; it also has a spirit, because it is God-breathed
If we do not breathe the divine breath by exercising our spirit, we shall not receive life from our study of the Bible
Often during a wedding ceremony a minister will instruct the bride and groom according to Paul's word in Ephesians 5
Although they may promise to fulfill these requirements, they will not be able to do so unless they receive the divine breath in the Word
We thank the Lord for showing us that in reading the Word we need to exercise our eyes, our mind, and our spirit
We not only understand the meaning of a certain portion of Scripture; we also inhale the divine breath to receive the life supply
Many may know the Bible in black and white letters, but, by the Lord's mercy and grace, we know the Bible in life, light, and spirit
There is another person-Christ-and there is a way for you to get out of Adam and into Christ that you may be justified by God
Apart from the Lord's enlightening, we may read 2 Timothy a dozen times without seeing anything related to the inoculation
They did not realize that the title of God-the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob-implied resurrection
If we do not have such a spirit but read only the black and white letters of the Bible, we shall not experience life, light, or spirit
The majority of believers use the Word in the way of letters, but we use it in the way of life, light, and spirit
Christ's appearing will be for judgment, to reward each one of us , and His kingdom will be for His reigning with His overcomers
It seems that Paul is saying Timothy you must realize that your life and work today have much to do with the Lords appearing and His kingdom
As genuine Christians we are saved for eternity but how are we living our Christian life and how well are we fulfilling our Christian duty
Because this is a solemn matter, Paul charged Timothy before God and Christ Jesus and by the Lord's appearing and kingdom
In caring for a local church, especially in a time of the church's decline, the preaching of the Word is vital
At that time many will not tolerate healthy teaching, teaching which is healthy in life and which ministers the supply of life
When we teach that Christ is the God-man, the One who is the embodiment of God as His expression, some accuse us of blasphemy or heresy
Our Lord Jesus Christ, the God-man, one Person with two natures, is worthy to receive our worship and praise forever
Because many Christians today will not tolerate healthy teaching, they heap up teachers to tickle their itching ears
We have pointed out again and again that in 1 and 2 Timothy truth refers to the reality of the contents of God's New Testament economy
Of listening to proper teachings concerning Christ and the church, many Christians have turned aside to other things
In verse 5 Paul says to Timothy But you be sober in all things suffer evil do the work of an evangelist fully accomplish your ministry
The Apostle Paul became such a drink offering by so enjoying Christ that he could be poured out by the actual shedding of his blood
He visited Crete ; Nicopolis , where he wrote the Epistle to Titus; Troas; and Miletus , where he probably wrote the Epistle to the Hebrews
The crown is a symbol of glory given as a prize, in addition to the Lord's salvation, to the triumphant runner of the race
Such a reward will be awarded the believers not according to the grace of the Lord, but according to His righteousness
Paul was assured that such a prize was reserved, laid up, for him and would be awarded to him at the day of the Lord's second appearing
We all need to receive this charge before God and before the Lord Jesus, the One who will judge the living and the dead
We must declare the fact that when the Lord comes back, He will be the Judge of all, both believers and unbelievers
Loving the present age, the world now before our eyes, is in contrast to loving the Lord's appearing, mentioned in verse 8
Some believe that Demas came from Thessalonica and that this was the reason he went to Thessalonica after forsaking Paul
Whether or not he was a native of that city, it is certain that he went there because he loved the world and forsook the apostle
Verse 10 is difficult to understand because the predicate 'has gone' governs not only Demas, but also Crescens and Titus
The fact that Paul says that Luke alone is with him may indicate that Titus left either in a negative way or in a neutral way
Because Paul was suffering as a prisoner in Rome, none of his co-workers should have left him for any reason unless they were sent by Paul
Ultimately we must leave to the Lord the question of whether Titus was sent by Paul to Dalmatia or went there on his own
Although there was no human organization, there was a divine arrangement in which the leading apostle was the authority
Even though Demas loved the present age and forsook Paul, Paul does not say that he dismissed him from the work
How much the leading ones in God's coordination can say to you depends on the extent to which you are one with the ministry
Verse 14 says, 'Alexander the coppersmith did many evil things to me; the Lord will repay him according to his works'
Paul did not curse Alexander, but he did utter a word of righteousness, saying that the Lord would repay him according to his works
Some may think that Hymenaeus was not a genuine believer, whereas others may think that he was a genuine believer who later became heretical
We have pointed out that it is difficult for us to draw the boundary line between the great house and the house of God
Concerning Alexander the coppersmith, Paul advised Timothy, 'You also guard against him, for he greatly opposed our words'
Verse 16 continues, 'At my first defense no one came with me, but all forsook me; may it not be counted against them'
It equals the crown of righteousness in verse 8, and it is an incentive to the believers to run the heavenly course
In the decline of the church and in suffering for the church, the gift of power is not as much needed as the grace in life
It may appear to some that in caring for Timothy's ailment and Trophimus' sickness in a human way Paul acted as if he were an unbeliever
Our emphasis must be on the eternal life by which we can withstand tests, trials, persecution, attack, and opposition
We see that Paul concludes with two of the main elements of his composition of 2 Timothy: a strong spirit and the grace of God
The book of 2 Timothy, which gives instructions concerning how to confront the degradation of the church, strongly stresses our spirit
In the midst of the degradation of today's Christianity, there will be the testimony of the reality of God's economy
It is helpful to know the sequence in which the four books of 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, and Philemon were written
Finally, during his second imprisonment, at the time of Nero's persecution, he wrote his last epistle, the Epistle of 2 Timothy
After his release from prison, Paul visited various places, including the city of Ephesus and the island of Crete
Paul was an apostle not only according to the faith of God's chosen ones, but also according to the full knowledge of the truth
In verse 2 Paul goes on to say, 'In the hope of eternal life, which God, Who cannot lie, promised before times eternal'
In the hope of eternal life means on the basis of, on the condition of, relying upon the hope of, eternal life
For this, the faith of God's chosen ones, the truth according to godliness, and eternal life are indispensable
It is not only everlasting, lasting forever, with respect to time, but in its nature it is also eternal and divine
The eternal life of God is given to all believers in Christ and is the main element of the divine grace given to us
The Father chose us in the Son and predestinated us unto sonship through Him before the foundation of the world
It must have been in that eternal epoch that the Father promised the Son that He would give His eternal life to His believers
In verse 4 Paul says To Titus genuine child according to the common faith grace and peace from God the Father and Christ Jesus our Savior
Because of this, the first thing the apostle charged Titus to do in setting things in order was to appoint elders in each city
The elders are appointed to administrate God's government in a local church that good order may be maintained in the church
The 'faithful word' is the trustworthy, reliable, and true word which was taught in the churches according to the apostles' teaching
The elders in a local church should hold to this kind of healthy word that they may fulfill their duty in teaching
It also indicates that the order of the churches was maintained by the faithful word, which was given according to the apostles' teaching
In a darkened and confused situation, we must cleave to the enlightening and ordering word in the New Testament-the apostles' teaching
To maintain the order of the church, the word according to God's revelation is needed in addition to the eldership
The teaching of the apostles ministers healthy teaching as the supply of life to people, either nourishing them or healing them
To convict here is to disclose the true character of anything so as to convict and hence reprove by exposing one's fault
In 1 Timothy 1:1 Paul says that he became 'an apostle of Christ Jesus, according to the command of God our Savior'
In Titus 1:1 Paul again speaks of his apostleship, but he adds something to what is written in 1 Timothy 1:1 and 2 Timothy 1:1
How can you explain the fact that you believe in the Lord Jesus when others, perhaps members of your family, refuse to believe in Him?
The reason these Gentiles could receive the word of the Lord and believe is that they were destined even predestinated to believe in Christ
Through faith Paul was brought into the organic union with the Triune God, and in this way he could receive the supply of eternal life
Paul could stand against the Roman Empire not because he was strong or capable in himself, but because he had received eternal life
We have pointed out that Paul also says that he became an apostle according to the full knowledge of the truth
Again and again we have seen that the truth in 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus denotes the reality of the contents of God's New Testament economy
We have the faith to bring us into the organic union, and we have the full knowledge of the truth of God's New Testament economy
Paul's apostleship involved four factors: God's command, eternal life, faith, and the full knowledge of the truth
Of these four elements two are on Gods sidethe command and the eternal lifeand two are on our sidefaith and the full knowledge of the truth
John 172 seems to refer to this Even as You gave Him authority over all flesh that He may give eternal life to all whom You have given Him
Because the promise of eternal life was made by the Father to the Lord Jesus in eternity, the Bible says that God chose us in Christ
The eternal life was promised by the Father to the Son; however, what God the Father has manifested is not eternal life, but His word
By reading verses 2 and 3 carefully, we see that the word manifested is the equivalent of the eternal life promised
God promised eternal life through the Son concerning us in eternity, but the proclamation was made in different ages and at different times
In this message we shall consider from these verses how Titus was instructed to deal with the influence of Judaism and Gnosticism
Both Pauls word about those of the circumcision in verse 10 and his reference to Jewish myths in verse 14 point to the influence of Judaism
These vain talkers and deceivers overthrow whole households, 'teaching things which they ought not for the sake of base gain'
Paul goes on to explain that there are many unruly men, especially of the circumcision, whose mouths must be stopped
There was the urgent need for the eldership to be set in order so that those who taught differently could be dealt with
Certain Jewish believers brought their Judaism into the church life and this, with its different teachings, caused a disturbance
In verses 12 and 13 Paul declares, 'One of them, a prophet of their own, said, Cretans are always liars, evil beasts, lazy gluttons
It means to disclose the true character of anything so as to convict and hence reprove by exposing one's fault
They needed the inoculation of the healthy teaching and the healthy word , which the elders should provide for their healing
The Greek word for myths is rendered myths here and in 1 Timothy 1:4, tales in 1 Timothy 4:7, and fables in 2 Timothy 4:4
It refers to words, speeches, and conversations concerning such things as rumors, reports, stories, and fictions
The truth here and the faith in the preceding verse prove that those who were dealt with here were not unbelievers
Paul says that to those who are defiled, or polluted, and unbelieving nothing is pure, but both their mind and conscience are defiled
If our mind is polluted, our soul is spontaneously polluted; and if our conscience is defiled, our spirit is unavoidably defiled
We should also be watchful concerning the hypocrisy and the superficial and superstitious tales circulated among many Christians
In Jerusalem those who received the Lord Jesus and were added to the church continued in the teaching and fellowship of the apostles
According to Ephesians 2:8, a verse often quoted in pointing out that salvation is by grace, to be saved does not mean to be saved from hell
They may be familiar with particular doctrines and consider this doctrinal knowledge the full knowledge of the truth
If as is the practice of many Christians we interpret truth to mean doctrine then the Lord Jesus would have been saying I am the doctrine
There is even a bumper sticker which makes light of the rapture by saying: 'Warning-in case of rapture, this car will be unmanned'
Panton has pointed out, many will be surprised to realize that this ticket is false and will not admit them into the heavenly kingdom
Another teaching we must oppose is the saying that as long as two or three meet in the name of the Lord, they are the church
Two or three believers may meet in the name of the Lord, but that does not necessarily mean that they are the church in that locality
The young people must honor their parents, and we all need to have a proper relationship with our family, relatives, and neighbors
Our burden must be to minister the all-inclusive Christ and the church as the Body of Christ to those who love God and seek Christ
If we study the verses where this word is used, and especially if we pray-read them, we shall be richly nourished
In contrast to those who profess to know God but by their works deny Him Titus was to speak the things which are fitting to healthy teaching
It is very much stressed in these three books, 1 and 2 Timothy and Titus, books dealing with the disorder and decline of the church
In the foregoing message we pointed out that in fighting the battle for the truth, we need to maintain excellent relationships with others
In 2:2 Paul speaks to the aged men and says, 'Aged men are to be temperate, grave, of a sober mind, healthy in faith, in love, in endurance'
It is often easier for an elderly person to be offended or angered than it is for a young person to be bothered in this way
The word faith in verse 2 does not refer to the objective faith, to the things we believe, but to our activity of believing
In order to be healthy in faith, we need to come to the Word and contact the Lord by praying in a living way with our spirit
Paul's use of the word 'likewise' indicates that the behavior of the aged women should be similar to that of the aged men
Especially the elderly sisters should have a demeanor which befits the sacred things, the things related to the service of the church
The young women should be sober chaste workers at home kind and subject to their own husbands so that the word of God may not be blasphemed
The word of God properly and adequately taught in a local church should be testified to by the sisters' submission to their own husbands
Paul's use of the word likewise indicates that the charge to the younger men is similar to that given to the others
The Greek word rendered opposer in verse 8 means the one of the opposite, contrary, side; that is, the heathen or Jewish opposer
The healthy teaching with the healthy speech of healthy words is the most effective antidote to the opposer's evil speaking
The church's government is built upon the proper eldership, and the teaching in the church is based on the healthy teaching of the apostles
For the testimony of Jesus we need the highest human life, a life lived out according to the divine life given to us by God
After speaking of the church and of the family life, Paul goes on to charge the slaves to behave well in the social system of slavery
He gave instructions to slaves concerning the need to behave according to the highest standard of human character
If Paul had advocated the annulment of the system of slavery he would have been regarded as a social reformer by those who read his Epistles
For this reason, when He was on earth, the Lord Jesus did not deal with the social system or with any earthly government
To be sure, God was utterly opposed to such a social system, for it was altogether contrary to the place of man in His creation
Even in the midst of such an unjust social system, Christians could live out a life with the highest standard of humanity
No matter how bad certain social systems may be today, none are as bad as the system of slavery in the Roman Empire
For the saints to live a Jesusly human life in that kind of social system was a marvelous testimony of the divine life
It was God's wisdom that a slave, bought and branded like an animal, could testify of the divine life according to the highest standard
If we have a bright testimony of a living which is Jesusly human, our neighbors will realize that we are genuine Christians
We should live not only in a way that is different from that of others, but in a way that is higher and more respectable
It appeared in the New Testament through the first appearing of Christ , bringing salvation to all men, both Jews and Gentiles
Forsaking ungodliness and worldly lusts we should live a life which is sober toward ourselves righteous toward others and godly toward God
In verse 13 Paul continues, 'Awaiting the blessed hope, even the appearing of the glory of the great God and our Savior, Christ Jesus'
According to the other school, there is but one Person, Christ Jesus being the great God and our Savior, thus asserting the deity of Christ
Whether or not we shall be happy at the time of the Lord's appearing depends on our living as Christians today
Because they have been drugged, they imagine that they will have no problems with the Lord at the time of His appearing
They do not seem to realize that, according to Paul's word in 2 Timothy 4:8, the Lord will appear as the righteous Judge
In contrast to much of the preaching among Christians today, the ministry in the Lord's recovery does not present sugar-coated teachings
Christ gave Himself for us not only that He might redeem us from all lawlessness, but also purify to Himself a people for His own possession
In verse 15 we have the apostle's charge to Titus: 'These things speak, and exhort and reprove with all authority
To exhort and reprove with all authority is to advise and rebuke imperatively with words of authority in every way, as giving command
Paul's exhortation, 'Let no one despise you,' is connected with the matter of authority in the preceding sentence
The healthy teaching with the healthy word according to godliness would keep him in gravity and invite the utmost respect
To have an orderly life, we need to take care of four units: the church, the family, the social system, and the government
Even the philosophers and thoughtful people throughout the centuries have considered only these three units among mankind
We give the church preeminence in our consideration, for the church is the house of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth
In this message we are concerned with Paul's charge to the saints to maintain a good relationship with the government
Before Paul could teach the saints to respect the government, he himself had to experience a certain amount of transformation
When he was Saul of Tarsus, he was a patriotic Jew and wanted to be free from the yoke of the Roman imperialists
Paul recognized that even those officials appointed by Caesar are rulers appointed by God, His deputy authority
To care for the church life, the family life, the social system, and the government, we need a specific supply
The supply for the proper family life includes healthy teaching , healthy speech , and being healthy in faith, in love, and in endurance
Titus 2:11 says that the grace of God brings salvation to man, and 3:7 says that we have been justified by the grace of the Lord
In John 1:16 and 17 we have grace; however, in 1 John we touch the love of God the Father as the source of this grace
According to verse 5, God's salvation is also through a certain action: the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit
In this is a passage from the old state we were in into a wholly new one, from the old creation into the status of a new creation
According to verse 7, the believers are not only sons, but also heirs who are qualified to inherit the Father's estate
The faithful word here is given in verses 3 through 7, and these things are the things mentioned in verses 1 through 7
In speaking concerning the church life, the family life, the social system, and the government, Paul does not give empty instructions
We have the divine supply for a proper church life, family life, social life, and relationship with the government
We have a proper relationship with all these units not by ethical teachings, philosophical instruction, or our natural life and ability
In verse 7 Paul says, 'That, having been justified by the grace of that One, we might become heirs according to the hope of eternal life'
Becoming heirs of God is the goal of His eternal salvation with His eternal life given to us by grace in Christ
Although justification is somewhat implied by the matters of salvation and washing, Paul mentions it explicitly in verse 7
Paul became an apostle in the hope of eternal life, and we become heirs of God according to the hope of eternal life
The fact that he used the word 'in' with respect to himself indicates that he was already experiencing the hope of eternal life
Because we have not yet entered into this experience to a very great extent, he says that we are heirs according to the hope of eternal life
The questionings here are those aroused by genealogies , and the strifes issue out of the questionings and genealogies
Contentions refer to fightings, which are due to different opinions issuing from the deviant and mythological studies of the law
These questionings, genealogies, strifes, and contentions are all vain; that is, they are aimless, without any positive result
These things include foolish questionings, genealogies, strifes, contentions about the law, and factious, opinionated men
These matters are of the knowledge that is deadening, matters that belong to the tree of knowledge and kill their victims
The content of the teaching of the New Testament economy is the all-inclusive Christ and the church as the Body of Christ
As we direct our attention to God's economy concerning Christ and the church, we must avoid differing teachings
The more he expounds 1 Corinthians 13, the more those who listen to him are distracted from Christ and from the church life
Many seeking Christians have been distracted not by heresies, but by good teachings on certain favorite portions of the Bible
Although they may talk a great deal about love and about the need to love one another, they neglect the church life
A factious man is a heretical, sectarian man who causes divisions by forming parties in the church according to his own opinions
In order to maintain good order in the church, a factious, divisive person, after a first and second admonition, should be refused, rejected
Because such divisiveness is contagious, this rejection is for the church's profit that contact with the divisive one be stopped
In verse 11 Paul speaks a severe word, saying that a factious man has been perverted, that he sins, and that he is self-condemned
One who has been perverted in this way is spoiled, damaged, destroyed, with respect to God's New Testament economy
With his tongue he may say that he is not condemned, but deep in his heart he has questions and a sense of uneasiness
If they did not have a feeling of condemnation within, they would not struggle to vindicate themselves and to convince others they are right
The faith here is subjective and denotes our believing act which brings us into organic union with the Lord and operates through love
In the new man all the believers, whether masters such as Philemon or slaves such as Onesimus, have the same status
The introduction to this Epistle concludes with Pauls word in verse 3 Grace to you and peace from God our Father and the Lord Jesus Christ
It is because his love has refreshed the inward parts of the saints and has hence rendered the apostle much joy and encouragement
Literally, the Greek word for heart means bowels, as in verses 7 and 20; Philippians 1:8; 2:1; and Colossians 3:12
Just as the Lord would not do anything without our consent, Paul would not keep Onesimus with him without Philemon's consent
Christ's death on the cross has abolished the ordinances of the different ways of life for the creation of the one new man
It is of the Lord's sovereignty that this Epistle was positioned after the three preceding books in the arrangement of the New Testament
These terms indicate the intimate sentiment in the apostle concerning his relationship with the fellow members in the new man
The eternal life of God imparted into Onesimus caused him to be reborn as Paul's spiritual child and brother in Christ
Although Paul had such a loving concern for his child, he realized that he was not the right person to keep him
Verse 18 may indicate this: 'And if he has wronged you in anything or owes anything, charge that to my account'
After we have brought a sinner to the Lord, we should first regard him as our spiritual child and then help him to rectify his relationships
The fellowship of Philemon's faith may be likened to a fan with which we fan into flame for Christ all the good things within us
In the churches in the Lord's recovery it is our practice to send back the escaped one and the divorced or separated wife or husband
Finally, in keeping with Paul's example in this Epistle, we must help the newly saved one to come into the church life
The fact that there were churches in Rome and in Colosse indicates that the churches as the expression of the Body of Christ are universal
Even during the comparatively short time of thirty years, churches had been established not only in Judea, but also in the Gentile world
Christs life had been constituted into Philemon and the same life with the same divine element had been constituted into his slave Onesimus
In the old social system, which belongs to the living of the old man, the distinction between master and slave exists
Through regeneration Onesimus had become more than a slave and even more than a free man, for he had become a beloved brother
Now Onesimus had a relationship with Philemon 'both in the flesh and in the Lord': in the flesh as a slave and in the Lord as a brother
As we have already indicated, this can be proved by Colossians 3:11, where we are told that in the new man there is no bond or free
As Paul was writing to Philemon, he may have been thinking something like this: 'Onesimus has become a dear brother in the Lord
If we would have the genuine church life, we must receive all the saints regardless of race, nationality, or social rank
We should never speak of a church according to race or color-there is no white church, yellow church, black church, or brown church
After you come into the church life, there must not be deep in your being any discrimination between believers on the basis of race or color
As long as such a discrimination exists within you, as far as you are concerned, you are nullifying the church life
If we still make distinctions on the basis of color, race, or nationality, in this matter we are reprobate concerning the truth
According to the full knowledge of the truth, in the universe there is one new man, one Body of Christ, and one church of God
According to the Lord's sovereignty, the Epistle to Philemon was written before the Epistles to Timothy and Titus
In the arrangement of the books in the New Testament, Philemon was placed at the end of this group of four books
These books reveal the practice of God's New Testament economy, and Philemon shows us a particular aspect of that practice
In the practice of the economy of God, it is crucial that all social ranks and differences among races and nations are swallowed up
He did so because he was burdened to illustrate that among all the saints and all the local churches, the believers are equal in the new man
It was the salvation of Onesimus that afforded Paul the opportunity to give such a marvelous illustration concerning the life of the new man
He could point out that a slave, then in Rome, and his master, far away in Colosse, were equal as believers in the new man
The case of Onesimus and Philemon illustrates to the uttermost that in the new man all the believers have an equal status
Praise the Lord for the salvation of Onesimus, and praise the Lord for this illustration of our equal status in the new man!
The phrase, 'if he has wronged you in anything or owes anything,' indicates that Onesimus may have defrauded his master
Since Philemon refreshed the inward parts of the saints, his partner asks him now to do the same for him in the Lord
Pauls expectation that he would be liberated from his imprisonment and visit the churches again is also expressed in Philippians 125 and 224
The apostle always greeted the recipients of his Epistles, both in the opening and in the conclusion, with the grace of the Lord
No human effort avails for the accomplishment of such a high revelation as the completing revelation of the Apostle Paul
