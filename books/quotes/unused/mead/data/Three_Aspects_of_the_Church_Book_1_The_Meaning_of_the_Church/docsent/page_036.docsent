   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE TYPES OF THE CHURCH 4 THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The types in the Old Testament concerning the church can be divided into two main categories: women and dwelling places the tabernacle, the temple, and a city.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The children of Israel connect these two categories.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Children of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The children of Israel connect two categories because God considers the children of Israel as a corporate woman as well as His habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the Old Testament, God regarded the children of Israel as His spouse, His wife.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Such terms can be found in Nehemiah, Ezekiel, and Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the children of Israel stand before God in the position of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, the children of Israel also typify God s habitation because they were corporately God s dwelling place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Before God, the children of Israel are not only a woman but also God s habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In like manner, the New Jerusalem is both a woman and a habitation Rev 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ephesians clearly says that the church is Christ s counterpart 5:31-32 and that the church is also God s dwelling place 2:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In addition, Revelation speaks of the New Jerusalem as the wife of the Lamb 21:2, 9 , indicating that the church is God s dwelling place as well as His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Old Testament typology, the children of Israel connect the two types concerning the church by being both a woman and a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, in the children of Israel we see both a woman and a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the types of Eve, Rebekah, and the Shulammite, we cannot see the aspect of a dwelling place, and in the types of the tabernacle and the city we cannot see the aspect of a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We can see the aspects of a woman and a dwelling place only in the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, the type of the children of Israel is complete and whole.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>With them there is a beginning, a process, and a conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Each of the seven women who are types of the church focus on a particular aspect of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In contrast, the children of Israel typify the church in its beginning, its process, and its culmination.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Corinthians 5 speaks of the Feast of the Passover, indicating that the children of Israel s keeping of the passover typifies the church s corporate keeping of Christ as the reality of the passover.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 7 says, Purge out the old leaven that you may be a new lump, even as you are unleavened; for our Passover, Christ, also has been sacrificed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that our keeping of the feast is not an individual matter, in which one person keeps the feast today and another keeps it tomorrow; rather, everyone needs to keep the feast at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In God s eyes we all, including the apostles Peter and Paul, keep the feast at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>According to the type of the passover, it is not that one Israelite would repent, kill a lamb, and keep the passover on the first day of the first month, while another would repent, kill a lamb, and keep the passover on the fourteenth day of the same month.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Instead, all God s people kept the passover at the same time on the same day.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hence, 1 Corinthians 5 speaks of the church corporately keeping the feast; it does not speak of individual salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First Corinthians 10 also speaks of the processes through which the Israelites passed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Their exodus from Egypt and their journey in the wilderness typify the church coming out of the world and journeying in the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hebrews 3 and 4 reveal that even though the children of Israel came out of Egypt and passed through the wilderness, only a few entered into Canaan to obtain the rest.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These chapters do not refer to the believers individually but to the church as a whole.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These portions in the New Testament prove that the story of the children of Israel coming out of Egypt and entering into Canaan is a type of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This type does not focus on a single aspect of the church s experience; rather, it is a complete and systematic type with a beginning, a process, and a culmination.</S>
