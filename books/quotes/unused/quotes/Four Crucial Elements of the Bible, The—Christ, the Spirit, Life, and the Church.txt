In particular, the Bible presents the divine and mystical matters in a way that is easily understandable to us
Man is also of three parts: the outer part-the physical organs; the inner part-the soul; and the innermost part-the spirit
Of these three parts-spirit, soul, and body-the most important part is the innermost part, the spirit, which is the breath of life in man
The Bible has its kernel, its life, its center, which is constituted with the church, Christ, the Spirit, and life
The revelation of the Bible, particularly the New Testament, stresses these four matters: the church, Christ, the Spirit, and life
We must all have a deep impression, a fresh light, and a renewed understanding concerning these four crucial elements
The Greek word for church is ekklesia, which is composed of two words: ek, meaning 'out of,' and kaleo, meaning 'call'
God has called us out of the world, out of every nation, tribe, people, and tongue and has gathered us together to be the church
Today, regardless of our nationality or race, we have been called to become the people of the kingdom of the heavens
An American of Chinese descent is Chinese according to birth, but he becomes an American citizen by naturalization
We all have God's divine life in us, and we are brothers and sisters of one another because we have been born of the same Father
In the church there are no differences among colors or races, and neither is there any separation due to language or culture
The Bible clearly reveals that the Triune God not only coexists but also coinheres; the Son is in the Father and the Father is in the Son
The holy anointing ointment in Exodus 30:23-25 typifies the Triune God being processed and eventually consummated as the Spirit
At the baptism of the Lord Jesus, the Holy Spirit was already present , but when the Lord cried out to the people, the Spirit was not yet
The reality of resurrection is also the Spirit; without the Spirit, we do not have the death, resurrection, and ascension of Christ
As God in eternity with divinity, Christ became a man with humanity and lived the human life on earth for thirty-three and a half years
We may illustrate the compound Spirit with a beverage that is a compound of water with honey, lemon, tea, and salt
The Triune God as a person in the church and Christ as a person in the believers are nothing less than the Spirit
Now as the Spirit of reality He is life to the believers that they may live Him out as the processed Triune God
When we believe in the Lord, this Lord in whom we believe immediately comes into us to be our life and person and to live and move with us
Before a person is married, he is alone, but after he is married, he is no longer one person living alone but two persons living together
A couple living together is an outward matter; the Lord Jesus and we live together by being united and mingled as one
In Christianity, there is the bad habit, the bad influence, of considering everything in the Bible to be merely a doctrine
When preaching God, many merely preach a doctrine, and when preaching Christ, many also merely preach a doctrine
Both in the Far East and in the West, there are some, including even former 'co-workers' among us, who say that we teach heresy
Some have even published books to slander us, saying that our teachings are 'sensuous' and are altogether not according to proper doctrines
In their consideration, Christ, who is sitting high above in the heavens, has only a representative on earth, who is the Holy Spirit
A couple may stay in the home of their relatives or friends, but that is a temporary residing not a settling down
It is not until they move into their own house that they settle down and deeply make their home there without having to move again
During conferences people come from different places and stay with us only for a while without making their home here
Genesis 1 tells us that after creating the heavens, the earth, and all things, God created man on the sixth day
Image and likeness indicate that man was created not only to be exactly like God but also to be a vessel to contain Him
Even if you did not know how a glove should be used, as soon as you saw one you would clearly realize that it was made to contain your hand
When God put man in front of the tree of life, that indicated that He wanted to be received as life into man as a vessel
Some people in Christianity today have only a shallow understanding of biblical truths, yet they slander us, accusing us of teaching heresy
They speak boldly and confidently as if they have all reason on their side, but in actuality this exposes their ignorance
Not only has this group made such a statement; some in a major Eastern denomination have also said nearly the same thing
In John 16:12-13 the Lord Jesus clearly said to His disciples, 'I have yet many things to say to you, but you cannot bear them now
For the sake of defending the truth, we have published a booklet, What a Heresy-Two Divine Fathers, Two Life-giving Spirits, and Three Gods
In order to keep the traditions, they even believe in two divine Fathers, two life-giving Spirits, and three Gods
Due to their ignorance concerning the truth, they even ask, 'How can Christ, who is the great sovereign Master, abide in the believers?
In a major Eastern denomination, some display a picture depicting a figure with one body and three heads; this is their so-called Trinity
Colossians 2:16-17 says that eating, drinking, feasts, new moons, and Sabbaths are all shadows, but the body is of Christ
The teaching concerning eating the Lord Jesus is not my teaching; it was taught by the Lord Himself in John 6:57
To render verse 57 as 'He who eats My body' creates a problem because it leads people to believe that the Lord's physical body is edible
They do not see that in verse 63 the Lord explains, saying, 'It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing'
Not only so, but the Lord's word in verses 54 and 56, 'He who eats My flesh and drinks My blood,' implies His death
The separation of blood and flesh indicates that the Lord gave His body and shed His blood for us that we may have eternal life
We have also pointed out that eating the Lord is a figurative way of speaking; it means to receive the Lord into us to be our life supply
The Bible shows us that God is triune not for our doctrinal understanding but for our experience and enjoyment
He had to solve the problems in us relating to sin, the self, the natural man, the corrupt nature, Satan, the world, and the ordinances
Since the Triune God desires to come into us to be our enjoyment, He first needed to go through a procedure to accomplish redemption
For Christ to solve our problems, He had to be the Redeemer, but for Christ to come into us as our life, He has to be the life-giving Spirit
John chapter one says that in the beginning was the Word, the Word was God, and the Word became flesh to be the Redeemer
In Greek the word became in these two passages of the Bible is an emphatic word; it points to a specific purpose to attain a definite goal
According to flesh, Christ came out of Israel, out of the tribe of Judah, yet Romans 9:5 says that He 'is God over all, blessed forever'
Hebrews 1:8 says, 'But of the Son, 'Your throne, O God, is forever and ever, and the scepter of uprightness is the scepter of Your kingdom'
When we say that the Son is God, we do not mean that He is merely one-third of God; rather, we mean that He is the Triune God Himself
One school says that Christ is the Father, while another school says that He is not the Father but only represents the Father
To say that Christ only represents the Father is a great mistake, and to say that He is the Father is too direct
The accurate way is to say that Christ is the expression of the Father; therefore, when we see Him, we see the Father
When we experience and enjoy Christ, we experience and enjoy the Father who is in Christ and in whom Christ is
At the same time, when we have the Lord Jesus, we have the Father because the Father is in Him and He is in the Father
He has been sent by God not only to speak the words of God to us but also to give us the Spirit not by measure
When we experience Christ, we experience the Triune God; when we experience Christ, we experience the Father and the Spirit
Verse 26 mentions the Father and the Son, and it also speaks of the Father's sending the Holy Spirit in the Son's name
The Bible clearly reveals that Christ is intrinsically involved with the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
Due to our subjectivity, we may not enter into the revelation of the Bible, even though we have read it many times
The Father is the source, and when the Spirit comes from the source, He does not leave the source but comes with the source
We all need to have our eyes opened to see that only when we experience the Triune God can we have the real experience of Christ
The procedure of God's becoming flesh was that He entered into Mary's womb, being conceived of the Holy Spirit
The man Jesus was God becoming flesh with the divine essence and the human essence; hence, He is both God and man
In incarnation, it was God who became flesh, yet He who was born was the Son, whose name was Emmanuel, that is, God with us
There may be a table spread with an abundance of food and drink but unless we eat and drink them all the abundance has nothing to do with us
Thank the Lord, today He is the life-giving Spirit, and we also have a spirit within that can contact and receive Him
After the Lord promised His disciples in those two chapters, He indicated that He would go to die, be buried, and come back in resurrection
All the aforementioned matters are related to the essential aspect of the Triune God, concerning His being and His person
At the Lord's table, as the Son's redeemed ones, we first remember the Son and then worship the Father under the leading of the Son
What the Lord's table involves is not mainly the essential aspect but the economical aspect of the Divine Trinity
Since the two coinhere and therefore are one, why did the Son still need to pray to the Father by lifting His eyes to heaven?
He was born of the Holy Spirit so that He had the element of the Holy Spirit within Him ; this is a matter of essence
The Holy Spirit's descending upon Him in His baptism was as His power for His ministry; this is a matter of economy
When we are filled with the Holy Spirit and have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, we receive the Spirit of power
The Spirit of life within is the essential aspect, whereas the Spirit of power without is the economical aspect
When we pray and exercise our spirit, we touch the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit-and we receive the life supply
Corinthians 1:30 tells us that Christ is wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption
Colossians 3:4 says that Christ is our life, and Ephesians 3:8 says that Christ is One who is unsearchably rich
In Philippians 1:20 Christ will be magnified, as always, in our body, and in verse 21a for us to live is Christ
In addition, it covers human culture, the conditions among the human race, and everything pertaining to human life
Those who study theology surely must scrutinize the Bible thoroughly because it contains many theological doctrines
Throughout the generations many teachers of theology have studied the Bible devotedly and have written profusely
Without Christ, there is no Spirit; without the Spirit, there is no life; and without life, there is no way to produce the church
In their mind there were even no such concepts as 'the light of the world,' 'the bread of life,' and 'the water of life'
The Lord Jesus said, 'I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life'
That the Lord Jesus was able to speak such extraordinary words that were unequaled before or after that time proves that He was not ordinary
He answered An evil and adulterous generation seeks after a sign and a sign shall not be given to it except the sign of Jonah the prophet
His disciple John wrote in the very beginning of his Gospel, 'In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God
All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being'
Do not consider that the husband is the lord of a family, because when he encounters many situations, he is unable to act as the lord
The Lord Jesus is not only God but also man; hence, He is qualified to be the Mediator, the go-between, of God and men
Rather, in eternity He was God and not man, but two thousand years ago He was born of the virgin Mary through the Holy Spirit to be a man
If the Lord Jesus had been tall in stature, Zaccheus would not have needed to climb a tree in order to see Him
The prophet Isaiah said, 'His appearance was marred more than that of any man,/And His form more than that of the sons of men
He has no attracting form nor majesty that we should look upon Him,/Nor beautiful appearance that we should desire Him'
Although He lived a human life, His living far exceeded benevolence and morality; it is indescribable with human vocabulary
Only a good Samaritan, who was journeying, was moved with compassion toward you and has cared for you in a detailed way
He was God who became a despised man to pass through human life for us and journey through human life as we do
We can endure what others cannot, and we can live a life that others cannot, even a life that goes beyond humility and meekness
When they think that we should weep, we still can praise, and when they think that we should exult, we bow down in worship
The true power of Christianity altogether lies in the inner life; this is why Christianity is able to spread worldwide
The soil of the earth may be thick and hard, yet the seed still will sprout and grow because it has the intrinsic life power
What He is, which far exceeds the kindness, justice, and morality taught by the Chinese sages, cannot be expressed by human language
Paul said that Christ is the treasure that we contain as earthen vessels, vessels that are worthless and fragile
We need to continually practice living by Him and thus pass through a time of travailing that Christ may be formed in us
We may live by our natural life and even become perfect men, but we are still human beings; we are merely copper, not gold
Our problem today is that after we are saved, we keep trying to be a proper Christian living a pure and faultless life
In order to live and magnify Christ, Paul said that he suffered the loss of all things and counted them as refuse that he might gain Christ
Paul was zealous for the law to such an extent that he said that he was blameless according to the righteousness which was in the law
He cast all those things aside completely, counting them as refuse on account of the excellency of the knowledge of the Lord Jesus Christ
Because of such knowledge, he was willing to pay the price by considering all things to be loss, refuse, that he might gain Christ
Toward such a One our reaction should be that it is no longer we who live but it is Christ who is God man and the Spirit who lives in us
He is waiting to be formed in us, He wants us to live Him out and express Him, even to the extent that for us to live is Christ
We should consider the knowledge of Christ as something excellent and aspire to know such a Christ and the power of His resurrection
The power of Christ's resurrection will operate in us so that our living is full of the experience and enjoyment of Him
May You, as the cleft rock, flow forth the living water again to us that we all may be refreshed, satisfied, and rejoicing in our heart
We love something not because we are capable of loving; rather, it is because a certain thing is lovable and we are drawn to love it
We are very reluctant to love something that is not lovable, but it is difficult for us to refrain from loving something that is lovable
In the past two thousand years, innumerable people have been attracted and charmed by Him, and we are among them
We do not know why and we cannot explain it, but we are simply charmed by the Lord Jesus because He is truly full of attractiveness
The Bible covers thousands of items and deals with a great number of doctrines, but it has only one center-Christ Himself
We can see skin and hair on the surface, touch the flesh and bones within, and examine the internal organs through dissection or by an x-ray
The center, the essence, of man, which is man's life, is neither visible nor touchable, yet it is real and crucial
If we touch or see only these things in our reading of the Bible, we are not different from the unbelievers in their reading of the Bible
The Old Testament speaks of Christ with a great part in types and a considerable part in prophecies but nearly with no plain words
The teaching material in graduate schools, however, contains very few pictures; instead, it contains many classical writings
The first category is human beings; the second, animals; the third, plants; the fourth, minerals; the fifth, offerings; and the sixth, foods
There is the dove and then the eagle; first there is the Lamb which was slain and then the overcoming Lion of the tribe of Judah
When He was crucified on the cross, He was the bronze serpent, which had the form of the serpent but was without the serpent's poison
He is also the acacia wood, which signifies that His humanity is noble and strong in quality and lofty and superior in standard
He is different kinds of stone: the living stone , the rock , the cornerstone , the topstone , and the foundation stone
In the Old Testament, Exodus is an introduction to the offerings, Leviticus is the text, and Numbers and Deuteronomy are the supplements
There are five main offerings: the burnt offering, the meal offering, the peace offering, the sin offering, and the trespass offering
He is the fruit of the tree of life , as well as wheat, barley, milk, and honey , to be man's supply and nourishment
Even if you have read through the entire Old Testament, you do not understand it unless you know these six categories
Prior to His coming, His forerunner, John the Baptist, was filled with the Holy Spirit, even from his mother's womb
The preparing of the way for the Savior's coming required that His forerunner be filled with the Holy Spirit even from his mother's womb
One day, in the sixth month of the conception of John the Baptist in his mother's womb, Mary went to visit John's mother
After the birth and naming of John, Zachariah his father was filled with the Holy Spirit and prophesied with praise to God
The families in the world are mostly led by the parents to be filled with all kinds of worldly amusements and matters
Sometimes a father plays mahjongg the mother follows the son helps the daughter joins in and the daughterinlaw and soninlaw also come
Of staying in Jerusalem, he went into the wilderness to be far from human religion and culture and thus became a 'wild' person
On the one hand, He is the Son of the Most High God ; on the other hand, He is the Son of Man, the seed of woman
The Lord Jesus, however, was conceived of the Holy Spirit; such a conception was essential and was related to the divine being of Jesus
When He came out to minister, He not only had the Holy Spirit outwardly as power, but He already had the Holy Spirit in Him as the essence
We cannot compare with the Lord Jesus even in His human nature, not to mention that the divine nature was in His human nature
At the seashore of the Sea of Galilee, seeing Peter, Andrew, James, and John, He spoke only a brief word: 'Come after Me'
They immediately quit their fishing, cast off their nets, and left their boats and their fathers to follow Him
The Lord Jesus explained saying He who believes into Me as the Scripture said out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water
Once we believe into Him, not only is our thirst quenched, but there are even rivers of living water flowing out of our innermost being
The apostle John told us, 'But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed into Him were about to receive'
The presence of the article the before Spirit is emphatic in Greek, indicating that the Spirit referred to is a very particular Spirit
At the time the Lord Jesus spoke this word, 'the Spirit' was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified
In order to know what 'the Spirit' is, we must first find out when the Lord Jesus was glorified and what the issue of His glorification was
He went to the cross and was crucified for us, shedding His blood for our redemption and releasing His divine life
No one may be able to recognize the seed of a flowering plant, but when it is sown into the soil, it sprouts, grows, and blossoms
Even those in His family could not fully understand Him; they were only able to tell that He was subject to them
When He came out to preach in His ministry at the age of thirty He attracted a group of people especially the twelve disciples to follow Him
One day, after they had been following the Lord Jesus for less than three years, suddenly He indicated to them that He was going to die
When the people heard this word many of them including the disciples may have gathered together for a discussion saying What is the Spirit
Not only the Jews and the disciples in the ancient days were perplexed; many Christians throughout the generations have felt the same way
On the night of His resurrection He came into the midst of His disciples and breathed into them, saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
When we look at the pictures in the Old Testament, we can right away understand their apparent, superficial, and literal side
In speaking about Christ, the New Testament does not mainly use types, such as human beings, animals, plants, minerals, offerings, and foods
In the New Testament, Christ is presented altogether with the Spirit as the center, the element, and the sphere
It goes on to show that Jesus was altogether conceived and born through the Holy Spirit's entering into humanity
In the Old Testament, in God's relationship with man and in His dealings with man, there was the Spirit of Jehovah
In the beginning of the New Testament, the Holy Spirit came to carry out the work for the preaching of the New Testament gospel
Many Bible readers recognize that the Acts of the apostles is the Acts of the Spirit and the biography of the Spirit
Do not think that the Spirit of Jesus is different from the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Jehovah, and the Holy Spirit
When Paul and his company of co-workers went out preaching in their ministry, they were led and controlled by the Spirit of Jesus
It does not say the Spirit and the bride both say but the Spirit and the bride say indicating that the Spirit and the bride have become one
The difference between Christians and unbelievers is that we Christians can still rejoice in our afflictions and not be anxious
To have a life that is anxious for nothing but always rejoicing, we need to experience Christ and know the Spirit
We also need to exercise our spirit and release our spirit before the Lord regularly for our cooperation with the Lord
They have not been thorough enough, and might even be considered negligent, in their study of the Holy Spirit in the biblical record
A hen broods, stretching its wings over its eggs for the purpose of producing something living, that is, its chicks
Some good English versions of the Bible have translated this word into was brooding, with the sense of life-producing
Elijah became a prophet because the Spirit of Jehovah came upon him; later, Elisha, following Elijah, put on Elijah's mantle
That mantle is a type of the Holy Spirit descending upon the believers in the New Testament as the economical Spirit, the Spirit of power
The Holy Spirit as the essence of Jesus in His conception and birth was His divine life, and He lived by this Spirit as His essence and life
The essence of the divine element of the Holy Spirit, who was His life and nature, was unchangeable and irremovable
On the last night of His threeandahalfyear ministry the Lord Jesus had a long discourse with His disciples which is recorded in John 1416
In this parting word, He first said that He is the expression of the Father; when people see Him, they see the Father
The Lord went on to say that this Comforter, the Spirit of reality, would abide with the disciples and would be in them
The Lord wanted them to know that at that time He could only be with them outwardly, but He could not enter into them
Although the Lord in the flesh could be with the disciples and could walk, stay, and abide with them, He was not satisfied with this
Since He was to be their bread of life and life supply, He had to be received into them that He might minister to them
Although the disciples were delighted with the Lord's outward presence, that was not good enough; the Lord aspired to enter into them
That day was the day when the Lord lived and His disciples also would live; this refers to the day of the Lord's resurrection
After His resurrection the Lord lived in His disciples, and they also lived by Him, as referred to in Galatians 2:20
In 20:22 in His resurrection the Lord came to the disciples and breathed into them and said to them, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
The disciples could have such a realization because the other Comforter had entered into them and was experienced by them practically
According to our thinking, if a person loves the Son, the Son will love him and will enter into him with rejoicing to abide in him
John 14:26 says that the Father sent the Spirit in the Son, and the Father and the Son are one because the Father is in the Son
15:26 shows us that the Son sent the Spirit from the Father and with the Father; hence, the Spirit is with the Father
The Father and the Son are two, but in the sending of the Spirit They are one, because it is the Father sending in the Son
Since Christ as the Spirit lives in our heart today, we can sing, 'Floods of joy o'er my soul like the sea billows roll'
He came first by becoming the life-giving Spirit through death and resurrection; this was the first step of His coming
The Lord's breathing accomplished not only His coming as another Comforter but also the giving of the Comforter by the Father
The Lord's word of promise to His disciples was fulfilled in just three days and was therefore 'a little while'
If we do not understand this, in our experience it may seem that we have only the Son without the Father and the Spirit
Because the Spirit is in us for our experience, we are brought into the Son to live by Him, because of Him, and with Him
There are not only three in one but four in one; the Father, the Son, the Spirit, and the believers have all become one
When the Spirit comes, He comes with the Father, who is in the Son and in whom also is the Son, and lives in us so that we are in the Son
Unfortunately, many Christians today neither understand this matter nor have the light concerning it, much less experience it
Christians' general concept about prayer is that we pray and ask the Lord to do something for us only when we have problems
Calling on the name of the Lord is the secret not only to our salvation but also to our enjoyment of the Lord's riches
Once we call on the Lord, our temper is gone, and when we call again, we feel peaceful inside and we rejoice exultingly
Every morning you need to first call on the name of the Lord to be filled with 'air,' and then go to your office
It is needless to say that you are often deflated after working hours are over; even by noon you have nearly been deflated already
Later, Brother Nee added a word saying that the reckoning in Romans 6 must be done along with the experience in Romans 8
Since the Lord is the Spirit, He can come into us, and all His riches can be subjectively experienced and enjoyed by us
In other words, the breathing of breath is for the essential aspect, whereas the eyes' observing and shining are for the economical aspect
In the essential aspect, the Spirit is the Son's breath, while in the economical aspect, the aspect for moving, the Spirit is the Son's eyes
Isaiah 9:6 says that the Son is called the eternal Father, and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that the Son is the Spirit
We cannot experience the Father directly; we must come to the Father in the all-inclusive Spirit through the Son
Singing a hymn like this was a new thing in the Lord's recovery because up until then our meetings had been very structured
It is worth remembering that just after that conference, we had Brother Nee's wedding meeting, and we sang this short hymn there
Why does it say that it was in that day, that is, in the day of the Lord's resurrection, that the disciples would know?
No one has dared to say such a thing, but the Lord has raised up His recovery that we may preach the pure revelation according to the Bible
With respect to the Son, it was a breathing; with respect to the Spirit, it was a coming; and with respect to the Father, it was a giving
When the Son breathed in this way, the Father's giving of the Holy Spirit was accomplished, and the Holy Spirit's coming was fulfilled
They also realized what the Lord had said in chapter fifteen concerning their abiding in Him and His abiding in them
They knew that what the Lord had spoken in chapter fifteen concerning their abiding in the Son and His abiding in them was also true
Now we must go a step further to ask how it was that once the Spirit entered them the disciples knew the three items mentioned in John 1420
In 1423 the Lord said If anyone loves Me he will keep My word and My Father will love him and We will come to him and make an abode with him
The answer to all these questions is in verse 20, which says that the Son is in the Father, we are in the Son, and the Son is in us
15:26 says that the Holy Spirit, whom the Son sends from the Father, is the Spirit of reality who proceeds from the Father
When we put these two verses together we can see that when the Holy Spirit comes He comes with the Father who is in the Son and with the Son
In other words, the coming of the Holy Spirit is the coming of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
The result was that in the disciples' experience they realized that not only the Spirit but also the Father was in them
According to our experience, however, we do not experience the reality of salvation until we touch the Lord in our spirit
Even though we may not be clear about doctrine at that time, we truly sense the reality and feel that there is a breath within us
The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three; the Father and the Son are distinct, and the Son and the Spirit are also distinct
Isaiah 9:6 says, 'A son is given to us /And His name will be called /Eternal Father,' and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, 'The Lord is the Spirit'
On the evening of the day of His resurrection, the Holy Spirit whom the Lord breathed into His disciples was simply Himself, the Triune God
The Gospel of John says that when the Son came, He did not merely come from the Father, but He came from and with the Father
The Son came to the earth from and with the Father, but He was conceived and born of and through the Spirit as His essence
It is true that the Triune God is one God, but there is the aspect of three-the Father, the Son, and the Spirit
The New Testament clearly indicates that when the Son was dying on the cross, the Father and the Spirit were both passing through death
Through our repenting and believing, the Son's redemption is applied to us sinners for the forgiveness and purification of our sins
It is through the Son, that is, through the effectiveness of the Son's redemption, that we are qualified to come before God
When we are in the Spirit, we have access unto the Father, because the Father is in the Son's name and the Father and the Son are one
According to the truth, these are three steps: we have access through the Son, in the Spirit, and unto the Father
Once we call on the Lords name we immediately have access in the Spirit unto the Father because the Father the Son and the Spirit are one
Through the Son is through the Triune God, in the Spirit is in the Triune God, and unto the Father is unto the Triune God
It is unfortunate that in today's Christianity this mistaken concept still exists due to two thousand years of the influence of tradition
Even among the saints in the Lord's recovery, there may still be some who unconsciously hold this mistaken concept
We need to earnestly study the Lord's Word and the truths in the Lord's recovery and carefully check them with our experience
The Father hears Paul's prayer and grants the believers to be strengthened through the Spirit into the inner man
Since the Father, Son, and Spirit are just one, why could he not pray directly to the Son asking Him to make His home in our hearts?
Ephesians 2:18 also refers to the Son, the Spirit, and the Father-having access through the Son, in the Spirit, unto the Father
The direction is reversed; it begins with the Father, it is through the Spirit, and finally the Son comes to make His home
If we want to enter into God to enjoy and experience Him, we must begin with the Son and have access in the Spirit unto the Father
When we speak of the Body of Christ, we must begin with the Spirit, because it is the Spirit who is in the Body
If we have not clearly seen that the Triune God is one, then we will never be able to clearly explain these passages
What Christianity sees is very shallow, but what we believe and experience are the divine mysteries in the Bible
We have discovered these profound points in the Bible in order to help the saints, hoping to give everyone a key to open this treasure store
The Spirit is the Son, the Son is the Father, and the Father is the Triune God, who can be over us and through us and in us
When we experience the Spirit, we experience the Triune God, and when we experience Christ, we experience the Triune God
Do we first experience the grace of Christ, then the love of the Father, and finally the fellowship of the Holy Spirit?
We cannot have the fellowship of the Holy Spirit without the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God
As we have seen, the Holy Spirit, who is the consummated Triune God, is of two aspects-the essential aspect and the economical aspect
In John 20:22 the Holy Spirit as breath is of the essential aspect, while in Acts 2:2-4 the Holy Spirit as wind is of the economical aspect
The Spirit's declaring to the disciples is His glorifying of the Son in verse 14 and His guiding of them into all the reality in verse 13
The Spirit perfectly desires/That Christ, the Son, be glorified,/And He reveals Him unto me,/That He be fully testified'
Rather, it was written altogether according to experience and by putting together different points of the revelation of the Bible
It says, 'Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
Anyone among all the nations who believes in the Lord must be baptized into one name-the name 'Father, Son, and Holy Spirit'
Jehovah is God's name in the Old Testament, but today we are no longer in the Old Testament but in the New Testament
Because our natural concept is often governed by tradition, whenever we speak of the Lord Jesus, we exclude the Father and the Spirit
In addition, since we do not have sufficient power when we pray, we need to depend on the power of the Holy Spirit
When we pray, we should pray to the heavenly Father, in the name of the Son, and by the power of the Holy Spirit
1 Corinthians 15:45b says, 'The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit,' and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says, 'And the Lord is the Spirit'
Once we have the Spirit, we have the Son and the Father because the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are one
Corinthians 13:14 says, 'The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all'
When the Holy Spirit reaches us, He transmits the Father's love and the Son's grace for our enjoyment and experience
The first is the Spirit, the Holy Spirit, and the second is that which is born of the Spirit, which is the human spirit
To be saved is not to believe in a religion; rather, it is to receive another life into us in addition to our original human life
In John 4:24 the Lord Jesus said, 'God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness'
Zechariah 121b says Jehovah who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him
What God considers most important in our being is not our physical organs or psychological faculties but our spirit
The Lord Jesus said that God is Spirit and that when we worship and contact Him, we must be in our spirit and exercise our spirit
For walking, we use our feet; for seeing, we use our eyes; for hearing, we use our ears; and for praying, we use our spirit
Perhaps when you first start to pray, you are in your mind; but after much practice in praying, you will gradually be in spirit
After further practice, you will reach a point that whenever you pray, you pray in your spirit and with your spirit
The Bible contains profound truths that are not for the believers' objective knowledge but for their subjective experience
To dive into these profound truths, we need to use our spirit because the Lord said that His words are spirit and are life
When we use our spirit we dive into these profound truths which are able to help open up our prayers making them more penetrating and richer
In this way our taste and feeling for the name of the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit will be very different from that in the past
John 1:12 says that as many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God, to those who believe into His name
In other words, since the Spirit of the Triune God is in our spirit, He can witness with our spirit that we are children born of God
Putting these five verses from the Scriptures together, we can see a clear picture that the Triune God as the Spirit today is in our spirit
7:6 says that we serve God in newness of spirit, and 12:11 says that we must be burning in spirit, serving the Lord
In Greek, spirit here refers not to the Holy Spirit but to our regenerated human spirit indwelt by the Spirit of God
Our spirit within our being is a spirit of revelation, a heavenly 'window' that is capable of receiving light from heaven
Before he spoke concerning the profound truths in Ephesians, Paul first prayed that God would make our spirit a spirit of revelation
If every one of us walks in spirit and worships God in spirit, the church has the reality and is the dwelling place of God
If we do not have any dealings with others, there are no arguments, but once we make friends with others, we begin to have quarrels
When we exercise our emotions, we open the door to the flesh, opinions, and quarreling; thus, the building work is finished
It is not that if we are gentle, then there is the church, and that if we are hot-tempered, then there is no church
When we are angry, we must first return to our spirit, and if it is not of the Lord, we should not become angry
Our entire being, including our mind, emotion, and will, must be strengthened into the inner man, which is our regenerated spirit
When you go back to your daily living, a word from the elders or an attitude of your spouse can cause you to become enraged and corrupted
When our mind becomes a mind in the spirit, our spirit becomes a transforming spirit that is able to transform our entire being
Of being drunk in our body with physical wine, we are 'drunk' in our spirit with God Himself as the divine wine
To pray every time in spirit indicates that we ought to exercise our spirit moment by moment, always living in spirit
If you do not pray and digest with your spirit, what you have seen or heard is merely an objective doctrine or theory
In prayer, you use your spirit to take in and digest what you have understood, making it your subjective supply in spirit
Perhaps we do not know if we are one spirit with the Lord, but we know when we are not one spirit with the Lord
Only by being one spirit with the Lord can we enjoy God, experience the Lord, and be sanctified, spiritual, and overcoming
Only in this kind of experience can we have the growth and maturity in life and be transformed and built up together
Matthew as the first book of the New Testament speaks of Christs coming and at its very beginning it gives a genealogy to show us His origin
We may say that the Holy Spirit who entered into the womb of the virgin Mary was the 'gene,' the life factor, of Christ's conception
The Holy Spirit was the 'gene' that came out from God, entered into the womb of the virgin, and became the factor of Christ's conception
During the three and a half years of His ministry, this was how He lived, how He moved, and even the more how He worked
When He was born, He put on humanity, the virgin's factor, but this humanity had not yet been uplifted into divinity
When the Lord died, Satan was happy, thinking that the Lord Jesus would be finished after His death and burial
Apparently a grain of wheat that is sown into the ground is broken, but in actuality it is given a great opportunity to resurrect
When a grain of wheat is sown, it is a bare seed, but what grows up is a green sprout with no trace or shape of the original seed
Christ's crucifixion was to break the shell of His body to release the glorious, divine life within Him so He could enter into resurrection
A grain of wheat grows into a sprout and then produces many grains with an increase of thirtyfold, sixtyfold, and even a hundredfold
When Christ was resurrected as the Spirit, He also produced the believers as the many grains to be His increase
There is the fact, but there is not the utterance; there is such a person, but there is no way to describe Him
According to the record in chapter two, after God created man, the name Jehovah is used in the relationship between God and man
When a grain of wheat is sown into the earth and grows, that is the glorification of the seed, the seed's entering into glory
Now the Spirit is the Spirit of life , the life-giving Spirit , the Spirit of Jesus , the Spirit of Christ , and the Spirit of Jesus Christ
The Lord is the Spirit, and the Spirit today has become the seven Spirits for God's move in His administration
For this reason, 1 John 5:12 says, 'He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life'
At that time a pastor taught me, saying, 'Before you were saved, you had life, but the life which you had was not very good
Before we were saved, we all had the psuche life, but we did not have the zoe life, the divine, eternal, and uncreated life of God
Without the Son of God, we can have the psuche life and the bios life, but we do not have the zoe life, the eternal life of God
When the Lord Jesus died for us on the cross, He laid down His soul, His psuche life, His human life, that we may share His zoe life
The robbers here mainly refer to the Pharisees because they did not come into the sheepfold through the Lord Jesus
All the Pharisees were robbers, not wild robbers with knives and guns, but cultured robbers speaking of love, justice, and morality
Since the nineteenth century, many saints have touched the matter of life and have left us many writings concerning life
We are not boasting; since we are standing on the shoulders of those who have gone before, we can see things more clearly
We are not proud, but we are truly standing on the saints from earlier centuries, and we should thank them for this
In my library there are various versions of the famous, authoritative translations and expositions of the Bible
By the Lord's mercy, today we can know that Christ is life and that Christ became the life-giving Spirit, who is the Spirit of life
The word eternal here in Greek is related both to space and time and refers to something without the limitations of space and time
Matthew 26:63-64 says that when the Lord Jesus was being judged, the high priest asked Him, 'Tell us if You are the Christ, the Son of God'
John 1:51 reveals that He will also be the Son of Man in eternity; at that time the angels of God will ascend and descend on the Son of Man
He showed them the nail marks on His hands and the spear wound in His side, and He even ate a piece of broiled fish before them
When a grain of wheat dies and then sprouts, we cannot say that it does not have a body; the sprout that grows up still has a physical form
If we do not have Christ, then we need the teachings of morality, etiquette, and ethics, but when Christ comes, we do not need them
Thank the Lord that today we have not only the Bible but also the Life-studies and the Recovery Version of the New Testament
We are not like Christianity, which teaches people how to be good children, good husbands and wives, and good parents
The situation among most Christians today may be considered as total darkness, where there is no light, life, or truth
We do not need to pray and beseech; we only need to diligently pursue and exercise, and life will grow out from this seed
It is just as 1 John 3:9 says, 'Everyone who has been begotten of God does not practice sin, because His seed abides in him'
Since our spirit has been born of God, we do not practice sin because His seed, that is, the divine life, has been sown into us
Revelation 2:7 also joins life to the Spirit, saying, 'He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches
When we hear what the Spirit says to the churches, we overcome, and the result is that we enjoy Christ as our life supply
When you turn on a light switch, an electric light shines, but when you turn off the switch, it does not shine
In addition, we need to stay in a good mood and be pleasant; we should not be angry, depressed, or downhearted
Just as there cannot be a good country without good citizens, there is no way to produce a good church without good Christians
We thank and praise the Lord that He has given us the secret of the Holy Spirit within and the Holy Bible without
To express the truths in poems and lyrics requires even the more that we have a thorough understanding of the truths
The table of contents alone occupies five pages pointing out the sequence of the truths so that by reading it one can easily receive light
It covers the church as the mystery of Christ the increase of Christ the fullness of Christ the vessel of Christ and the lampstand of Christ
It also covers the church's general definition, course, faith, unity, foundation, building, attraction, coordination, and fellowship
In the Bible, the Old Testament never mentions the church in plain words, but it contains the types of the church
In Psalm 84 the psalmist tells us that he longs, even faints, for the courts of Jehovah, which are the dwelling place of God
One day He brought them into the parts of Caesarea Philippi, in the northern part of the land of Judea, far from the atmosphere of Jerusalem
In chapter eighteen the Lord said that if a brother sins against us and refuses to hear our admonition then we should tell it to the church
Chapter eighteen says that if a brother sins and refuses to hear our admonition, then we should go and tell it to the church
The church in Jerusalem was the first church established in a locality within the jurisdiction of a city, the city of Jerusalem
The record concerning the establishing of the church in its locality is consistent throughout the New Testament
The Greek word for church, referring to the church in Jerusalem in Acts 8 and in the church in Antioch in chapter thirteen, is singular
In Asia Minor, each of the several cities, such as Ephesus and Smyrna, had its respective church, so there were the 'churches'
In Matthew the Lord Jesus only briefly mentioned the church in its unique, universal aspect and in its local aspect for expression
He tells us that the church is what God planned in eternity, what God is after in His heart's desire; it was God's plan in His economy
It is unfortunate that of the Jews the Gentiles the Catholic Church and many in Christianity very few know that the Triune God is the Head
In the New Testament dispensation, the Triune God has become the Head of the Body, and His redeemed people are the Body
In Ephesians Paul covers the church in its aspects as the Body, the dwelling place, the fullness, the new man, the bride, and the warrior
Paul speaks not only concerning the inner being of the church but also of the outward expression of the church
After approximately twenty-five years, among the apostles of the first generation, only the aged John was still alive
The nature of the golden lampstand is pure gold, and in typology gold signifies the Father's glorious nature and life
In Revelation the golden lampstand signifies the church as the embodiment of the Triune God-the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit
Ephesians 4:4-6 speaks of one Body and one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father of all, who is over all and through all and in all
At the end of Revelation, when the new heaven and the new earth come, their center is a golden mountain, the New Jerusalem
Ultimately, the New Jerusalem is an aggregate lampstand with Christ as the lamp and God as the light shining out from the golden mountain
At the beginning of Revelation, the church is expressed as many lampstands in different localities, with one lampstand for each locality
For more than a thousand years Christianity neglected and abandoned the church, making the church a material thing
The Brethren properly understood this meaning and therefore did not approve of using the word church, but used assembly instead
In today's Christianity, there is not one locality with one church but one locality with one hundred 'churches' like a 'church market'
The proper church in God's eyes is a group of people who stand on the proper ground and are according to God's heart
When the seventy years had been fulfilled, God commanded the children of Israel to return from the land of captivity to form a nation again
Because the returned people had the holy temple and the holy city and were in the holy land, they were the nation of Israel
In the same manner, those in the Christian denominations today may also question why they are not the church, since they are Christians
Before their deformation, they were the proper Israelites, but after their deformation, they became scattered and divided
Although they were still Israelites, they had left the ground of oneness and were no longer the nation of Israel
They should not have still remained in Assyria or Egypt, much less in Babylon, a place which was condemned by God
In God's eyes, Christians who do not return to the proper ground to worship God are not the church in practicality
Many Christians meeting together may not be the church; only those who stand on the unique ground ordained by God are the church
In their captivity some Christians saw God's revelation and knew that they ought to return from the land of their captivity
We are not in the Catholic Church, nor in the denominations, nor in a 'halfway cabin,' but on the proper ground
In the ancient time, all the children of Israel knew that they had to return, but only a small number of them returned
Because they have not returned to the nation of Israel, they have no share in the formation of the nation of Israel
Today, the majority of Christians are scattered in the Catholic Church and in different Christian denominations and groups
As genuine Christians, they are components of the church, yet they are separated from the church and have no share in the church
In the eyes of God, they are not the church, just as the children of Israel who are scattered everywhere are not the nation of Israel
In figure, today, only we who have come out of the Catholic Church and the different Christian denominations and groups are the church
Many of these brothers and sisters who immigrated to the United States, which is an English-speaking country, cannot speak English
We must be clear that doing the Chinese-speaking work is not doing a work in addition to the work of the church
We should not form a church because of language, since in the church there are no differences in nationalities, races, and languages
The Chinese-speaking work in every place in the United States must be done in the fellowship of the local church
On the other hand, the elders should not allow the Chinese-speaking work to have such unlimited freedom that it becomes a separate unit
The elders must always render fellowship, guidance, and supervision for the testimony of the oneness among God's people
We thank the Lord that under His sovereignty He has brought so many Chinese to the United States, and He has also brought His recovery here
We pray further that You would open us to You from within so that our spirit is open, our heart is pure, and our mind is sober
Deliver us from our tradition, from the influence of the past, from all the distractions around us, and from all the coverings
Under the category of human beings, besides the priest, the king, and the prophet, there are the shepherd and the counselor

We are those who sin without intent, but since we are all sinful in Adam, according to the law we should all perish
Christ is complete and perfect, and He has passed through all His processes to become the life-giving Spirit-the Spirit, who is life
Our salvation, our growth, our transformation, and our maturity in Christ are all matters of the Spirit and life
The Bible is not a book merely about human history, the creation of the heavens and the earth, or much less morality and ethics
It tells us how the church is produced, how the church should have its living, and how it passes through a process
In chapters two and three we see the seven epistles written to the seven churches-one epistle to each church respectively
The Spirit's speaking to the churches equals the Lord's working on the churches, and the Spirit's speaking concerns the Lord's work
He will deal with all the rebellions: the rebellion in heaven, the rebellion on earth, and the rebellion under the earth
Finally, He will deal with the leader of the rebellions, that is Satan, the devil, the ancient serpent, the great dragon
In this way, all the negative things in the universe, whether in heaven, on earth, or under the earth, will be swept into the lake of fire
In Revelation 21 to 22, concerning the new heaven and the new earth, the revelation is once again on the church
The first three chapters tell us how the church shines forth as a golden lampstand in the old heaven and old earth
The old heaven and old earth may be compared to the night, whereas the new heaven and new earth are the real day
The old heaven and old earth are a long, dark night, and in this long stretch of night the church is a golden lampstand
In Matthew 16:16-18, Peter first had the realization that the Lord Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God
We were individual and scattered, but when the Lord Jesus baptized us in the Holy Spirit, He baptized us into one body
It would be awful if, when someone prophesies, only his mouth rose to prophesy and the rest of his body remained seated
Sometimes we even say that we should share everything with one another, we are all members, and we have to love one another
Today many Christians say that we should not have a narrow view or be sectarian but should simply love one another
That pastor said, 'If there is only one church in Chefoo, this is like having only one electric lamp in a big house at night
Someone once commented that among the Chinese who come to the United States, two lines of business have been the most prosperous
Ephesians 1:22-23 says that not only has Christ been exalted to be Head over all things, He is also Head over all things to the church
The precious blood washes away our sins and filthiness objectively, whereas the water washes away our spots and wrinkles subjectively
Spots, which are of the natural life, are scars left by the wounded natural life, whereas wrinkles are related to oldness
For this cause a man shall leave his father and mother and shall be joined to his wife, and the two shall be one flesh
Christ and the church not only are one spirit but also have become one Body , as typified by a husband and a wife becoming one flesh
The church, which is the pillar and base of the truth, holds, bears, and testifies all the real things concerning Christ and the church
The first three chapters of Revelation reveal that while the church is on earth, there is only one church in each locality
Eventually, in the last two chapters of Revelation there is the ultimate manifestation of the church-the New Jerusalem
Within the city, there is a throne, out of which comes a street which passes by the twelve gates in a spiraling manner
If we study this picture in detail and pray-read and digest it thoroughly, our eyes will be opened to clearly see what the church is
The essence of Eve was the same as that of Adam; there was no difference in essence because Eve was of Adam, being built with a rib of Adam
The union of the church with Christ is not only like the joining of a wife to a husband, but even more like the union of a body with a head
In the area around Nanking and Yangchow in China there is a saying In the morning the skin wraps the water at night the water wraps the skin
For a Christian to be healthy, there is also the need to have 'the skin wrapping the water' and 'the water wrapping the skin'
The church is baptized in the Spirit, is given to drink the Spirit, lives in the Spirit, and is for the manifestation of the Spirit
1 John 5:12 says, 'He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life'
Being born from our mother's womb was our first birth for us to receive the psuche life, which is the human life
When the life of God grows in us, we grow in this life unto maturity and arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ
Initially, flower seeds are not pretty, but the more they grow, the better they look and the more they are transformed to be beautiful
The contents of the church are Christ, the Spirit, and life, and the appearance of the church is one church in one locality
