   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF ZECHARIAH MESSAGE FIFTEEN A WORD CONCERNING THE HUMAN SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE CHRIST UNVEILED IN ZECHARIAH Scripture Reading: Zech 12:1; Isa 42:5-6; John 4:24; 2 Tim 4:22; Zech 3:9; Rev 5:6; Zech 1:8-11, 20-21; 2:1-2, 5, 8-9, 11; 4:7, 2-3, 11-14; 9:9; 11:7-13; 14:9, 16-17; 4:9; 6:12-15, 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Zechariah reveals that Christ is wonderful and that He is the centrality and universality of God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But how can we receive such a Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The means and the instrument by which we can receive Christ is our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In this message, therefore, I would like to give a word concerning the human spirit and the Christ unveiled in Zechariah.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>SISTER VERSES IN ZECHARIAH AND ISAIAH</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the books of Zechariah and Isaiah, both of which have much to say about Christ, there are sister verses that speak clearly regarding the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Zechariah 12:1 says, "Thus declares Jehovah, who stretches forth the heavens and lays the foundations of the earth and forms the spirit of man within him."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This reveals that the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man was created by God with a spirit that he may contact God, receive God, live God, fulfill God's purpose for God, and be one with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Isaiah 42:5 is a sister verse to Zechariah 12:1.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Thus says God Jehovah, / Who created the heavens and stretched them out, / Who spread forth the earth and what springs up from it, / Who gives breath to the people upon it / And spirit to those who walk on it."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Hebrew word translated breath here can also be rendered spirit cf.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Prov 20:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These sister verses both mention three matters: the heavens, the earth, and the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whereas Zechariah 12:1 speaks of God's forming the human spirit, Isaiah 42:5 simply speaks of God's giving a spirit to man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 6 goes on to speak concerning God's purpose in giving man a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"I am Jehovah; I have called You in righteousness; / I have held You by the hand; / I have kept You and I have given You / As a covenant for the people, as a light for the nations."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here we see that God intends to give His Son Christ to us as a covenant and as a light to the nations.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such a Christ is wonderful, but unless we can receive Him, He does not have anything to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In order to receive this Christ, we must have a receiver within us, and this receiver is our human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God has given us a spirit so that we can receive, partake of, participate in, and enjoy Christ as the covenant and as the light.</S>
