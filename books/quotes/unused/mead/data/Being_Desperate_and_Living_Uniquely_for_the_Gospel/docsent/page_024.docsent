   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In doing anything successfully there is a certain principle.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You must get the principle and learn it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Do not think that to knock on doors to get people baptized is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No, it has its principle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There are principles in learning how to play the piano.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we are endeavoring to live uniquely for the gospel, and no other way is prevailing but the Lord's new way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This has been proven by Christian history for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We studied many of the practices of the past and tried them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We had many of the books of the leading mystics translated into Chinese close to fifty years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We studied nearly all of the leading books of the inner life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I learned a lot from them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I was with the Brethren, and Brother Nee studied many books put out by the Brethren teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We even tried some items of the Pentecostal movement and found out that it was not profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must cut off "the tail" of the leaven of Christianity to have a new way, and the new way is fully ordained by God and recorded in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is here now for us to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have tried this way, and it works.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If each one of you would rise up and go out for some time once a week for two or three hours, everyone will get one a month or twelve a year.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What an increase we will have!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I must be faithful to tell you this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>After telling you this, you bear the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must visit people to share with them the high gospel, that is, the Triune God Himself to be our life and content.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our sharing of the gospel with people is to lead them to believe and be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the Bible not one who repented and believed was told to wait for some time to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Every case was that they repented, believed, and were baptized Acts 8:36-38; 16:14-15, 31-33; 22:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the biblical way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When people repent and believe, that is the right time for you to exercise your authority to authorize their baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Holy Spirit honors this and confirms this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This baptism could never be a ritual.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But if you ask people to wait four months and then baptize them, that baptism will become a ritual and not bear any significance in the power of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We do not need to wait to get into the meeting hall's baptistery.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Right away from the living room, we get them into the bathroom to exercise the power of the Spirit in baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What a big difference!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you would take this way and practice faithfully to go out three hours weekly for four weeks a month, I assure you that you can gain one person.</S>
