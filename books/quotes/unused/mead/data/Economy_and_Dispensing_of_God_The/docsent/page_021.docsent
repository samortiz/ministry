   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO RECEIVE AND TO ENJOY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE BOUNTIFUL SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we want to receive and to enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, first we must love the Lord with all our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must fellowship with Him all the time and must abide in Him unceasingly 2 Cor 5:14; 1 John 1:3; John 15:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Actually, it is not we who love the Lord first.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, it is the Lord who first loved us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This love was manifested through His death for us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The love of Christ constrains us on all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It focuses us on one goal, that is, that we would no longer live to ourselves, but to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In such a condition we live in the fellowship of the eternal life of Christ and enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>How can we abide constantly in the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Today, the Lord is not only in heaven but also in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we set our mind on the spirit Rom 8:6b , we are abiding in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To set the mind on the spirit is actually to abide.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Every day and every moment, we need to set our mind, which represents our whole person, on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The more we set our mind on the spirit, the more we will abide in the Lord, and the more the Lord will live Himself through us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, "But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We can abide in the Lord because of the fact that we are one spirit with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the same time, the Spirit with whom we have been joined as one is also the word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus said in John 6:63, "The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Christian experience, the word and the Spirit must forever be one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we want to receive the Spirit, we must receive the word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without receiving the word, it is impossible for us to have the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Since God is both the Spirit and the word, He created for us a mind to understand and also a spirit to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When we touch the Bible, we need to exercise our mind and our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to read with our mind and pray with our spirit; that is, we need to pray-read the word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must pray-read daily at set times to receive the word of God, which is the embodiment of the Spirit Eph 6:17; John 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We not only need to pray with our spirit, but we also must pray at every time in spirit Eph 6:18 and must not quench the Spirit 1 Thes 5:19 , but must be filled in spirit by the Triune God Eph 5:18b .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Finally, if we desire to receive and enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, we must also walk only according to spirit Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our walk, our speaking, our actions, and our attitudes must be conducted according to spirit and not according to flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this way, we will daily receive and enjoy the dispensing of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Under this dispensing, we will spontaneously receive the supply of Christ within and will live a life that expresses Christ.</S>
