Acknowledging That the Believers<br />Have Been Baptized into One Body</h2><p>Another prerequisite is that we acknowledge that all the believers have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body and that God has placed the members in the Body and blended all the Body together (1 Cor. 12:13a, 18, 24). If we see that God has already placed the members in the Body and has blended the Body together, we are built.</p><h2 class="head3">3. Being in Harmony and in One Accord</h2><p>We also need to be in harmony with the fellow believers and to be in one accord with the Body in prayer, which issues in the establishment of the church (Matt. 18:19; Acts 1:14). We need not only to have the oneness but also to be in sweet harmony with other believers and to be in one accord with the Body in prayer. If we cannot pray in one accord with the saints, we are not one with them. Praying together is a test concerning whether or not we are in one accord with all the saints.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Practicing the Oneness of the Divine Trinity</h2><p>The believers need to practice the oneness of the Divine Trinity in the Divine Trinity as the Divine Trinity does (John 17:21-23). We need to ask ourselves what kind of oneness we are practicing. Some claim to be practicing the oneness of the Body, but they are actually practicing a sectarian, factious oneness. The oneness of the Body is the oneness of the Triune God. We practice the oneness of the Divine Trinity not in ourselves but in the Divine Trinity. The three of the Divine Trinity&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;are continually practicing the divine oneness. For example, the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I and the Father are one&rdquo; (John 10:30). The oneness of the Father and the Son includes the Spirit, who is the consummation and totality of the Triune God. The Spirit is also the Triune God reaching us. When Christ came into us, He came as the Spirit. Wherever the Father and the Son are, there the Spirit is also.</p><h2 class="head4">a. By the Divine Life</h2><p>We practice the oneness of the Divine Trinity by the divine life with its source, the divine name of the Father (17:2-3, 6, 26). The name denotes the person&mdash;the Father, who is the source of life.</p><h2 class="head4">b. By the Divine Word</h2><p>We practice the oneness of the Divine Trinity also by the divine word as the truth that sanctifies the believers from the world (vv. 14-19). We are separated from the world and are holy unto God.</p><h2 class="head4">c. By the Divine Glory</h2><p>Furthermore, we practice the oneness of the Divine Trinity by the divine glory&mdash;the divine sonship with the Father&rsquo;s life and nature as the divine right to express the Father (vv. 22, 24). Sonship is composed of the divine life and the divine nature. Anyone who does not have the divine life and nature is not a son of God, for such a one does not have the divine sonship. The divine sonship implies God the Father&rsquo;s life and nature. This sonship is the right for us to express the Father. Actually, the only one who has this right is the Son of God. God the Father first gave His glory to His Son, and then His Son passed on this glory to us who, as sons of God, have God&rsquo;s life and nature as our sonship and as the right to express Him.</p><h2 class="head3">5. Keeping the Oneness of the Spirit</h2><p>The next prerequisite is to keep the oneness of the Spirit diligently (Eph. 4:3). We keep this oneness in the constitution of the Body with the Divine Trinity (4:4-6) as the source (the Father), the element (the Son), and the essence (the Spirit). We also keep this oneness through the perfection by the gifted members for the building up of the Body of Christ (vv. 11-12). This means that keeping the oneness is related not only to the Triune God but also to the gifted persons&mdash;the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers. Moreover, we keep the oneness by the growth in the divine life, growing into the Head in all things (vv. 13, 15).</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
