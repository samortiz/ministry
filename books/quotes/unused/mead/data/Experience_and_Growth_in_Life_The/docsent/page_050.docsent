   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Mirrors Beholding and Reflecting the Glory of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Paul and his co-workers were also mirrors beholding and reflecting with an unveiled face the glory of Christ in order to be transformed into His glorious image 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Man was made in the image of God Gen 1:26 , and Colossians 1:15 says that Christ is the image of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The glorious image unveiled in 2 Corinthians 3 is the divine image in Genesis 1:26.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, at the time of Genesis 1:26, Christ did not have the elements of incarnation, humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>His all-inclusive, wonderful death, and the wonderful resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These elements have now been added to Christ by the process through which the Triune God has passed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now the image of God is not only the image of divinity, but the image of divinity mingled with humanity and constituted with the all-inclusive death and the wonderful resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Earthen Vessels Containing the Excellent Treasure</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The apostles were also earthen vessels to contain the Christ of glory as the excellent treasure 2 Cor 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 7 says, "But we have this treasure in earthen vessels, that the excellence of the power may be of God and not of us."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The earthen vessels are worthless and fragile, but a priceless treasure is contained in the worthless vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This treasure enters into the vessels by God's shining.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God shines, the treasure is infused into the earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The content of this treasure is divinity mingled with humanity, constituted with His wonderful, all-inclusive death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to enjoy the constituents of this treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We should enjoy divinity, humanity, and even death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are two kinds of death in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One is the death of Adam, and the other is the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We hate the death of Adam, but we love the wonderful, marvelous, all-inclusive death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The excellent power of the treasure is manifested in the earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 8 says, "We are afflicted in every way, but not straitened; perplexed, but not despairing."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Being afflicted in every way indicates affliction in every kind of suffering, but it is not merely suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Being afflicted in every way indicates the all-inclusive death of Christ, but not being straitened is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Likewise, being perplexed indicates death, but not despairing is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Verse 9 says, "Persecuted, but not forsaken; cast down, but not destroyed."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Being persecuted and cast down again indicate death, but not being forsaken and not being destroyed refer to resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Verses 10-12 say, "Always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus' sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>So then death operates in us, but life in you."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The death for Jesus' sake is the glorious, wonderful, loveable death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The life of Jesus is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Earthen vessels containing a treasure is the last metaphor used to describe the ministers of the new covenant and their ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This portion of the Word leads us into the real experience of Christ's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are the earthen vessels, yet we have a treasure in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This demonstrates the excellence of the power of the treasure in death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Christ's power is not only manifested in resurrection but also in death.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The four Gospels show us how Christ passed through a long journey of death, but He was not put down by death; the many aspects of death could not restrain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He had the power to overcome death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In death the power of Christ was greatly manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In His resurrection His power was also manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There was no way to subdue Paul because as an earthen vessel he had Christ as the treasure within him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this way, the excellent power of the treasure was manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was not of man but of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 16 says, "Wherefore we do not lose heart, but if indeed our outward man is decaying, yet our inward man is being renewed day by day."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Decay indicates death, but renewal is resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our afflictions may cause us to lose heart, but we have to thank and worship the Lord for our afflictions.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord allows us to pass through afflictions so that our inward man may be renewed day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are all the captives of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, we are Christ's incense-bearers, scattering, dispensing, the fragrance of Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We are also letters of Christ written by the Spirit, not to display ourselves, but to display ourselves with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In this sense, "Christ" should be a part of our name.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are also mirrors, and we are vessels to contain Christ as the treasure, that day after day we may express the all-inclusive death of Christ and the resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How much of this treasure we have in us is indicated by how much we express Christ in His all-inclusive death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Question: Being afflicted, perplexed, persecuted, and cast down and the decaying of our outward man are all aspects of the death in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, 2 Corinthians 4:10 speaks of "always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Are there two different kinds of death, or are these the same death?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Answer: The death that takes place in Adam is ugly, but the same death, when it takes place in Christ, is lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Adam died, and Christ also died.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, with one the death was ugly, but with the other the death was lovely.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>With unbelievers, no affliction is good, but with us, the believers, all afflictions are very good.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If persecution befalls us, it is wonderful, but if it befalls an unbelieving relative, it is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All the negative items in verses 8 through 12 are different aspects of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We may call them sufferings, but according to Philippians 3:10, sufferings are a part of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Philippians 3:10 says, "To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The fellowship, the participation, of His sufferings is the participation in His death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To participate in His death is to be conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Every day we are afflicted, perplexed, cast down, and persecuted, and our outward man is decaying, being consumed.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>These are different aspects of Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we are suffering these things, Christ's death is being applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Through this death the life of Christ is manifested.</S>
