   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE THE SIGNS IN JOHN ELEVEN 1 Scripture Reading: John 11:1-44</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This Gospel is also deep and profound in the matter of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The cases in chapters three through eleven give us a full picture of the divine life in its different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>CASES IN CHAPTERS THREE THROUGH SEVEN</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first case, that of Nicodemus, reveals how the natural man, no matter how good he may be, needs regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The last case, that of Lazarus, indicates that we all are dead and in need of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, the first case indicates regeneration, and the last case indicates resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In chapter four we have the case of an immoral Samaritan woman who pretended to be religious and to be a worshipper of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From this case we see that she needed the living water to satisfy the thirst in her human life and also needed the reality with which and by which to render God the kind of worship that satisfies Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all need Christ as the living water and as our reality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For our daily life we need a fountain of living water to satisfy our thirst, and for our worship of God we need Christ as the reality of all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we have Christ as the reality of the offerings, we shall be able to offer God the Father the worship He is seeking.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In chapter five we have the case of the impotent man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Apparently, this is the case of a sick person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But according to the context of this chapter, we see that the Lord Jesus did not regard him as sick He regarded him as dead.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After the Lord enlivened the impotent man, He went on to speak about passing out of death into life: "Truly, truly I say to you, he who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and will not come into judgment, but has passed out of death into life" v. 24 . Then the Lord spoke about two aspects of resurrection, the spiritual aspect and the physical aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In 5:25 we have the Lord's word concerning the spiritual aspect of resurrection: "Truly, truly, I say to you, an hour is coming and now is, when the dead shall hear the voice of the Son of God, and those who hear shall live."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this verse the Lord refers not to those who are dead physically, but refers to those who are dead in spirit, as in Ephesians 2:1 and 5.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, in this verse to live means to be alive in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is not resurrection in the physical body, as mentioned in 5:28 and 29.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In 5:28 and 29 the Lord Jesus says, "An hour is coming in which all who are in the tombs shall hear His voice, and shall come forth: those who have done the good to the resurrection of life, and those who have done the evil to the resurrection of judgment."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who are in the tombs are those who are physically dead and buried in the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Hence, their coming forth from the tomb in verse 29 is the resurrection in the physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord's work today is to resurrect those who are dead in their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All of us were resurrected in spirit at the time of our regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once we were dead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But we heard the Lord's voice, repented, and believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a result, we were regenerated and spiritually resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As we have pointed out, verses 28 and 29 speak of the resurrection of those who are physically dead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>"The resurrection of life" will be the resurrection of believers before the millennium Rev 20:4, 6; 1 Cor 15:23, 52; 1 Thes 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The dead believers will be resurrected to enjoy eternal life at the coming back of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, it is called the resurrection of life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The "resurrection of judgment" refers to the resurrection of the unbelievers after the millennium Rev 20:5, 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All the dead unbelievers will be resurrected after the thousand years to be judged at the great white throne Rev 20:11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, it is called the resurrection of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Chapter five of the Gospel of John is actually a chapter dealing with resurrection in both a spiritual and physical sense.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, in this chapter the emphasis is on the spiritual aspect of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the sight of the life-giving Christ, the impotent man, who had been sick for thirty-eight years, was dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, when the Lord Jesus spoke to him, and he received the Lord's word, he was resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This was an instance of someone passing out of death into life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In chapter six we have the case of a hungry multitude around the Sea of Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fact that the Lord Jesus fed this multitude indicates that He is the true life-feeder.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Jesus said to the people, "Do not work for the food which perishes, but for the food which abides to eternal life, which the Son of Man shall give you" 6:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This food is the Lord Jesus Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He is the bread of life, the living bread, the true bread of God that came down out of heaven vv.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>32, 33, 35, 51 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Because the Lord is the bread of life, He can fill our hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In chapter seven of John's Gospel we have the case of the thirsty ones at the feast of tabernacles.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>At the feast of tabernacles the people enjoyed all that had been gathered in at the time of harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They enjoyed this rich ingathering with God and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, not even that enjoyment could satisfy them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, "on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" 7:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Here we have a word concerning the quenching of our thirst.</S>
