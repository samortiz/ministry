   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TWO</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us turn our attention to Paul s Epistles to the Corinthians, in particular to the manner in which he fulfilled his ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A brother once said that of all the books of the Bible, the Corinthian Epistles, and in particular 1 Corinthians 7, show us the peak of human experience.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is right.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Paul s experience proves this.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Consider the following examples:</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 6 says, But this I say by way of concession, not by way of command.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The phrase this I say clearly indicates that this was Paul s own word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 7 says, Yet I wish all men to be even as I am myself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Such a wish was Paul s own wish.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Verse 6 presents Paul s own word, while verse 7 speaks of his own wish.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He did not say that God commanded such or that God ordained such.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 7 continues, But each has his own gift from God, one in this way, the other in that.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God works in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But it seems as if Paul was giving his own opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was hoping that all would be even as he was.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 8 says, But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I am.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was again Paul s own word.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 10 says, But to the married I charge, not I but the Lord, A wife must not be separated from her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul first said that he charged them, but then he said that it was not him but the Lord who charged them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can only find such expressions in 1 Corinthians 7.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the one hand, Paul charged, and on the other hand, he said that it was not his charge but the Lord s charge.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Verse 12 says, But to the rest I say, I, not the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is Paul s word again.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verses 12 through 24 are all Paul s word; they are not the Lord s word.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How could Paul have dared to say such a word?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How could he have been so bold?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By what authority was he speaking these words?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the following verses he presents the basis for his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Verse 25 says, Now concerning virgins I have no commandment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul did not lie.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He honestly confessed that he did not have a commandment of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But I give my opinion as one who has been shown mercy by the Lord to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here was the opinion of one who had been shown mercy by the Lord, one who was empowered by the Lord to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God had done a profound work in him and had made him a faithful one.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He was able to claim that God s mercy had made him a faithful person, that it had done so much work in him that he was now able to express his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Here we do not find the Lord s commandment.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead, we find Paul s opinion, that is, his view concerning a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the words were Paul s. He told the Corinthians how he felt.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 26 says, I consider then that this is good because of the present necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul said that this was his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verse 28 says, I am trying to spare you.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was again Paul s opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Verse 29 says, But this I say, brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is Paul s word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Verse 32 says, But I desire you to be without care.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is Paul s word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 35 says, But this I say.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is again Paul s word.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Verse 40 says, According to my opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is Paul s opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In verse 17 Paul said, And so I direct in all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He said this not only to the Corinthians but to all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He charged all the churches with the same things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brothers and sisters, how marvelous this is!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is the opposite of our common understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In John 8:28 the Lord said, As My Father has taught Me, I speak these things, and in 12:50 He said, Even as the Father has said to Me, so I speak.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Yet Paul was bold to tell others that his words were his own opinions, views, and even his charge to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is either the loftiest experience or the worst experience.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thank God that this is the loftiest experience.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>No place in the Bible is as high as 1 Corinthians 7.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>After his words in this passage, Paul concluded by saying, I think that I also have the Spirit of God v. 40 . Here we reach the highest peak.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul was clear that he did not have God s commandment; he was clear that he did not have a word from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>His speaking was merely based on the mercy that had been shown to him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He had no other basis.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>His only basis was God s compassion and mercy to him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But after he spoke, he could say that he thought he had the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is the human element which we discussed earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is an outstanding and stark example of man s elements being employed in God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Here was a man who was disciplined, restricted, and broken by the Lord to the extent that he could speak even when he was very clear that the Lord had not said anything.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Yet in the end, his word became the word of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Paul was giving others his own opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Yet in the end his opinion was the opinion of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Paul said that it was his thought and his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Yet in the end it was the intention of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Here was a man under the Lord s Spirit and His operation so much that when he spoke, the Holy Spirit was speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What a great difference this is from the donkey of Balaam!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Balaam s donkey could speak God s word only when the word was put into its mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When God s word was taken away, only the donkey was left.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In contrast, here was a man who had followed the Lord, received mercy from Him, and been faithful for years.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the end his speaking became the Spirit s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Paul made it clear that it was his opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But in the end it was the Lord s opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>God had worked in him to such an extent that he could almost speak God s word without having God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>With many servants of the Lord, God s word can be found in them only when a word is put into their mouth, and when it is not placed in their mouth, they do not have any word.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Yet Paul had reached the stage where he had God s word whether or not it was put into his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Here was a man so trained that he could earn the Lord s trust.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Here was a man so trained and trusted by God that his speaking became God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We cannot do anything about this except to plead for mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Brothers, we cannot be just a donkey.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We cannot be satisfied with God s word just being placed in our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If this is our condition, it means that we ourselves have nothing to do with God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Paul was a man who had much to do with God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Even his own opinions became God s opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The little thoughts that he had became the thoughts of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>He was so one with the Spirit of God!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>His very speaking represented God s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>He indeed reached the highest peak.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>A minister of the word is not merely one who transmits God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He must be a person who has a certain relationship with God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He has God s thoughts and opinions, and he has reached the stage where his desires become God s desires.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He does not act in a certain way because he comes to a separate realization of God s desire in a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Rather, he is restricted by God to such an extent that God trusts his thoughts and ideas.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>God can acknowledge his thoughts and ideas as His own.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>This is what we have been saying for years; it is what we call the constituting work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>God constitutes Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He works and wroughts Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The golden lampstand was made of beaten work Exo 25:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>We must remember that something is given to us by the Lord on the one hand, while God is beating the same thing into us on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>We are like an unshaped piece of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>God is beating us blow by blow until we are formed into the shape of a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The Holy Spirit not only puts the divine word in our mouth but also beats such a word into our being until we are conformed to God s defined shape.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This is not a matter of whether or not we have God s word in our mouth but a matter of whether we have been beaten to the point where God can entrust His word to us.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Paul was constituted by the Lord to such an extent that his opinion was considered trustworthy; the Lord worked in him to such an extent that his thoughts were trustworthy enough to convey God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When God s word is placed in such a man and he is called to be a minister of the word, there is no danger of corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>A minister of the word is a person in whom God can confide His trust and faith.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Ministry of the word means that there is not only the word but the man, the very person who serves as the minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Such a person has been so perfected that God s word will not suffer damage or misunderstanding through him.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>He is a person whom God can use, one who can serve as a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>A minister of the word is one who is so constituted by God that God can entrust him with His very opinions, thoughts, and desires.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>His own human elements can be involved in the speaking; they will not cause any problem to the divine word.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Brothers and sisters, do not think that we are contradicting what we have preached in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>In the past we pointed out that human ingredients are forbidden in God s work.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Why then do we now say that God s word contains human elements?</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>We are not admitting every kind of human element; we are saying that only certain kinds of human elements can be involved in God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Those who have such elements will find God s word flowing out of them freely.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>God can freely trust them.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>We should spend a little more time to consider Paul s word.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>He said that he had obtained mercy to be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Mercy is of God, and the result of mercy is faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>This means that God did some constituting work in Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>He worked in Paul to such an extent that Paul s very being resembled God s word.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Because of this, Paul could release God s word wherever he went.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Paul could say I wish, I say, or I direct in all the churches because he was a person who had met God; he knew God.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>When he spoke his word, it was God s word that came out.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>We have to remember that God s word is not released in a supernatural way; it is released through man and with human elements.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>If the person is not right, God s word cannot be released, and such a person cannot be a minister of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>Never think that a man can preach a message just by memorizing it.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>God s word has to make a turn within man before it can be released.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>If you are not the proper person, God s word will be damaged as soon as it goes through you.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>As soon as man s frivolity and carnality come in, God s word is defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>A man must reach the point where God s constituting work is well formed in him.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Then the Lord s word can pass through him without suffering loss on account of his person.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>In 1 Corinthians 7 God s word did not suffer any loss in Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Here was a man who was mature.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>If he spoke according to his own opinion, we are assured that this opinion was right.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>If he said something, we have the confidence that what he said was right.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>When he directed all the churches to do certain things, we have the assurance that this direction was right.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Here was a man who was directing others, yet God s word was coming through him; he was not acting independently.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>Here was a man whom God could trust.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>He had reached the pinnacle.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>A minister of the word must attain such a height before God s word can be released through him.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>The measure of discipline and restriction one receives from the Lord determines the degree of purity of God s word that is released through him.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>The degree of brokenness before the Lord determines the degree of purity of one s speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>The less one receives and learns from the Lord, the more likely God s word is defiled and contaminated when it is released through him.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>The more restriction, discipline, blows, and breakings one receives, the purer God s word is when it is released through him.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>The ministry of the word is based on the ministry a person possesses before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>If our ministry before the Lord is a failure, our speaking is a failure as well.</S>
