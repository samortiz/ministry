   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>and His Wonderful Teaching</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first God-man, after reproaching the surrounding cities for not being willing to receive His teaching and repent Matt 11:20-24 , prayed to the Father, and based upon His prayer, He gave a wonderful teaching to His disciples vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>25-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Most of the time, we cannot pray after reproaching people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If a father cannot pray after reproaching his children, his reproaching was not divine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if we can still pray after reproaching someone, our reproaching was divine.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His Surpassing Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord s surpassing prayer to the Father is as follows: I extol You, Father, Lord of heaven and of earth, because You have hidden these things from the wise and intelligent and have revealed them to infants.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yes, Father, for thus it has been well-pleasing in Your sight vv.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord s prayer was actually His answering the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That indicates that while He was reproaching, He was fellowshipping with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When a father reproaches his children, he should remain in fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Extolling the Father</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In His prayer the Lord extolled the Father, acknowledging the Father as Lord of heaven and of earth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To extol is to praise with acknowledgment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Mostly we give praise to the Lord without any acknowledgment, but the Lord praised the Father by acknowledging that the Father is the Lord of heaven and earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should learn to praise by acknowledging the Father in His economy, His will, and His doing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When God s people were defeated by His enemy, God was called the God of heaven Ezra 5:12; Dan 2:18, 37 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But because Abraham was a man on the earth standing for God, he called God the possessor of heaven and earth Gen 14:19, 22 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord as the Son of Man called the Father Lord of heaven and of earth, indicating that the Lord was standing on the earth for God s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His Father could be the Lord of the earth through Him and through His disciples.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>for Revealing These Things to Infants</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord praised the Father that He has hidden all the things mentioned in Matthew 11:27 from the wise and intelligent and has revealed them to infants.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The wise and intelligent refers to all the peoples in the cities who rejected the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They were humanly and devilishly wise and intelligent like today s worldly, intellectual people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord hides the divine things from them and reveals them to the disciples, who are the infants.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>d.</S>

   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord s prayer is surpassing, and His teaching is unveiling vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>27-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As the infants, we are unveiled, because the Lord has taken away all the veils from us.</S>

   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the Father had not given us to the Lord Jesus, we would not be in the church life today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To get us away from our worldly pursuits was not an easy thing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are in the Lord s recovery because the Father has given us to the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Our being here is not of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Knowing the Son and the Father Requiring Revelation</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>No one fully knows the Son except the Father; neither does anyone fully know the Father except the Son and him to whom the Son wills to reveal Him Matt 11:27 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Concerning the Son, only the Father has such knowledge, and concerning the Father, only the Son and he to whom the Son reveals Him have such knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, to know the Son requires that the Father reveal Him 16:17 , and to know the Father requires that the Son reveal Him John 17:6, 26 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Paul aspired in Philippians 3:10 to know Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To know Christ is the preeminent thing.</S>

   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Charging the Disciples to Take His Yoke upon Them</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>and Learn from Him</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord charged the disciples to take His yoke upon them and learn from Him because He is meek and lowly in heart and they would find rest for their souls v. 29 . To be meek means not to resist opposition, and to be lowly means not to have self-esteem.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The rest from the Lord is for our souls; it is an inward rest, not something merely outward in nature.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The harassment and the troubles are in our soul.</S>

   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Greek word for easy means fit for use ; hence, good, kind, mild, gentle, easy, pleasant in contrast to hard, harsh, sharp, bitter.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The yoke of God s economy is like this.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Everything in God s economy is not a heavy burden but an enjoyment.</S>
