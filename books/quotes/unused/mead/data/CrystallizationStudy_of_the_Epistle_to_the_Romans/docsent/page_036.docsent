   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>X. Faith Being the First Issue</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>of the Lord s Superabounding Grace</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First Timothy 1:14 says, And the grace of our Lord superabounded with faith and love in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Faith is the first issue of the Lord s superabounding grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Now we need to see what this grace is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Superabounding Grace of the Lord Being</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>the Processed and Consummated Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>to Be within Us Our Enjoyment of the Divine</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Unsearchable Riches in Christ</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to use a number of adjectives to describe grace.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This grace is not only super but also abounding.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Grace is superabounding.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Romans 5:17 speaks of receiving the abundance of grace, and verse 21 speaks of grace reigning.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John 1:14 says that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then verses 16 and 17 say, For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For the law was given through Moses; grace...came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This superabounding grace is not some thing or matter but the Triune God Himself, the processed and consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Triune God s being processed and consummated is in the divine revelation of the Scriptures, but it is not in the theology of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God today is no more raw.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God has been processed and consummated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To be processed means He has gone through, step by step, one process after another.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His being consummated implies His attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After all the processes, He has been consummated, that is, He has attained to His completion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Before the Triune God was incarnated, He was only God, without humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But just about two thousand years ago, God became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Two thousand years in God s eyes is like two days 2 Pet 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Just about two days ago, the Triune God suddenly came into the womb of a virgin, and eventually God was born of her to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This indicates strongly that our Triune God has been processed to become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Furthermore, He passed through a long process of human living for thirty-three and a half years on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What a wonder that God lived on this earth!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He lived most of His life in the small town of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I went there twice purposely to see where God lived, to see the streets where God walked.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When I walked through Nazareth, I said, Lord, You are a Nazarene; I am too.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I follow You.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was part of the process through which the Lord passed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He also passed through an all-inclusive death and an all-surpassing resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This processed Triune God is now within us to be the enjoyment in us of the divine unsearchable riches in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul said he was a minister to minister the unsearchable riches of Christ to people Eph 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These unsearchable riches today are the riches of the processed, consummated Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Enjoyment of the Lord s</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Superabounding Grace Issues in</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All the Matters Related to the Divine Life</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we enjoy the processed and consummated Triune God, this enjoyment issues in something.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Even today, when you enjoy food, this enjoyment issues in something.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Every day we eat three meals.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After eating, we are full of strength, and this is the issue of our eating.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The enjoyment of the Lord s superabounding grace issues in all the matters related to the divine life Rom 5:17, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It even issues in the kingship, so that we can be made kings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The overcomers will be in the thousand-year kingdom to be co-kings with Christ Rev 20:4, 6 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today we also are kings.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The brothers are the real kings and the sisters are the real queens.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can say this based upon Romans 5:17 and 21.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These verses tell us that those who receive the abundance of grace will reign in life and that grace can reign.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our being kings and queens is the superabounding, top issue of the enjoyment of the superabounding grace.</S>
