It is by faith, and genuine, living faith always includes repentance. Faith without repentance is full of problems. A living faith always includes repentance. The Bible says, &#8220;Repent and believe&#8221; (Mark 1:15). Repentance and faith fit the requirements for the work of the Holy Spirit. The unique way for the Holy Spirit to work in us is through repentance and faith. There is no other way. Whenever and wherever a person repents before God and believes in the Lord Jesus, immediately the Holy Spirit comes into him. This is a principle, a law. The way for radio waves in the air to enter a radio is to tune it properly. When we tune it to the right station, the radio waves operate according to a principle. In the same way, the principle of the work of the Spirit is for us to &#8220;tune to the station&#8221; of repentance and faith.<p>Every morning, every day, and every evening we need to repent and believe. We should pray, &#8220;Lord, forgive me. I admit that I am still sinful in so many things. I abhor myself, and I repent before You. Lord, I open myself to You, and I put my trust in You. I believe You!&#8221; By doing this, we tune ourselves properly and pick up the heavenly &#8220;radio waves&#8221;; that is, in our experience we receive the Holy Spirit. Now the Spirit is in us, and we are in the Spirit. In this way, whatever has been accomplished in Christ and by Christ is ours. Christ&#8217;s history becomes our experience in the Spirit.<p>The wonderful, all-inclusive Spirit comes into us through our repentance and faith. Without exception, whether a person is low or high, young or old, weak or strong, foolish or clever, uneducated or educated, evil or good, as long as he repents and believes in the Lord Jesus, the Spirit as the spiritual, heavenly &#8220;radio waves&#8221; comes into him. This wonderful Spirit transmits all that Christ is, all that Christ has done, and all that God has accomplished in Christ into us. Then we are in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in us. We are made alive, raised up, and seated with Christ in the Spirit. Without the Spirit as the transmission we cannot be one with Christ; He will be separated from us by space and time. But in the Holy Spirit as the transmission we are one with Christ regardless of space or time. In this way, the church is produced by the resurrection and ascension of Christ applied to us by the Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE DAILY WALK OF THE MEMBERS OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><h2 class=head2>In the Spirit and in the Body</h2><p>The sixth main point in Ephesians is the daily walk of the members of Christ&#8217;s Body on this earth. After we become members of the Body of Christ, we should have a daily walk in the Spirit and in the Body. This is a basic teaching of this book.<p>The first three chapters of Ephesians are a revelation of the life, nature, and position of the church, while the last three chapters deal with the walk of the church. The first item of the walk of the church is to keep the oneness of the Body. This is to realize the Body life. To realize the Body life is first of all to keep the oneness of the Body. Whether we are an apostle or a small brother or sister, we are the members of the Body and for the Body. Therefore, we must keep the oneness of the Body and live in the Body.<p>For many years after I was saved, no one told me about the oneness of the Body. I received many teachings concerning Christian ethics and human ethics with Christian terminology. At that time I was bothered. I asked myself what the difference is between the ethics taught by Confucius and the things taught in the Scriptures. In my upbringing I had studied Confucius, and I was familiar with his teaching of ethics. I considered that those ethics were so good that there was no need for me to be taught by the Scriptures. At that time I did not know the difference. Gradually, the Lord showed me that the teachings of the Scriptures are absolutely different. The Christian walk on this earth is not a matter of ethics. It is a matter of living as a member of the Body of Christ.<p>We must realize that we are members and that we need to live in the Body. We should never be independent; we should never be separated from the Body. We should always live, walk, and work in the church, the Body of Christ. We must walk in the Spirit and in the Body, and we must put on the new man (4:24). To put on the new man is simply to live in the Body. This includes our functioning as members in the Body.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> </body></html>
