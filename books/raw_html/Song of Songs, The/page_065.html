<p>The maiden brings up those whom she has always cared for and who are younger than she is; she brings them up before the Lord to discuss them with Him. Because she is living so much in the Lord’s will, she can say, “We have….” She knows that her concern is the Lord’s concern. Therefore, she says, “We.” She knows that what she wants is also what the Lord wants. Therefore, she says, “We.” The union is complete; there is no more separation. Hence, prayers are no longer requests, but a speaking forth of God’s will.</p><p>Verse 9 says, “If she be a wall, we will build upon her a palace of silver: and if she be a door, we will inclose her with boards of cedar.” “If she be a wall.” If there is anything that is of God, which causes her to build a separation between herself and that which is not of God, like a wall, then “we will build upon her a palace of silver.” We will build upon her everything that is high and noble that comes from redemption. If she has established a life of separation through the Holy Spirit, we will build upon her the fruit of redemption. If she is a door, others will enter into God’s knowledge through her. “We will inclose her with boards of cedar.” We will add Christ’s heavenly humanity to her. (Wood signifies humanity, whereas cedar is tall. Hence cedar wood signifies Christ’s heavenly humanity, His glorified humanity, and His heavenly human life.) She no longer does the things that she wants to do; she does them together with the Lord. Although the words are out of her mouth, they represent the Lord’s mind.</p><p>Verse 10 says, “I am a wall, and my breasts like towers: then was I in his eyes as one that found favor.” “I am a wall.” I am already a separated person; the Lord has separated me from everything unclean, common, and ordinary. “My breasts like towers.” My faith and love are based on my separation from the world. The Lord has established me, and my two breasts are no longer undeveloped; they are like towers. I have come to the point where I am a person who has obtained peace in His eyes (“found favor” can be translated “found peace”). This means that I can be at rest. Hence, a life of peace is based on a life of separation, which is based on the development of faith and love. She gives a short testimony and shows that there is no thought of self-contentment. She can say that she is a wall, and she can say that her two breasts are towers, but in the Lord’s eyes, she considers ­herself as one who has obtained peace.</p><p>Verse 11 says, “Solomon had a vineyard at Baal-hamon; he let out the vineyard unto keepers; every one for the fruit thereof was to bring a thousand pieces of silver.” Before the believers are raptured, the Holy Spirit wants them to pay attention to one thing&#151;the reward of the work. Solomon has his vineyards; they are his fields, and he leases them out to the keepers. The Lord’s work is not ours; our position is ­forever that of a steward. We are merely keeping watch over His business. When He comes, what He entrusted to us will return to Him.</p><p>“Baalhamon” means “the lord of all.” This shows us that the Lord, like Solomon, is the lord of everything; He is also our Lord. Solomon’s charge was that the keepers would have the fruits; but for the fruits that they harvested, they would have to give Solomon a thousand pieces of silver. The Lord will also give us the fruit of what we keep, tend, and raise for Him today; that will be our reward. Nothing that we do for the Lord is in vain. Even a cup of water that we give away will be rewarded.</p>
