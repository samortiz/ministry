        <h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND EXPERIENCING THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The experience of the Spirit is the life pulse of our spiritual experience; it has an exceedingly important place in our spiritual experience. In the last chapter we saw that the cross enables man to experience the Spirit. Based on the accomplishments of the cross, the Spirit descended (Matt. 3:16; John 7:38-39; Luke 24:26). Based on the accomplishments of the cross, the Spirit regenerates man and enters into man as the indwelling Spirit of life (1 Pet. 1:3; John 20:22). Based on the accomplishments of the cross, the Spirit also fills us within with the divine life and fills us without with spiritual power. We must pass through the cross in order to receive the Spirit as the Spirit of life and as the Spirit of power, and we must also pass through the cross to be filled inwardly with His life and filled outwardly with His power.</p>
<p>We must pass through the cross in order to be born of the Spirit, to live by the Spirit, to walk by the Spirit, and to work by the Spirit. We must pass through the cross to experience the Spirit. The only way to experience the Spirit is through the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND FAITH</h2>
<p>Faith is very important in our spiritual experiences. Genuine faith is not from us. Genuine faith is the faith of the Son of God worked into us by the Spirit, and this faith comes through the cross. Because the Spirit deals with our flesh, puts our self to death, and breaks our natural life through the cross, He can work the faith of the Son of God into us so that we live by His faith, not by our flesh, self, or natural life. In Galatians 2:20 Paul says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me,&rdquo; and he also says, &ldquo;The life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God.&rdquo; Paul had been crucified with Christ, and it was no longer he who lived. It was Christ who lived in him. Thus, he could have the faith of the Son of God and live by His faith. Christ lived in Paul, and Paul had the faith of Christ because he was crucified with Christ on the cross. Thus, Paul no longer lived by himself, nor could he live himself; instead, he lived by Christ, and he lived Christ. Paul lived by the faith of Christ.</p>
<p>Galatians 2:20 shows that we obtain the faith of Christ that enables us to live before God when our self is put to death by the cross and Christ lives in us. In order to have the faith that is out of the Son of God, our self must experience the breaking and crucifixion of the cross. Faith comes through the cross of Christ and depends on the cross of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND PRAYER</h2>
<p>Prayer is another crucial matter in our spiritual experience. Prayer is not asking God for things related to ourselves according to our will; rather, it is asking God for things related to His will (Matt. 26:39-42). In a deeper sense, prayer is not our asking God for things but God asking in us and through us. To pray is to fellowship with God in spirit. When we pray, we must contact God in spirit (John 4:24). We can enter into such prayer after we experience the dealing and breaking of the cross (Heb. 10:19-20).</p>
<p>A person whose flesh has been dealt with and whose self has been broken by the cross will not pray according to his own will, asking God for things for himself. Instead, he will pray according to God&rsquo;s will, asking God for matters that concern God. For such a person, prayer is not a matter of asking God for things but of God asking in him and through him. Only a person in whom the veil of the flesh has been split can pray in spirit. To such a person, prayer involves fellowshipping with God, contacting God. Genuine, spiritual, and valuable prayer comes through the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CROSS AND SPIRITUAL REVELATION</h2>
<p>Spiritual revelation is related to spiritual experience. Spiritual revelation is the base for spiritual experience. Spiritual experience often comes through spiritual revelation, and spiritual revelation is often gained through spiritual experience. Our spiritual experience often depends on the spiritual revelation that we have, and our spiritual revelation often depends on our spiritual experience. Hence, both spiritual experience and spiritual revelation are the cause and the effect of the other. In order to have spiritual experience, we must have spiritual revelation, and in order to have spiritual revelation, we must also have spiritual experience. Because spiritual experience comes through the cross, the spiritual revelation gained through experience must also come through the cross.</p>
<p>Speaking to the Corinthians, Paul said, &ldquo;I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified...My speech and my proclamation were not in persuasive words of wisdom but in demonstration of the Spirit and of power&rdquo; (1 Cor. 2:2, 4). Paul knew only Christ, and this One crucified. Paul&rsquo;s proclamation was not in human words of wisdom; his instruction was by the Spirit. This is the receiving of spiritual revelation. Our own wisdom is the greatest hindrance to obtaining spiritual revelation. Just as our self and our flesh hinder us from being spiritual, our wisdom and cleverness hinder us from obtaining spiritual revelation. We must let the cross of Christ deal with our wisdom and cleverness; otherwise, we will not obtain spiritual revelation.</p>
<p>In order for a person to receive spiritual revelation, he must let the cross deal with his wisdom and cleverness, for only such a person can receive spiritual revelation. Our wisdom and cleverness must be dealt with and broken by the cross in order for us to receive spiritual revelation. May our wisdom and cleverness pass through the death of the cross so that we can receive spiritual revelation. The more the cross breaks our wisdom and cleverness, the easier it will be for us to receive spiritual revelation. Spiritual revelation is always received when the cross breaks our wisdom and cleverness.</p>
<p>Revelation is a spiritual matter. In verses 14 and 15 the apostle says, &ldquo;A soulish man does not receive the things of the Spirit of God...and he is not able to know them because they are discerned spiritually. But the spiritual man discerns all things.&rdquo; A soulish man is a natural person; he lives mainly in his soul and by his mind. Such a person cannot perceive spiritual things and cannot receive spiritual revelation. A spiritual man lives by his spirit and in the spirit; he does not live by his soul. Only such a person can discern spiritual things and receive spiritual revelation. In order to be such a person, we must let the cross deal with the wisdom and cleverness of our natural mind. Letting the cross deal with our soul enables us to live not by the soul but by the spirit and to not be soulish but to be spiritual. We perceive spiritual things and receive spiritual revelation only when the cross deals with our soul.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
