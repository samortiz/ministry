as the Word and as the Spirit</h2>
<p>If we desire to know God and experience Him as our life, we must experience Him as both the Word and the Spirit, because today He is in His words and also in the Spirit. Touching God and contacting God is not something that should be abstract to us. Rather, it is something that can be genuine and real if we calm down our outer man, rein in our mind, and exercise our spirit to read and contact the Lord in the Word. Then His Word will become the Spirit operating in us. In this way we will contact God in our spirit.</p>
<p>This is a marvelous and mysterious matter. The Triune God is in His words and in the Spirit, and the Spirit and the Word are connected. If we had only the Spirit, God would be beyond our comprehension, but because His Word is connected to the Spirit, God can become very real to us. Contacting God is not a matter of religious practice. Religious regulations can only tell people what to do, but God&rsquo;s salvation involves His entrance into us to be our life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">God Entering into Us to Be Our Life<br />
through the Word and the Spirit</h2>
<p>God can be our life because, as the Word, He became flesh, and then through death and resurrection, the Word, who became flesh, became the life-giving Spirit. As the Spirit, God enters into all those who believe into Christ. Incarnation brought God into man; death and resurrection brought man into God. In this way God accomplished a mingling and union of God and man and man and God so that He could enter into man as the Spirit to be man&rsquo;s life. The Spirit contains many elements, including divinity, humanity, death, resurrection, the mingling of humanity and divinity, and the heavenly element. These elements are in the Spirit.</p>
<p>However, even though God is the Spirit with all these elements, He can still be abstract to us. Therefore, sympathizing with our weakness and according to the extent of our capacity to understand, He also gave us the Bible. This Bible contains God&rsquo;s words, God&rsquo;s breathing. God is Spirit, but the Spirit has been connected with the words in the Bible. Hence, we can say that the words in the Bible are the embodiment of the Spirit. The life in the Word is the Spirit, and the embodiment of the Spirit is the Word. Thank God that He comes to us not only as the Spirit but also in His Word. He not only gives us the Spirit but also His Word. This is great grace to us! When we contact His Word, the Spirit enters into us.</p>
<p>When our condition is normal, every time we read the Bible, we will contact His words outwardly but receive the Spirit inwardly. Whenever we receive His Word, we also receive the Spirit. The result of receiving God as the Spirit is to receive life. If we contact God, experience God, and receive God as Spirit through the Word, we will experience Him as our life.</p>
<p>I hope that we will learn to use the Bible outside of us and to contact the Spirit within us. We are truly rich! We have the Spirit in us, and we also have the Bible in our hand. The riches in these two items are inexhaustible! For two thousand years no one has exhausted these riches; the more a person touches them, the richer they become. I have been touching them for thirty-five years, and I can testify that the more I touch them, the richer they become. The riches that we have received cannot be exhausted in our experience. We do not possess silver and gold (Acts 3:6), but we have something much more valuable; we have the Word and the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Doing All Things according to<br />
the Word and the Spirit</h2>
<p>Now that we have the Word and the Spirit, we should conduct ourselves in our daily living according to the Word and the Spirit. We should not go against either the Word or the Spirit. Christ has released us and set us free, but we should not go beyond the Word and the Spirit. Whenever we are not in agreement with either the Word or the Spirit, we should always allow the Word and the Spirit to win. We must let ourselves be defeated. We should be submissive and allow the Word and the Spirit to touch us. We must learn to continually match the Word and the Spirit in our being. It is better to be defeated and suffer a loss, even if it involves sorrow, than to offend the Word or the Spirit. If this is our attitude, we will be able to touch the Lord&rsquo;s words and receive the Spirit every day, and we will have a practical experience of God as life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_037.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
