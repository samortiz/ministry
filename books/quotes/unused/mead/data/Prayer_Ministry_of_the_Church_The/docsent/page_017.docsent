   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE IMPORTANCE OF FORGIVING OTHERS' OFFENSES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the Lord finished His teaching on prayer, He went on to say, "For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also; but if you do not forgive men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is the Lord's interpretation of verse 12, which says, "Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is easy for Christians to fail in the matter of forgiving others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If any unforgivingness exists among God's children, all lessons, faith, and power will leak away.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is why the Lord is so strong and clear.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is a simple word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Yet God's children need this simple word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>"For if you forgive men their offenses, your heavenly Father will forgive you also."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is so simple for us to receive the Father's forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, "if you do not forgive men their offenses, neither will your Father forgive your offenses."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no such thing as careless forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This word is simple, but the fact is not that simple.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we forgive others with our mouth but do not forgive in our heart, it is not considered as forgiveness in the Father's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Forgiveness which is in the mouth only is vain and deceitful and does not count before the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must forgive others' offenses from the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Just as the disciples needed this word of the Lord, we also need the same word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If Christians are irreconcilable and if they do not forgive others from their heart, the church will run into problems.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have no intention of behaving like the church and if we want to each take our own way as soon as we disagree with a single word, we do not need to forgive one another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But the Lord knows how crucial this matter is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, He reemphasized it at the end of the prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Lord knows that the more we communicate and fellowship with one another, the more we need to forgive one another.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He knows how crucial this matter is.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, He had to turn our attention to it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we do not forgive one another, it will be easy for us to give place to the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we cannot forgive one another, we are not people of the kingdom, and we cannot do the work of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No one who is unforgiving can be in the work of the kingdom, and no one who is unforgiving can be a person in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whenever we develop a problem with the brothers and sisters, we develop a problem with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We cannot pray to the Lord on the one hand and remain unforgiving on the other hand.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Brothers and sisters, this is not an insignificant thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must pay attention to what the Lord pays attention to.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must forgive others their offenses.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Finally, we should note how much the Lord cares for the matter of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There are only four verses that speak about almsgiving.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In speaking about fasting, there are only three verses.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But concerning prayer, He speaks in an emphatic way because prayer has to do with God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Prayer is the most important work of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord shows us that there is reward for prayer because prayer is too great an issue; it is too great a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who are faithful to this work of prayer will receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who continue with this work in secret and who pay attention to this work will not be without reward.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May God raise up those who would pray for God's work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, the prayer that the Lord taught always mentions "we" and "us."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is the form of address used by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is a prayer that is filled with a sense of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is a tremendous prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do not know how many saints there are on earth who can pray this prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Brothers and sisters, may we consecrate ourselves afresh for this great prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Countless saints throughout the ages have become a part of this great prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May the Lord be merciful to us that we also may have a share in this great prayer.</S>
