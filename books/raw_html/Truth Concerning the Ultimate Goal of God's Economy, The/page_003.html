 <h1 class="title">A CONCLUDING WORD</h1>
<p>We can see from the above excerpts how crucial this revelation is. The contents of God&rsquo;s economy involve both the Triune God being processed and consummated and His chosen and redeemed people being processed and consummated. First, the Triune God was processed by becoming a man (John 1:14) to pass through human living, an all-inclusive death, and an all-surpassing resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45b). This life-giving Spirit is the consummation of the processed Triune God. Then when this wonderful Spirit enters into God&rsquo;s chosen and redeemed people, they begin to pass through a wonderful process of becoming God in life and nature but not in the Godhead. This process begins with regeneration and continues with sanctification, renewing, transformation, conformation, and glorification until they are consummated to be the bride of Christ. Thus, at the end of the Bible there is a marvelous couple. The Spirit as the consummation of the processed Triune God marries the bride as the consummation of the transformed, tripartite church (Rev. 22:17a). This is the ultimate consummation of God becoming a man that man might become God in life and nature but not in the Godhead, so that God and man can be an eternal couple, a pair of lovers of the same kind, mingled together as one entity for eternity for the full expression of the Triune God in this universe.</p>
<p>We do not become God in His Godhead to become an object of worship. Only our wonderful Triune God embodied in Christ is worthy of worship. Only He is the Head of the Body and the Lord of all. But the marvelous thing is that through regeneration we have received God&rsquo;s life and nature to become the children of God, the sons of God. In eternity past we were chosen to be holy by being predestinated unto sonship (Eph. 1:4-5). Now through the process of being sanctified, we are being &ldquo;sonized,&rdquo; that is, we are being made God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead. We aspire to walk according to the spirit to live Christ as we look forward to the day when He is manifested and we shall be fully like Him in life, nature, and appearance but not in His Godhead. Thank the Lord for this high peak of the divine revelation!</p>

<h1 class="title">THE HEART OF J. S.&rsquo;S ACCUSATIONS<br />
AND THE CRUX OF BROTHER LEE&rsquo;S TEACHING</h1>
<p>J. S.&rsquo;s article, entitled &ldquo;The Worst Blasphemous Words of Witness Lee against God,&rdquo; is a condemnation of Brother Lee in three parts. The first part is a rather poorly executed translation of a message Brother Lee gave in Chinese during the 1994 Chinese New Year&rsquo;s Conference in Anaheim, California. The second part is a translation of a passage from a book by Brother Lee, which includes a hymn that he wrote. Both translations were done in such a way as to make Brother Lee say what he did not mean and to provide &ldquo;evidence&rdquo; for J. S.&rsquo;s accusation that Brother Lee is heretical. The third part is the &ldquo;meat&rdquo; of J. S.&rsquo;s accusation. In it he attempts to prove scripturally that any form of the teaching that man may become God is heretical. The basis of his proof is his interpretation of Psalm 82:6 and John 10:34. He further gives a few verses to show that men should not be worshipped as God and that any who seek such worship are persons of the worst sort. Again, the presentation is such that Brother Lee is accused of saying things that he never said.</p>
<p>The heart of J. S.&rsquo;s false accusations is his repeated suggestion that Brother Lee teaches that the believers can become God in the sense of having the Godhead and also in the sense of being an object of worship. As the previous section makes clear, the crux of Brother Lee&rsquo;s teaching concerning this matter is that, for the carrying out of the divine economy, God desires that the believers in Christ become God in life and in nature but never in the Godhead and never as an object of worship. In this section we will deal with the heart of J. S.&rsquo;s false accusations in contrast to the crux of Brother Lee&rsquo;s teaching. We will first examine J. S.&rsquo;s spurious accusations, showing how he uses excerpts of Brother Lee&rsquo;s ministry to misrepresent him and quotations from the Bible to attack him and even to categorize him with heretics, false apostles, Antichrist, and Satan. Then we will comment on other significant matters related to J. S.&rsquo;s apparent refusal to accept the revelation in the Scriptures regarding man becoming God in life and in nature but not in the Godhead.</p>
