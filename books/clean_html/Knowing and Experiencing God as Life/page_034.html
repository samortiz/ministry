<h2 class="head1">THERE BEING NO REALITY OF THE CHURCH<br />
WITHOUT GOD AS OUR LIFE</h2>
<p>The Lord cannot make His home in us if we continue to live by ourselves and in ourselves. When we are occupied with ourselves, He does not have the ground to make home in us. As a result, we remain independent. In such a situation there is the church in name but not the church in reality. In other words, we will not have the reality of the church.</p>
<p>In order to have the reality of the church, every believer needs to live in Christ and let Christ make home in him in order to be delivered from the self. Then instead of despising, belittling, criticizing, or attacking one another, they will be in harmony. Furthermore, oneness will spontaneously be expressed among them, and all the saints will be one in God. If this is our situation, we will have the reality of the church, which is the built-up church. We will be a group of people who let Christ possess us and make home in us, and we will be living stones built together into God&rsquo;s habitation.</p>
<p>The building begins when our inner being becomes God&rsquo;s habitation, that is, when He can make His home in us. If God cannot make home in us, the building up of the church is not among us. At best, we are stones that have not been built into a spiritual house. If God has not made His home in us, we cannot have a part in the church as His practical habitation.</p>
<p>However, we should not say that a believer who does not let God make home in him is not in the church. Once a person is saved, he is in the church. However, practically speaking, the church is God&rsquo;s habitation, His spiritual temple and home, His dwelling place (1 Tim. 3:15). If we do not let Christ make home in us, we will not have the reality of the church. We should consider our situation. Can God make His home in us? Does He have ground in us? Does He occupy us? Are we practically in the church if we are full of criticism, judgment, despising, or disregard for the church? And are we practically in the church if we are dissatisfied, always complaining, and not in harmony with other believers? If this is our situation, we have not been built up into a house. Although we belong to the church, we have not been built into the church; we are detached from the church.</p>
<p>In order for the reality of the church to be expressed, there must be a situation where the saints genuinely learn in their practical living and in all things to deny themselves and to not live by themselves but to let God live in them and occupy them. Then they will be the reality of the church. Their inner being will be God&rsquo;s habitation; He will make home in them, and they will be filled unto all the fullness of God (Eph. 3:17a, 19b). Such a group of people will be in harmony and in one accord, and they will be in oneness, which is God Himself. They will be built up by the Lord, and they will be the church. When they come together, they will be the reality of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GROWING IN LIFE<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>If we do not grow in life, that is, learn to take God as life, there will not be a way for us to be built up. Some saints have remained in the same condition for twenty years. Their disposition and temperament have not been broken, and they do not know what it is to live in God or to take God as life. For this reason, they have not grown, the measure of the stature of Christ has not increased in them, and they cannot be built up.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 3:9 says, &ldquo;You are God&rsquo;s cultivated land, God&rsquo;s building.&rdquo; This indicates that, on one hand, we are God&rsquo;s building, and on the other hand, we are His cultivated land. The expression <em>cultivated land</em> in the original language refers to a farm for growing crops or produce. Just as a house needs to be built, crops need to grow. We must grow in order to be built up. In other words, if we do not grow in life, the church cannot be built up.</p>
<p>When we grow in the divine life, we decrease and Christ increases (John 3:30); that is, we become less and Christ becomes more. We are delivered from ourselves, and Christ gains more ground to live in us. This is the meaning of growing. If we would daily grow in such a way, the church will be built up practically and daily. Then God will have a dwelling place, which is His home. When God&rsquo;s children come to this place, they will say, &ldquo;This is where we should be. We have come home because here we have the object of our longing. We were thirsty, but now we have living water. We were hungry, but now we have food. We were homeless, wandering about, but here we have rest.&rdquo; This is the situation in the church, the house of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>The church is not only a spiritual temple, a spiritual house; it is also a priesthood (1 Pet. 2:5). In the Old Testament the priests were a group of people, and God&rsquo;s habitation was the tabernacle and later the temple. The priests and God&rsquo;s habitation were separate. In the New Testament, however, God&rsquo;s dwelling place is His priests; the priests are His dwelling place. The two&mdash;the priests and the habitation&mdash;have become one. However, the New Testament priests are not scattered individuals; they are a corporate entity. The priests have been built up into a corporate entity that serves God together.</p>
<p>The genuine service rendered to God is not individualistic. Rather, it is a coordinated service by those who are joined together, one, and corporate. Such oneness, such joining together, is not arranged or organized by man. Genuine service involves learning not to live in ourselves but to let Christ be our life and to let Him occupy us and make His home in us so that we may be built up as a spiritual dwelling place. This is the way to become the priesthood. We are God&rsquo;s habitation for His dwelling place, and we are a priesthood for our service to God. The priesthood is a body of priests who are coordinated together and who serve God. This coordination is living and in life; it is full of the measure of life and the element of life. Such a service supplies others with the fullness of life.</p>
<p>The issue of God being life in us is that we are built up to become the habitation of God. Such a habitation is a spiritual temple and also a priesthood. This is where God can make His home, and it is where He is served. On one hand, we express God; on the other hand, we serve Him. This is the glorious result of taking God as life.</p>
