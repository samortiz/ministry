   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>All Three Being God and Being Eternal</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The modalistic doctrine that the Father, Son, and Spirit do not co-exist equally from eternity to eternity but are merely three temporary manifestations of the one Person of God is easily disproved from the clear statements of the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible reveals that all Three the Father, Son, and Spirit are God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>That the Father is God is shown by Ephesians 1:17, which speaks of God being the Father of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That the Son is God is proved by Hebrews 1:8 where the Son is addressed as God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That the Spirit is God is proved by Acts 5:3-4 which says that Ananias, in lying to the Holy Spirit, actually lied to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While the modalists claim that the Father, Son, and Spirit are not eternal, the Bible says that They are.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Isaiah 9:6 shows that the Father is eternal, Hebrews 1:12 and 7:3 reveal that the Son is eternal, and Hebrews 9:14 proves that the Spirit is eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, any claim that the three Persons of the Godhead are not eternal is a denial of the clear revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Simultaneous Existence of the Father, Son, and Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to modalism, the Father, Son, and Spirit cannot exist simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But what does the Bible say?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Matthew 3:16-17, when Jesus, the Son, was baptized, the Spirit of God descended upon Him and the Father in heaven declared, "This is My Son, the Beloved, in whom I have found My delight."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As this passage indicates, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit exist at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, the modalistic claim that They do not is false.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The simultaneous existence of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is also proved by John 14:16-17, where the Lord says that He, the Son, will pray the Father, who will give us another Comforter, the Spirit of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once again, the Father, Son, and Spirit, all of whom are God and are eternal, exist at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The same is also clearly revealed in Ephesians 3:16-17, where Paul prays that the Father will strengthen us through His Spirit that Christ may make His home in our hearts; in 1 Corinthians 12:4-6, which speaks of "the same Spirit," "the same Lord," and "the same God"; in 2 Corinthians 13:14, where we read that the grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit all Three are with us at the same time; and in Revelation 1:4-5, where grace and peace come simultaneously from God, the Spirit, and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, all these Scriptures expose the error of modalism.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all God, are all eternal, and all exist at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>John 1:2 says that the Word, Christ, was "in the beginning with God."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From eternity past, the Word was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not, as supposed by some, that Christ was not with God and was not God from eternity past, and that at a certain time Christ became God and was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No, Christ always was God and always was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His deity is eternal and absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>75 This disproves both the teaching of Arius that Christ is less than God and the teaching of Sabellius that Christ is not eternally co-existent with God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Three Being One</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>All fundamental Christians agree that God is uniquely one and that He is eternally the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They emphasize the aspect of God's being one-in-three, but they often neglect the aspect of His being three-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, this also is clearly revealed in the pure Word of God and must be faithfully believed in and proclaimed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Nevertheless, if we approach the Scriptures in the way of mental analysis, with the motive of finding justification for preconceived concepts, or with the aim of preserving traditional, man-made theological systems, we may ignore the aspect of God's being the three-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To do this is not only to be unfaithful to the whole scriptural revelation of the Triune God; it is also a frustration to the outworking of God's economy, which is to dispense Himself into us that He might have the church as His corporate expression on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, as those who would be faithful to all that the Scriptures have spoken concerning the Triune God, we must clearly show forth those verses in the Word which reveal that God is three-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have seen that God is the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, if we emphasize the Three at the expense of the One, we may fall, although perhaps unconsciously and unintentionally, into tritheism.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must affirm both aspects of the Triune God the aspect of the Three being one and the aspect of the One being three.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only by so doing can we avoid the extremes of modalism and tritheism.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is at the point of testifying these two aspects that we are most acutely aware of the unfathomable mystery of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We simply cannot adequately explain this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can only believe what the Bible says and testify of it without attempting to systematize it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Nowhere does the Bible require that we systematize the Word of God or attempt, through human formulation, to reconcile its statements.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We are simply to believe whatever God has spoken.</S>
