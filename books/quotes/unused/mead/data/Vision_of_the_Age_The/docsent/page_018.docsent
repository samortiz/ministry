   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE BACKGROUND OF THE FIRST EPISTLE TO TIMOTHY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order to understand 1 Timothy, we must first understand the background behind the writing of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In Acts 20 we find Paul sending for the elders of the church in Ephesus while he was on his way to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He spoke a solemn and crucial word to them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He reminded them how for three years he was in their midst, not shrinking from declaring to them all the counsel of God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>20, 27, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that Paul fully and thoroughly explained to them God s revelation in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then he said, I know that after my departure fierce wolves will come in among you, not sparing the flock v. 29 . The wolves here refer to the Judaistic believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They were doing an unhealthy work in the church, speaking unhealthy words.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Unhealthy words are poisonous words, killing words.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who were speaking these unhealthy words destroyed men and poisoned them rather than supplying them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this sense, they were like wolves.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 10 the Lord said that He is the good Shepherd and that He came to lay down His life that men may receive life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He also said that the wolf comes not to give life but to snatch and scatter v. 12 . Hence, everyone who causes harm and destruction in the church is a wolf.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Outwardly, those who teach differently are God s people, but the different teaching that they are teaching is the unhealthy teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To be unhealthy means to not supply men with life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is to harm and destroy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This may be compared to the food that we eat: if it is not healthy, it is harmful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we eat unhealthy food, not only will it not benefit us, but it will actually harm our body and threaten our physical life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Paul s Burden</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible is written like a jigsaw puzzle.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not written in a systematic way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Rather, it says a little here and a little there.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must spend the time to put all the pieces together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Acts 20 Paul knew that the church in Ephesus had a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was very concerned about the situation, and he sent for the elders to come to him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He charged them repeatedly to be watchful and sober and on the alert.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After this, he left for Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once he arrived in Jerusalem, problems arose.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Christians there were deeply into the practice of keeping the law.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>James and the elders came to see Paul and said to him, You observe, brother, how many thousands there are among the Jews who have believed; and all are zealous for the law 21:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Not only were they keeping the law; they were even vowing the Nazarite vow and purifying themselves vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>23b-24; Num 6:2-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that the Jewish believers in Jerusalem were still keeping the law of Moses and remaining in the Old Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Under the strong influence of Judaism, they mixed God s New Testament economy with the out-of-date Old Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Being Entangled in James s Snare</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, James thought that this mixture was good.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He even told Paul, They have been informed concerning you that you are teaching all the Jews throughout the nations apostasy from Moses...What then is to be done?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They will certainly hear that you have come Acts 21:21-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>James was saying that there were tens of thousands of believers in Jerusalem who could not accept what Paul had done.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>As a result, Paul had an evil name.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What should he do?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>James advised him, saying, Therefore do this that we tell you: We have four men who have a vow on themselves; take these and be purified with them, and pay their expenses that they may shave their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>And all will know that there is nothing to the things that they have been informed of concerning you, but that you yourself also walk orderly, keeping the law vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The four had vowed a Nazarite vow.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order for a Nazarite to complete his vow, he had to pay a sum for the sacrifice Num 6:13-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It was a substantial sum of money; therefore, according to the Jewish tradition, those who paid on behalf of a poor Nazarite were not only considered pious but actually became partakers of the Nazarite vow.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Paul writes strongly in the books of Romans and Galatians that the law is over.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since that is the case, why would Paul concede to James s proposal when he was in Jerusalem and go back to the law?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Perhaps Paul was thinking, Although I have written the books of Romans and Galatians, I have also written the book of 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There I said that to the Jews I became as a Jew that I might gain the Jews 9:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Since all the people here in Jerusalem are Jews, I can only be a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To put it in a nice way, Paul did this in order to not be different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>To put it in a not-so-nice way, Paul was compromising.</S>
