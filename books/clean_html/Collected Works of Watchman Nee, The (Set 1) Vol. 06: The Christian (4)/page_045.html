<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Fourth Way to Hell:<br>Not Believing in the Lord Jesus</H2><P>John 3:18 says, "He who believes into Him is not condemned; but he who does not believe has been condemned already, because he has not believed into the name of the only begotten Son of God." Verse 36 says, "He who disobeys the Son shall not see life, but the wrath of God abides upon him." Being condemned is to perish and perishing is to go to hell. Not seeing life and having the wrath of God abide on one is also to perish and suffer God's punishment, which is also to go to hell. These two verses tell us another reason for people to go to hell.</P><P>Who will go to hell? Those who do not believe will go to hell! What do they not believe in? They do not believe in the name of the only begotten Son of God. Many people think that man goes to hell by committing different kinds of sins. But the Bible does not teach this. It does not matter whether you are a moralist, religionist, or philosopher; it does not matter how much good you have done, how virtuous, righteous, loving, and kind you are. If you do not believe in the Son of God, the death and judgment waiting for you will be no different from that of the publicans and sinners. Please listen carefully. You do not have to commit any more sins. You do not have to tell one more lie. You do not have to reject Christ, persecute the saints, fornicate, or trespass God's law to go to hell. You can even try your best to reform, improve, serve, sacrifice, love, show kindness, perform charity and relief work, and do many other kinds of good works. But as long as you do not believe in the Lord Jesus, that is good enough for you to perish and go to hell. The words in these two verses are clear and plain. He who does not believe will be condemned. He who does not believe will not have eternal life, and the wrath of God is upon him all the time. "He who does not believe." Besides not believing, there is no other reason for the condemnation. It is not because a person has sinned or does not have good morals. Rather, it is because he does not believe. Besides unbelief, there is no reason for one to perish.</P><P>What does an unbelieving person receive? He who does not believe has been condemned already! Many people are more loving than God is. They think that God will surely not judge man's sin. But in these two verses the Lord Jesus Himself said that God will judge man and punish sinners with His wrath. God has His wrath. Do not think that God is an easy-going and foolishly good person with no righteousness at all. Many people think that God is kind and full of mercy, too kind to punish sinners. I say this in a most reverent way: if God were like this, He would not be kind but foolish. Although our God is kind, He is also righteous. He shows His love toward the sinners in the world. But He will show righteous judgment to those sinners who reject His love. Consequently, the Bible says that he who does not believe in the Son will not have eternal life and God's wrath will abide upon him. God has His wrath and His wrath abides upon unbelieving ones. Hell is real; the righteousness of God and the sin of the world require a hell!</P><P>What do these ones not believe in? They do not believe in the name of the only begotten Son of God. What is the name of the only begotten Son of God? His name is "Jesus." Why is the name of the only begotten Son of God called "Jesus"? The Bible says, "For it is He who will save His people from their sins" (Matt. 1:21). The word "Jesus" means "Jehovah the Savior." Therefore, whoever does not believe in the name of the only begotten Son of God does not believe in Jesus. Not believing in Jesus is not believing in Him as the Savior who saves one from sin. All those who do not believe in Jesus as their Savior will perish and go to hell. This is what the Word of God says.</P><P>How did the Lord Jesus become man's Savior? The Bible says clearly that He is not a Savior of our flesh or of society, but a Savior from sin. He came to save the sinners from their sins. Please listen carefully, and do not be deceived or cheated to think that the Lord Jesus was a great teacher, example, and pattern who promoted love, peace, equality, and freedom for everyone. The Bible does not say that He was such a person. It says clearly that the goal of all His works was to "save His people from their sins." He came to be the Savior from sin.</P><P>How could He become the Savior from sin? Please listen to His own words: "For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins" (Matt. 26:28). In this verse the Lord Jesus explained the way He saves sinners. He saves not by reforming and improving sinners but by dying on behalf of sinners and shedding His blood so that their sins may be forgiven. The way He saves sinners is by the shedding of blood. This is His cross. He saves sinners by the merit of the blood which He shed on the cross. His work did not exhort sinners to do good, educate them, teach them, or slowly develop goodness in their heart. He did not come to serve the sinners' physical body, reform society, or give sinners a more comfortable living in the sinful world. He saved sinners through the shedding of His blood. All the work of the Lord Jesus during His life on earth could not save one sinner. The source of a sinner's salvation is His death.</P><P>How did the Lord Jesus save sinners through His death? Why did He say, "This is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins"? Was shedding His own blood the only way to forgive man's sin? Indeed, there was no other way. The forgiveness of sin presupposes the existence of sin. Because there is sin, there has to be the forgiveness of sin. In what way, however, can sin be forgiven? It can be by the shedding of the Lord Jesus' blood. But why is there a need for the shedding of blood? There is a need because sinners have sinned and sin must be punished. The Bible says, "The wages of sin is death" (Rom. 6:23). Since the wages of sin is death, then a sinner who has sinned must die. The flesh and soul must suffer eternally in hell. Since a sinner has sinned, he should perish. In order to save sinners, the Lord Jesus died and shed His blood for them. Romans 5:6 and 8 say, "For while we were yet weak, in due time Christ died for the ungodly";  "while we were yet sinners, Christ died for us." Listen! The death of Christ was not a martyr's act. Neither was it an example for us to follow. His death was a death for sinners. In other words, He died in place of sinners. Sinners should die and perish themselves. But the Lord Jesus died for sinners and suffered the punishment of sin on behalf of sinners. The punishment which sinners should have suffered was upon the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus substituted for sinners, stood in place of sinners, and received from the hand of a righteous God the punishment of sinners. Since He died, sinners do not have to die. This is the gospel! This is salvation!</P><P>The Lord Jesus Christ, the Son of God, through His offering up of Himself on the cross, has borne the sin of sinners and accomplished eternal salvation. There is no salvation other than this salvation. There is one other way for man to be saved before Godâ€”he must commit absolutely no sin from the day of his birth to the day of his death, including every minute and second of his time, in all of his thoughts, words, conduct, and attitude. No matter how good, moral, godly, and no matter how much he is sheltered by religion, if he has sinned just once in thought, word, conduct, or attitude, that is sufficient for him to go to hell. Since this is the case, can man still be saved by himself? Of course, no one can be saved. This is why the Lord Jesus came to bear sinners' sins. He shed His blood for sinners, so that sinners could be saved through Him, even though they could not save themselves.</P><P>Not believing in the name of the only begotten Son of God is not believing in Jesus; not believing in Jesus is refusing the salvation accomplished by the blood of Jesus shed on the cross. If one does not believe this, he is already condemned. If there is a person on earth who is perfect in goodness and has never sinned in his life, whose conduct is as good as the Lord Jesus', then he does not need to believe in the Lord Jesus. If such a person does not exist, then everyone has sinned and should receive punishment for their sins. If you do not accept the Lord Jesus as your Savior and do not believe that He has died for you, you will bear your own sins and perish forever. Therefore, the sinners who are sitting here should ask themselves if they have sinned. If you have not sinned, there is nothing more to say. But if you have sinned, you must believe in the Lord Jesus. If you do not believe, you will go to hell and bear your own sins. Alas, you will perish because you refused salvation, not because salvation was not offered to you!</P>
