   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY-THREE FELLOWSHIP AT THE CONCLUSION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE TRAINING Date:October 4, 1948</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Place:Kuling</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have made the necessary arrangements in the work already.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I believe that the brothers and sisters can see the reason for our arrangements.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to realize that all problems in our service rest entirely with the person of the workers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this reason, we have to be trained in our very person as well as in the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This time we have seen a little concerning the way to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, our greatest lack before God is not our ministry but our personal daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this training sixty-nine brothers and sisters have presented their testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Their condition is a fair representation of all the brothers and sisters everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During the second morning session, we have covered the need of knowing the proper kind of Christian walk.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our training has emphasized three things: ministry, our walk, and new believers' lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now that you have seen these things, please remember that you must not repeat and duplicate what we have talked about here.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We were free to say what was said because we have all handed ourselves over to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am not making any clarification for myself; rather, I am showing you that I have never interfered with others' business in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some brothers like Simon Meek and Faithful Luk have known me for decades.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brother Luk, who is very close to me, has asked me twenty times by letter and even three times while we were here on the mountain, to open up myself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This time I am giving myself to you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am revealing my own secrets.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the future if I open up myself again, I want to do it myself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you try to do it for me, it is unrighteousness as far as I am concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What we have released here, with the exception of our lessons on the way to study the Scripture and the messages in the evenings, should not be broadcast.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In particular, you should not imitate my style or my tone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In other places I have done exceptional things for the sake of meeting the needs of the churches in those places.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In my life I have done three very exceptional things.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First, I felt the need to write The Spiritual Man when I had tuberculosis and the doctor told me that I was about to die.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, I spoke on matters that I had been constrained from speaking about for many years when I returned from overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I was abroad, friends asked if I had learned my utterance in China.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I came back to China, some thought that I picked up my utterance overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Often we imagine things that bear no resemblance to reality at all.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Third, I have spoken as I have done during the past months in Kuling.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have opened up myself and given myself to you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I have done it once, and I will not do it again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I owe the church nothing, because I have done all I can.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have spoken all that I should speak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have given myself to you unreservedly.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I hope that you will see the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you do not rise up now, the church will have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If the ministers will not rise up, the church will have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The responsibility is not on me any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I have washed my hands.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The fault does not lay with me any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The responsibility is now on your shoulders.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I thank you all for coming this time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We made the decision to have this training at the last minute.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It was a little unfair to you because we did not give you enough time to prepare yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I hope that you will not communicate to ordinary brothers and sisters what we have done here in Kuling.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Allow me to say a word "beside myself" 2 Cor 11:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have received enough glory and suffered enough shame already.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the future I do not wish to receive any more glory or shame.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have my scruples and reasons for doing what I did here in Kuling.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some people say, "Do not worry; everything will be settled at the judgment seat."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I do not have their confidence.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I dare not say such a word.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am in God's hand, and I know that I am a hard person to deal with.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I need God's word to deal with me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As one psalm says, "If God is silent to me, I become like those who go down into the pit" Psa 28:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After the last storm in my ministry, I became even clearer than before about what I have felt for the past ten years, which is that my ministry is for serving the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>My ministry is not to serve God's children in general; my ministry is among the ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I hope that you will not force me to move among the brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If you do, I will be exposed before all the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Please do not imitate me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>No brother or sister can be the same as I am in disposition or service.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Everyone has his own pathway.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Romans 14:4 tells us clearly that each one of us has our own pathway before the Lord, and the Lord will make us stand.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I know inwardly the way I should take.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I know that I was slandered and attacked twenty times in pamphlets and through mass distribution of negative booklets.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>For this reason my service to other Christians can only be indirect; I cannot serve them directly.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I am not saying that I am angry at the pamphlets and the booklets.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God knows that I smiled at them more than I frowned at them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When others accused me of weaknesses, I readily admitted it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The facts might have been wrong, but it was right that I should receive criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As far as the facts are concerned, they might not have condemned what I condemned, and they might have condemned what I would not condemn.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>At any rate, I do not want other brothers and sisters to know what I am doing here at Kuling.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>If they know about it, I am afraid much damage will be done.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You should only let others see and hear the spiritual benefits you have received; you should not teach others the doctrines and outward practices you have received.</S>
