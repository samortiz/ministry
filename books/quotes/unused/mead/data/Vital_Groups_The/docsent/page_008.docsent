   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The constituents of the vital groups are six categories of persons.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will cover the first three categories: the believers in Christ, the disciples of Christ, and the witnesses of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the next message we will fellowship concerning the members of Christ, the brothers of Christ, and the prophets of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. THE BELIEVERS IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We may feel that the believers in Christ is a common term, but actually we do not fully realize what a believer is.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. Transferred from Adam into Christ</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The believers in Christ John 3:15-16 have been transferred from Adam into Christ 1 Cor 15:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before we were regenerated, we were in the Adamic realm.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The entire world with billions of people is in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Adam is a big realm, but our regeneration has transferred us out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ today is our realm.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Physically, we are in the United States, but actually we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>B. Regenerated to Be a New Creation</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We also have been regenerated to be a new creation in Christ and all the old things have been washed away 2Cor.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>5:17; Titus 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Not only has our outward realm changed, but also our inward nature has been changed through regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was generated to be Chinese ninety-one years ago, but one day I was regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have to emphasize the syllable "re-".</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have been regenerated to be a new creation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we see these truths, we will realize that we are abnormal in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have been transferred out of Adam, but we still do many things in Adam and not in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We were regenerated to be a new creation, but we still remain in our living as the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we became a new creation, all the old things were washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But this washing is also a continual process throughout our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I am concerned that many of our old concepts have not been washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Titus 3:5 reveals that regeneration is a great washing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have been saved by the washing of regeneration, which is a kind of reconditioning, remaking, or remodeling with life to make us altogether new.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our group meetings are not vital because much of the time we meet in the way of the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The things of the old creation can remain with us prevailingly.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many of us come together as a "free" group instead of a vital group.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are free to talk about many things.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>One brother may ask another brother who cuts his hair.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We should not talk about the cutting of our hair but about the cutting, the crucifying, of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should not be so free in our group meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must be restricted to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Vital groups are composed of people in the new creation who speak about the new creation, not about the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>C. United with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The believers in Christ have been united with Christ in His eternal life, which is a union in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is an organic union.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>D. Joined to Christ</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are also joined to Christ to be one spirit with Him 1Cor.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many Christians today do not realize that Christ is the life-giving Spirit and that we are joined to Christ to be one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that we become spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"That which is born of the Spirit is spirit" John 3:6b .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have been born of the Spirit to be spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we come to the vital groups, we should come in this status.</S>
