Through the Spirit as the Firstfruits Dispensing<br>the Divine Essence into the Believers' Entire Being</H2><P>God's conformed sons are glorified through the Spirit as the firstfruits dispensing the divine essence into the believers' entire being (Rom. 8:23). God has given the Spirit to us as the firstfruits, the foretaste, of our enjoyment of God as our inheritance. Today we are enjoying God as a foretaste, not as a full taste. While we are enjoying the Spirit as our foretaste, He is dispensing the divine essence into our entire being. This dispensing proceeds from the initiation of His sealing to the consummation of the glorification of the believers, which will be their full taste of their enjoyment of God as their inheritance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6.
