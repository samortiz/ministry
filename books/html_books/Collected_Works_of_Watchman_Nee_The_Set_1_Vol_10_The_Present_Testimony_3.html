Praise God that it has been in print for more than a month now. We hope that we will have this book available to meet the needs after this autumn. The acceptance of The Spiritual Man by God's children makes me, of course, very thankful. But I need to say a few words. If a man does not love God's revelation and only understands the truth in this book in his mind, never has any dealing of the cross, and does not have a seeking heart, but merely likes the truth in this book superficially, his behavior will be completely opposite to the truth in this book when a time of trial or even a time of testing comes. I am saying this with special reference to the situation of all the present outward works.</P><P>For the last two years, the churches in every locality seem to have been having some revival. We praise God that most of those revivals were the pure work of God's Holy Spirit. Nevertheless, there were a few (or more accurately, many) that were mingled with natural and supernatural elements and were not totally spiritual. The purpose of The Spiritual Man is to point out the difference between the two, so that one may understand what is of the natural man, of the supernatural, of the soul, and of the evil spirits. If the reader of The Spiritual Man genuinely receives God's revelation and at the same time experiences the dealing of the cross, he will definitely know how to distinguish between the two.</P><P>I am referring to those preachings that are but soulish performances and those passive seekings after supernatural experiences. My heart aches over the fact that God's children are fooled. I truly feel that it is useless for one merely to read through a book. Revelation and submission are both indispensable. I am amazed that some dear brothers have written to me indicating how much help they have gained from this book, yet they have no way of resisting the current trend and have agreed with or even encouraged this kind of soulish work and passive attitude. The reason for this is either that they understand the book only in their mind without revelation or they have never paid a price to obtain the truth and only like it superficially.</P><P>Brothers, are my words too strong for you? I hope that I have not hurt you, but what I have said is the true situation. I admit that often our lives are in a state of paradox. When the Holy Spirit points out to us that our living does not match our belief, only then are we willing to correct it through His power. However, a dramatic, performance work and genuine, spiritual work cannot coexist. How can we, on the one hand, confess that soulish work should be refused and, on the other hand, welcome the same kind of soulish work? Of course, I know that there are not many people like this. But it is enough to make me realize that few are willing to pay a price to obtain the truth by receiving God's revelation.</P><P>Naturally, the flesh likes a noisy, dramatic, performance work because it stirs up a person's emotion. For this reason, even though a person may see a truth at first and may also joyfully embrace it, this does not mean that he has possessed this truth. It is necessary to pay a price to obtain the truth. Many times the price for obtaining the truth is a suffering in the emotions. Many have failed because even though they like the truth in the beginning, they cannot resist joining the emotional excitement.</P><P>Concerning supernatural things, I would like to explain them more specifically in order to avoid any misunderstanding. I want everyone to know that I am absolutely not against supernatural things. The miraculous gifts recorded in the Bible are very precious. I do not forbid people to seek after them; rather, I exhort people to seek after them. Nevertheless, I would like everyone to realize that if we compare the gifts of the Holy Spirit (miraculous, supernatural things) with the fruit of the Holy Spirit (spiritual life), the former is not as precious as the latter. This is what we see in the book of 1 Corinthians. Furthermore, whatever is supernatural can come not only from the Holy Spirit but also from the evil spirits. The latter are able to counterfeit the work of the Holy Spirit. For this reason I like to discover from the Bible the difference between the work of the Holy Spirit and the work of the evil spirits, so that everyone would be able to differentiate between the two. My purpose in doing this is not to forbid but to discern.</P><P>A passive will and empty mind are extremely dangerous. May the Holy Spirit enlighten the readers of The Spiritual Man to realize these items and avoid them.</P><P>Many people constantly inquire as to when the next edition of this book will be published. At present we are not sure about the date. I can only say that it will be sometime after this autumn. I hope that the brothers who are of one heart would pray often for the proofreaders so that they will not make any mistakes. May peace be with you!</P><P>A household slave of Christ<br>Watchman Nee</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>A SOUL AT REST</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 24</H2><P>Man's psychological faculty is very sensitive and most easily affected by outward stimulations. Words, attitudes, circumstances, human affections that come from the outside are able to affect us emotionally. Formerly our mind was filled with thoughts, plans, and ideals and always buzzing with activities. Our will was filled with opinions and suggestions and loved to act according to its preferences. Every faculty of our soul-life afforded us no peace. Whether we were alone or with others, the soul-life within us was constantly swaying, changing, causing turbulence, disorganization, and unrest.</P><P>But when our soul comes under the control of the spirit, we are delivered from these kinds of turbulence. The Lord Jesus says, "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls" (Matt. 11:29). If we are willing to submit to the Lord, take His yoke, and walk according to His will, our soul will not be disturbed. If we are willing to follow the Lord, willing to consider how He was despised by men and did not give in to His self-will, but rather followed God's will, and willing to learn from Him, all the turbulence in our soul will be calmed down. The reason sorrow and grief come upon us is that we are not content with receiving the same treatment as the Lord; we are not willing to submit to God's will and His arrangements. If we put the soul-life to death and submit fully to the Lord, our sensitive soul will rest in the Lord, and we will no longer misunderstand the Lord. A soul that is under the control of the Holy Spirit is a soul that is at rest.</P><P>Formerly we were busy planning. Now we are serenely trusting. Formerly there were constant sorrow and frustration. Now we are like a weaned child, who rests in his mother's bosom. Formerly we were filled with our own thoughts and had many cravings and ambitions. Now we consider God's will as the best and rest in Him. Indeed, "Perfect submission, perfect delight," and "Perfect submission, all is at rest" [Hymns, #308]. Ephesians 6:6 says more or less the same thing: "As slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul." No longer do we do God's will by the soul, which is self-assurance. Now we are doing God's will from the soul, which means carrying out His will practically and wholeheartedly. The soul-life which once rebelled against God's will is now brought into full submission to His will through the work of the cross and is willing to do His will wholeheartedly. Formerly everything was outward; we either walked according to our self-will, or we tried to do God's will according to our self-will. But now, in everything, we have become one mind with God.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LAST PART OF THE JOURNEY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 24</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Mark 6:45-52</H1><P>This passage of the Bible has often been a help to me; even now it is a continuous help to me. The passage prior to Mark 6:45-52 speaks of the Lord Jesus feeding five thousand with five loaves and two fish. The passage following Mark 6:45-52 speaks of the Lord Jesus healing many who were sick. These three events form a large type prefiguring the time of the Lord Jesus' death on the cross to the time of His establishing the kingdom. They tell us how the Lord: (1) was crucified for us, (2) ascended to the heaven to become the High Priest for our sake, and (3) will descend again in the future to establish the kingdom.</P><P>John 6 also records the Lord feeding the five thousand with five loaves and two fish, but the record is lengthier. It says that after the Lord Jesus distributed the loaves and fish, He continued to speak a very important teaching: "I am the living bread which came down out of heaven" (v. 51). The Lord meant that just as the people were filled with bread that day, they would have eternal life by similarly eating His flesh and drinking His blood. Hence, the Lord's distribution of the bread typifies His death for us in which His body was broken and His precious blood was shed.</P><P>Mark 6:46 says, "He went away to the mountain to pray." This typifies the Lord ascending to the heavens to become the High Priest to pray for us before God.</P><P>Mark 6:53-56 typifies the Lord coming again to establish His kingdom and heal many who are sick.</P><P>What we will cover today is the account of the Lord compelling the disciples to journey across the sea. This event was inserted between the cross and the kingdom. This is an event for today, an event for the church age. It speaks of the things that will transpire and the attitude we should have during the period of time after the cross and before the kingdom. For now, I will not emphasize what the Lord has done for us. Instead, I will emphasize what we should do.</P><P>Verse 45 says, "And immediately He compelled His disciples to step into the boat and go before to the other side, toward Bethsaida, while He sent the crowd away." Brothers and sisters, this verse tells us that everyone of us has a journey ordained by Him. The word "compelled" here is the same as the word "constrains" used in 2 Corinthians 5:14. The Lord constrained the disciples to step into the boat. The Lord has died for them and is now constraining them to take the journey. The Lord has one journey for His disciples, and He constrained them to take it. The most important thing in the Christian life is to seek out the journey which the Lord has ordained and faithfully walk on it. A poor phenomenon among believers today is that many have not found the journey that the Lord has ordained for them. Some, even though they have found it, do not walk on it. This is the reason that their living is filled with so much spiritual death, gloom, and restriction, and this is the reason that there are so many conflicts and arguments in God's work. The most important task for each of us is to put ourselves into God's hand in a quiet, patient, prayerful, consecrated, and obedient way and wholeheartedly seek after His leading. We should be willing to obey Him and act only in accordance with His will. We should pray that He reveal to us the journey He has designated for us. After this, we should pay any price to wholeheartedly walk on it.</P><P>We know that the feeding of the bread took place in Bethsaida (Luke 9:10). From the map we can see that there were two cities named Bethsaida, one to the northeast of Capernaum and the other to the southwest. The Lord commanded them to start from the Bethsaida in the northeast and sail to the other side, toward the Bethsaida in the southwest.</P><P>Mark 6:46 says, "And after He said farewell to them, He went away to the mountain to pray." This indicates to us how our Lord departed from His disciples and ascended to the right hand of the Father to do the work of intercession. He left His disciples on the earth to take the journey He had assigned them.</P><P>Verses 47 and 48 say, "And when evening fell, the boat was in the midst of the sea and He was alone on the land. And seeing them distressed as they rowed, for the wind was contrary to them, He came toward them about the fourth watch of the night, walking on the sea, and He intended to pass by them." What did the disciples encounter on this journey? "And when evening fell." It was nightfall, and the boat was in the midst of the sea. Christ is the light of the world, but He has left this world. When He comes again, He will be the morning star and sun. From the ascension of Christ to His coming again, this world is in a long night. In man's eyes, the world is becoming brighter and more progressive. But according to God's Word, "The night is far advanced" (Rom. 13:12). God does not say that the world is very bright and progressive. Rather, He says that the night is far advanced. We are now in the night. This is why we see darkness all around us. Do you feel that all around you is just darkness? If you do not know what darkness is and if you do not sense that your surroundings are all darkness, I am afraid that you have been assimilated by the world. If we continually walk in the light and continually stay near to God, live in Christ, unceasingly judge the work of the flesh, and obey the leading of the Holy Spirit, we will surely realize that this world is indeed dark.</P><P>"The boat was in the midst of the sea." We still have not reached the destination of our journey. Although the matter of eternal life is resolved for us and we have no more problem with that, whether or not our history on the earth will be one of faithfulness or failure (of faithfulness to the end or desertion halfway), is yet to be determined. The boat is still in the midst of the sea and has not arrived in port. There is still the danger and possibility of changing. We should not be overly self-assured and should not presume that our ending is already determined. Of course, we are delighted to be on the right course, but how we run and end it is still a question.</P><P>What did the disciples encounter when they went forward? They were "distressed as they rowed, for the wind was contrary to them." Brothers and sisters, if your walk is contrary to the wind, then surely those opposite you will be walking with the wind. If there is an adverse wind from the northeast to the southwest, then there must be a favorable wind from the southwest to the northeast. If the journey which many Christians take is not contrary to the wind, I doubt whether such a journey is ordained by the Lord. We should take the journey that the Lord has ordained. The Lord has already ordained our place on the earth. He said, "The world hates you." Our journey is one that is contrary to the wind. If we have never been opposed, ridiculed, or persecuted by the world, our position must not have come from the Lord. We should encounter adverse wind; we should not run with the wind. If we walk according to what the Lord has ordained, from the northeast to the southwest, there certainly will be adverse wind. Otherwise, I have doubts about our journey.</P><P>"And seeing them distressed as they rowed, for the wind was contrary to them"! Faithful believers experience being distressed as they row, for the wind is contrary to them! In the past few years, temptations have become more numerous and severe than before. Those who belong to the Lord seem to encounter much trouble. Their bodies are often weak and ill. There are often discord and difficulty in their families. Their jobs and living are not as easy as before. Their community and country have increasingly persecuted and attacked them. Even more, Satan and the evil spirits have done their best to stir up trouble with the intention of consuming and afflicting the believers. Oh, these are all adverse winds! If we stand firmly on the course which the Lord has ordained, we will realize that the wind is contrary and indeed distressing! What about the condition in the church during the past few years? We have not seen the Lord raise up any great persons. Heresies of all kinds are more numerous than before. There are more deceptions by the evil spirits and more worldliness than before. In such a generation, by taking the Lord's ordained journey without turning any corner, can we encounter favorable winds and not be distressed?</P><P>Yet we would rather be distressed than drifting. We would rather toil in rowing than wander in drifting. We would rather take the difficult journey than take the easy path and drift. If we want favorable winds, we do not have to turn around; we only need to stop rowing for a moment, and the wind will bring us back to the original spot. Drifting about does not require any effort. If, however, we choose to stand firm, we will feel distressed. As long as we are willing to compromise a little, relax a little, and backslide a little, the wind will carry us back; there is no effort involved. Loving the world requires no effort; neither does following the world require any labor. Standing firm for the Lord and being faithful to Him certainly invite contrary winds. Consequently, there will be toil in rowing.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, it is extremely easy to return to the former place. This is the time for us to choose and the time for us to be faithful. May we take the journey which the Lord has commanded.</P><P>The disciples were rowing from the evening to the fourth watch of the night. The Jews had three watches, and the Romans had four which corresponds with the Chinese system. The fourth watch is probably three o'clock in the morning. They were rowing constantly. Turning back would have been embarrassing for them. Would it not have been better for them to go to Capernaum, tarry, and rest a little? But they did not do this.</P><P>The fourth watch is the darkest hour of the night; it is the very end of the night. It is also the time for us to hold on and continue. I know you have temptations because I also have temptations. I know you have trials because I also have trials. Now is not the time for rebuking because the temptations are too great. The greatest danger and the greatest temptation now is to be a little indifferent and compromise. This is like dozing off for a short while. We are too tired. In the beginning, a constraining love sustained us with strength for a while. But now things seem to have gone on for too long, and the situation has become too difficult. As a result, we become cold. I have seen many believers who were very energetic and brave in the battlefield a few years ago, but who have now become cold and withdrawn. This is because the winds have become too contrary. It is more difficult to overcome a slight indifference than to overcome other temptations. It is easier to overcome sin; journeying on in contrary winds is too tiring, and we tend to become a little cold.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, if the Lord constrained us in the beginning, commanded us to take the journey, and compelled us to cross the sea to the other side, how can we stop from going forward? If we stop, the currents will carry us to a place farther from the Lord, and the favorable winds will also carry us to a place farther from the Lord. We would rather be distressed than drifting. What we need now is the Lord's encouragement. Paul told Timothy, "For which cause I remind you to fan into flame the gift of God, which is in you through the laying on of my hands" (2 Tim. 1:6). "Fan into flame," in the original, means to do a little stirring. Brothers and sisters, may the love we had at the beginning be stirred up again and become vigorous again. Perhaps you have stumbled. Now you should rise up. The writer of the book of Hebrews saw that among the Hebrew brothers, some "may seem to have come short of it" (4:1). Their initial zeal for the Lord seemed to wane. Therefore, he entreated them to "set straight the hands which hang down and the paralyzed knees" (12:12).</P><P>Mr. Muller, who had worked in China, once said that the key to receiving God's great success is to persevere through the last half hour. Brothers and sisters, how many temptations have you overcome? Although the darkness is great, it will not last long. What does Isaiah 21:12 say? "The guard says, / Morning is coming, / But so also is night." Although it is night now, the morning will come shortly. At such times, I beg you to persevere through the last half hour. Our eyes should not be set on the night, neither should we consider only the difficulties. It would be too foolish to quit now, and it would be too foolish to relax now because in a short time we will be over on the other side.</P><P>Mrs. Penn-Lewis once said, "Many believers say that they have encountered a lot of pressure. The battle now seems to grow thicker day by day. It seems as if we are the only target of Satan. But the question now is whether you can persevere through the final half-hour. Daniel 7:25 says, `And he will..wear out the saints of the Most High.' To wear out is to consume. Now the work of consuming the saints has already begun. It is harder to recognize Satan as the one who consumes the saints than to recognize him as the roaring lion." </P><P>When I was in Kuling, I often strolled by a stream and saw a rock as big as a washbasin with a hole in its middle. The hole was formed by the daily grinding of the many small pebbles. Satan acts likewise with God's children. He does not kill you with one stroke. Rather, he will try to consume you day by day. After a while, without knowing it, you will be seriously wounded by him. Brothers and sisters, although you are suffering, can you not persevere just a moment? Can you not persevere with the Lord in this final half hour? Is it really true that you are not able to watch with the Lord a moment? Oh, today is our time, the time when we ought to stand firm. If a person has never experienced adverse winds, he is most pitiful! If a person has never reckoned that the world is bitter, corrupt, and can persecute people, this person has never started his journey! You will encounter hardship and realize that the wind is contrary only when you are faithful in your walking. Only then will you hear a voice telling you, "It is too hard. Why not loosen up a little and rest a moment?" But it is foolish to rest now because much of the way has been covered.</P><P>"And He was alone on the land. And seeing them distressed as they rowed, for the wind was contrary to them, He came toward them about the fourth watch of the night, walking on the sea, and He intended to pass by them." The Lord wants to see if we will keep our faith or renounce it. He wants to see if we will advance or retreat. His eyes are on you and me. He pays attention to every step we take. He knows how great our temptations are and how difficult our circumstances are. He will not let us endure beyond the fourth watch. When the night is far advanced, He comes to us. He has died for us and ascended to the heavens to pray for us. At the same time, He sees our hardship. When the night is far advanced, He will come.</P><P>There is something special in verse 48: the Lord "intended to pass by them." Many have found this difficult to understand. It seems as if the Lord had no intention to go to the disciples. But if we consider what the Lord is doing today, we will not have any problem understanding this. Since the Lord had commanded His disciples to go to the other side to Bethsaida, He descended the mountain and went forward to Bethsaida. Could the Lord go to another place to wait for them? The Lord was looking for the disciples along the same path which He had commanded them to take. If they had turned at a corner, the Lord would not have met them when He came. If they had gone on a wrong course, the Lord would not have gone on a wrong pathway to wait for them. This is very sobering! I have always considered that if the Lord commanded me to go to Shanghai and I went instead to Nanking, I would miss the rapture when He comes. This is because the rapture takes place only along the pathway that the Lord has ordained. If you are not there, you will miss the rapture. Each one of us has to bear his own responsibility as to which way he should go.</P><P>Verse 51 says, "And He went up unto them into the boat, and the wind ceased." As soon as the Lord comes, everything is fine. Thank and praise the Lord, the wind may be contrary, but it will not remain contrary forever. Though rowing is a toil, we will not need to row forever. Perhaps the Lord is on the way. Brothers and sisters, we can suffer hardship on this earth because the Lord has died for us in the past and will come back again in the future. The Lord's constraining love is behind us, and the hope of His coming is before us and drawing us. One missionary said, "I have the Lord as my portion; this is why I can forsake all." The Lord's eyes are on us. We should not fear hardship. If we change direction now for fear of hardship, all the hardship we have endured in the past will come to naught.</P><P>A person who is very deep in the Lord once said, "When we read 2 Thessalonians 2:3 and 2 Timothy 3:1-13, we can realize that before the Lord's coming, there will be a falling away, and perilous times, and evil men and seducers shall wax worse and worse. These apostasies do not refer to education, religious activities, able pastors, splendid worship halls, or intellectual and material progress. Rather, they refer to the denial of faith and the power of God. Presently, some famous denominations are inclined towards the Higher Criticism (which is actually low-class unbelief), which denies God's supernatural work, such as regeneration, sanctification, definite answers to prayers, and the revelation of the divine things to men through the Holy Spirit."</P><P>In the days before the Lord's coming, there will be great deceit and delusion. If it has its way, even the elect will be deceived. Furthermore, the "form of godliness" will exceedingly increase. The decrease of faith will be due not only to the love of the world and the denial of God's Word, but will also be due to the false faith fashioned by Satan. One brother said, "These works of Satan will become an invisible influence in the air surrounding us. They will become a form of godliness, which will be inhabited by the evil spirits and which will be occupied with the oppression of Hades. These evil spirits will do their utmost to harm, deceitfully lead, confuse, and oppress God's children. They will affect our bodies, suppress our mood, and darken our mind. Various strange feelings and trials unheard of in the past will come upon us and will strip us in a surprising way of all willingness and ability to incline toward God. Our spirit will be tired and weak, our mind will be dull, and our will will slumber. We will be strangely covetous of the things which God forbids and will surprisingly love the amusement and customs of this world. We will find it difficult to preach with full freedom and power and will find it hard to listen attentively to a message or kneel down to give ourselves to prayer continually. At such a time as today, when the evening is at hand, we must quell this kind of atmosphere!" Oh, let us be strong in the Lord! Satan will certainly endeavor with unthinkable power to deceive our mind and our will; he will make it difficult for us to carry on an intimate walk with the Lord, and we will find it easy to live according to the flesh and harder to faithfully serve God and give ourselves to prayer. It will seem as if our entire being is stirred up to oppose our following the Lord Jesus to the end and seduce us to make a covenant with the world.</P><P>The atmosphere around us wants to distract us from God, so that we would be cold in prayer, dull in our spiritual senses, and blind to the reality of the heavenly things and to the glorious presence of the Lord. It also causes us to neglect our fellowship with God and think that it is difficult to maintain a constant fellowship with Him.</P><P>We sense that all these things are beginning to affect us. The lusts of the world are knitting a stretched-out net through many ways. This knitting has become stronger and more powerful in many believers. Many things which were prohibited in previous generations are not only done today but practiced without any sense of shame. Many places of worship have not only rejected spiritual things and ceased from having revival but are introducing all sorts of entertainments and dubious activities.</P><P>Generally speaking, everywhere on earth, we see a waning of faith and a departure from the truth. We admit that there are exceptions and there are places which are blessed by God. But taken as a whole, the condition of all the churches on earth gives us a mournful picture.</P><P>As we behold this situation, we cannot help but call upon the churches of God to rise up, strengthen themselves, and return to fellowship with God, so that in the remaining days, they will please the Lord and be prepared to "be manifested before the judgment seat of Christ" (2 Cor. 5:10) and give an account of what they have done.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, what we have spoken are true words. I do not know what your feeling is toward them. Every day I sense that the whole world is against us. We can only have one of two attitudes: stand fast or relax. The world still welcomes us and so does Satan. But the Lord has compelled us to go to the other side to Bethsaida. If, at this time, we are not faithful, we will never be faithful. Many of God's children have suffered for the Lord and have taken the lonely journey. Shall we be like what one British brother wrote in a poem, which says that while others go to the Lord through a sea of blood, we go to Him on a bridal sedan? Moses said unto the sons of Gad and sons of Reuben, "Shall your brothers go to the war while you stay here?" (Num. 32:6). Brothers and sisters, while others are faithful and suffering, can we sit still in peace? Surely there is hardship, but that is far better than drifting. Every one of us ought to faithfully serve the Lord and every one ought to take the journey that He has ordained until we reach the other side.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 25</H2><P>Praise God that His grace and power have enabled us once again to publish another volume of The Present Testimony. His provision and His guidance are precious. The messages concerning the New Testament in this volume are a continuation of the last volume. However, I would like everyone to remember that each of these messages can stand alone by itself. The messages in this volume emphasize that the foundation of the New Testament is based upon the blood of the Lord Jesus. As to the messages, "In Christ" and "God's Way of Redemption," one needs to read them with much prayer and God's revelation. If there is prayer and revelation, everything will become reality. Otherwise, it will merely disappear like fleeing clouds and will not be of much use.</P><P>I need to explain some more concerning the writings which appeared in the past in The Present Testimony and Notes on Scriptural Messages. Most of the articles are notes from my messages. Although I have spent much time in polishing them, the style and expressions are basically the same as when I originally delivered them. They would have been clearer and mistakes would have been fewer if I had rewritten them, but this was impossible because of my busy schedule. Therefore, I beg the brothers to forgive me if there are any mistakes in structure or expression.</P><P>Concerning those who have corresponded with me, I would like you to know I have read your letters and sympathize with you, but because of my physical weakness, busy schedule, frequent travel, and lack of help, in many cases I have been unable to answer them right away. In some cases I have not been able to answer them at all. This indeed is regrettable, but in my present situation I see no hope of improvement. I beg the brothers to forgive me, for if I answered all the letters, I would not be able to do any other work.</P><P>In the last few months, due to heart disease and other physical illness, my earthly tent is again in danger of collapsing at any moment. Many times I tarry at the fork of the road, not knowing what way to take. Humanly speaking, in many experiences I do not know whether to cry or laugh. But thank the Lord, for the Lord's sake nothing is too difficult and no price is too great. In the eyes of those who trust and obey, a dark, cloudy situation is still a bright and clear sky. Those lines are true: "If there is less of earth joy; give, Lord, more of heaven. Let the spirit praise Thee, though the heart be riven." Your prayer at this time is what I treasure. Thank you. Peace be to you.</P><P>A household slave of Christ<br>Watchman Nee<br>August 8, 1932</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>IN CHRIST</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(A Message Given at a Baptismal Meeting)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 25</H2><P>We have to remember that we are all sinners because we are all in Adam. Everyone that is born of Adam has the Adamic nature. We do not need to make an effort to lose our temper, lie, etc., because Adam's nature, life, and behavior have all flowed into us. God's way of salvation is not by making us better but by delivering us out of Adam and putting us into Christ. Similarly, everything of Christ has flowed into us. The Bible shows that as long as we are in Adam, we will sin; and as long as we are in Christ, we are righteous. But in the most secret place of our heart, there is an erroneous desire. We wish that God would do something on us. Many people make this kind of mistake. However, God never does anything on us; rather, He puts us into Christ.</P><P>Some people think that because the root of sin is still in us even though we are saved, we need to ask God to do another thing on us: to remove the root of sin in us like pulling out a bad tooth. Perhaps someone has said that we need to pray to ask God to pull out the root of our sin. Perhaps some have said that after they prayed for a certain period of time, they succeeded and were sanctified. But if we expect God to accomplish something on us, this will never happen. The Bible shows us that all of God's work has been accomplished in Christ. Since the day Christ died, every spiritual thing has been accomplished in Christ. God will not do any more. If we ask God to perform a work on us, God cannot. We can only receive what God has already accomplished in Christ.</P><P>Everything is in Christ. Do not hope to receive some special light while you are praying or hear some voice telling you that a certain sin has been removed. Do not expect to have a special feeling that will fill you with joy. You may think that these are good things. Actually, thinking this way involves an evil heart of unbelief. This is not God's work. Whatever God does has been done in Christ; it is not done in you. It is not a matter of what God does on you; God has done everything in Christ. If you believe, you will have it. But if you want God to do something on you, you will never have it done. When you are in Christ, you have what is in Christ by receiving.</P><P>Many times when you are ill, you wish that God would just touch you with His little finger so that you would be healed. However, God has healed you in Christ; God cannot do anything on you again. As long as you are in Christ and receive, you will have what you need. Once you believe, the healing is yours. Do you want to be victorious? You can never do it! Only Christ is victorious. Do you want to overcome the world? You can never do it! Only Christ overcomes the world. Do you wish that God would do something? God will never do it because He has already done everything in Christ. Do you think that overcoming is something that only happens today? No, it happened when Christ overcame. May God grant us the light of revelation and show us what is already in Christ. If we do not have faith, we will have nothing; but if we have faith, we will have everything. In Christ there is victory, justification, holiness, forgiveness, as well as all the other spiritual blessings. God will not work these things on us again. If we enter into Christ, all that is in Christ will be ours. This does not mean that we extract something from Christ for our nourishment. Rather, it is entering into Christ and letting everything in Christ flow into us.</P><P>When we are baptized, we are baptized into Christ. Not only are we immersed into the water, we are also immersed into Christ. The second part of Romans 6:3, "Baptized into His death," indicates that the baptismal water refers to death. The first part of this verse, "Are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus," indicates that the water also refers to Christ. Many times we think that God gives us a glass of water to drink. Instead, God wants us to enter into Christ. If we see this clearly, we will know that we do not have to ask God to do something on us. It is done in Christ. Everything is in Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHAT DO WE HAVE IN CHRIST?</H2><P>Romans 8:1 says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus." You cannot be condemned, because you are in Christ. Can you say to God, "I am a sinner, please forgive me and do not condemn me"? No. God cannot do this. God forgives you in Christ. You need not look at yourself. You only need to look at Christ. How do you know that you will not be condemned in the future? Can you rely upon your experience of a certain day or a certain time? The only way you can stop me from rebutting you is by quoting the Scripture. If you quote the Scripture, no preacher on earth can rebut you. Even God cannot rebut you because His Word says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus."</P><P>Second Corinthians 5:17 says, "So then if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation. The old things have passed away; behold, they have become new." Does this verse tell us that we are changed? No, it says that he who is in Christ is a new creation. Some say, "I was a Christian for many years but was very weak. But on a certain day of a certain year, I was revived and became a new creation." What evidence does he have that he became a new creation on a certain day of a certain year? My evidence is not a so-called revival which supposedly made me a new creation; my evidence is God's Word which says that whoever is in Christ is a new creation. Perhaps some may say, "According to the Bible, I am in Christ, and I am a new creation. However, when I look at myself, I do not seem so new." I can say that sinners and even many Christians do not have faith. After reading this you should kneel down and say, "God, I thank and praise You; Your Word says that whoever is in Christ is a new creation. I am in Christ; therefore, I am a new creation!" Whenever temptation befalls you and tells you that you are still an old creation, you should say, "God's Word says that whoever is in Christ is a new creation." If you do this, Satan will retreat. If you pay no attention to the temptation and only stand on the side of God's Word, you will overcome. Overcoming does not depend upon feeling but upon God's Word.</P><P>God will not do any work on us. If He removes the root of our sin, we will have no need to believe. God has accomplished everything in Christ. He wants us to look to Him day by day and believe His Word which says that we are a new creation in Christ. God does not lie. Whatever God speaks will be done. If we believe, it will be ours. This is the secret of overcoming.</P><P>Ephesians 1:6 says, "...His grace, with which He graced us in the Beloved." God accepts us only in the Beloved. No one can please God outside of Christ. God can keep us and accept us only in Christ.</P><P>Colossians 1:14 says, "In whom we have redemption, the forgiveness of sins." Being saved and being forgiven are both in Christ. Have you asked God to forgive you? Suppose a Christian has committed a sin and asks God to forgive him. Do you know when God forgives him? Some say the evidence that you have been forgiven comes only after you have prayed to the point of having peace in your heart. But are there not many people who still have peace in their hearts even after committing sins? Are there not many people who still have no peace even though their sins have been forgiven? Your feeling is not dependable. If a Christian has sinned, can you tell him how long he has to pray before he can obtain forgiveness? You should know that your sins were borne by Christ more than nineteen hundred years ago. You died in the death of Christ; you are forgiven. All you have to do is to bow down and take what Christ has accomplished. If you expect God to do a new thing on you, it is impossible to say how long you would have to pray. When you ask God to forgive you, you are really asking for the forgiveness in Christ to flow to you. Your forgiveness depends upon your faith that God has forgiven you in Christ. It does not depend on feeling.</P><P>Second Corinthians 5:21 says, "Him who did not know sin He made sin on our behalf that we might become the righteousness of God in Him." We are justified because we are in Christ. God does not justify us because we do good. God justifies us in Christ. If we want to wait until we regard ourselves as righteous before we believe, we will never believe.</P><P>First Corinthians 1:2 says, "To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place." We are justified because we are in Christ; we are sanctified also because we are in Christ. Many people make a big mistake by saying that God has given them holiness and that they were sanctified on a certain day of a certain month. If we expect God to work on us until we are sanctified, this will never happen. All we need to do is to receive what is in Christ</P><P>The light in a car is supplied by only a little amount of electricity that is stored in the battery. If we are in Christ, we will be like the light in a room; although the source of the electrical power is not in the room, electricity flows into the room. Once the connection is made and the switch is turned on, the light will come. But when the connection is broken or the switch is turned off, the light will not come. When we are joined to Christ, we have everything; once we are disconnected, we find ourselves to be just like unbelievers. A single work is never accomplished on us; everything is accomplished in Christ. We are merely a wire through which electricity flows.</P><P>Romans 8:38 and 39 say, "For I am persuaded that neither death nor life nor angels nor principalities nor things present nor things to come nor powers nor height nor depth nor any other creature will be able to separate us from the love of God, which is in Christ Jesus our Lord." All these things cannot separate us from the love of God. There is only one reason: this love is in Christ Jesus.</P><P>Colossians 2:10 says, "And you have been made full in Him...." We have been made full because we are in Christ, not because of ourselves.</P><P>Colossians 3:3 says, "And your life is hidden with Christ in God." Our lives are hidden with Christ in God.</P><P>Romans 8:2 says, "For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." We are freed because we are in Christ, not because of ourselves. Those who believe this are blessed. But those who beg for it will not receive.</P><P>Ephesians 1:3 says, "Who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ." This verse surely has much for us to enjoy. No matter what the spiritual blessings are, they are altogether in Christ. If you have this verse, you can say, "I thank and praise God because He has given me every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ." The extent of your belief in God's Word is the extent of your receiving of the reality.</P><P>John 16:33 says, "In Me you may have peace." Peace is not found outside of the Lord. When we are in the Lord, we have His peace.</P><P>Philippians 2:1 says, "If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of spirit, if any tenderheartedness and compassions."</P><P>Second Corinthians 12:2 says, "I know a man in Christ." This speaks of a person who is in Christ; his whole being is in Christ.</P><P>If you carefully read the Bible, you will not ask God to do a work on you. If you want God to do a work on you, you will not only be disappointed today and tomorrow; you will be disappointed until the day you die. If the electrical switch is turned off, you cannot expect the lamp to have light. The moment the switch is turned on, immediately there is light. If you do not believe in Christ moment by moment, you will not be victorious. You need the Lord every moment. In Christ you have everything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW TO BE IN CHRIST</H2><P>(1) He who believes into Christ is in Christ. John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that every one who believes into Him would not perish, but would have eternal life." This is a union. When you believe into Him (Christ), your sin becomes His, and He becomes one with you.</P><P>(2) Having believed into Christ, we should be baptized into Christ. Baptism is to be immersed into Christ. Romans 6:3 says, "Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?" The way we are immersed into the water when we are baptized is the way we are immersed into Christ. If a copper coin is put into a bottle of sulfuric acid, the copper coin will melt, and we will not see the copper coin anymore. When we are immersed into Christ, we are melted into Christ and become one with Him. This is faith.</P><P>(3) "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus" (1 Cor. 1:30). God has immersed us into Christ. Inwardly, we believe into Him; outwardly by baptism, we are immersed into Him. God joins us to Christ. God has done this for us. Therefore, we have righteousness, sanctification, and redemption. It is wonderful; we have it all. We have no righteousness in ourselves; Christ is our righteousness. We have no sanctification in ourselves; Christ is our sanctification. We have no redemption in ourselves; Christ is our redemption. Our eyes must be fixed on Christ. May God remove our veils, so that we would see how complete God's accomplishment is.</P><P>Mr. Hudson Taylor once tried hard to overcome. He said, "I am always asking, but God never gives it to me; one day when I read John 15:5, `I am the vine; you are the branches,' I immediately received the light." Later he knelt down and prayed, saying, "I am the most foolish person in the whole world; the overcoming life that I am looking for, I already have." You are a branch; it is not that you want to be a branch. You are a branch; the life is yours already. For many years Mr. Taylor asked to be joined to the tree like a branch. Little did he realize that he was already a branch and already joined to the tree. It was not until the day he received the revelation from God and had genuine faith that he had the victory. Later he was able to accomplish great things for the Lord. Once he was asked to speak at the Keswick Convention, and he related this story. He said, "After I failed, I sought for the overcoming life, only to find that I could never obtain it. But the day I believed, I received it."</P><P>Brothers and sisters, we are not hoping to draw out some sap from the root to nourish us. We are branches of the tree. We do not have to care for anything as long as we are the branches. We do not need to take something from the tree to cultivate ourselves. All we have to do is believe that we are the branches. God has joined us to Christ. Everything that Christ has now belongs to us. If we believe, we will overcome.</P><P>On the one hand, we are baptized into Christ; on the other hand, by means of the bread and the cup, we contact Him. This is the way for His life to freely flow.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>GOD'S WAY OF REDEMPTION</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(A Message on the Lord's Day Morning)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 25</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gal. 4:4-5; Rom. 10:17; Heb. 11:6; Gal. 4:6; John 14:26; 16:13</H1><P>Deep within me I feel the need to give a message on the significance of faith. Hebrews 11:6 says, "But without faith it is impossible to be well pleasing to Him." The most important thing in the entire life of a Christian is to please God. If a Christian does not have faith, he cannot be well pleasing to God. Why is faith so important? I recently looked into a Bible concordance regarding the word faith and found that almost everything was through faith; this is by faith and that is by faith. All of the grace that God has prepared for man is received through man's faith. Faith is so important. God does not grant grace with respect of persons. Many people are obedient and well-behaved, yet God does not grant them much grace. Why is this? We need to see that there are four steps involved in God's way of redemption.</P><P>First, there is the work of Christ. God caused Christ to accomplish redemption for us. Through the death and resurrection of Christ, God accomplished redemption for us.</P><P>Second, God proclaims what He has done through His Word. The Word of God proclaims Christ's accomplished facts.</P><P>Third, man believes in God's Word. We first believe in the Word of God, not the work of Christ. Christ's work satisfied God's heart. Christ fulfilled God's desire. We rely on the work of Christ and believe in the Word of God. Without the Word of God, we cannot believe the work of Christ. Without the Word of God, we cannot understand the work of Christ. Therefore, believing in the Word of God is believing in the work of Christ.</P><P>Fourth, the Holy Spirit applies the accomplishments of Christ to the believers. When the Bible mentions the Holy Spirit, it pays particular attention to His fellowship. The Holy Spirit applies to us what Christ has accomplished. The Holy Spirit is leading us into God's truth. Truth is reality, the reality of all spiritual things. In the Bible, truth indicates Christ and His accomplishments. The Lord says, "I am...the reality" (John 14:6). Truth also refers to the Word of God. The Lord says, "Your word is truth" (17:17). The Holy Spirit is the Spirit of truth. The Holy Spirit ushers us into Christ and His accomplishments. The Holy Spirit also makes the Word of God real to us.</P><P>This is God's way of redemption. If we do not have faith, we do not have anything. Although Christ has accomplished everything and God has spoken, if we do not believe, the Holy Spirit can do nothing and we cannot obtain anything.</P><P>What does Christ's work include?  A few weeks ago I spoke on the riches in Christ and mentioned that sanctification, perfection, freedom from condemnation, deliverance from sins, holiness, pleasing God, etc. are all included in Christ's accomplishments. When Christ died, we died in Him; when Christ resurrected, we resurrected in Him; and when Christ ascended, we ascended in Him. A certain magazine once said, "When Christ was on the cross, not only was His physical body there, but the spiritual body was also there. The body He obtained from Mary was there, and even the mystical body was on the cross." We should not seek to die or look for death, because Christ has accomplished this for us. If we are weak, someone may tell us that we should die, that if we die, we will not sin. But the Word of God tells us that we died nineteen hundred years ago. We have no choice; God has accomplished this for us.</P><P>Sinners cannot be saved through works. Once we realize that salvation is through the work of Christ, we will be at peace. Today many Christians appear to be dead even though they are not dead. They fail today and again tomorrow; all of their efforts are in vain. Brothers and sisters, we are hearing a wrong gospel if it requires us to work. The Bible says that "in Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands, in the putting off of the body of the flesh, in the circumcision of Christ" (Col. 2:11). Christ did this for us. This is the work of Christ. We should see what has been accomplished in Him.</P><P>Christ's accomplishments are for our perfection in Him. The Holy Spirit puts whatever is in Him into us. Christ not only died, but also resurrected. When Christ died, we died; when Christ resurrected, we also resurrected; and when Christ ascended, we also ascended. Our inheritance in Christ is beyond our imagination.</P><P>When we read the Bible, we ought to pay attention to one question: should we pursue the things that are in Christ, or have we already obtained them? Once I asked a brother, who was reading Romans 6, how much he needed to do and how much had already been done concerning death and resurrection. He answered, "I need to die and resurrect." I responded that my Bible did not say that; rather, Romans 6 says that we have died and resurrected. All we need to do is just consecrate.</P><P>Men in the world talk about death and resurrection, but their talk is not based on Christ's accomplishments. Therefore, they can never experience it. Thank God that Christ has died and resurrected. Even though Christ has accomplished this, without God telling us so in the Bible, how could we believe? Without God's Word, none of us would know that Christ died and resurrected. God's Word tells us the facts in Christ. Therefore, we believe in God's Word, not just the work of Christ. How can we believe if we did not see the death of Christ with our own eyes, and some of us do not even know where Israel is. The Word of God, however, has told us that Christ died and resurrected for us. God commanded His servants to write down the accomplishments of Christ so that we could believe.</P><P>It is extremely important to believe in the Word of God. The Bible says, "Every one who believes into Him may have eternal life" (John 3:15). It also says, "Believe into Me," "Believe into My name," etc. What do we believe in? Is believing in the Lord Jesus just believing in His works? Romans 10:17 says, "So faith comes out of hearing, and hearing through the word of Christ." If we do not have the word of Christ, what can we believe? The Word of God brings what is far away near to us. If a person has not laid hold of the Word, I would say that he has not believed in Christ. Without God's Word, what is the basis for our believing? Without God's Word, we only have psychological activities.</P><P>What is the difference between faith and psychology? Psychology is thinking that something exists when nothing, in actuality, has been said. Faith is believing because something has been said. For example, if no one invites me for dinner tonight, I may still say, "I believe that someone will invite me for dinner." This is psychology. It is not faith because no one has invited me. But if someone said that he would like to invite me for dinner tonight and I believe his word, then this is faith, because someone has said it already. Brothers and sisters, we must have the Word of God before we can believe. Without God's Word, we cannot believe. We have never actually seen God putting us on the cross; this is something that God has done. We can believe only if God tells us that we have been crucified.</P><P>How do we know that God's Word is true? We know because what God has done is a fact. What God says is what He has done. If I went to the park yesterday and later said that I had gone to the park, my words would be true because I was at the park. Christ has accomplished His work. The Word of God tells us what Christ has done. As long as we believe, all these works become ours. We do not have to do anything; we only need to believe in God's Word. Without the Word of God, there is no faith.</P><P>Faith is to believe in God's Word. Believing in God's Word is harder than anything else; yet at the same time, it is easier than anything else. This seems contradictory. Yet it is true. So many times we cannot believe. But once we do, we have everything instantly. Our experience confirms this.</P><P>When Mr. Chapman came to Shanghai to preach the gospel, his work was very prevailing. Before he was saved, he was a doctor of divinity. Once after a meeting, Mr. Moody talked to him. Mr. Moody asked him, "Dr. Chapman, are you a saved Christian; are you of Christ?" He answered, "I dare not say so, but I hope that I am of Christ." Mr. Moody read John 3:16 with him. Then Mr. Moody asked him again, "Dr. Chapman, are you a saved Christian; are you of Christ?" He again replied, "I dare not say so, but I hope to be one." Mr. Moody then read John 3:16 once again. When he finished reading, he looked at Dr. Chapman, who was embarrassed by Mr Moody's stare. He said, "I really wish I could say that I am of Christ." Mr. Moody responded in a severe tone, "Dr. Chapman, whose word are you doubting here?" Right then Dr. Chapman realized that he was doubting the Word of God. For the rest of his life, he testified that whatever God's Word says is true. Dr. Chapman thought that he needed to behave before he could go to heaven. But God's Word says that those who believe have eternal life. In Christ, God has accomplished this for us. When we believe the Word, we have the accomplishments. Believing in God's Word is nothing other than believing whatever God has said.</P><P>A president of a Bible school in the United States once said that he could overcome many things. However, there were four or five sins that he committed again and again, and he repented again and again. He told others that his history was a history of repentance. One day he read Romans 6:14, which says, "For sin will not lord it over you, for you are not under the law but under grace." He said to God, "Your Word says that sin will not lord it over me, but my condition shows that sin always has dominion over me. However, today I believe in your Word. I declare that I have overcome my sin." Later, when the same temptation came, he realized that he was about to fall. But he looked to the Word of God, and said to God, "Your Word is true." In this way he overcame those sins for the rest of his life. Brothers and sisters, it is very important to lay hold of the Word of God. When you look at yourself, you are just as corrupted as you were before, and when you look at the circumstances, they are still as difficult as before. But if you believe in God's Word, you will overcome.</P><P>There was a woman whose health was very weak. Her sixteen-year-old son was very naughty and would not behave properly. One day she prayed to God and told Him that she could not bear such a burden. She asked God for a promise, and the Lord gave her the words in Philippians 4:6-7. She believed that what God had said would be accomplished. However, her son became worse year after year. One day a policeman notified her that her son was at the police station because he had been injured by a car. She went there and found her son with blood all over him. Her husband even fainted when he arrived. Some relatives came too. But in the midst of the situation, she was still able to smile. When others asked why her heart was so insensitive, she replied, "God's Word promised me the peace that passes all understanding. Today I encountered something that passes my understanding, and I received the peace that passes all understanding. This is why I can behave this way." Faith is to lay hold of a certain word of God.</P><P>Once I met a patient, and I asked him how he was doing. He said that God would heal him. I said that God would not heal him because he did not have His word. There was another nearsighted brother who needed to get corrective glasses, but someone told him that he should believe God and not get the glasses. He thought that his faith might be bigger than that of others, so he went to pray instead. Later he was asked to preach in an evangelistic meeting. He thought that his eyes would be healed after his preaching, and he asked me to pray for this. I told someone that God would not heal him. He asked me why, and I said because he did not have the Word of God. His faith was not faith, but feeling. What he had was not actually faith, but hope. Without God's Word, how can we believe?</P><P>Christ's work is real. But without the Word of God, everyone in the world will still perish. However, if we have God's Word, the whole world will not be able to overthrow our faith. Once the Lord said to His disciples, "Let us go over to the other side" (Mark 4:35). The Lord slept in the stern of the boat. Suddenly there arose a great windstorm, the waves beat into the boat, and it began to fill up. The disciples woke Him and said to Him, "We are perishing" (v. 38). The Lord arose and rebuked the wind and sea. The wind ceased and there was a great calm. What did the Lord say to the disciples? The Lord said, "Why are you cowardly in this way? How is it that you do not have faith?" (v. 40). Since the Lord gave the order to pass over to the other side, He took the responsibility, regardless of the wind and waves along the way. If the Lord has spoken and we still do not have faith, we are casting His word aside. Suppose I give you a ten dollar bill to make change. How do you know that it is ten dollars? You know because it says so on the bill. Whatever God has said is so. God says it, and it is so. If the Lord orders you to pass over to the other side, all you have to do is go. You can speak to the wind, "Blow as much as you will," and tell the waves, "Beat as much as you can." But when the Lord says to pass over to the other side, you will surely pass over to the other side. If you think that the Lord's word only seems to be true and is not quite true, you will sink to the bottom of the sea with the wind and waves.</P><P>Only the Word of God is true. Even when the environment is against you, the Word of God remains true. You may have difficulties with your family, school, business, or even your self. If you do not believe in God's Word, it is useless for you to pray, even if you pray for several hours. If you do not pray, you will not get anything; and if you pray without believing in God's Word, you still will not get anything. If you cannot believe in God's Word, you need not pray, because the prayer will be a vain effort. If you want to obtain God's grace, it is very important to lay hold of the Word of God. Take care of the believing, and God will take care of the working. If a matter is put before you, you have to pray that God will give you a word concerning this matter. Once you have His word, you can use it to confront any difficulty. The Word of God that you have acquired is the sword of the Holy Spirit. Everything mentioned regarding the armor in Ephesians 6 is defensive; only the sword of the Holy Spirit is offensive. As long as you have the Word of God, everything will be overcome. As long as you have His Word, every hardship will pass away.</P><P>One of my friends once spent all the money she had. While reading the Bible, she spoke to God, "O God, please give me a word. I do not ask that You put a thousand dollars in front of me. I only ask You to give me a word." God reminded her of a passage in Psalm 23. The word she got was, "My cup runs over!" At that moment she was far from running over; she was completely empty. Nevertheless, she had the Word of God, and she wrote a hymn in English, a few lines of which read:</P><P CLASS=HBODY>With Jehovah as my Shepherd, <br>There is always something over!<br>Though we have much hardship,<br>There is always something over!<br>With God as my Treasurer,<br>There is always something over!</P><P>She wrote this hymn and sent it to one of her friends. After a while her friend wrote her a letter in return, saying, "After reading your hymn, I realize that God has really blessed you, seeing that you have so much surplus." The friend did not realize that she was in fact penniless. Meanwhile, was God's word in vain? No. After a couple of days, God supplied her through other people. If we have the Word of God, we have many sources. The raven will supply us; the brook will supply us; a widow with only a handful of meal will supply us. Even without all of these, God can open a heavenly window to supply us from above. This is faith.</P><P>Christ's work has been accomplished, and God has said it in His Word. Once you believe, you have everything. The essence of God's word is the Holy Spirit. When you believe in His word, the Holy Spirit will take the responsibility to apply the reality of this word to you. Once you believe, the Holy Spirit will lead you into Christ and into all that He has accomplished. Christ's work is accomplished, and God has spoken. However, if you do not believe, the Holy Spirit will have no way to apply Christ's accomplishment to you.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, you are clear about what God has done in Christ, and you understand it. But why do you still not have it? It is because you do not have faith. You say you have believed and wonder why you still do not have? But I say that you have not yet believed. If you have faith, the Holy Spirit is responsible for making what you have believed a reality. Knowledge is not sufficient. You need faith in addition to knowledge. How many times have we read a whole chapter of the Bible without believing in one verse? In many things, we lack faith. Once you have faith, the Holy Spirit applies to you what you believe.</P><P>"And God said, Let there be light: and there was light" (Gen. 1:3). Whatever He said, He accomplished. In this universe whatever He says, He will accomplish. In the beginning He spoke, and the universe obeyed Him. Today whenever God speaks, the universe still has to obey Him because no word of God is without His power. This power is the Holy Spirit. Whenever God speaks, the Holy Spirit accomplishes it immediately.</P><P>This is the way a sinner is saved. Whenever a sinner believes the Word of God, the Holy Spirit immediately will give him what Christ has accomplished. Some who were addicted to opium or alcohol experienced an immediate deliverance from these things when they believed in God's word. The only explanation for this is that the Holy Spirit has granted them the power to overcome. I had a classmate who was by nature very tactful; he manipulated the whole class under his hands. Many classmates were afraid of him. Later he was saved, and now he is even one of my co-workers. If one did not know his past, one could never imagine what kind of person he was before. He is what he is today through nothing other than resurrection. The most amazing thing in the world is for a dead person to receive the life of God. After one believes, the Holy Spirit will add what Christ has accomplished to him. Perhaps while he was listening to God's Word, he said, "I believe." Perhaps while he was sitting in the last row, he said, "I believe." Or perhaps while he was walking on the street, he said, "I believe." When he believes, the Holy Spirit adds what Christ has accomplished to him.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, my responsibility is to share this message with you. It would be wonderful if you could believe it. If you would read to God the verse that you heard last week, "In Him also you were circumcised with a circumcision not made with hands" (Col. 2:11), and if you would read the same verse to yourself, you would gain something. You may think that you have already overcome a few times and that you are now trustworthy. But I have to say, "No." Only the Word of God is trustworthy; your experience is not trustworthy. May God work among us, so that we can believe in what His Word says literally. The more we believe in what He says, the more we gain what He says. May the Lord bless us.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 26</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN THE MIDST OF DIFFERENT<br>PRESSURES AND TRIALS</H2><P>This issue was completed in the midst of much suffering. I know that Satan and his evil spirits are very busy, for he is aware that the message of The Present Testimony is harmful to him. Therefore, both the message and the one who preaches it are the objects of his attacks. For this reason I beg all the brothers in the Lord to supply me with more prayers.</P><P>The various temptations, oppressions, misunderstandings, and hardships which come can weaken even the physically strongest one, to say nothing of someone like me whose earthly tabernacle is often being shaken. It is difficult to become a martyr, but it is also difficult to become an apostate. It is difficult to be faithful but even more difficult to lose chastity. To restrain our lips is indeed painful, but to vindicate ourselves does not bring joy either. An evil name brings sorrow, but a good name does not necessarily bring gladness. We care only to work faithfully, keeping the first love and maintaining a single eye while waiting for the Lord's return. Did not the Lord tell us from the outset that we must bear the cross and encounter sufferings on this earth?</P><P>Watchman<br>August 15, 1932</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>PREFACE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LATENT POWER OF THE SOUL</H1><P CLASS=INDENT1>(Editor's Note: The Latent Power of the Soul was published in Issue Nos. 26 and 27 of The Present Testimony. The following preface was added when the two articles were republished later as a separate book by the Gospel Book Room.)</P><P>In 1924 when I first called the attention of God's children to the distinction between the spirit and soul, some well-intentioned brothers thought that this was only a dispute over words and that it had no real significance. Little did they realize that we were not disputing words but what lies behind the words. The spirit and the soul are two distinct, yet not separate, organs. One belongs to God, while the other belongs to man. You can call them by whatever name you want, but in essence the two are different. The danger with believers is to confuse the spirit with the soul and the soul with the spirit. In so doing, they are deceived into accepting the counterfeits of the evil spirits, with the result that they confuse God's work. This is the reason why we have drawn men's attention to the subject.</P><P>This message was originally intended to be written after The Spiritual Man was finished. But because of my physical weakness and the heavy burden of my work, I delayed until last year to publish it in The Present Testimony. Now, at the request of readers, I have put out this single volume.</P><P>The greatest benefit in knowing the difference between the spirit and the soul lies in the fact that one can know the latent power of the soul and how it counterfeits the power of the Holy Spirit. This kind of knowledge is not theoretical but practical in helping people to walk in God's way.</P><P>Last night I read a word by Mr. Meyer which he spoke in a meeting shortly before he died. He said:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>It is an amazing fact that never before has there been as much spiritualism found outside the church of Christ as there is today. In addition, there are many tongue speaking movements which may all be the soul counterfeiting the spirit. I do not wish to argue. But it is a fact that in places where human mentality is low, the counterfeit work of the soul is quite prevailing. At present, the atmosphere is filled with the commotion of all kinds of counterfeits. The Lord seems to be calling His church to rise to a higher ground.</P><P>The situation today is perilous. May we "prove all things. Hold fast to what is good" (1 Thes. 5:21).

The merchandise mentioned here began with gold and silver and ended with the souls of men. Gold, silver, horses, and chariots are merchandise and can be bought and sold. Slaves can also be bought and sold. This means that the human body can be bought and sold. In addition to these things, the souls of men can also be bought and sold as merchandise.</P><P>First Corinthians 15:45 says, "So also it is written, `The first man, Adam, became a living soul'; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." The proper translations of the words soul and spirit were clearly explained in the appendix of The Spiritual Man.</P><P>First Corinthians 15:46 says, "But the spiritual is not first but the soulish, then the spiritual."</P><P>Genesis 2:7 says, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground, and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life; and man became a living soul." When God breathed into man's nostrils the breath of life, he became a living soul.</P><P>During the past two years, I was deeply burdened to convey this profound message. But this message is very hard and very deep. It is hard for both the speaker to speak it as well as for the listener to understand it. Therefore, when I was writing The Spiritual Man, I did not include this message, "The Soul," in chapter three. I feel, however, that I should speak on this topic. After I read some books and magazines, contacted some unbelievers, and observed the present condition and trend of society and the church, I sensed how precious is the truth that we know. Considering the situation today, I cannot help but feel that I should pass on what we have received because, if I do not do this, I am hiding the light under the bushel.</P><P>Today I want to talk about the relationship between spiritual warfare and the last generation. This is the subject which I was reluctant to put into the book, The Spiritual Man. In that book we explained clearly the difference between the spirit, the soul, and the body. Some of you may not have read this book. Therefore, I would like to repeat this briefly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br>THE SPIRIT, SOUL, AND BODY</H2><P>Genesis 2:7 says, "And the Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground." This is man's body. "And breathed into his nostrils the breath of life." The "breath of life" is the spirit God gave man, and this is Adam's spirit. We can see that man's body was made of dust and man's spirit was given by God. After God breathed into Adam the breath of life, man became a living soul. Actually, the spirit, soul, and body are three separate things. It is incorrect to say that man has only the soul and the body. First Thessalonians 5:23 says, "And the God of peace Himself sanctify you wholly, and may your spirit and soul and body be preserved complete." The spirit is given by God, the soul is a living soul, and the body is formed by God. According to the world's common understanding, the soul is our personality. When the spirit is joined to the body, there is a living soul. The main feature of the angels is that they are spirits; the main feature of the animals such as the beasts is that they are flesh. Human beings have a spirit and body; but our main feature is neither the spirit nor the body, but the soul. We have a living soul. This is why the Bible calls man a soul after the creation. For example, in mentioning Jacob's household of seventy people that went down to Egypt, Genesis 46:27 says, "All the souls of the house of Jacob, which came into Egypt, were threescore and ten." In other places, when the Bible relates to us the number of people saved, it says that these are the number of souls saved. The soul stands for the human personality; it is that which distinguishes us as man.</P><P>What are the functions of the spirit, soul, and body? In chapter one of The Spiritual Man, we explained this matter. I was very glad one day to find a book called The Spirit of Christ written by Andrew Murray. In its appendix was an explanation of the spirit, the soul, and the body in exactly the same way. Therefore, today I would like to read Andrew Murray's word:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>In the history of man's creation we read, "The Lord God formed man of the dust of the ground": thus was his body made "and breathed into his nostrils the breath" or spirit "of life": thus his spirit came from God; "and man became a living soul." The Spirit quickening the body made man a living soul, a living person with the consciousness of himself. [We know that only man has the consciousness of himself; wood and stone have no self consciousness.] The soul was the meeting-place, the point of union between body and spirit. Through the body, man, the living soul, stood related to the external world of sense, could influence it, or be influenced by it. Through the spirit he stood related to the spiritual world and the Spirit of God, whence he had his origin; could be the recipient and the minister of its life and power. Standing thus midway between two worlds, belonging to both, the soul had the power of determining itself, of choosing or refusing the objects by which it was surrounded, and to which it stood related.</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>In the constitution of these three parts of man's nature, the spirit, as linking him with the Divine, was the highest; the body, connecting him with the sensible and animal, the lowest; intermediate stood the soul, partaker of the nature of the others, the bond that united them and through which they could act on each other. Its work, as the central power, was to maintain them in their due relation; to keep the body, as the lowest, in subjection to the spirit. (The Spirit of Christ. Fort Washington, Pa., Christian Literature Crusade, 1963. Note C: The Place of the Indwelling, pp. 227-228.)</P><P>I quote this to show you that not only do we differentiate in this way; even Andrew Murray clearly differentiated the spirit, soul, and body.</P><P>What is the spirit? Whatever causes us to sense God and have a relationship with God is the spirit. What is the soul? Anything that causes us to contact the self and have self-awareness is the soul. What is the body? Anything that causes us to contact the world is the body. The notes in the Scofield Reference Bible say the same thing: the spirit gives us God-consciousness, the soul gives us self-consciousness, and the body gives us world-consciousness. Beasts and horses are not conscious of God because they do not have a spirit; they are only conscious of themselves. The body causes us to feel and see the physical world, to feel hot or cold, etc. I think we are all familiar with this, and there is no need for me to speak too much on it.</P><P>The above covers the functions of the spirit, soul, and body. Now I come to the biggest question, which was also mentioned in the book The Spiritual Man. Many people think that they should pay attention to the matter of the spirit, soul, and body simply because it is related to their spiritual life. However, this matter is not only related to our spiritual life but to our spiritual work and warfare as well. They think that Adam was more or less the same as we are now, even before he fell. They think that we are quite similar to each other because Adam was a man and we are men. They think that Adam was incapable of doing what we are incapable of doing. Whatever Adam was incapable of doing, we are also incapable of doing. They do not realize, however, that what Adam was capable of doing, we are incapable of doing. I am afraid that we still do not know what Adam's abilities were. If we read the Bible carefully, we will see what Adam was really like before his fall.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ADAM'S AUTHORITY AND ABILITY</H2><P>Genesis 1:27-28 says, "So God created man in his own image, in the image of God created he him; male and female created he them. And God blessed them, and God said unto them, Be fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion over the fish of the sea, and over the fowl of the air, and over every living thing that moveth upon the earth." God said that man would have dominion over all the earth. Friends, do you know the size of the earth? Have you ever thought about this? What do you mean when you ask a servant to manage two houses? It means that the servant has the ability to manage them; that is why the master commits the management to the servant. It would not be possible for all the houses in this Wen-teh Lane to be managed by one servant because a servant cannot do what is beyond his ability. Even a demanding master will only ask a servant to do a little more than the servant is capable of doing. Let me ask you -would God ask Adam to manage what he could not manage? If Adam could manage the whole earth, his ability must not have been the same as ours today. He had the strength, ability, and capacity to do it. Everything inside and outside of Adam was a fresh ability he received from the Creator. Although we cannot say that Adam's power was billions of times more than ours, it had to have been at least millions of times more than ours in order for him to do what was assigned to him. Otherwise, he surely could not have done what was assigned to him. But for us, even managing an area as little as Wen-teh Lane, and sweeping it three times a day, totally exhausts us, and we find it hard to straighten our backs after sweeping. How could we possibly rule the earth? Adam not only had dominion over the whole earth, but also had dominion over the fish of the sea, the fowl of the air, and the cattle. Having dominion does not mean just sitting there. It means to dominate and manage. From this point, therefore, we see that Adam must have had extraordinary abilities which were superior to ours today. We may think that this is something new; actually, this is the teaching in the Bible. Before Adam's fall, he had the ability to do many things without getting tired. After his fall, God said to him that in the sweat of his face he would eat bread. From this we know that Adam worked without sweat before his fall. This ability is the fresh ability that emanates from God's creation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ADAM'S INTELLIGENCE AND MEMORY</H2><P>Genesis 2:19 says, "And out of the ground the Lord God formed every beast of the field, and every fowl of the air; and brought them unto Adam to see what he would call them: and whatsoever Adam called every living creature, that was the name thereof." Friends, is not this something new? If we look into an encyclopedia and read all the names under the dog family, we would say, "I do not know them all. I cannot remember all these names." But Adam could name all the birds and beasts. We should realize how much intelligence he had. If some of us with less intelligence were to study zoology, we would not succeed because we cannot even remember all the names. However, Adam not only remembered the zoological names, he invented them. Now we can begin to see how full and perfect Adam's intellectual power was. Do we even know how many millions of different animals there are? Yet Adam could name them one by one!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ADAM'S MANAGING AND KEEPING ABILITY</H2><P>Genesis 2:15 says, "And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it." Let us put the matter of having dominion over the whole earth aside and consider what God told Adam to do. God told him to dress and keep the garden of Eden. Dressing is more organized than managing. How big was the garden of Eden? Genesis 2:10-14 mentions four rivers: Pison, Gihon, Hiddekel, and Euphrates, which went out of Eden and covered four regions. Can we imagine the size of the garden? We do not know how many times larger it was than Hon-kou Park or Chiao-Feng Park in Shanghai. In order to dress four regions covered by four rivers, how much ability did Adam need? Not only did he have to dress them, but he had to keep them as well. Keeping is guarding the garden from the enemy. Therefore, Adam must have had extraordinary ability in those days. He must have been a person with supernatural abilities. All these abilities were in Adam's soul. Adam's abilities must have been unimaginable. According to our eyes, Adam's abilities must have been supernatural and miraculous; but to Adam himself, these abilities were merely human abilities, not miracles. They were natural abilities to him, not supernatural abilities.</P><P>Did Adam ever exhaust all of his abilities? According to what I see from Genesis, Adam did not exhaust his abilities. After Adam was freshly created by God, and before he could even demonstrate all of his abilities, he fell. When the enemy seduced Eve with some bait, what did Satan promise her? The bait used by the enemy was the ability to know good and evil like God by taking in the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Satan's promise was to be like God. He told Eve that even though she had these abilities, there was still a big gap between her and God. He told her that once she ate the fruit, she would have God's authority, wisdom, and strength. On that day Eve was tempted and failed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE POWER GOD ENDOWED TO ADAM</H2><P>We are not trying to be curious; we are merely trying to see what God had given Adam. Genesis 1:26 says, "And God said, Let us make man in our image, after our likeness." The Hebrew word image means man's outside appearance; it can be translated "appearance." In its literal meaning the word likeness is not much different from the word image, and appears to be repetitious. However, likeness in Hebrew means not only the physical likeness but also moral and spiritual likeness. It is not a physical word, but a metaphysical word, a spiritual word. I am not that good with the Hebrew language and can only consult the Hebrew dictionary. One Western lady, Mrs. ______, was very good in Hebrew. She said likeness in Hebrew means "to make someone like something." This interpretation does not sound like a good sentence; what it actually means is "to become alike." In other words, it means to become like God. God created man in order that man would become like Him. God's purpose was that Adam would be like Him. The devil said, "You may be like God." God said, "You need to become like Me." This is God's purpose. Before his fall, there was a potential ability inside of Adam to be like God. Within him, there was a latent power that made it possible for him to be like God. His outside appearance looked like God, but morally He wants whatever is metaphysical to be like Him as well. (I use the word morally to mean everything beyond the physical realm, and not just good human behavior.) From this we can see the great loss that man incurred from the fall. Many people may have never thought about the immensity of this loss.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MAN'S FALL</H2><P>Adam was a soul. His spirit and body were both joined to his soul. Therefore, the astonishing abilities mentioned above were all included in Adam's soul. The power that came from Adam's living soul, which was a product of his spirit and body, was unimaginable and supernatural according to today's eyes. When he fell, these abilities, which were different from ours, were lost. However, this does not mean that they are gone. Rather, these abilities, though present inside man, became dormant and unusable. By Genesis 6, after man's fall, he had become flesh. The flesh surrounded man's whole being and subdued him. Man was originally a living soul. But, through the fall, he became flesh. Man's soul was originally under the spirit's control; it is now under the flesh's control. Therefore, God said that He would no longer strive with man because he had become flesh. In its original language, the Bible calls man the flesh. When God talked about men, God no longer called them men, but flesh. In God's eyes, all of them had become just pieces of flesh. Therefore, the Bible says that all flesh was corrupt (v. 12) and that God would not pour His Spirit upon man's flesh anymore (Exo. 30:32). In another place, it says that no flesh can be justified by the works of law (Rom. 3:20). From that point on, all men were subjected under the flesh.</P><P>Why should I mention this here? I mention this because all the things in Revelation 18 will take place in the last age. I also mentioned at the beginning the souls of men. The souls of men will become a commodity that can be bought and sold in Babylon. Why will the souls of men become a commodity that can be sold and bought? It is because Satan and Antichrist want the souls of men to be the instruments for their activities in the last age. Adam fell in the garden of Eden, and his power also fell. Adam did not lose his power through the fall; the power was merely buried within him. When Adam became flesh, the flesh locked up all the wonderful powers inside him. This went on generation after generation. The original power which Adam had, became a latent power that was inherited by his descendants. This became a kind of latent power. Man did not lose this power; this power was merely bound up inside man's flesh. Today everyone in the world still has Adam's power. But it is concealed inside and cannot be expressed freely. All this power is in a man's soul, in the same way that it was in Adam's soul. Because the soul is surrounded by the flesh, the power is also surrounded by the flesh. Satan's work today is to stir up man's soul and develop the latent power within his soul, so that he can deceive people and cause people to believe that this soulish power is spiritual power. The reason I mention this is to show you the special relationship between man's soul and Satan's work in this last age.</P><P>We have seen that Adam had a special or supernatural power. Actually, this power was not anything extraordinary. But to us today, it seems special and supernatural. Later, when Adam fell, the power fell with him as well. Before his fall, Adam could very spontaneously exercise this power. It was in Adam's soul. When Adam fell, the power was concealed by the shell of the flesh. In the beginning, when Adam's soul possessed this power, the body was his helper. When the soul fell, this power was suppressed and surrounded by the shell of the flesh. What Satan is trying to do now is break the shell of the flesh and develop the power within man's soul. In this way he will control man's soul. Many people do not understand this and think that this power is from God. As a result, they are deceived.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FROM THE RELIGIOUS PERSPECTIVE</H2><P>Not only Christians, but Babylonians, Arabians, Buddhists, Taoists, and Hindus, all try their best to release everything concealed in the soul which we inherited from Adam. No matter what religion, no matter how different the practices, methods, and procedures, there is a common principle behind these practices: they all try to overcome the outward flesh and freely release the soulish power from every kind of bondage. Some practices aim at destroying the obstructions of the body. Others try to combine the body and the soul. Still others train and strengthen the soul to overcome the body. Despite all of these differences, the principle is the same. If you do not know this, you will be deceived. I do not know how some know of the marvelous power that is dormant within the flesh, and I do not know how some discovered that this power was bound up in the flesh and that it will turn them into a so-called "super being" or "buddha" once it is released and its miraculous power is manifested. Perhaps they were told by the devil or the evil spirits. Although their theories are somewhat different, the principle behind their teachings is the same: to release the soulish power by some special means. They may not use the term "the soulish power," but the fact is there. For example, Taoists, Buddhists, and some Christian sects, such as the Charismatics and Christian Scientists (this one has branches in Shanghai and Tientsin), have special and supernatural power to perform seemingly miraculous things. Some claim that they can heal diseases, and some even predict the future.</P><P>For example, in Taoism there are cultivation techniques and breathing exercises. These are some of the simpler exercises. Then there is meditation. They all have one principle in common, to put the body in subjection to the soul for the purpose of releasing the power of the soul. This is why many miraculous things happen in Taoism. Many of these things are facts, and we cannot discredit them as mere superstition. Buddhism was originally atheistic and Sakyamuni was an atheist. This is the common conclusion of many Buddhist researchers and critics. Sakyamuni believed in reincarnation as well as a nirvana beyond reincarnation. He believed that when a man frees himself of everything, he will transcend over all to become a buddha. Today I am not teaching Buddhism. My purpose is to explain why there are many miraculous things in Buddhism and how these miraculous things come about. The Buddhists speak of escape from the world. Their monks abstain from marriage. They prohibit killing and the eating of meat. They meditate, and they practice asceticism. In the end, some even abstain from food altogether. Many senior monks can tell the past and predict the future. They perform many miracles through Buddhist practices. In moments of inspiration, they can predict the future. Behind all of these things is one principle. Buddhists try by every kind of abstinence and asceticism to break the biological and physical bondage, so that the soulish power may be released. Even the simplest kind of meditation is a way to break the bondage of the flesh and develop the power of the soul. Several friends of my father belonged to the Common Improvement Club. These people have rules of meditation, etc. They say that when they reach a certain level, they see a certain amount of light. The higher the level they achieve, the brighter the light they see. I believe all these are true reports. What they have experienced is the release from the bondage of the body and the acquisition of the power Adam had before the fall. This is not surprising at all.</P><P>The popular modern-day Church of Christ, Scientist, was founded by Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy. She denied the existence of sickness, pain, sin, and death (but she has already died), saying that man should not have any disease. If a man becomes sick, all he needs to do is say, "I am not sick," and he will not be sick. This means that if he believes that he is not sick, he will not be sick. The same is true with respect to sin. If a man believes that he has no sin, there is no sin. They believe that when a man trains his will, thought, and emotion to the point that he can deny the existence of these things and proclaim them as false and deceiving, he will indeed find that they do not exist. When they started to preach this, many people and many doctors were against it. They thought that if this were true, all of the doctors would be out of a job. When they investigated those who were supposedly healed in the Church of Christ, Scientist, they found that many were indeed healed. They could not overturn the facts, and more and more people believed and joined them. Even some famous scientists and doctors have believed. They have believers not only in England and the U.S., but also in China, where they have set up branch organizations. This should not be at all surprising because Adam did have great and immense power in his soul. As long as a man can release this soulish power from his flesh, he will experience these things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FROM THE SCIENTIFIC PERSPECTIVE</H2><P>We need to see the power of the soul from the scientific perspective. There have been unprecedented developments in the field of psychology in modern times. What is psychology? Psychology is the study of the soul. The words psychology and psychiatry in every nation come from the two Greek words psyche and logos. Psyche becomes psycho and logos becomes logy. Psyche is the word used for soul in the Bible. Therefore, a man's psyche or his psychology is his soul, and psychology and psychiatry are but the study of the soul. Modern-day scientific research on psychology is a study of what is taking place in the soul. It is limited only to the soul and has nothing to do with the spirit. Modern parapsychology began with Franz Anton Mesmer. His first discovery was made in 1778 and is now known as mesmerism. Since Mesmer's days, his students surpassed him and discovered much more. Many discoveries were too miraculous to believe. His method was to develop the latent power within man. For example, the so-called clairvoyance, or seeing or sensing of something happening thousands of miles away, was taught by Mesmer's students.</P><P>One book said that "mesmerism is the rock from which all mental sciences...were hewn." Before Mesmer, the study of psychology was not considered an independent science; it was only a part, and a minor part, of natural science. Later, because of the discoveries, it became a system all by itself.</P><P>I would like you to pay attention, not to study psychology, but to know the miraculous things discovered by psychology. These discoveries are but the development of part of the latent power of the soul that was hidden in Adam's soul after his fall. What is a latent power? You have to realize that God did not take back Adam's miraculous power after the fall; this power fell together with Adam. This is the reason why the devil can particularly utilize this power. This power was locked up in the body and has been restricted. The power is there, but it cannot be released. This is why we call it the latent power.</P><P>The phenomena of our human life, such as the ability to speak and think, are quite remarkable; but within us there is still another latent power which is not developed and which is concealed. If this power was released, it would demonstrate far more remarkable phenomena than that which we see today. The supernatural things discovered by the psychologists did not come because they had the power to communicate with spirits, but because they released the existing latent power of the soul through some means. Ever since psychologists discovered the key to unlock the great potential in man's psyche, they have discovered numerous things which psychiatric power can perform.</P><P>Mesmer had a student who discovered clairvoyance through mesmerism-style hypnosis in 1784. Clairvoyance enables a person to see something that normal people cannot see with their physical eyes. One of his students also discovered telepathy, through which they were able to know through their mental power what was in other peoples' minds. These phenomena were discovered by Mesmer's students. Soon after this, hypnotism, neurology, and psychometry were discovered. Hypnotism first puts someone to sleep, then the hypnotists give suggestions to the one being hypnotized, and the hypnotized one thinks, speaks, or acts according to the suggestions. Not only can a man be hypnotized, but some animals can also be hypnotized. Psychiatry is a method of healing illness through hypnotism; it is a method of removing illness through man's own psyche. Psychometry is the independent action of man's psyche apart from his body. The psychometric senses of the one who practices it enable him to know everything of the past. Besides these, there were other discoveries as well.</P><P>Another technique was called statuvolism, in which the subject controls his own will and throws it out of his body to any distance he pleases. He can eat, drink, and feel outside his own body and can do everything that a man can do within his own body. This kind of knowledge became more and more developed. By 1847 it became more advanced. Once a man came out of a hypnotic state and discovered what he called pathetism, in which a man can release his own power and withdraw himself from the consciousness of pain, as well as cure diseases. Later this became a special branch of study as well.</P><P>At first, men did not believe or agree with these discoveries. But since many miraculous things happened and were true, these things became established as a special branch of science. Many miraculous things were considered as natural phenomena. Of course, to us, they are indeed natural, for they are but the development of the latent power concealed through the fall of Adam. If you exercise your will enough, you can manifest yourself outside of your body also.</P><P>Psychologists say that there is great power locked up within man, that within him, there is self-regulating power, creative power, constructive power, faith power, interest-arousing power, and even rejuvenating power (the power to regain youth). These are powers that can be developed by man. One psychology book even said that "human beings are God, and God is locked up inside of us. We can be God when we release the very God within us." These words sound exactly like Satan's speaking.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A COMMON PRINCIPLE</H2><P>Whether in China, Europe, or the United States, and whether it is breathing exercises, asceticism, meditations, hypnosis, predictions, telepathy, or pathetism, they all cultivate the inward power and its expressions. I think you all have heard of many miraculous things done through hypnotism. In China there are many fortune-tellers who have done many things that we are all familiar with. Every day they can only see a few clients. Their skill comes from much cultivation and exercise. Their fortune-tellings are surprisingly accurate. Some other techniques developed by Taoism and Buddhism also perform miraculous things. Although there are many counterfeits, there are also many true supernatural manifestations. There is no other explanation except that these people have either stumbled upon a way, or are instructed by evil spirits, to release the power to perform extraordinary acts through certain exercises. Ordinary men do not know that this power is within them. Those with some scientific knowledge know that this power is within them, but they do not know where it lies. We, who have been taught by God, know that this power is the latent power within man's soul. The power became fallen when Adam fell and is now locked up in the flesh. This power is fallen, and God has ordained that man should no longer use this power. However, Satan likes to develop this latent power and make man realize the many riches within him. Satan makes man think that he is God and thus fulfills his promise that man "shall be as gods" (Gen. 3:5). Consequently, man worships himself, and indirectly Satan, and loses his position before God. Therefore, Satan is behind all study of psychology. He is trying his best to utilize the latent power of the soul to fulfill his purpose. All those who try to develop their soulish power cannot avoid being utilized by and being close to the evil spirits.</P><P>Mr. Pember indicated, from another point of view, that once men can do this they can communicate with the devil. He was very knowledgeable in this aspect and had many such experiences. He said that there are two methods by which men can communicate with the devil. The first is to stir up the latent power, and the second is to be possessed by the demons. Today we will pay special attention to the first way which is to stir up the latent power. Mr. Pember said that very few people can stir up their latent power. Many people cannot do this because this requires the soul to be in control of the body and be freed from the control of the body. This is exactly what we have said. We have studied the Buddhists' contemplation, meditation, etc.; the Taoists' practice of body-relaxation, meditation, breathing exercise, etc.; the hypnotists' cogitation, mind-concentration, etc.; the "silent sitting" of the Common Improvement Club; and other kinds of breathing, meditation, intoning, silence, mind- concentrating, thought-denial, and hundreds of other similar activities. Although their knowledge and religious beliefs are different, the principle is the same. What they are doing is nothing but bringing men's disordered minds, wavering emotions, and feeble wills to an empty state and, at the same time, subduing the outward flesh. In this way, it becomes possible to release the latent power of the soul. The reason the latent power of the soul is not manifested in everyone is that not everyone can break down the barriers of his flesh or bring his psychological condition to a completely void state. People today are simply developing the inner latent power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SOME FACTS</H2><P>When I was in Singapore a few years ago, I met an Indian friend who was doing a great deal of work there. He said that he had a Hindu friend who could reveal the secrets of others and that this friend was right every time. One day he invited his Hindu friend home to try him out. His friend was able to name everything stored in the drawer. Later he asked his Hindu friend to wait outside while he wrapped a very important thing in cloth and paper and put it into a box. Then he put the box into the drawer and locked the drawer. When his friend came back, he was able to accurately say what was inside the drawer. This is the function of the soulish power; it can see through all kinds of physical obstacles.</P><P>Mrs. Penn-Lewis published the following in the Overcomer magazine:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>I once met a man in North India, who had access to the highest circles of society in Simla, the summer seat of the Government of India, who told me one evening of his connection with the Mahatmas in India and in other countries of Asia. He said that he knew of great political events weeks and months before they came to pass. "I do not depend for news on telegrams and newspapers. They only record past events; we know events before they take place," he said. How can a man in London know the events happening in India, and vice-versa? It was explained to me that it was through "soul-force" being projected by men who knew the secret of the Mahatmas. (Overcomer magazine for 1921-23, quoted in Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis's Soul and Spirit. Poole, Dorset, England, Overcomer Literature Trust, 1968, pp. 55-56.)</P><P>Mr. Pember also said that many Buddhists could see other people's minds, subdue evil spirits, perform works through soulish power, accelerate the growth of plants, quench fires, and subdue wild beasts. They could speak to others outside of themselves and even touch others. They could exhibit their spiritual bodies in an exact likeness of that of the flesh, and even create the likeness of physical objects, as if creating something out of nothing. However, a monk with this kind of ability must go through long periods of training.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CHRISTIAN'S ATTITUDE TOWARD THESE MATTERS</H2><P>Friends, all of the miraculous things in religion and science are manifestations of a person's latent power and are utilized by the evil spirits. They have one common principle, which is to break down the barriers of the flesh and release the soulish power. We (Christianity) are different from them because all our miracles are done by God through the Holy Spirit. However, Satan is utilizing soulish power to express his supernatural abilities and make man as God. The power of the soul is now a tool of Satan's work. Satan works through this. Everything of God is void of soulish power. When we were regenerated, we were born of the Holy Spirit. Everything of God is done through the Holy Spirit and our regenerated spirit. God will never use soulish power. Ever since Adam's fall, God has prohibited man from using the power he had before. This is why the Lord Jesus often said that we should lose the soul-life, the power of the soul. I have spoken before on the salvation of the soul, but I have never mentioned what I am mentioning here. God wants us to totally abandon our soulish power. We cannot say that the works of wonders that others perform are all counterfeits; I admit that many of them are real. However, these phenomena all come from the latent power of the soul after Adam's fall. We Christians must be very careful in this last age. We must not purposely or unconsciously stir up the latent power of the soul.</P><P>Now let us come back to the verses we just read. We have seen that Satan and his followers, the evil spirits, will buy and sell men's soulish power in the last generation. This means that the whole world will be filled up with the latent power of the soul. One correspondent of the Overcomer magazine said, "The forces of psyche (soul) are arrayed against the forces of pneuma (spirit)" (op. cit., p. 55). All those who have spiritual discernment and perception can feel that this is true. The power of the soul is coming toward us like a turbulent tide. Satan is utilizing science (psychology, psychiatry), religions, and some ignorant churches (which inordinately pursue supernatural manifestations and manipulate supernatural gifts in an unscriptural way) to saturate this world with the power of darkness. This is simply Satan's preparation for the manifestation of Antichrist at the end of the world. A truly spiritual person (one who rejects soulish power) will feel that the opposing evil spirits around him are much more intense than before and that darkness is everywhere. He will feel that it is hard to press on. However, this is the necessary process through which God prepares His overcomers for the rapture.</P><P>I have mentioned all the above things to show you what soulish power can do and what it really is. Prior to the Lord's coming back, similar things will increase, perhaps a hundred times more than before. Satan will perform many unprecedented works of wonder through the power of the soul and deceive God's chosen people. We are getting closer and closer to the time of the great apostate. Mrs. Penn-Lewis said:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>The momentum is increasing rapidly, the hand of the Arch-enemy of God and man is on the helm, and the world is rushing to the dark hour, when, for a brief period, Satan will actually be the "god of this age", ruling through a superman whose "parousia" (appearance) cannot long be delayed (op. cit., p. 69).</P><P>What is the power of the soul? Any believer who receives the teachings of the Lord and the enlightening of God's Spirit knows that this power is the power of Hades. It is spreading out into all the nations of the world to deceive them, making the world an extremely dangerous place.</P><P>Satan is now utilizing the power of the soul to replace the gospel of God and the power of the gospel. He is blinding the eyes of men's hearts and causing religious people to believe in his bloodless religion through the wonder of the soulish power. The fact that today several billion people believe in Buddhism and Taoism is a good example of this. Satan is using psycho-scientific discoveries to cause people to doubt the value of all the supernatural things in Christianity and think that these are the same as the miracles other religions perform; but they are simply psychological, latent powers. On the one hand, Satan is using these things to replace Christ's redemption. Hypnotism is pioneering the way to try to reform men's bad habits and evil nature. On the other hand, Satan is busy in the church, performing many miracles which issue from him and leading God's children astray.</P><P>As God's children we must know the difference between the spirit and soul. Only then will we be protected. If there is no deep work of the cross applied to the Adamic life, and if there is no real life union with the resurrected Lord through the Holy Spirit, we will unconsciously develop our soulish power. Mrs. Penn-Lewis said:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>"Soul-force" versus "Spirit-force" is the battleground today. The Body of Christ is by the energy of the Holy Spirit within her, advancing heavenward. The atmosphere of the world is thickening with psychic currents behind which are massed the aerial foes. The only safety for the child of God is an experimental knowledge of the life in union with Christ wherein he dwells with Christ in God, above the poisonous air in which the prince of the power of the air carries on his work. The Blood of Christ is for cleansing. The Cross of Christ is for identification in death. The Power of the Risen Ascended Lord by the Holy Ghost, continually declared, laid hold of and wielded, will alone bring the members of the Body through in victory to join the Ascended Head (op. cit., p. 70).</P><P>Today my desire is to let us know the source of the soulish power and its function. We will speak on the rest of the subject next time. May God show us that where this soulish power is, there are the evil spirits. We should reject whatever is from the self and accept only what is from the Holy Spirit. In this last age may we particularly refuse the latent power of the soul, so that we will not fall into Satan's hands. The soulish power, through the fall of Adam, has come under Satan's authority and has become the tool for his work. For this reason we should be particularly careful, or we will be deceived by Satan.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LATENT POWER OF THE SOUL</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 27</H2><P>We have seen that, when God created Adam, Adam had a certain kind of supernatural and miraculous power. Later on, this miraculous power fell as a result of Adam's fall. Those who are ignorant think that after Adam's fall, all the miraculous power was lost. But the facts of modern psychology prove that Adam's initial power was not lost; rather, it was hidden in his soul. During the past five or six thousand years, some people, though not many, have been able to demonstrate this kind of power, even those who have not believed in the Lord Jesus. In the past century, however, more people have been able to demonstrate this kind of power. In the previous message I mentioned many examples and cited much evidence. This evidence is enough to prove that Adam's initial power was only hidden within his flesh and not lost. Today I would like to talk about the relationship of the soul's latent power to Christians. If we do not understand this relationship, we will not know its danger and how to be on the alert. I would ask us to pay special attention to the following four matters.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FOUR FACTS</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. There Is Unlimited and Miraculous Power within Adam</H2><P>We call this power the soul's power. The facts discovered in today's psychology prove that all the miraculous power is still within man. Since Mesmer's discoveries in 1778, many forms of the latent power within man, whether they are manifested in psychology, in Christian Science, or in other sciences, have been discovered, and we know that they are just the power latent within man's soul. Even in Buddhism and Taoism, various inventions including breathing, asceticism, meditating, and numerous miracles prove that the latent power inherited from Adam is still within man's soul. We should remember that this power was in man before man's fall. After man's fall, this power still remains; the only difference is that it has become a latent power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. Satan's Goal Is to Rule over the Power<br>within Man's Soul</H2><P>Satan knew that within man's soul there was a great power which could do many things. He did not want God to rule over this power in man; instead, he wanted to rule over man himself and utilize this power to do many things. In the garden of Eden, his purpose in tempting Adam and Eve was to have the authority to rule over this power.</P><P>In the past I have talked about the spiritual meanings of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and the tree of life. The meaning of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is independence; it is to act independently. The meaning of the tree of life is to depend on God. The tree of life reveals that Adam's original life was only a human life; Adam still needed to depend on God and receive God's life in order to live. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil, on the other hand, means that man does not need to depend on God; he can act, live, and bring forth fruit by himself. I mention this matter again because I want us to see the very cause of Adam and Eve's fall. If we see this, we will know what we now need to do. If we utilized and manifested the latent power in Adam, we also could perform many works of wonders. But we have to ask whether it is all right to have this kind of manifestation.</P><P>Satan is fully aware that this strange power is latent within man. Therefore, he tried to tempt man to become independent and lose his trust in God. The fall in the garden of Eden was nothing less than the separation of man from God, and man taking action independent from God. By tempting man to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, Satan caused man to not depend on God and instead do things on his own. He caused man to depend on his own ability to accomplish things. If we know the story of the fall in Eden, we will understand Satan's purpose. He desires to gain man's soul. When man failed, all his capabilities and miraculous power fell into Satan's hands.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Satan's Desire Is to Develop<br>the Latent Power of the Soul</H2><P>As soon as man fell, God concealed all the power of man within man's flesh and put him under the rule of the flesh. When Adam fell, much of this power fell with him and became bound and latent within the flesh. It became a latent, unseen, and seemingly nonexistent power. After man's fall, everything belonging to the soul, everything psychological, was ruled and bound by the flesh, that is, by everything physical. All psychological powers are ruled by the physical power. Satan's purpose is to engage himself in the release of man's soulish power; he wants to break man's outer shell of the flesh and free man's soul from the bondage of his flesh, so that this latent power can be made manifest. This is the meaning of Revelation 18:13, where man's soul has been made a commodity. Man's soul has become one item of merchandise in the enemy's business. The enemy is particularly keen to gain man's psychological power as his merchandise.</P><P>In the end time, especially today, Satan's aim is to carry out what he intended to do originally in the garden of Eden. Although the enemy tried to control man's soul in the garden of Eden, he did not fully succeed. After man's fall, his entire being was under the control of the flesh. The power of man's soul also came under the control of the flesh. In other words, man's psychological power is now under the control of his physical power. The enemy could not do anything; he did not succeed in his plan. Throughout the past several thousand years Satan has been exercising his power to cause man to manifest his latent power. He has found some here and there, now and then, and has used them to manifest the power of the soul. Throughout the years, these people have been considered as religious leaders with the ability to work miracles. But during the past century, since the discovery of psychology by Mesmer, there have continued to be more discoveries of psychological phenomena. There is only one reason for these discoveries: the enemy wants to accomplish the work which he began but left unfinished. In this end time, the enemy's unique goal is to manifest all of man's latent power. This is the unique goal that he has been laboring on for thousands of years. This is why, in addition to buying gold, silver, cattle, horses, and precious stones, he also buys the souls of men as his merchandise. The souls of men are the very merchandise that the enemy has tried his best to obtain.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. Satan Desires to Utilize the Power of the Soul</H2><P>What are the advantages to Satan in causing men to manifest the latent power of the soul? There are many advantages to him: (1) He will be able to fulfill the original promise he made to man: "Ye shall be as gods" (Gen. 3:5). He wants man to regard himself as god and believe that there is no god besides man, through the many wonders that man can perform in himself. (2) He wants to confuse God's miracles. He wants man to believe that the miracles in the Bible are just psychological effects, in order to lower God's miracles to the same level as works of wonders. He wants man to think that he can do what the Lord Jesus did. (3) He wants to confuse the works of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit works within man through his spirit. But Satan produces many phenomena in man that are similar to the results of the Spirit's working, such as giving man false repentance, false salvation, false regeneration, false revival, false happiness, and other experiences that are not from the Holy Spirit. (4) He wants to make man his instrument, through which he will complete his final resistance against God's plan in the last age. The Holy Spirit is God's power in performing miracles, but man's soul is Satan's power in working wonders. The last three and a half years, the great tribulation, will be a period in which Satan utilizes man's soul to do many great wonders.</P><P>I will conclude by saying: (1) Miraculous powers were in Adam initially. (2) Satan's goal is to rule over such power. (3) In the end time, Satan will use all his means to manifest this power. (4) Satan's purpose is to accomplish his desired yet uncompleted tasks.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br>GOD'S WORK AND SATAN'S WORK</H2><P>How can we be on the alert? We should discern what is God's work and what is the enemy's work, what is the work of the Holy Spirit and what is the work of the evil spirit. All of the works done by the Holy Spirit are done through man's spirit; all of the works done by the enemy are done through man's soul. The Holy Spirit inspires man's spirit, while the enemy moves man's soul. This is the basic difference between the work of God and the work of the enemy. God's work originates from man's spirit, while the enemy's work originates from man's soul. Our human spirit was deadened because of the fall, and fellowship with God was broken. When we believed in the Lord Jesus and were saved, we were regenerated. What does being saved and regenerated mean? Salvation and regeneration are not just terms. They are real changes which occur physically, or we can say that they are actual changes which occur organically. Human beings have a spirit and a soul from the beginning. When we believe in the Lord Jesus, God puts His life into our spirit, and He revives our spirit. The human spirit is substantive; therefore, the new spirit put into us by God must be substantive. John 3:6 tells us that in regeneration, "That which is born of the Spirit is spirit." The book of Ezekiel also tell us that God will put a new spirit within us (36:26). Therefore, we are regenerated because we receive a new spirit. The Lord Jesus said, "The flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life" (John. 6:63). Therefore, all our living and working should be in the realm of the spirit; when God uses us, He is also working in our spirit and through our spirit. Ephesians 5:18 says, "Be filled in spirit." Not only should we be filled with the Holy Spirit, but we should be filled with the Holy Spirit in our spirit. God fills up our spirit with the Holy Spirit.</P><P>I have discussed these matters in detail in the book The Spiritual Man. I just want to clearly point out to you once again that the Holy Spirit works in our spirit; the evil spirit works in our soul. The human spirit is the place where the Holy Spirit is working, while Satan can only work in the soul and through the power of the soul. Satan cannot do any work in the human spirit. He can only work in the soul, and the result of his work is also limited to the soul. The enemy is continuing to do what he has been doing for the past five to six thousand years, and he will continue to do the same in the future. Why is Satan as seemingly omniscient, omnipotent, and omnipresent as God? There is no other reason except that he is using the power of man's soul. We can say that just as the Holy Spirit is the power of God, the human soul is the power of Satan. I feel sorry that many people are ignorant of the fact that the practices of asceticism, concentrated breathing, sitting, meditation by Buddhists and Taoists, the hypnotism from the West, and the many wonders discovered through psychology are only the demonstration of the latent power in man's soul. They do not realize how mighty the power in the soul is.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, let us not think that these are some minor problems or topics for scholars' research and that it does not make any difference whether we study these things or not. Actually, these things have much to do with us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TWO CATEGORIES OF THE POWER OF SOUL</H2><P>The latent power of the soul, according to the Bible and even in psychology, can be classified into two categories. We admit that we cannot separate the two categories too clearly, nor definitively categorize the contents of each category. But we can say that within the latent power of the soul, one category seems to be ordinary while the other seems to be miraculous; one category seems to be natural while the other seems to be supernatural; one category seems to be humanly comprehensible while the other seems to be beyond human comprehension.</P><P>The definition of the mind in psychology is broader than the Bible's definition. In psychology the mind includes two parts: the conscious and the subconscious. The subconscious part in psychology is the miraculous power of the soul. The mind in psychology is equal to the soul in the Bible, one part of which is conscious and the other part is subconscious. Although consciousness and subconsciousness are clearly distinguished by psychologists, in reality it is very difficult to distinguish them. Generally, psychologists group those ordinary manifestations of the soul into the category of consciousness and the uncommon and miraculous manifestations into the category of subconsciousness. We often group the ordinary and common manifestations of the soul within the scope of the soul. However, even the powerful, seemingly miraculous, and strange manifestations of the soul are also within the realm of the soul. These latter manifestations tend toward the realm of subconsciousness. Since everyone's latent power is different, some manifested phenomena lean more toward one realm while others lean more toward the other.</P><P>All those who serve the Lord should pay attention to this matter; otherwise, they will be carried away by this kind of miraculous power when they are leading others to the Lord. Let me reiterate the difference between the soul and the spirit. The soul of Adam belongs to the old creation, while the spirit regenerated by God belongs to the new creation. All of God's works are done through man's spirit, because this is the regenerated life of man and the new creation. All of Satan's works are done through man's soul, which is the fallen soul from Adam. Satan can only use the old creation; he cannot use the new creation because the regenerated life cannot sin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHAT SATAN IS DOING IN THE CHURCH</H2><P>How does Satan, through man's soul, utilize this latent power? Buddhism, Taoism, psychologists, and spiritualists in Christianity are all his working tools. We have given many examples regarding this. Today I would like to illustrate with some further spiritual examples to show how the enemy uses man's soul, so that we can discern what comes from God and what comes from the enemy. In addition, we will also know how God uses man's spirit and how Satan uses man's soul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. Prayer</H2><P>All prayers in the Bible are meaningful and purposeful. When the Lord Jesus taught us how to pray, the first sentence was, "Our Father who is in the heavens" (Matt. 6:9b). The Lord instructed us to pray to the Father in heaven; but we often pray to the God in our room rather than to the Father in heaven. Our prayers should only be offered to the Father in heaven and should ascend to the heavenly Father. We should not care for our good feeling or bad feeling or any feeling at all. God only wants us to offer our prayers to heaven by faith. If we just pray to the God in the room, I am afraid that we will have many strange feelings, miraculous experiences, and strange visions from the God. All of these will be given to us by Satan. And what we receive from Satan belongs to either the consciousness or the subconsciousness.</P><P>You may not pray to the God in your room, but it is also very dangerous if you direct your prayer toward the person for whom you are praying. For example, you have a friend who is more than two thousand miles away. You pray for him, asking God to either revive him with the Word or cause him to believe in the Lord. However, your prayer is not directed toward God in the heavens; you are only exercising and concentrating your soul to project your expectations and desires as a force toward your friend. Your thoughts, intentions, desires and all you have are all piled upon your friend. Your prayer is like a bow which shoots your thoughts, intentions, and desires as arrows directly toward your friend. He is pressed by your force; consequently, whatever you asked will be fulfilled upon him. You may think that your prayer is answered. But let me say, the prayer toward your friend is not answered by God because your prayer was not toward God. Someone said to me, "My prayer was answered because I piled prayers upon him." I responded, "Yes, you prayed toward him, not toward God. Therefore, your prayer was answered, but it was not answered by God." If you pray in this way, even though you know nothing about hypnotism, you will be following the principle of hypnotism because you will release the power in your soul to accomplish this matter.</P><P>I would like to read a letter written by a believer. He wrote, "Recently I have been attacked severely by the enemy. I vomited blood; my heart rate was erratic; I was suffocating and exhausted. My whole body seemed to be collapsing. While I was praying, God revealed that I should pray against the many prayers that were toward me which were made through soulish power. I then asked God to protect and cover me with the blood of the Lord Jesus. I also believed that God's power would be manifested in my body. When I began to pray in this way, wonderfully, my heart began to beat normally, the vomiting of blood stopped, my breathing became smooth, and the strength of my body was recovered. I was recovered fully as a normal person. God showed me that day that I suffered from vomiting blood, an erratic heart rate, suffocation, and exhaustion because a group of deceived believers (those who prayed for me) had prayed me into the sickness. Later I helped two of them to be saved and delivered. It is sad that the rest of them are still in that foolish pit."</P><P>Why did this happen? It happened because some people did not pray toward God in heaven; instead, they were casting, besieging, and piling their prayers upon the person for whom they were praying. In doing so, it seemed that they were praying, but secretly they were exercising their soulish power to oppress that person. Suppose you exercise your soul-power to pray for someone to be a certain way, saying, "Even if he is not punished, he should at least be disciplined." Your prayer out of your soul-power will be projected to that person, and he will become sick. This is a law, a law of the soul. A person will burn his finger if he puts it into fire; it is a law. Therefore, when you pray, you should not say that if someone does not behave a certain way, certain things should happen to him. If you pray in this way, all of that person's painful suffering will come from you. If you intend to give yourself to prayer, your prayer should be toward God and should not be toward any person. I also had this kind of experience. Several years ago I suffered from a sickness for over a year. This was also due to the prayers of five or six persons who piled their prayers upon me. The more they prayed, the weaker I became. Later on when I found this out, I resisted this kind of prayer by asking God not to accomplish what they had prayed toward me. After that I got well.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. The Power of Work</H2><P>If an experienced Christian in the Lord is present at a revival meeting, he will know whether the preacher is using his soul-power or the power of the Spirit. Once I met a friend who told me that a certain person's preaching was quite powerful. I then responded that I had not met that person and dared not to judge. Later I wrote down several words in a notebook and gave it to my friend, asking, "Full of power, but what kind of power was it?" His experiences in the Lord were not as deep as his wife's, and he could not understand the question. He turned around to ask his wife. After she looked at the notebook, she smiled and said, "Indeed, this is a problem. What kind of power is it?" One brother once said to us that whether or not a person has power does not depend on how loud he can pound on the table. Therefore, in our meeting, we should discern whether one's power comes from his soul or from his spirit.</P><P>We can consider this matter from two sides: (1) from the preacher himself, and (2) from the audience. Suppose a preacher depends on his past experiences and thinks that just because someone repented and confessed his sins because he preached a certain way in the past, he should preach the same way, expecting someone to repent and confess again. Or suppose he tries to tell stories about the repentance and confession of others with the hope that this will stir up his audience. If this is his intention, we can be sure that he is working by his soul-power.</P><P>On the contrary, it would be wonderful if preachers could have attitudes like the leaders in the Welsh Revival, who asked God to subdue them, bind the power in their soul, restrain their self, and refuse anything that would come out of themselves. If this is the motive and the pursuit of a preacher, his soul-power can be rejected. The preacher will be able to discern the difference between these two kinds of power and realize how different they are. He will then be able to tell which of his works are done by his soul-power and which are done by God's power.</P><P>There are three aspects to the work of the Holy Spirit: (1) The Holy Spirit regenerates us; (2) the Holy Spirit dwells within us so that we can bring forth the fruit of the Spirit; and (3) the Holy Spirit comes upon us so that we have power to testify. The power of the Holy Spirit is always mentioned in the Bible with reference to working and witnessing. This is the work of the Holy Spirit upon us; it is not the work of the Holy Spirit within us. Therefore, the power of the Holy Spirit is for work, whereas the indwelling of the Spirit is for fruit-bearing. According to the original text, whenever the Spirit is mentioned in the Bible with reference to power, it always says that the Spirit "comes upon" us, while whenever the Spirit is mentioned with respect to fruit-bearing, it says that He "dwells within" us. What does come upon mean? It means that the power given to us by the Spirit is outside of us. We cannot sense it by ourselves and cannot have any assurance of it at all. If anyone asked us in a meeting, "Are you sure about today's meeting? Do you have the assurance that someone will be saved?", we would definitely respond, "I do not have any assurance and do not sense anything." The reason is that this power is outside of us. The power of the Spirit is the power outside of us and cannot be laid hold of by us. How about the power of the soul? With the power of the soul, one has the assurance; he knows that his message will cause someone to weep and make someone repent and confess. What does it mean to be "dynamic"? It merely means to have the power of the soul.</P><P>Once I felt powerless. Although people told me that I could get by, I still felt powerless. So I went to see an older and more experienced sister (Miss Barber). I asked her, "You have great power. But why do I not have any power?" She knew me very well and often helped me in the Word. Looking at me seriously, she said, "Do you want the power that you can feel or the kind you cannot feel? Which one do you want?" As soon as I heard her, I understood. I said, "I do not want the kind that I can feel." She then said, "Remember, there is no need for the person to feel the power coming from the Spirit. Man's responsibility is just to obey God. The power of the Spirit is never to be felt by the person himself." (Of course, the sense in the spirit is a different matter.) Therefore, our duty is to ask God to bind the power of our soul, our own strength. We must submit to God entirely. Everything else is left for God to do and is none of our business. If we exercise the strength of our soul to serve, we can feel it; this is just like the hypnotists who know they will have a certain result if they do certain things. They know what they should do first, what to do next, and what to do as the third step. The danger of many preachers on the platform is that they do not realize that they are actually exercising their own soulish power. They think they have the power; but, in fact, they are working by the power of their soul. They are only gaining people by their psychic strength.</P><P>Some people say that preachers should pay attention to psychology. This is wrong. Although we know clearly that we can gain people by applying psychological methods, we ought to avoid these methods and not exercise the psychic power. While I was working in Shantung, one professor spoke to another professor: "All these preachers are working with emotions." It so happened that on that same afternoon I was giving a message to the believers on the undependability and futility of the emotion. That professor who was told that preachers worked with emotions was in the audience. He heard my word and said, "It is too bad that the other professor who claimed that preachers work with emotions is not here. Otherwise, he could have heard that emotions are undependable." Please bear in mind that all work by the emotion is not dependable and shall pass away. In a meeting, if the Holy Spirit is working, men have no need to exert their own strength and no need to do anything by themselves. If a preacher is working by his soulish power, he will have to exert much strength. In addition, he will need to resort to other methods such as weeping, shouting, jumping, emotional appeals, repetitive singing of a chorus, or telling moving stories. I do not mean that hymns and stories cannot be used in a meeting. But they must be used only within proper limits. The only reason for preachers to perform is to cause the audience to be moved and stirred up.</P><P>We all know that even though certain people are not necessarily more handsome or eloquent than others, they have particular attractions which attract people to themselves. In reality, they only possess more attractiveness than others. People often tell me, "You have great influence on someone, why don't you draw him over?" I respond, "This is of no use, because it is only natural and not spiritual." Many people misunderstand Christianity and think that it is a kind of psychic function or something within the psychic realm. This is only because we believers have made the same mistake first. If we cannot attract our parents and children with the so-called power from God, any greater attraction that we have would be useless and not attract others. Even if we can draw others by our attraction, it will still amount to nothing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Peace and Joy</H2><P>What is the peak of Christianity? It is a complete union with God and the entire loss of self. Currently, psychology also claims that man is able to unite with the unseen "heart" and be lost within it. Apparently, this claim is the same as that in Christianity, but in reality they are totally different. Dr. Frank Buchman, who is presently popular, belongs to this school of psychology. The books from his school have been translated into Chinese and published by the Literary Promotion Society. One of his teachings is meditation. He teaches that meditation is all that man needs to communicate with God. He does not suggest that people read the Bible in the morning. Instead, he suggests that they just meditate and pray. He also claims that the first thought after people pray is a thought from God and that people should act and behave that day according to this thought. Little do they realize that this kind of meditating on God is just another type of silent cultivation, quiet meditation, and mind-contemplation. What result do they have from their meditation? They claim that meditation will make a person peaceful and joyful. It is true that if one meditates on anything for an hour, he will have a so-called peace and joy. Even if one meditates on some nonexistent matter for an hour, he will still have peace and joy. Many people's meditation is only a kind of psychic function. But Christianity is entirely different. We have no need to meditate on God because we have God's life. We can know God in our intuition. Whether or not we sense God in our feeling, we have the leading of the intuition within which teaches us to know God. In addition, we have God's word in the Bible which tells us so. Whatever God's Word says, we believe. We have faith and do not need to care about our feeling. This is what makes us different from psychology.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. Works of Wonders</H2><P>In addition, we have seen works of wonders. Personally, I do not object to these works. I have witnessed several people healed by God immediately. Today, we are not against those who say they can heal illness. We are only against the cases where wrong principles are applied in healing. Someone asked me, "Are you against speaking in tongues?" I replied, "I am not against speaking in tongues, but I am against all tongues spoken by the wrong means." Concerning strange dreams and visions, we are also not against them. I myself have once seen great lights. These things are recorded in the Bible and we accept them. But I am against all the strange dreams and visions obtained through improper methods. For example, the healing mentioned in the Bible is accompanied by the laying on of hands and the applying of ointment. However, if someone lays his hand on another person's head, and, at the same time, forcibly massages that person's back and neck with the other hand, and asks, "How do you feel?", the person receiving the massage would certainly feel heat around his neck. This is low-class hypnotism and is despised even by the hypnotists. We know that behind our head there is the spinal cord with nerves extending from the brain all the way down our spine. Although the one who performs the massage does not know that this is a kind of hypnotism, actually he is employing hypnotism. The person who is massaged may feel a stream of heat flowing as electrical currents all the way to his shoulder and back and may feel that he is healed. Actually, this is only a manifestation of the latent power within man's soul. Even if the person is healed, I would not admit that this healing is from God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>5. The Baptism of the Holy Spirit</H2><P>Let us go on to the baptism of the Holy Spirit. Recently in Shantung I also shared about the baptism of the Holy Spirit and asked others to pray for it. But I do not agree with the practice of shutting many people together into a small room to fast, pray, and sing choruses for days and nights. Some fast for days, and their physical strength is exhausted. The room is small, and the air is stagnant. In this kind of environment, they repeatedly sing short choruses. If someone does this, his mind will be numbed after a while, his will will become passive, and his mouth will automatically utter a kind of confused and nonsensical voice or language. In this way, his latent power will be exposed.</P><P>In meetings where people pray for the baptism of the Holy Spirit, sometimes they shout only one word, "Hallelujah," repeatedly. After hundreds and thousands of times of repeated shouting, their heads will be dizzy, and their minds will become numb. Then it will be easy for them to discover a kind of strange vision. This is not the baptism of the Spirit; it is only a baptism of the soul. What they have received is not the power of the Holy Spirit but the power of the soul; it is just the manifestation of the latent power. Therefore, the power they receive is only acquired through human training and is not from God. This is not the right way to be baptized in the Holy Spirit. However, these ones force others to follow them. They act according to their past experiences, not according to God's teaching.</P><P>Some may ask after hearing this, "According to what you say, are there no real works of wonders at all?" Yes, there are. If any work of wonder comes from God, we thank God for it. But we have to exercise the proper discernment. If something does not come from God, it must be from the latent power of man's soul. When I was in Shantung, I heard that a woman who was mentally disordered and paralyzed for many years was completely healed. If her healing indeed came from God, I would thank God for it. But the healing she received was through the kind of laying on of hands mentioned above.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>UNDERSTANDING THE LATENT POWER OF THE SOUL</H2><P>Mrs. Mary Baker Eddy, the founder of the Church of Christ, Scientist, denied that there was death, sickness, or pain. Yet she died. But the Church of Christ, Scientist, that she founded still exists and seems to have become more prosperous. Today they tell others that a patient only needs to believe he has no illness and he will not feel pain, and that a dying person only needs to believe he will not die, and he will not die. As a result of this, many receive healing. Actually, the Church of Christ, Scientist, has nothing to do with Christianity or with science. It is only a relief of man's physical bondage and a strengthening of man's psychic power. It merely tries to develop the latent power of the soul in an effort to overcome the weakness of the physical body.</P><P>Through the development of the latent power of the soul, more and more works of wonders are happening. Among them there are some which are very supernatural and miraculous. However, all of these are just the manifestation of the latent power of the soul. Though I am not a prophet, I have studied the prophetic books. I know that in the future there will be more manifestations of the latent power of the soul, because the enemy will lay hold of the power of man's soul at the end of the ages to accomplish his work. If he succeeds in laying hold of it, he will advance to do more and more works of wonder.</P><P>There are two groups of people who lean toward different extremes. One group says that miraculous things no longer exist; they do not listen to anything about any miracles such as divine healing. On the other hand, there is the other group of people who pay attention only to the miraculous things; they do not care where these miracles come from, whether they are from God or the enemy. We should be careful not to lean toward either extreme. Whenever we see or hear of any works of wonders, we should ask, "Was this done by God or by the enemy? Was this done by the Holy Spirit of God, or was this done by the psychic law of man?"</P><P>Today we should exercise our faculties, such as our mind, emotion, and will, to work. We should not try to release the latent power that lies dormant within us. The mind, emotion, and will are man's original psychological organs; man has to use them. If man does not use these organs, the evil spirit will use them instead. However, if we try laboriously to invoke the latent power behind these abilities, the evil spirit will give us many false miracles. Working by the principle of the soul and psychology will result in falsehood. Only the work which is done through the power of the Holy Spirit is genuine. The Holy Spirit works according to a law, because Romans 8:2 speaks of "the law of the Spirit of life." Thanks be to God, the Holy Spirit is a fact, and the law of the Spirit is also a fact. Only the works of wonders done through the law of the Spirit are from God.</P><P>It is extremely difficult for the Moslems to believe in the Lord Jesus. Comparatively speaking, there are very few Moslems who believe in the Lord (I do not mean none). When Moslems pray, how do they pray? They must go to their mosques to pray three times a day. They claim that the accomplishment of a certain matter only requires thousands and tens of thousands to pray for it in one accord. There is a huge mosque in Mecca, the most famous place among all the Moslems. It can accommodate one hundred thousand people. At one time there were one hundred thousand Moslems praying within the mosque. After their prayer another one hundred thousand who were waiting outside went in to pray. What did they pray for? There was one sentence which they shouted in one accord: "We want the recovery of Turkey; we want to be free from the dominion of the white race." When hundreds of thousands prayed inside and outside the mosque, the psychological power gained the victory. Consequently, Turkey was freed from the dominion of the white race and was restored. It is a pity that the prayers of many believers are not answered by God, but by the projection of the latent power of their soul. Their purpose is accomplished in the same way that the Moslems accomplished theirs.</P><P>Consider again the power in Hinduism. In Hinduism, some can walk on fire without being scorched. This is a fact. When they walk on fire, it is not for just a few steps, but for quite a long distance. Every step they tread is on red-hot iron; yet, they are not hurt. In Hinduism, some can also sleep on a bed of many pointed nails but without being hurt. Beginners cannot bear it and feel the pain. These are also related to the development of the power of the soul. Many wonders performed by believers are done with the same power as those in Hinduism.</P><P>Christians often feel that they are being oppressed by a certain power during a meeting or feel bored and troubled while praying and reading the Word. This is because Satan is oppressing and attacking us through the soul's power. Not only do we feel this way, all experienced Christians all over the world feel the same way; they feel that in this age, the attacks from Satan are particularly severe. Those with deep experiences in the Lord can sense that the atmosphere of the whole world is saturated with the soul's power. Therefore, we should hide ourselves under the precious blood of the Lord and be protected by it.</P><P>While listening to a message in a huge church meeting hall, one can discern right away if the soul's power is moving there. One can also feel right away if something is trying to stir someone up. The preacher may say, "Today, some have repented and are saved." But we have to watch the result of those who claim that they have repented and are saved. Among them, there is the mixture of an improper power. If the power is from God and the Holy Spirit, one will feel extremely clear and relaxed. If the power is from the enemy or the soul, it will be developed by the fact that there is a great crowd. This is where the difference lies. I hope we will all have the discernment and not be deceived.</P><P>The time is near. Satan is trying his best to stir up the latent power by means which are commonly used by religionists, scientists, and even Christians. The fact lies clearly before us. May we pray to the Lord to give us the light so that we can have the true discernment! Amen.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE LATENT POWER OF THE SOUL</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(3)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 28</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ASPECT WHICH IS NOT MIRACULOUS</H2><P>Today we will continue with the subject we have been speaking on the last two Lord's Days, which is the work of the power of the soul and its functions. Of the many things happening in this last age, how can we know which are done by God and which are not? How can we differentiate between spiritual things and soulish things? For example, many signs, miracles, and supernatural things take place. Are they done by God, or are they initiated by another power? Today I will talk about the power of the soul, what it is doing, and how it operates. Through this we may know what is from God and what is not.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PROPHECIES IN THE BIBLE</H2><P>Before we go on, let us see in the Bible what will be the situation of the last age and what will be the signs of the Lord's second coming.</P><P>Matthew 24:24 says, "For false Christs and false prophets will arise and will show great signs and wonders so as to lead astray, if possible, even the chosen."</P><P>Revelation 13:2-5 and 12-13 say, "And the beast which I saw was like a leopard, and his feet like those of a bear, and his mouth like the mouth of a lion. And the dragon gave him his power and his throne and great authority. And one of his heads was as it were slain to death, and his death stroke was healed. And the whole earth marveled after the beast. And they worshipped the dragon because he gave his authority to the beast; and they worshipped the beast, saying, Who is like the beast? And who can make war with him? And there was given to him a mouth speaking great things and blasphemies, and authority was given to him to act for forty-two months....And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his sight, and he causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose death stroke was healed. And he does great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth before men."</P><P>Second Thessalonians 2:8-10 says, "And then the lawless one will be revealed (whom the Lord Jesus will slay by the breath of His mouth and bring to nothing by the manifestation of His coming), the coming of whom is according to Satan's operation in all power and signs and wonders of a lie and in all deceit of unrighteousness among those who are perishing, because they did not receive the love of the truth that they might be saved."</P><P>Before explaining these verses, please notice that the word lie in 2 Thessalonians 2:9 can be translated as "deceit." A lie is a fabrication of something nonexistent, but deceit means something is there to deceive people. It does not refer to a nonentity, but to something that is actually there. However, this something is not from God; its purpose is to deceive people. Please do not misunderstand. This verse does not say that something does not exist. Saying that something is a lie may mean that it does not exist and is merely fabricated. But this verse refers to something that does exist, something that can be proven to exist. The purpose of its existence is to deceive people.</P><P>These three passages refer to what will happen during the great tribulation. Some of the things will happen before the great tribulation. Although these prophecies speak directly of the period of the great tribulation, a biblical principle tells us that before the fulfillment of a prophecy, many similar things will happen before the actual events. Many students of prophecy agree that the things that are happening in this age are a manifestation of the things that will come to pass in the great tribulation. However, the present events are not as severe as they will be during the great tribulation. The verses we have read today show us the main features of the great tribulation. At that time there will be signs and miracles. Before the Lord comes, Antichrist will especially want to perform signs and miracles. Just as the shadow always comes before a person's body, and his voice is heard before he appears, the "shadows" and "voices" of the signs and miracles of the great tribulation are already here. Since signs and miracles will be quite common during the great tribulation, the same must be true today, and we will surely see more signs and miracles around us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A NOTE OF CLARIFICATION</H2><P>Before I come to the subject, I need to make a clarification. Personally, I do not object to miracles. There are many miracles in the Bible, and they are most precious and important. Those who have been meeting here with us know that I have mentioned before that the proper growth of a believer requires several aspects. I have mentioned four aspects. Let me go over these four aspects again. First, after a person is saved, he should pursue the proper knowledge of the Bible. Second, he has to pursue the growth in spiritual life and pursue such things as victory, holiness, perfect love, etc. These are all very important matters. Third, he should be zealous in the work of saving people. Fourth, he should believe in God and have a specific faith. He should believe in God and trust in Him to the extent that he can experience God's work-miracles. Today in the church, that is, among the believers, there are many shortcomings. Many Christians only pay attention to the interpretation of the Bible. They may have very good knowledge, but they do not care about other things and do not have a heart to pursue after them. Some people are more advanced. They seek for a higher life and deeper things. Yet they do not care for the other three things. Some are zealous, but they do not have the proper knowledge. This kind of unbalanced seeking is not good. Strangely enough, in the church today, there are many who pursue after the interpretation of the Bible, both spiritually and literally. There are also quite a few who pursue deeper and more abundant life. More than a few are also zealous to save people. Unfortunately, it is hard to find some who have a living faith to trust in God and who desire to gain something from God. I have spent a great deal of effort previously to share with you the way to become a perfect Christian. First, you must have the knowledge of the Bible. Second, you must pursue after a more abundant, spiritual, profound, holy, and perfect life or living. Third, you must work zealously. Fourth, you must learn how to pray to God with faith, receive answers from God, and witness miracles from God. Every believer must have all four things and must grow in these four aspects equally, in a balanced way. There must not be any imbalance. So, please note that I am not against miracles. On the contrary, I pay much attention to miracles. However, due to the presence of false miracles and deceitful miracles, I would like to explain the difference between real ones and false ones. Today I want to tell you what a false miracle is. I am not against miracles themselves.</P><P>Please remember that all of God's works are done through both the Holy Spirit and our spirit; they are never done through our souls. The only way Satan works is through the power of the soul, through the power in man's flesh that became hidden through the fall. This is the reason Satan has to raise up an Antichrist in this last age and give his power and authority to this Antichrist; Satan has to use the latent power of the human soul. I have spent enough time in the last two messages on this matter. Now I would like to give some miscellaneous examples to show you what are not manifestations of spiritual power and show you that they are merely the manifestations of the latent power of the soul.</P><P>We have talked enough about the miraculous manifestation of the soul's power. Today let us consider some examples which are not miraculous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. Personal Preaching</H2><P>The first thing we will see is the work of personal preaching. The power of the soul varies according to the individual's psychological condition. Some people's minds are stronger than others; sometimes they can read other people's minds. They know that in order to deal with other people it is better to know what they are thinking. In this way they will be able to speak the right word to the right person. This natural ability to know about others is something that should be rejected. Forgive me for using myself as an example. When I contact someone, it is very easy for me to know what they are thinking about after two or three sentences. I just know, and there is no special reason why I do. When I first began to work for the Lord, I thought that a natural knowledge of what others are thinking could be helpful to my work. But later I became clearer and dared not use this natural ability. Whenever something like this occurs, I immediately pray to resist it. Every time I talk to a person, I try not to find out what he is thinking. One thing is certain-everything that comes out of the soul or is done by the soul will not have any result. If you do something according to your soulish power, even though the other person may say he has received the help, he will not be perfected in life; in the deepest part of his being, he has not received any profit. When a person comes to you, the most important thing to do is to pray to God to show you how to help this person. You should say to God, "I do not know what this person is thinking about nor what his psychological condition is; neither do I know what his spiritual condition is; I just come to You without relying on anything else. Please give me the words." You have to lay yourself totally aside and receive your help only from God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. Revival Meetings</H2><P>Here is another example which is most interesting: many brothers involved in the work of preaching have often told me that if they go into a chapel with dim lighting, small attendance, and many empty seats, their strength seems to disappear when they stand up to speak. If the lights are bright, however, and there are many people sitting and waiting expectantly for them to speak, they have strength; the more they speak, the more powerful they become. But I would like to ask what kind of power this is. Frankly speaking, this is nothing other than the power of their soul. The power from the Holy Spirit will never be affected by any outside influences. If you want to know what preaching by the power of the soul means, just go to a big chapel, where there is a large audience with good equipment. Simply listen to the singing and watch the actions, and you will realize that there is always a special power behind a large gathering. But what kind of power is it? While you are in such a place, do you not feel a power pressing on you? What kind of power is this? Is this the power of the Holy Spirit? Most likely it is not. This is nothing but the power of the soul.</P><P>How do we know that is the power of the soul? Just look at what the crowd is doing. For example, they may be singing. The singing is directed toward a certain direction. Consequently, the power of all the souls is directed to one place. How great that power is! Honestly speaking, under such circumstances, you may not be able to help them as you originally intended. Instead, you may be affected by them. This is very dangerous. Many people have come to me and talked about the same thing. They told me how the number in the meeting and the atmosphere would help or hinder their speaking. I have always told them that the reason was that they were doing the speaking; they were speaking by their own power. This is why they were affected by the environment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Singing Hymns</H2><P>Many times, singing is helpful to God's work. But sometimes it becomes a soulish activity. Many people like to go to the Catholic cathedrals to worship God. They have good music. Some Catholic cathedrals have even spent more than a million dollars for an organ. Some people say that whenever they go to a Catholic cathedral to attend a mass, in their hearts they feel that they are liberated to God's presence when they walk in and hear the sound of the organ and the choir. These sensations are true indeed. If you go there once, you will know what I mean. But the question is: Is this real? Does this really lead you to God's presence? Will just a little stirring up and attraction really release your heart and draw you to God? Is this God's way? I must tell you that many arrangements in the Catholic Church are from the flesh; they have no truth to them at all. They simply stir up man's mood and religious sentiment through the music and choir. This feeling of closeness to God does not come from the power of God. Rather, it comes from the power of the songs and music. We sing hymns also, but our faith is not in the hymns. Only the work of the Holy Spirit brings us profit; otherwise, nothing will reach our spirit.</P><P>Have you ever been to a backward countryside? Thank the Lord, He has given me the chance to be in such places. Once I went to a village by the seashore. Most of the people there were fishermen. Several places nearby had believers, and they had meetings. In some places there were twenty to thirty people; in other places there were fifty to sixty people. Whenever they came together, their singing was out of tune and disorderly. Their singing could be off from one another by a few minutes. Some would sing fast, while others would sing slowly. After some finished their lines, they would wait a while to allow the rest to catch up. How could one meet in such a situation? He would probably run out of patience, and his power would probably also run out. A brother told me that just listening to their singing was enough to drain his message away. I told him that he felt this way because he had never checked if his power was from God or from himself. Please remember a principle: we always have to look at our environment and are always influenced by our environment. But if something is of the Holy Spirit, we will be able to take control over our environment. This is a very deep principle. Let us lay hold of this principle, and let us never exercise our soulish power, lest we be controlled by the environment.</P><P>Sometimes when the atmosphere is suppressing, God can release men through singing hymns or through praying. But if we make singing hymns our center, we run the danger of manifesting the power of the soul. Many people live foolishly for six days of the week. When Sunday comes, they go to church and listen to the singing; they are warmed up and become burning and happy. However, where does this kind of burning and happiness come from? I must say that there is a problem in it. After living foolishly and loosely for six days, they should feel their sin and should be convicted when they come to the Lord on the Lord's Day. How can they become burning and happy when they begin to sing? This power is most likely not spiritual power. I do not like to be too harsh of a critic about this kind of thing, but a great deal of singing is simply a stirring up of the power of the soul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. Interpreting the Bible</H2><P>In reading the Bible, sometimes there is also the danger of developing the latent power of the soul. For example, a person may not understand a certain portion of the Scripture; he may continue to think about it while he is walking, lying on his bed, in his study, or on the tram. Suddenly, he may feel a light shining on him like a flashlight, and he may feel that he understands this section of Scripture in a very reasonable way. All the reasons and explanations are laid in front of him. If he has a good memory, he may memorize them, and if he does not have a good memory, he may write them down in his notebook. He may think that he has received much. But is this reliable? It is possible that the soulish power was involved. To find out, look at the fruit. Novel, special, and meaningful thoughts may seem to be very deep, but they do not bear fruit. Not only can he not gain any life from them, but when he shares them with others, others cannot gain any life from them either. All they do is render something to others' thoughts. I am not saying that God cannot convey His thought to us while we are thinking, nor am I saying that God cannot give us His word suddenly on the road or in a room. God can give us something suddenly. But please remember that God never gives His word to a person when he has no need for it. Every time a thought or knowledge comes from God, it is for the purpose of meeting our need. When God gives us money, He will not give us a dollar just for us to hide it in a hole to use five years later. The same is also true when He gives us the truth. When we have no need, God will not give us any truth. Furthermore, He will not listen to any prayer or petition that does not speak of a need. Someone has said very well that the first condition for God to work is need. Need is the first step to miracles. This is the principle of getting an answer from prayer. God will never work against this principle, but Satan will always work against this principle.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>5. Rejoicing</H2><P>Many people want to have the feeling of joy. There is one thing which is very popular in Western countries now. It is called the "holy laugh." Some say that once a person is filled with the Holy Spirit, he will have this kind of so-called holy laugh. Those who laugh this way do not know why they laugh; they seem to have caught some kind of disease which keeps them laughing uncontrollably, as if they have gone insane. One time after a meeting, it was proposed that everyone seek this kind of holy laugh. Soon after, all the people began kicking tables and chairs and dancing wildly like mad people. After a while, the so-called holy laugh started. Everyone began to laugh at each other. The more it went on, the harder they laughed. Eventually, everyone laughed so hard that they could not stop. What is this? Is this the infilling of the Holy Spirit? Is this the work of the Holy Spirit? This is only one of the many works of the soul!</P><P>I mention this extreme case as an example. If we know how far off an extreme case is, we more likely will know what is two or three degrees off. The most help I received from Mr. Barlow, while he was here meeting with us, was his statement that if you want to see whether or not something is wrong, all you have to do is exaggerate it one hundred degrees and push it to the extreme. If it is wrong at one hundred degrees, you can be sure that it is wrong at one or two degrees. It is difficult to find out whether or not it is wrong at one or two degrees because though it may be off, it is off by only a little; it is not easy to discern the difference. However, if you enlarge and stretch it a little, you will be clearer. A Chinese proverb says, "Off by an inch, and one will miss by a thousand miles." In the beginning you may be off by only an inch. But in the end you will miss the mark by a thousand miles. Putting it another way, if you want to know if you are off by an inch, all you have to do is consider if the outcome will miss by a thousand miles. This in fact is even easier. If two lines are out of parallel alignment by only one or two degrees, our eyes may not be able to detect it. But if we extend the two lines for an inch, the distance between them will become greater, and if we extend them two inches more, the distance between them will become still greater. If we extend the two lines to the other end of the earth, the distance will be many thousands of miles. Therefore, if we can see that the difference of many thousands of miles is wrong, the little difference at the beginning must also be wrong.</P><P>Today we are only using the holy laugh as an example. By what method, or by meeting what kind of conditions, do these people obtain this kind of holy laugh? They obtain it because they have a desire to laugh in their heart, and they have the thought to laugh in their mind. It is true that they are seeking the filling of the Holy Spirit, and it is true that they are saying with their mouth, "Lord, fill me with Your Spirit." However, these words are only a procedure that they go through; this is not really their goal. Although they say this with their mouth, where is their heart? What is their goal? They want to laugh and be happy. They are not saying, "God, fill me with Your Spirit. I do not care about any outside feeling. As long as You will fill me up, I will not care for anything else." Whoever wants to be filled with God's Spirit must have this attitude. However, if all we pray for is the holy laugh, we will surely end up with nothing other than laughter. But can we say that this is from God?</P><P>Let me tell you a true story. There was a student who had repented and believed in the Lord. He had a classmate who had received the so-called filling of the Holy Spirit and was very happy. The classmate was so happy he could not contain his happiness. The classmate told his friend, "You should ask for the infilling of the Holy Spirit. I have already received it; this is why I am happy all day long. I have no worries at all. Being happy all day long can help your spiritual growth." This person thought that since his classmate was a believer and had received the infilling, he should have it too. From that time on he began to pray to God desperately, to a point that he could not eat or study. He prayed incessantly for God to give it to him. Later he went to a teacher and asked the teacher to pray for him, while he himself also prayed desperately, saying, "God, tonight You have to give me the infilling. If You do not give it to me, I will not get up from my knees." He prayed repeatedly this way. Not too long after he began praying, he jumped up and said, "I am really happy now." He began to laugh and laugh. He began to wave his hand and dance around the place. He laughed so hard that he was even shouting. The teacher later related the incident: "At that time I forgot I was a Christian; I only knew that I was a doctor, and I thought that he was out of his mind. I dragged him down and said, `Brother, be quiet. Brother, be quiet. Do not be so silly.' The more I persuaded him this way, the worse he became." The teacher dared not say much more, because he felt that if this was indeed something from God, he would be offending the Holy Spirit. The student then went back home. Fortunately nothing more happened to him the next day. This was nothing other than a strong release of soul-power. If you were to ask me what this was and what caused this to happen, I would say I do not know. Perhaps even the best psychologist would not know. I dare say that no one knows how to receive this power and be connected to it. But I can say that this was a work of the soul, because this person met the conditions for the release of soulish power. These are facts that can be proven. The soul has the power to do the most extraordinary things.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>6. Visions and Dreams</H2><P>Among all the churches today, many are seeking visions and dreams. Some have asked me if I believe in these things. My answer is that I am not opposed to the visions and dreams themselves; I myself also have experienced these before. Sometimes visions and dreams can be very helpful. However, my question is where do the visions and dreams come from? Are they from God or not? Many times when someone testifies in a meeting concerning a vision he has seen, many others begin to talk about their visions as well. In the end the whole meeting becomes occupied with visions and dreams. This is a fact, and I have seen many cases. This happens because, after hearing about the visions of others, some begin to pray and ask God for the same experience. If they do not have the same experience, they fast and pray for several nights continuously. Their bodies become weak and their minds become blank. They have no will to resist anything, and under these conditions they receive the so-called visions or dreams. It is true that they have received visions, but the question is how they received these visions and whether or not they have received something from God. This kind of pursuit with blank minds and passive wills is not according to the teaching of the Bible. It is simply a kind of self-hypnosis.</P><P>Some people are good at dreams and the interpretation of dreams. However, their interpretations are too ridiculous. I have a friend who is a doctor. After he believed in the Lord, he had a great many dreams. Every time I met him, he told me his dreams and his interpretations of them. He dreamt almost every night, sometimes even three or four dreams a night. What was the reason for such dreams? Do you think that God intended to give him all those dreams? I know that he daydreamed very much; perhaps this was the reason he dreamed so much at night. It was surprising that even though he was an intelligent doctor, his thoughts were so confused. In his mind he was drawing pictures day and night; he could not control his thoughts. What he daydreamed during the day, he dreamed during the night. I frankly advised him that if he did not reject his dreams, he would be deceived and not grow spiritually. Later he improved a little. This shows us that many dreams are not from God but are from men's malfunctioning minds and wandering thoughts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>7. Baptism of the Holy Spirit</H2><P>Another condition, which I call "electric shocks," claims to convey power to some people. It causes them to shake just as if they have been shocked by electricity. They feel a kind of burning within and make strange noises with their mouth. Their hands and feet make all kinds of strange gestures. This is what some call "the baptism of the Holy Spirit." I am not against all these. Yet remember that what can be done in the spirit can be done in the soul; but what comes from the soul has the goal to deceive. The soul deceives men by telling them that these things are from the spirit and from God. Therefore, we have to differentiate what is from the soul and what is from the spirit, so that we will not be deceived. These soulish practices are similar to the way men seek after visions. In order to have these experiences, people fast and pray all night. As a result, their bodies become weak, they lose all resistance in their will, and they receive the so-called baptism of the Holy Spirit which makes them shake and tremble.</P><P>Many people like to have happy or strangely exciting feelings. They pray earnestly by fasting or for the whole night, in hope of receiving the so-called baptism of the Holy Spirit. This is in reality a kind of self-hypnosis. They continue to practice these things until they sense some feelings within them. What is this? Is God really filling up their hearts? I cannot believe that they have received something that is true because they are not practicing according to the teaching of the Bible. We should, on the one hand, know God and how He thinks about these things, and we should, on the other hand, consider if these things are from God. Many believers think that everything is from God, and they accept it all. As a result, they are deceived. Other believers think that it is very difficult to distinguish what is from God and what is not. As a result, they reject everything. This is also wrong. We should differentiate what is from God and what is not. Anything that is from God, we will accept, and anything that is not from God, no matter how good, we should reject. We should remember that all of Satan's works are done through the power of man's soul, and we must avoid them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>EXAMINING THE SOURCE</H2><P>Some seek visions. Some say they have seen lights or a flame, while others say they have had dreams or have felt an electric shock. After they testify this way, others begin to have similar experiences. I am not against these things in themselves. I merely ask, Where do these things come from? Are they from the soul, or are they from the spirit? We ought to remember that everything that can be done in the spirit can also be done in the soul; the only difference between them is that the soulish things are a counterfeit of the spirit. If we do not trace the source of these things, we will be deceived. The most important thing is to not deny the existence of these things, but to ask if these things are from the soul or the spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIFFERENT RESULTS OF THE FUNCTION<br>OF THE SOUL AND OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>What is the difference in the results of the soul's function and the spirit's function? This is a great principle; this principle allows us to differentiate between the things of the spirit and the things of the soul. Let us look at 1 Corinthians 15:45: "`The first man, Adam, became a living soul'; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." This verse says that the first man, Adam, became a living soul. This means that the soul is living; it has life and can do whatever it is supposed to do. This refers to the position of Adam. Following this it says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." This word deserves our attention and is most precious and important. The difference in the results of the soul's function and the spirit's function is right here. The soul itself is living and has life, but the Spirit can enliven people and can give life to people. The soul is living in itself, but it cannot give life to people. The Spirit is living and can give life to people. Only the Spirit can give life to people. We may have the strongest and the most living soul, but we cannot give life to others. The Lord says, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing'" (John 6:63a).</P><P>Please distinguish these two functions clearly. This is most important. No one can carry out the Lord's work well if they cannot distinguish the work of the spirit from that of the soul. Let me repeat this: even though the soul is living, it cannot give life to others. The Spirit, however, is not only living, but it can also give life to people. This is why I repeatedly say that we have to put the power of the soul under us. Whatever is from the soul is not worth anything. This is not an argument of words; it involves a great principle. Although the soul is living, it cannot give life to others. Therefore, when we help someone, our purpose should not be to help his mind, but to work in the deepest part of his being; only this can benefit others. We cannot work with the power of the soul. The soul can only live by itself; it cannot save or profit others. We should be very careful and reject everything that comes from the soul! Not only are the things from the soul unable to help people, they actually interfere with God in His work, frustrate Him from getting the glory, and are an offense to Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DANGER OF WORKING<br>THROUGH THE POWER OF THE SOUL</H2><P>Let me give some common examples to illustrate the vast difference between the works of the soul and the works of the spirit. I will not mention the miraculous examples, because I have mentioned them during the past two Lord's Days. I can say this much: many people use psychological methods in their works in the church today. They use psychology to attract people to their preaching meetings. In meetings of the believers, it is also common to find psychology being employed to stir up people. When you go to a place you can know the kind of work they are doing just by observing the methods they use. Frankly speaking, many teachings only benefit people's souls; they do not benefit people's spirits. This kind of preaching can only reach the soul and merely adds more knowledge to the person because it is preached from the soul. We cannot do this, because this kind of work does not reach man's spirit.</P><P>How do many revival meetings work? I want to make it very clear that I am not against believers being revived. But are many of the methods used in revival meetings from the Spirit? Is it not true that in many revival meetings, a revival atmosphere is created to give people a warm feeling and atmosphere? They repeatedly sing some chorus lines to stir people up. They relate moving stories to cause people to testify. These are just methods and means; they are not the power of the Holy Spirit. After the atmosphere is warmed up, the speaker stands up and preaches. In his heart he knows what will happen. The ways are already worked out: some will come and be shaking, and others will come with tears to confess their sins and make resolutions. This kind of revival goes on year after year, and everything remains the same. When the effect of the medicine runs out, the old conditions come back. Some revival meetings last only a few weeks, while others may last three or five months. In the beginning people become very burning and willing to do anything. However, after a while, everything is over. This is only because they have not received any life. For many believers, their history is a history of revivals-one revival followed by a lapse, followed by another revival. The dosage of stimulant used the first time must increase the second time; otherwise, they will not be revived again. The method used next must be more emotional and more exciting before it will take effect. I call this a spiritual "morphine" addiction. After you give an injection to someone the first time, you have to give more injections the second time. Oh, the soul can only give life to itself; it can never give life to others. If you work by the power of the soul, even if you can make men cry, make them resolve to do things, or cause them to become zealous, nothing worthwhile will be produced.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ONLY THE SPIRIT GIVES LIFE</H2><P>What is regeneration? Regeneration is to receive the Lord's resurrection life. Why does the Bible not say that we are regenerated through the Lord's birth, but through the Lord's resurrection? It is because we are not regenerated with the life of Bethlehem. The begotten life may still die, but the resurrection life will never die. The Lord says, "I am...the living One; and I became dead, and behold, I am living forever" (Rev. 1:17b-18a). The resurrection life never dies; it lives forever. The begotten life is the flesh and may die. The life we received through regeneration will live forever; it will never die.</P><P>What is resurrection? We cannot use any human method to enliven a corpse. No matter how much effort we exert or how much warmth we give to it, it will not come alive. The only way for it to be enlivened is to put God's life into it. The life which enables it to be enlivened is the resurrection life. This is the meaning of resurrection. What is worse than a dead situation? What is colder than a dead situation? A dead corpse will only spoil and stink more and more. However, once we put resurrection life into it, death will be swallowed. Therefore, a regenerated person can reject anything of death and drop anything that is dead.</P><P>Someone once spoke of the resurrection life with the following illustration. There was a person who did not believe in resurrection. He was a very renowned person among the atheists. Later he died, and his tombstone was engraved with the words: "A tomb that will never open." The tomb was ornately made with marble. Amazingly, one day the marble cracked. A spruce seed had fallen into a fracture of the stone; it gradually grew into a tree and burst the tomb wide open. A tree has life. That is why it can break the tomb. Only life can overcome death. This is regeneration, and this is resurrection.</P><P>The Spirit gives life, and only the Spirit can impart life to people. We should pay attention to this. Today there are many counterfeits of the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DEALING WITH THE SOUL</H2><P>When God works, He works with His own power. This is why we have to ask God to bind our soul. Every time we work, we must first deal with the self. We must deal with our self, and we must put our self aside. We must first lay aside our own wisdom, thoughts, talents, and virtues. We need to ask God to bind these things and say to Him, "Lord, whatever talents and abilities I have, I will not use them; I only want You to do the work. I can do nothing according to myself. I ask You to do it."</P><P>Today many co-workers think that God's power is not sufficient, so they add some of their own power. This kind of work is not only unprofitable, but it is also damaging. Bear in mind that the work of the Holy Spirit never leaves any room for the human hand. I have always said that in God's work we should be like a paper puppet, which has no life and which can do nothing by itself. An organic life would have to be put into it before it could work. Let us all reject the self to the extent that we are like a paper puppet, having no strength of our own. All the power must be from above, and all the methods must also be from above. Only the Spirit gives life. God works through the Spirit. If we want God to work, we must ask Him to bind our soul before He can freely work.</P><P>John 12:24-25 says, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit. He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life." These two verses speak of "soul-life" two times. In Greek this refers to the soul. Whoever loves his soul-life shall lose his soul-life, and whoever loses his soul-life shall keep his soul-life unto eternal life. This is the Lord's specific command. The Lord says this as an explanation for His words in verse 24: "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." Something must die before certain things will take place. If a believer will not lay down his soul-life, the Spirit will never work, and men will never receive a profit. If we want to do a deeper work, we must specifically deal with our soul. The soul should be lost. A grain of wheat is good; its golden color is attractive. But if we put it on the table, it will still be one grain even after one hundred years. It will never yield more grains. The soulish power is like a grain of wheat that has never fallen into the ground. It will never bear fruit.</P><P>Let us consider this question most soberly: Has the holy, blameless, resurrection life which we have received ever produced any fruit? Some may ask, "Why can I not save people or help people?" Others may ask, "Why do I not have any power for the work?" Many have said, "I do not have the power to work." I would answer that we have no power because our power is too great. Since we have so much power already, is there any room for God to work? If we want to use our own wisdom, methods, strength, and natural ability, we are frustrating God's power from being manifested. Many miraculous things are but an expression of the soulish power; they are not from God. Yet we use all these things as substitutes for God. How can there be desirable results? Many revival meetings might look good at the time, but the result is generally zero. There are some revival meetings that actually help people. But I am talking about those that employ human methods in their works. I want to say this very seriously to everyone who wants to do a better and deeper work: do not talk very much about power. Our responsibility is to fall into the ground and die. Once we die, we will spontaneously bear fruit.</P><P>The Lord said, "He who hates his soul-life in this world"-what will happen?-"shall keep it unto eternal life." What does this mean? Suppose that I have eloquence but do not use it. My heart is not in my eloquence, and I do not use my eloquence as a tool for my work. If I give up my eloquence and do not depend on my eloquence, what will be the result? I will gain life, and I will render help to others in life. Suppose that I have a great deal of administrative skill. If I do not exercise my natural ability, but rather wait before the Lord, others will receive practical help. Let us learn not to use our own ability. If we do this, we will bear much fruit.</P><P>Power comes from the realm of resurrection. Resurrection is a living that has passed through death. What we need is not greater power but deeper death. We need to reject every natural ability. If we never lose our own soul-life, we will never understand what power is. If we pass through death, we will gain life. If we lose our soul, we will die like a grain falling into the ground; but God's life will grow up in us and bear much fruit.</P><P>I feel that many people are too rich and too strong; there is no room for God to work in them. I often consider two words to be most precious: "utter helplessness." We can say to God, "All that I have is Yours; I have nothing besides You. Apart from You, I am utterly helpless." We will then have an attitude of total trust in God; we will feel as if we cannot breathe without Him. We will see that our holiness is from Him and our power is from Him. Whatever we need is from Him. It is God's desire that we come to Him in utter helplessness. A brother once asked me what the conditions are for the Holy Spirit to work. I said that the Holy Spirit never needs any help from the power of the soul. The Holy Spirit must first bring us to a place where we can do nothing by ourselves. Let us learn to reject everything natural. We should reject anything that is not from God, whether it is miraculous or ordinary. If we do this, God will use His power to do the work He wants to do.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD'S PATTERN</H2><P>In John 5:19 the Lord says, "Then Jesus answered and said to them, Truly, truly, I say to you, The Son can do nothing from Himself except what He sees the Father doing, for whatever that One does, these things the Son also does in like manner." From here means "out of'"; it is better to translate it "out of." For the Son to do nothing from Himself meant that the Son did nothing out of Himself. In other words, whatever the Lord was doing was not out of Himself. This was the Lord's attitude. He did not depend on His own ability; He did not depend on His own will. Whatever was out of Himself, He rejected. Was there anything bad with His soul? Was not His soulish power very useful? He did not have a trace of sin. Was it a sin for Him to exercise His soulish power? However, the Lord said, "The Son can do nothing from Himself." If one as holy and perfect as He did not exercise His own power, how about us? If He, in a living as perfect as His, still looked to God helplessly and did not act according to His own will on earth, but did everything according to the Father's will, how could humble mortals like ourselves consider doing anything by ourselves? We must drop our soulish power and must reject everything out of the soul before we will have the spiritual power to work and bear much fruit. May God bless us.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN ANNOUNCEMENT</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 27</H2><P>Since the lines and stakes of my earthly tabernacle are often shaken, I have not done a thorough job in answering letters and in corresponding with you.

The Sadducees came to Jesus asking Him concerning the matter of resurrection. They said there were seven brothers with them. The first one married a wife and died and left no children. His widow became the wife of the second brother. Likewise, the second brother also died, and the third became the husband. This continued until the seventh brother, who also eventually died. Last of all, the woman died. Whose wife would she be at the time of resurrection? The Lord gave them a very clear answer: "You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God" (Matt. 22:29). I am not going to expound on the marriage of the seven brothers, but point out from this verse two very deep principles which relate to our spiritual living. The first principle is to know the Bible, and the second is to know the power of God. Christians should have two kinds of knowledge: the first is the knowledge of the Bible, and the second is the knowledge of God.</P><P>Among God's seeking children, there are two kinds of people: the first kind know the Bible but lack the knowledge of God's power; the other kind know God's power but not the Bible. Very few Christians have both kinds of knowledge in a balanced way. Some believers have considerable Bible knowledge but know nothing about God's will, nature, and ways of working. My intention is not to talk about the equal importance of these two things, but to tell you that it is not enough to just know the Bible; we have to know God's power as well. I will assume that all of you know the Bible. What we want to see now is how to know God. It is not enough just to have the knowledge of the Bible; we must also know God. However, if we want to know God, we need to deal with God and be dealt with by God. Without dealing with God and being dealt with by God, we cannot know God. The knowledge of God comes from dealing with God and being dealt with by God. Apart from this there is no other way. This is what all of us should pay attention to.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MERE BIBLE KNOWLEDGE<br>DOES NOT NECESSARILY MAKE ONE KNOW GOD</H2><P>One day several magi came to Jerusalem asking, "Where is He who has been born King of the Jews?" (Matt. 2:2). They asked this question everywhere along their way. When Herod the king heard this, his heart was troubled, and assembling in haste all the chief priests and scribes of the people, he asked where Christ was to be born (v. 4). At that time did anyone among them say, "I do not know; let me go back to check the Scripture"? Did anyone say, "I have forgotten what the Scripture says; let me go back and look it up"? No, they could recite immediately, "In Bethlehem of Judea" (v. 5). This proves that the priests and the scribes knew the Scriptures very well. When they were asked, they answered immediately. Was their answer wrong? No, it was right. But strangely, not one scribe or priest went to Bethlehem. They knew the exact answer, but they only told the magi from the east to go to Bethlehem. They were like traffic policemen who only direct people from one place to another with a police stick in their hand, while remaining unmoved. The priests and scribes knew the Scriptures well, but they never took any action to look for the Messiah. The magi probably found out from the book left behind by Daniel about the One who was born to be the King of the Jews. Therefore, they came to seek the Lord despite the long journey. It is interesting to see that some people without Bible knowledge had the zeal to seek for Christ, while those with Bible knowledge did not seek for the Lord. It was the men from the east who came to seek the Lord from a long distance. Eventually, they found the Lord. Therefore, those who only have Bible knowledge do not necessarily know God.</P><P>This was true not only concerning Christ's birth; it was also true concerning Christ's death. It was Caiaphas who prophesied, "Nor do you take account of the fact that it is expedient for you that one man die for the people and that not the whole nation perish" (John 11:50). It was also Caiaphas and his father-in-law who sentenced Jesus to death. Therefore, we can see that it is useless to have only Bible knowledge without the knowledge of God. This is why God prophesied again and again through the prophet Jeremiah, "I will put My law within them and write it upon their hearts; and I will be their God, and they will be My people. And they will no longer teach, each man his neighbor and each man his brother, saying, Know Jehovah; for all of them will know Me, from the little one among them even to the great one among them" (Jer. 31:33-34). The outward knowledge of the Bible is not sufficient; this knowledge also needs to be written within man. The result of this inward writing is knowing God. We hope all the brothers and sisters will realize that mere biblical knowledge is not enough; we need to pursue the knowledge of God as well.</P><P>Today an unfortunate phenomenon exists in many places: too few people know God. Brothers and sisters, it is possible for us to acquire much Bible knowledge without knowing God. If all that a man has is only some Bible knowledge, he is merely making weapons of reeds, which will collapse when the wind blows and which are completely powerless when it comes to fighting the warfare. Who can say today that he knows God's purpose, God's desire, God's will, and the way of God's work? I have often said that the knowledge of God is more precious than anything else. Nothing is more precious than this. A man can open up the Bible and can expound a passage very well. Yet at the same time, he can know nothing at all about God. Although he can say a great deal, he knows nothing concerning the knowledge of God. Originally, the knowledge of the Bible was to lead people to the knowledge of God. But this is not true today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE WAY TO KNOW GOD</H2><P>The prayer of our Lord Jesus in the garden of Gethsemane was for the purpose of knowing God's will. Gethsemane means the place where oil is pressed. Our Lord knew that He ought to press out the oil there, so He knelt down and prayed, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will" (Matt. 26:39). The Bible tells us that He prayed the same way for a second time and that the words He used in His third prayer were the same. He did not just pray once and then foolishly let it go; He prayed three times. When He finished the third prayer the Bible says, "He rose up from prayer" (Luke 22:45). He left when the prayer was done, and "He came to the disciples and said to them, Are you still sleeping and resting? Behold, the hour has drawn near, and the Son of Man is being delivered up into the hands of sinners. Arise, let us be going" (Matt. 26:45-46). When He prayed in the garden of Gethsemane, He said, "All things are possible to You; remove this cup from Me" (Mark 14:36). But when Peter cut off the ear of the slave of the high priest with a sword, Jesus said, "The cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?" (John 18:11). When He was praying at Gethsemane, He was unsure of the cup; but when He was walking on His way, He had no doubt about this cup. He was willing to drink it. Through the three prayers, He came to know God. He never assumed anything; He wanted to deal with God and know God through His prayers. He dealt with God and was also dealt with by God.</P><P>There was a thorn in the flesh of the apostle Paul. We will not consider what this thorn was, but since it was a thorn, it must have been something that made him uncomfortable, something that stung him all the time. He also said that a messenger of Satan often buffeted him. Therefore, this thorn must have caused him constant discomfort. He could not overcome this thorn without the power of Christ tabernacling over him. He prayed three times to ask the Lord that it might depart from him. But the Lord said to him, "My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness" (2 Cor. 12:9). Paul was clear. Did he pray the fourth time? No. While he was praying the third time, God spoke to him, and he was clear. Paul was another person who did not want to make decisions according to his own knowledge. He desired to deal with God through prayer so that he could know God and know His will concerning certain matters.</P><P>From the experiences of the Lord and the apostle Paul we can see one principle: if a man desires to know God, he must learn how to deal with God. In other words, we have to deal with God and be dealt with by God. When many Christians encounter difficulties or problems, they let them slip by and are never dealt with by God. They do not know why God gives them such difficulties. When someone else encounters the same problem, they also do not know the reason. This kind of person may read the Bible every day, they may have knowledge and light, but they do not know God's will. This is grossly inadequate. Therefore, dear brothers and sisters, we must deal with God and be dealt with by God. Only then will we truly know Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW TO PRACTICE</H2><P>For example, every one of us has his own particular sins which he cannot overcome. With some, one sin stumbles them, while with others, another sin stumbles them. Some people cannot overcome pride, and others cannot overcome jealousy. Some cannot overcome their temper or the world or lust. Everyone knows that they have a special sin, but they cannot overcome it. By reading the Bible, some have come to know Romans 6:14, which says, "For sin will not lord it over you," and Romans 8:1-2, which says, "There is now then no condemnation to those who are in Christ Jesus. For the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death." They may have scriptural knowledge concerning these matters, but they still cannot overcome their sins. The truth they obtain cannot be carried out in practice. I am afraid that among us today there are some brothers and sisters who are like this! If a believer who has failed to overcome sin comes to them, they can tell him the high teaching of victory over sin, when in fact they may still be in the bondage of sins that they are unable to overcome. Consequently, the brother who came to consult with them will only gain some knowledge of sin, but still will be unable to experientially overcome his own sins. This indicates that they only have the knowledge of the Bible. They have never been dealt with by God and have no knowledge of God's power.</P><P>How do we know God through His dealings? Suppose you lose your temper quite often, and you come to God's presence and ask God to eradicate the root of your sin. Soon there may be a brother who comes to you asking for help on overcoming this sin. You may tell him to ask God to eradicate the root of his sin of temper, like removing a tooth. (I wish that such a thing could happen. But we have said many times that this is impossible. We cannot eradicate the root of sin; rather, the more we try to eradicate the root, the stronger it becomes.) After the second one learns the teaching, he will also begin to teach others in the same way. However, they will find that not only is the root of sin not removed, but it has actually taken deeper root. If you fear God, you will not easily let the sins that you cannot overcome go by; you will certainly want to deal with God. You must come before God and pray once, twice, three times, asking God to tell you what this is all about. God will then show you the truth in Romans 6:6. God has dealt with the body of sin by crucifying the old man; He has not eradicated the root of sin from the flesh. Instead, He has crucified the old man through the cross.</P><P>After a while you find yourself losing your temper again. You may want to ask a brother what has happened. He may tell you that when the Lord Jesus was crucified, your old man was crucified with Him and that you will overcome if you count yourself as dead. In this way you will acquire more new knowledge. However, when temptation comes, no matter how much you reckon yourself dead, it will be useless. Your temper will still be there. You may think that this method does not work. Although the Bible says clearly that this kind of reckoning will make you overcome, you find yourself still being defeated. If you are one who fears God, you will ask God again. By then you will realize that you do not reckon yourself dead with Christ when temptation comes. Rather, you died with Christ more than nineteen hundred years ago. Your heart will rest upon what Christ has accomplished. When temptation comes you will know that your old man died more than nineteen hundred years ago. You will not need to take hold of any particular word; you will only need to rest on the work that God has accomplished.</P><P>However, a short time later the temptation will come back, and you will find yourself losing your temper again. If you do not fear God, you will probably stop here. But if you fear God, you will not be satisfied with Bible knowledge. You will ask God again, saying, "God, Your Word tells me that my old man has been crucified with You; why can I not overcome my sin?" You will deal with God again. Perhaps God will tell you that you are wrong in certain things, or perhaps He will tell you that you do not realize the corruption of your flesh and that you are dependent on yourself. This is why He allows you to err or stumble, so that you will realize the corruption of the flesh. You will then learn another lesson; you will know your self and the corruption of your flesh. In this way you will not dare to do anything but humbly ask God to protect you, and you will no longer trust in your flesh.</P><P>But before long you will fail again. If you fear God, you will come before God to deal with God, saying, "Why is it that I still cannot overcome my sin? I have reckoned my old man dead and have known the corruption of my flesh. Why do I still fail?" You may pray once, twice, three times, even four or five times. You may ask God to speak to you. In the end God may grant you the revelation to see that sin is like the fruit of a tree. The tree of life bears fruit every month and bears twelve kinds of fruit, but the root of sin produces thousands of different kinds of fruits. There is only one root of sin, but its fruit multiplies day after day. God may say, "If you only deal with one sin and neglect the other sins, the other sins will come back, and you will find yourself committing the same old sinful habits as before." If you only deal with your temper, while the other sins are still there, before long the sin of temper will come back. You have not dealt with your pride or your jealousy, and you have forgotten to deal with other sins like your unclean thoughts. All those who forget to deal with other sins will find their past sins coming back to them. All those who forget to deal with the root of sin will find the miscellaneous sins coming back to them. If you only pay attention to your temper, you will fail. But if you pay attention to dealing with sin itself, God will bless you.</P><P>While you are dealing with your sin this way, you may think that you have overcome and are walking on the broad way to victory; you may think that now you can live peacefully. But perhaps not too long afterward, sin will come back again, and you will find yourself failing again. This is a critical time, and you must not relax. You have to come before God once more to ask Him to deal with you. After praying once or twice, God may give you another new revelation. You will realize how you should live after you have overcome. God will show you that all Christ has accomplished on the cross can be maintained only in fellowship with God. God may say that your prayer and reading of the Bible have become lax or that you have been rising too late every day; therefore, your fellowship with God has been frustrated. This does not mean that the work of Christ on the cross has failed. It only means that the accomplishment of Christ on the cross can only be maintained in the atmosphere of fellowship with God.</P><P>Perhaps after a few days, you will lose your temper again. You will pray the same way again, asking God to deal with you. Perhaps God will say that you are good in everything but that you still have not obeyed one of His commandments. This may be a specific commandment that God has for you. You have been touched, but you have refused and procrastinated. As a result, God allows you to lose your victory. You have not obeyed, and your old sins begin to come back again. Therefore, brothers and sisters, as long as we disobey once, we will not overcome sin. In the past I have often shared with you the matter of trusting and obeying. This is the secret to victory. If one slackens in his obedience, his faith will be weakened.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ONE WHO KNOWS GOD</H2><P>If you know God and have experienced God's dealings, you will know at which point someone cannot get through. Since you may have experienced dealing with God more than fifty times in certain matters, you can help others go through the same. You are not just telling someone about the Bible, but are telling them about God.</P><P>Last summer many famous people were speaking at a very popular spiritual conference. Someone told me that I should attend because a certain one gave good messages during those few days. I went there once. The subject of the message was "The Infilling of the Holy Spirit." The Scriptures he used were quite adequate, and the parables and logic were also very good. But after he spoke for ten minutes, I asked myself, "Is this the so-called infilling of the Holy Spirit?" His preaching was good, but several laymen's words slipped out from his mouth; therefore, I knew that he did not know God in this matter at all. He did not know anything about the infilling of the Holy Spirit. Mere Bible knowledge cannot make one know God or minister God. We must learn to take the way of the cross and must experience God's dealings. The Lord did not say, "I am the Son of God, so I do not need to worry about God's will." On the contrary, He prayed to the Father once, twice, and even three times, until He finished the prayer. Then He said, "The cup which the Father has given Me, shall I not drink it?" (John 18:11).</P><P>The apostle Paul also prayed to the Lord again and again until the Lord spoke to him: "My grace is sufficient for you" (2 Cor. 12:9). Later Paul was misunderstood by the Corinthians. Second Corinthians express Paul's sorrow, while Philippians expresses Paul's joy. Only these two books among Paul's epistles express his emotions. But I love to read the Epistles to the Corinthians more than the Epistle to the Philippians. The Corinthians misunderstood him and said that he was not honest and that God consequently made him sick. Paul did not ask God to remove his thorn in an attempt to avoid being laughed at by the Corinthians. He said, "Concerning this I entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from me. And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you" (2 Cor. 12:8-9a). Because God had spoken, he did not ask God to change His will. Paul said, "Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me" (2 Cor. 12:9b). No one can know God without first having dealings with Him. I have told several brothers that if anyone wants to progress, the only way is to be dealt with by God. If you do not accept God's dealing, you will never progress. If you want Bible knowledge, all you have to do is study hard and receive some help from those who have Bible knowledge. But if you want to know God, there is no way except to deal with God personally and be dealt with by Him.</P><P>I often treasure very much the experience of those who know God. I know from their words that they are experienced in knowing God and that they truly know God. One sister from the West was truly a person who was waiting for the Lord's second coming. (Many scholars of prophecy do not even know what it is to wait for the Lord's second coming!) Whenever I went to her, I was afraid of doing anything, because as soon as she opened her mouth, I realized that she was a very experienced person. I remember that I prayed with her on the last day of 1925. She said, "Lord, are You really going to let 1925 go by? Do You really want to wait until 1926 before You will come back? Even on this last day, I will still ask You to come today." I knew what she was praying for. Several months later I met her on the street. She held my hand and said to me, "Brother, it is strange. Why has He still not come back today?" These words proved that she not only was a scholar of prophecy, but was also a person who had fellowship with God and who truly waited for the Lord. She knew God and was experienced in the matter of the Lord's coming again.</P><P>Once I talked to another sister. I thought she was not very experienced in spiritual things. But after a short conversation, I knew that she was very experienced. She was one who had passed through God's dealings and was a person who had dealt with God.</P><P>In Peking I met an old believer. He did not have much knowledge of the Bible. I did not think highly of some of his behavior either. But he really knew God. While I was talking to him, he said, "Christ is responsible for everything." He was rather poor, but both he and his wife were happy. He said that although he encountered many difficulties, Christ was responsible for everything. I asked him, "What then are you responsible for?" He said, "I am responsible for singing the praise." This is like King Jehoshaphat who, when going into battle, ordered the singers to sing before the battlefield (2 Chron. 20:21-22). I said, "Since you gave up everything for Christ, do you have any regrets at all?" He answered straightly, "You do not understand. Christ is responsible for everything; I am not responsible for it." You can see that regarding the matter of the Lord bearing our responsibility, he was far ahead of us. We can only be his student. He is an experienced person regarding the Lord's bearing of our responsibility. What he has is not just Bible knowledge, but knowledge that he has learned from God. Some have really experienced God's dealing, and they know what it is to be dealt with by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEVER STOPPING UNTIL ONE RECEIVES<br>GOD'S DEALING</H2><P>Not only do we have to deal with our sins, and not only do we have to know God, but we need dealings in our environment as well. For example, do you let everything that happens in your family go by freely? If you pray only once and then stop praying because you do not receive God's answer, you can never expect to know God. Paul surely was not like this. He prayed once, twice, even three times to the Lord until the Lord answered his prayers. If you are only willing to pray once, then you do not need to pray. If God does not answer you the first, second, or third time, you should pray ten times or a hundred times until God speaks to you. Keep in mind that any hastiness is contrary to faith and prayers. Faith is the most enduring thing. If God does not answer, you should be able to wait until you are one hundred years old. Abraham believed in hope in a situation that was against hope. Elisha told King Joash to beat the ground with an arrow. Joash only beat the ground three times, and Elisha said that he could only win the battle over the Syrians three times. If he would have beaten it several times more, he could have destroyed the Syrians (2 Kings 13:14-19). Our prayers should be the same. We cannot stop our prayers at two or three times.</P><P>Mr. Usher said that prayers are like putting name cards on a balance. You put one gram of weight on one side and then put the cards one by one on the other side. After the first one or two cards, the other side may not move; perhaps, only after you have added the last card will the weight be offset. Prayer is the same; you have to pray once, twice, three times, again and again. Perhaps by the last time, the prayer will be answered.</P><P>Therefore, we have to learn to deal with God. In our physical health, in our work, in our family, in every detail of our environment, we have to ask God to deal with us. I know a sister who is over sixty years old. She said to me that everything she encounters in her environment has something to do with her. I asked her, "Is this really true?" She said, "Yes." I thought that she only said this in her preaching and that the fact might not have been so. Once a brother had a cold, and she wrote to him: "What lesson have you learned from this cold?" I thought that it would be reasonable to learn something if he had a severe disease like intestinal flu. But how could he learn a lesson from a small cold? But this brother received the help. He replied, "I did not normally pay attention to this. By your asking, this matter has come to my attention. I have been dealt with by God, and I have repented."</P><P>There was another brother whose relative was sick. This sister again wrote and said, "You have to be responsible for prayer. You should not allow this sickness to go on." Consequently, this brother also received help from her. Once she herself was sick in bed. Her co-worker was away in another place. She was out of money, and her cook also went home for some reason. She prayed continuously, asking God, "Why does this sickness come upon me?", and God showed her that this was not from Him, but this was Satan's attack. She said, "If this is due to my own problem, I can remain sick. But if this is Satan's attack, let the sickness be gone." She had been ill for four days with a high fever, but she stood up right after she prayed. At this time she wrote a song: "To the foe my word is always, `No,' / To the Father it is `Yes.'" We have this song in our hymn book. When she finished writing this song, she went out to work, and her sickness was over.</P><P>Wherever she was, she had God's hand with her. She fully understood Christ's victory. Once she told me that everything would be all right if we really knew Christ's victory. I could easily find Colossians 2:14-15 in the Bible, which says that Christ triumphed over everything on the cross, or Hebrews 2:14, which says that through death He destroyed him who has the might of death, or 1 John 3:8, which says that the Son of God was manifested to destroy the works of the devil, or Revelation 12:11, which says that the brothers overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb. But whenever I heard of Christ's victory from this sister's mouth, I always felt that with her there seemed to be a special meaning. I did not understand this, and I was bewildered all the time. Once I stayed in her house and was very sick. At that time in addition to my sickness, I was really depressed in my heart because a few matters were still unresolved. She came to see me, and I told her my problems. After every phrase that I spoke, she stared at me and said, "Christ has won the victory." I said that I was not afraid of the outward sickness, but that whenever I thought about the inward problems that were not yet worked out, I broke out in a cold sweat, and I just could not bear it. She still said, "Christ has won the victory." I said, "You cannot say this. To the enemy you can say, `Christ has won the victory.' To sin, we can trust in the cleansing of the blood. To sickness, we can say that Christ has borne our infirmities. In all these things, we can say that Christ has won the victory. But this is my own fault; I have a problem with God. How can you say Christ has won the victory?" But she still said, "Christ has won the victory." Then she read two verses to me. At that moment I became fully clear inside and out. On that day I realized what Christ's victory really meant. Prior to this I had only the Bible knowledge. From that day on, I received the real knowledge from God. I also realized that the victory I used to know was a weapon of reed and that it was useless. On that day I realized how much Christ's victory includes. Whether it be the enemy, sin, sickness, or personal business, Christ's victory covers them all. She knew Christ's victory through her repeated experience of God's dealings. She knew God, so she was able to help others.</P><P>Today many believers have not paid enough attention to Bible knowledge. Let me ask you: which book from among the sixty-six books of the Bible do you really know? It is a pity that most of today's Christians do not even understand one book in the Bible. But more pitiful than this is the fact that they are ignorant about the knowledge of God. If you want to know God, you have to deal with God concerning your body, your family, and your environment. You should not let anything go by carelessly. You have to pray until you have God's answer. By doing this you will learn a lesson which the Bible alone cannot teach you. If you do this you will know the next time that you have to deal with God in everything. If you learn this time after time, you will really know God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br>THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOD AND OUR WORK</H2><P>Let me also say a few words to those brothers and sisters who are co-workers. No one can work for God without knowing God. Many people who believe in the clergy-laity system think that as long as they go to the seminary to study the Bible, they can preach the gospel. I would like to ask this: when we preach the gospel to others, are we merely giving them some Bible expositions, or are we giving them the Savior? Is this merely Bible exposition, or are we telling others the good news? Even if the seminary is as good as you think, it can only teach you to understand the Bible; it cannot teach you to know God. Today many people understand the Bible, many can even systematize the Bible in a very good order, but how many of them can minister God and know God? We have to learn to know God before we can work for God. Some people say that they want to do a personal preaching work. They hope that they can preach, but they have nothing to say when they come before the crowd. They are uncertain as to what they should say. Indeed, a man can only preach what he is touched by in the Word; he can only help others in the areas that God has touched him. What can we preach if we do not know God?</P><P>Suppose you have not dealt with a certain sin, and God's hand is always touching you concerning this point. Whenever you pray, God always points to this sin and says, "You have not dealt with this sin." He will not let you go. Next time when you see a brother in a similar situation, you will know that Bible knowledge alone cannot help him get through and that he has to deal with his sins. If you carelessly allow your sin to get by, and if you see a brother committing a similar sin, you will excuse him in your heart because you have been excusing yourself. If you do this, you cannot help him at all.</P><P>If a brother has a hard time rising up early, and if he has been caught and dealt with by God in this matter, when he sees another brother doing the same thing, he will lay hold of this brother and will tell him, "Brother, get up quickly; otherwise, the manna will be melted." He can help this brother because he has been dealt with by God.</P><P>Preaching the word is preaching what we have been dealt with by God. If this is not the case, even though we may preach something, we cannot lead others to what we preach. Today we have so much preaching with so little result because we have not been dealt with by God nor taught by God. If we only preach a Bible sermon that we have prepared in two or three hours, it will be merely a teaching, and it would be better for us not to preach it at all. We must have three to five years of experiencing God's dealing before we can preach something to others. New wine and aged wine are both useful, yet most people prefer aged wine because it is more tasteful. If we deal with everything that we run into every day, one by one, we can help those who encounter the same thing. Many of us do not know how to help young believers and sinners because we do not know what is within their hearts and what their backgrounds are. Under these circumstances, we cannot offer any help to them.</P><P>Do you know the difference between a discourse and a report? A discourse cannot render any help to people, but a report can. The discourse that you expound may make others feel that you are very logical. But you cannot help others go on the way, because your discourse does not have any base to it. This is like an elementary school student composing a travelogue; he writes of sceneries which he has never seen. What about a report? A report means you have something in hand and can describe it point by point. You can only give a poor description; you can never give a wrong description. This is because what is described is real, something that can be touched and seen. Whether you are working on believers or unbelievers, the most important thing is that you have to be dealt with by God. After you are dealt with, you will speak the reality, and others will touch it.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, we have to deal with hundreds and thousands of events before God. Unfortunately, to this day we have neglected so many things that need to be dealt with by God. Day after day if we learn to be dealt with by God, we will know God in the long run. Many believers run around asking people questions, but they themselves never seek to know God. They may have been saved for many years, but they still do not know God. What a pitiful situation this is! We should ask God what we should do in this or that matter, and we should not stop asking until we know God. Do not pray just once and think that it is over. Again I say it would be better for those who only want to pray once to not pray at all.</P><P>Finally, I have to say that no lazy person can know God. I would also tell the co-workers that if something does not cause us to feel pained, we will never cause others to feel pained. I hope we learn to deal with God daily, and I hope that we are dealt with by Him daily. This kind of experience and condition is most precious. It is more precious to know God than to have mere Bible knowledge. May God bless us.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE WAY TO KNOW GOD-<br>DEALING WITH GOD<br>AND BEING DEALT WITH BY GOD</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 28</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 5:7; 12:8; Matt. 26:44</H1><P>Today we will continue to consider the matter of knowing God. We will consider how we can learn to deal with God and how to be dealt with by Him. In other words, we will learn how to have dealings with God. Last time I mentioned only one aspect, which was how to deal with God. That was not enough. We should learn, step by step, to know God. If we know nothing about God's nature and how to communicate with Him, it will be impossible to go on. Today I want to mention two items: one is learning to know God through prayer, and the other is learning to know God through His will.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING TO KNOW GOD THROUGH PRAYER</H2><P>One matter that causes many Christians to grope in darkness is that they do not know how to receive answers to prayer. Every Christian has a desire that God would listen to his prayers. If God listens to your prayers only once every three to five years or once every three to five months, you are what can be considered as an abnormal Christian. Many people barely have even one answer to their prayer. I do not mean that they do not pray; I mean that their prayers produce no effect. Many believers have no assurance about the things they pray for. They do not know whether or not God will answer their prayers. As time passes by, if they get what they pray for, they say that God has answered their prayers; if not, they say that God has not answered their prayers. They have no assurance at all from the beginning. We should be very rich, but because we do not know how to pray, we become very poor. How poor that God only answers our prayers once every three to five years! I have mentioned many times that we cannot live a life in which God does not answer our prayers. If this is the case, we have indeed fallen into an extremely poor condition.</P><P>Today I would like to talk about how a Christian should pray. How long should we pray before we obtain God's answer? What kind of assurance should we have after we pray, and what should the results be? What is the basis for this kind of knowledge? It comes from our knowledge of God. If you ask anyone these questions, he may tell you that you should pray to remove sin, that prayer should be with faith, or that you should pray according to God's will, etc. He may give many doctrines about prayer. However, many people understand prayer only through the Bible; they never understand prayer before God. They read the Bible and know the conditions for God to answer their prayers. But it is of little use to only have knowledge from the Bible without knowledge that is learned by dealing with God. We must spend time before God to learn to deal with Him and to be dealt with by Him; only then will we know God's requirements concerning prayer. Knowing God through prayer does not come by accident or by learning from others. Neither does it come by listening to my messages. A travel guide can only direct you to a place; he can never bring you there. If you do not go, you will never have any experience.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, suppose you have a desire or a request for God to fulfill, and you begin to pray for it. While you pray, you may or may not be very enthusiastic, and you may or may not have spent much time praying. But what is most interesting is that you never consider that you should know God through your prayer. You do not care whether or not God answers your prayer. For example, you may ask God for a book. One day God may indeed give you the book. You will think that God has answered your prayer and then forget about it. However, you should realize that you have not just received a book, but something more, which is the knowledge of God. Oh, only after you know how to ask will God answer! Receiving the book is not the most important thing. The precious thing is the acquisition of the knowledge of how God answers prayer. By praying this way, you are brought on further in the knowledge of God. Our knowledge should not only be from the Bible, but should also be from God Himself.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>REMOVING BARRIERS </H2><P>Suppose you ask God for another book and after four or five days, He has not given it to you; after two months God still has not given it to you. If after three or four months God still has not answered your prayer, and you do not know why, you must have a seeking and searching heart to ask Him why He answered your prayer the first time but not this time. You must find the problem. The problem must not be on God's side. God has no lack, and He has the power to accomplish your prayer. The problem is definitely on your side. You ought to put aside the matter of asking for the book and search for the reason that there is no answer. You can ask God, saying, "God! I have asked You for a book. Why do You not give it to me?" When you earnestly seek and ask God to show you, God will tell you to deal with this and that matter before He will answer your prayer. After you have dealt with these matters, God will give you the book after three to five days. But by then you have not just received a book, but something deeper-the knowledge of God. This knowledge will cause you to not pray as before. You will know that you have to remove the barriers before God will answer your prayer.</P><P>All the knowledge we acquire from God comes by some amount of laboring; we cannot acquire this knowledge simply by reading or listening. If we learn how to deal with God and how to be dealt with by God in everything, that is, if we learn to have dealings with God in everything, we will know what God wants from us, what He wants to remove from us, and what He wants to accomplish in us. In this way we will know God, and God will be known by us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DESIRE</H2><P>I will mention a few more things about our experience so that we can know God more. There are many spiritual principles concerning the matter of praying. If we do not learn them, God will not answer our prayers. For example, we may ask God for a watch. After we pray for two or three days or five or six days, we forget about the matter. God has not answered our prayer, and we have totally forgotten about it. Many times we pray for this or that or tens or hundreds of other things. God has not answered us, so we forget about it and so does God. This kind of prayer is like not even praying at all. Strictly speaking, we should ask God why He has not given us the watch. We should say, "God, I asked for a watch; why did You not give it to me?" When we deal with God this way, He will show us that our desire is not strong enough. Since our desire is not that strong, even if God were to answer our prayer, we would not feel very happy. If God did not answer our prayer, we also would not feel much of a loss. Since this is our condition, God cannot answer our prayer. Any prayer that cannot move our own heart cannot move God. If we pray, we must have an absolute desire before God. We should not let God go if He does not answer. If we can let go of something whether or not God answers our prayer, He will certainly not answer our prayer, because He knows that it does not matter to us. If we realize this, we will acquire new knowledge and realize that all of our prayers must be accompanied by sincere desires.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ASKING</H2><P>Sometimes we are full of desire, yet still do not receive an answer. If we ask God again, He may tell us that while we truly have a desire, we have not asked; we have not opened our mouth to speak out what we want. This is what the Bible says: "You do not have because you do not ask" (James 4:2). Thus, you acquire new knowledge that even with a desire within, you still have to ask without.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OBEDIENCE </H2><P>Suppose that you want God to answer your prayer and you have a desire within and an asking without, and God still has not answered your prayers. If you pray again and ask God why He has not answered you, He may say that you still have not obeyed Him in one thing and that He will not listen to your prayer until you obey Him in that one thing. Then you will realize that you need to obey God totally. After you have obeyed Him, you may say, "O God, I have removed what You wanted me to remove. God, answer my prayer now." In this way you acquire the new knowledge that God only answers the prayers of the obedient ones. The kind of knowledge which you acquire through dealing with God and through being dealt with by God is very different from the knowledge you acquire from reading the Bible or listening to messages.</P><P>Let me say a sincere word. The reason God does not listen to the prayers of many brothers and sisters is that they have not learned to obey God. If you do not listen to God all the time, neither will He listen to your prayer. You may think that many things are small and that you can ignore them. You may ignore them, but God will never ignore them. Let me say a very frank word: Many Christians still need to go through a thorough dealing from God. You cannot ignore things, one by one, until tens or hundreds of items have piled up. When you pray to God, you must have a thorough dealing with each matter, one by one. Unless you do this, God will not answer your prayer. Sometimes a great danger is approaching, and God may make an exception and listen to you. However, if you want God to continually answer your prayers, you have to faithfully obey God every time, on every item, and in everything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FAITH</H2><P>Perhaps you have obeyed, but your prayers are still not answered. You should then inquire of God again. Perhaps God will tell you that you have no faith. You can then inquire how you can have faith. Perhaps you repeatedly ask God to answer your prayer, and you pray that He will give you faith. If you still do not have it, God may tell you that you need to deal with some things before you can have the faith. Perhaps you have prayed too zealously and asked repeatedly, to the point that even when God says no, you do not let Him go. This proves that you have not obeyed. When you obey, you will say, "God, even if You do not give me what I want, I will still obey You." This seems to contradict the point about desire that we mentioned earlier. Indeed, many spiritual things are contradictory one to another. Yet they are all facts. When you reach this point, God may tell you that you need to ask for faith. If you, accordingly, pray for faith, you may come across or may look up a passage in the Bible, and one of the lines will lay hold of you. The word lays hold of you, instead of you laying hold of the word. The letters may be in a small size, but when the word lays hold of you, they may appear to be much larger. You will realize that God has comforted you and has given you a word. You will realize that God has heard your prayer and has given you the promise. You can then speak to God and reckon with Him on the basis of His word. In this way you acquire the new knowledge of faith in God in prayer. By then you will know what faith means in the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PRAISING </H2><P>Perhaps you have dealt with everything and have obtained faith. Yet you still have not received the watch. You may pray again. After you have prayed for one or two months, you still may not have received the watch. The more you pray, the less likely it appears that you will receive it. You ask the Lord again and learn that after receiving a promise, you should praise rather than pray. If you pray after you have already obtained faith, your prayer will bring forth doubts. If God has given you the word and you have the faith, you should praise. Satan may come at once to tempt, saying, "You should pray." You should reply, "No, I should praise." He may come a second time to tempt, saying, "You should pray." You should still reply, "No. God has heard my prayer, and I should praise instead." This is the right thing to do. This is actually what happens in our human relationships; if others have not promised anything, you can ask for it. But if they have promised something, all you have to do is thank them. In the same way, since God has given you His promise, you should praise Him. If you pray more, the prayer will cause you to lose your faith. Mr. B______, an experienced brother in the Lord, once said, "Do not pray yourself out of the realm of faith." If your prayer causes you to lose faith, doubts will be brought in. More prayer means that you do not believe what the Lord has spoken to you. In this way you acquire new knowledge from God; you now know how to offer up praise in your prayer based on faith.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>REMINDING GOD </H2><P>However, after praising again and again, you still may have not received what you prayed for. You ask God again, "Why is this so?" You then find out that after you have faith, you must not only praise, but also must remind God. As the Lord said in Isaiah, "Put Me in remembrance" (43:26). It is as if God can forget, and we have to remind Him. God may have promised, but He needs us to remind Him. We should say, not with a heart of unbelief but with a heart of faith, "Lord, You have given me Your promise. You should remember Your promise." This is exactly what King Solomon did. He said to God, "Now, O Lord God, let thy promise unto David my father be established" (2 Chron. 1:9). This way of reminding God is very meaningful. The reason that God delays His promise is that we may have the opportunity to deal with Him. In this way we acquire new knowledge; we have learned how to remind Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A DEEPER LESSON </H2><P>Having done all these, you may still not have what you asked for. There is something more you have to learn. The matter of prayer is so simple that even a six-year-old child can do it, but it is also so complicated that a person with seventy or eighty years of experience still has much that he does not know or comprehend. Perhaps God wants you to wait. Or perhaps Satan is attacking you, in which case you should learn to resist. The knowledge of God's way is acquired through numerous prayers. The next time you pray, you will know how much you have to remove; then you will get God's answer whenever you ask. An experienced believer has a great deal of assurance about his prayers. He knows without any doubt that at a certain time God has answered his prayer. Without this kind of knowledge, we will not know whether or not God has answered us. We will also be full of doubts and have no rest at all. We must learn to know God in things that are big or small. If we do this again and again, God will answer our prayer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SOME EXPERIENCES </H2><P>Once a friend of mine was short of one hundred fifty dollars (if I remember right). At the time he was living in a village. He needed this amount of money on Monday, and it was Saturday. The steam ferryboat only docked at his village several times during the week, and no boats were scheduled to arrive before Monday. He had only two dollars in his pocket. He prayed to the Lord, and the Lord said to him, "You still have two dollars. This is only Saturday. Wait until the two dollars are spent, and see what happens on Monday." He submitted to God and concentrated on how he should spend the two dollars. As he went out to preach the gospel, he met a man who said to him, "I cleaned your windows the other day and have not yet asked you for payment." So he paid this person one dollar as usual. Now he had only one dollar remaining in his pocket. As he walked further, he met a beggar asking for money. He thought about having only one dollar, and the dollar seemed to become more precious to him. He considered changing the dollar into coins and giving half of the coins to the beggar. But at that very moment, he knew that was wrong, and he, subsequently, gave the whole dollar to the beggar. Once the dollar bill went out, God came in. He was very happy and said that there was nothing left for him to depend on in this world and that God must take care of him and bless him. He went to sleep and worked on the Lord's Day as usual. It was marvelous that one of his friends cabled him a money order on Monday, and it was exactly one hundred fifty dollars. If I remember right, the cable charge was about thirty to fifty dollars. But there was not any shortage for the payment he was supposed to make.</P><P>Every time we want God to answer our prayers, we must go through God's dealing. Even a large bottle can be plugged with a small plug. If it is then thrown into the sea, not one drop of sea water will enter into the bottle. The two dollars remaining in our pockets are just like the small plug; if we do not remove this plug, we cannot receive anything from God. We cannot learn very much at once. However, if we have prayed for ten years, we should have ten years of praying experience; if we have prayed for twenty years, we should have twenty years of praying experience. Our experience should become deeper as time goes on. In the end we will realize that even the words of our prayer are crucial. We will know that if we pray in a certain way, God will not listen, and if we pray in another way, God will listen. Everything has to be thoroughly studied. Whenever we pray we should have the confidence that God will answer. We do not have to wait three to five months to realize God's answer. Without the experience of knowing God in prayer, no one can have the experience of knowing God.</P><P>Once, Miss M.E. Barber felt that it was God's will that she prepare about ten rooms for hospitality for believers. These would be apartment-like buildings. She prayed for this and, marvelously, God caused a nearby vocational school to close and it was rented to her. There were twenty rooms altogether, and the monthly rent was only twenty dollars. The matter was thus settled. I felt that it was quite remarkable.</P><P>Four years later, some bad news came that the vocational school would be reopened. I heard this news through my father because he was one of the board members of the school. One afternoon I went purposely to visit Miss Barber and asked whether or not she was aware of the news. She said that she had indeed received a notice from the school that it was scheduled to reopen in the fall. The school had hired two engineers from the United States to come, and they were on their way. The matter was very certain in their eyes. I asked her, "Are you going to move?" She said, "No." I asked again, "Have you prayed?" She said, "No, I do not even need to pray this time." A young believer who was there said that she must have been deceived by Satan. She answered, "Do not say that so quickly; let us wait and see." Then I asked her again how she could be so sure. She said, "God does not play jokes on us. He said that He wanted me to manage some living quarters. I have done this. He has not told me to stop; will He cast us out? God does not play jokes on us." But how about the other party? The engineers were on their way, and the opening of the school was definite. But she was enjoying her summer vacation peacefully on the mountain, as if this situation would never occur. Remarkably, when she was about to come down from the mountain, the school sent her a letter telling her that the school would not reopen. They asked her to continue renting the rooms because, while they were preparing to reopen the school, an unexpected financial change had forced them to declare bankruptcy. Oh, once we realize clearly the principle of God's working, no matter what happens, we will know definitely how to deal with it. In this way we will avoid many unnecessary actions and words. If we know God, we will certainly know the way He acts. If we know a person's disposition, we can predict how he will act and speak under various circumstances. If we know God, we will know whether He will answer our prayers or not.</P><P>Today the church is always paying attention to Bible studies. Bible studies are very important, but I urge everyone to realize that it is more important to know God. After you have learned all these lessons, when you see someone with problems, groping in darkness, you will be very clear about what he should do. Situations may differ, but the principle is the same. When you pray with someone, you will know assuredly whether his prayer will be answered or not. When you pray with two persons, you will know which one knows how to pray and which one does not. This does not mean that you are a prophet; it merely means that you know the outcome of their prayer based on their spiritual condition.</P><P>We must never be contented and never think that it does not matter whether or not God answers our prayer. How precious it is to have a definite answer every time.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING TO KNOW GOD FROM HIS WILL </H2><P>In the future I will speak on this topic specifically. Perhaps I will need to speak four or five messages on this. Today I will just speak briefly about it. If we want to know God's will, we also need to deal with God. If we have not been dealt with by God, we cannot know His will. Some brothers and sisters may think, "God's will is the greatest thing in the entire world; how can we possibly know it?" Yes, God is indeed great. How then can He reveal His will to little men like us? We have to first adjust ourselves. If a mirror is foggy, it cannot reflect a clear image; if it is too long or too short, convex or concave, it will also distort a person's real image. If we do not adjust ourselves, the will of God will be very distorted by us. Every time we want to know God's will, we must first deal with our selves. We must be willing to lay down our selves and forsake everything, before God will reveal His will to us. Whenever we are seeking God's will, our self must first be dealt with by God.</P><P>Whenever Mr. George Muller sought God's will, he continually searched and examined the situation. In his diary, whenever he mentioned something for the first time, he would always say that things seemed to point toward a certain way. The second time he mentioned it, he would say again that things seemed to point toward that way. After a month or two, he would record the same thing with the same remark that things seemed to be pointing a certain way. It would sound like, "On a certain day, someone came, and what he asked seemed to have to do with this matter." Or it would say, "On a certain day, what a certain co-worker said seemed to match this matter." Sometimes he would say that on a certain day he received a promise. After a period of time, he would record that the matter was now quite clear. Still later, he would say, "Now not only is there the word, but there is the supply also." Yet later, he would say, "Now the matter is absolutely clear." Sometimes he would record in his diary that though he did not have much money, God was beginning to provide and was blessing him again. Therefore, he was not afraid of those who scoffed at him, neither would he make a contract with others. Whenever a need arose, he asked God to provide, and God's provision always met the need exactly. He was always learning to deal with God.</P><P>One day as he was praying, he felt that God wanted him to return to Germany. He said to God, "There are three matters at present which prevent me from returning: (1) if my wife goes along, there is no one to take care of my three children; (2) there are no traveling funds; and (3) there is a need for someone to care for the orphans in my place. I do not know whether You want me to go. If You do, please make provisions for these matters." One day someone came, and he felt that this person would be very suitable to care for the orphans. He told God that one need had been met, but that there were still two more. Before long, a sister wanted to stay in his house for a few months, who, at the same time, could take care of his children. The second need was also met. Then someone offered an amount of money to him (he never took any money from his work), and the last need was also met. When this happened, he asked God, "Can I leave for Germany now?" These dealings were clearly recorded in his diary. He always learned to deal with God step by step.</P><P>How can one know God's will? Someone may tell you that the first thought that comes to your mind after you pray is God's will. But this is not always so. Mr. Muller's spiritual growth was faster than others because of his thorough dealing. This has much to do with prayer. Those who do not pray in a thorough way can never know God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE STORY OF ABIGAIL </H2><P>Mr. Muller once taught a little girl how to pray. Eventually, she learned it. The girl's name was Abigail. She was very young. She wanted some colorful yarn in order to make a play ball. When she saw this man of God, Mr. Muller, coming to her house, she bargained with him, saying, "My parents said you can pray very well. I would like to ask you for one thing. I would like to have a yarn ball with different colors. Can you please pray for me?" The old man said, "Yes, but you need to pray for this as well." The little girl knelt down, and this man of God also knelt down with her. The girl first prayed, "I want a yarn ball, and it must be colorful." Then this man of God bowed down his head with silvery hair, put his hand on the girl, and prayed, "Lord, here is a child who wants a yarn ball with different colors. No one knows this, neither can I provide it. This matter is Yours; please listen to her prayer." After this old man uttered his prayer, he was silent, yet he appeared to still mutter something. Then he stood up and told the girl that God would give her the colorful yarn within a couple of days. At that time the girl's heart leapt. He brought her request to God. She thought that perhaps her grandmother or her aunt would bring her some colorful yarn. The following evening, her father brought home some colorful yarn to her. She was extremely happy. Her father owned a department store, and all the other kinds of yarn, except this one, had been sold. It had been on display in the store for a long time. Since it did not look nice on the shelf, he took it home and gave it to his daughter. The next time Mr. Muller saw her, he asked, "Have you enjoyed playing with your yarn ball?" He did not ask her whether or not she had received the ball, but whether or not she had fun playing with it. A person who knows God has this kind of assurance. Mr. Muller had countless anecdotes like this during his lifetime. Every time, he was always very accurate. It took him several decades to learn. He followed God until he was more than ninety years old. Many of his experiences were learned from following God. He never did anything in a vague way. In his diary he always recorded clearly what had happened on a certain day. He dealt with God in this way all the time. It is no wonder that he had such a deep experience. Today our mistake is in thinking that spiritual knowledge is mere biblical knowledge. Little do we realize that genuine spiritual knowledge must be learned from God. If we want to learn before God, we must deal with God and be dealt with by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE INSEPARABILITY OF DEALING AND KNOWING</H2><P>The most precious thing on earth today is the knowledge of God. However, in order to know God, we need to be dealt with by Him in everything. We need to be dealt with by Him in prayer, and we need to be dealt with by Him in matters related to His will. We need to deal with sin and our environment. When something happens, we need to ask, "What does this mean?" and "What is God after?" A lazy person can never know God. We can only know God through prayer and through communicating with Him. We should be like Paul who, after asking the Lord once without getting an answer, asked the Lord two or three times until the Lord spoke to him. We should also learn of our Lord. He prayed in Gethsemane the first time, "My Father, if it is possible, let this cup pass from Me; yet not as I will, but as You will" (Matt 26:39). He prayed a second time and a third time until He was completely clear on this matter. We also need to pray once, twice, three times until we get the answer from God. Only in this way can we know God.</P><P>I would like to speak some words to the co-workers: if you have not learned to be dealt with by God and to deal with God, you can never go out to work because you are not yet even a proper Christian. If you do not know God's principles, God's way of doing things, and God's nature, you are no different from other people. If you can only give people some spiritual theories, you cannot lead them on in the spiritual way. A person who has read a tour book on Hangchow or Peking has not necessarily been to Hangchow or Peking. A person who owns a cookbook has not necessarily eaten all the dishes in the cookbook. In the same way, if you merely understand the Bible, but have no experience, you can never lead others to the right way.</P><P>If you simply have experience and do not know the Bible, you will not have the proper word for other people. The Lord said, "You err, not knowing the Scriptures nor the power of God." This was the Lord's rebuke. Many believers lack the knowledge or the realization of God's power. Many people only know some spiritual theories. In the end all they have are theories. Likewise, all you have are theories. They do not know what they are talking about. Neither do you know what you are talking about. Many people are able to teach others simply because they have a better memory and can remember more doctrines. O brothers and sisters, this is too poor. May we learn to know Him in prayer and in His will. We can know God. There is nothing more important than knowing God. May we not just retain what we have heard today in our mind, but, from now on, may we be diligent to learn to know God and accept His dealing.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 29</H2><P>This surely is a time of temptations; everything is confusing, cold, and harsh. In this hour it is indeed difficult for Christians to stand. But have we not known this for some time from the beginning already? What else can we say?</P><P>We walk in solitude and bewilderment; we must either put down our weapons or be raptured. O Lord, which do You think is best?</P><P>This is the first issue of this year. We cannot say that there is greater hope, greater courage, or greater interest than last year. On the contrary, there will probably be greater hardships; still we need to go on as usual.</P><P>We treasure those co-workers who pray for us.</P><P>Watchman Nee<br>March 23, 1933</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE TWO SIDES OF THE TRUTH-<br>SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(Notes from a Meeting Held in 1932)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 29</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 3:16; 14:16; 15:4-5; 14:17; 6:47; 4:14; 1 John 2:8; Phil. 1:20-21; 1 Cor. 1:30; Col. 1:27</H1><P>We often speak about the matter of subjective truth and objective truth. All the truths in the New Testament are divided into these two categories, and similarly all the Old Testament truths are divided into these two categories. To make this matter clear to many of you, I would first like to explain the meaning of the words objective and subjective. The literal meanings of the Chinese words for objective and subjective are "guest's view" and "host's view." Being objective is viewing things from the position of a guest or an outsider, and being subjective is viewing things from one's self as a host. Viewing things from the position of an outsider is being objective, and viewing things from within is being subjective. Whatever occurs in others is objective; whatever occurs in me is subjective. All the truths that are not in me are objective truths; all the truths that are inside of me are subjective truths. All the truths outside of me are objective truths; they are truths, even though they are outside of me. All the experiences within me are subjective and are also truths. The Bible places equal weight on both aspects of these truths. I would now like to give you some illustrations.</P><P>John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son." John 14:16 says, "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter." It is sad that many who can recite John 3:16 so well cannot recite John 14:16. Actually these two verses are of equal worth. God had two "givings." In John 3:16 He gave His Son to us, and in John 14:16 He gave the Holy Spirit to us. God gave His Son to sinners, and He gave the Holy Spirit to the ones who believe in His Son. God gave His Son to the world that they may be saved through Him. God gave the Holy Spirit to those who believe in His Son that they may be empowered to overcome. One is the giving of the Son, and the other is the giving of the Holy Spirit. Everything accomplished in the Son is an objective truth, and everything done in us through the working of the Holy Spirit is a subjective truth. Everything that is done in Christ is objective, while everything that is done in us through the Holy Spirit is subjective. When the Lord was crucified on the cross, we were crucified there with Him. This is an objective fact. If we search within ourselves to see whether we have died, we surely will not feel that we have died. Likewise, if we preach the gospel to a sinner, telling him that he is a sinner and Christ has died for him, will he realize he has died with Christ? No matter that is in Christ is subjective. Everything in Christ is objective, and all the work done by the Holy Spirit in us is subjective. The Holy Spirit does not work in Himself; all the work of the Holy Spirit is done within us. What Christ has accomplished is in Himself, and what the Holy Spirit has accomplished is in us. As long as something or some work is done in Christ, it is objective; as long as something is accomplished by the Holy Spirit, it is subjective. Please remember this point: objective matters are in Christ, and subjective matters are within us.</P><P>In John 15:4 the Lord repeated the phrase abide in Me twice. What is it to "abide in Me"? It is just to abide in the Lord. Abiding in the Lord is objective. We must first have the objective aspect before we can have the experience of "I [abide] in you," which is the subjective aspect. We must remember that the words "I [abide] in you" are preceded by the words "Abide in Me." Every subjective experience is based on an objective fact. No one could ever be saved if there was just the working of the Holy Spirit without the accomplishment of Christ. Neither could people be saved by only having the accomplishment of Christ without the working of the Holy Spirit. As I have said before, a man must have two feet to stand firm and two eyes to see clearly. Birds must have two wings to fly. Similarly, we must first be in the Lord, and then He will be in us.</P><P>John 6:47 says, "He who believes has eternal life." Every believer knows this verse. It is true that we have believed, and it is true that he who believes has eternal life. However, no one can locate the eternal life. What does John 4:14 tell us? It says, "But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life." The water that He will give us is the water of life, and it will well up from within again and again until we sense its flavor. On the one hand, the Lord talks about the eternal life, and on the other hand, He talks about a well of living water springing up which enables us to taste the flavor of eternal life. John 6:47 speaks of the objective aspect, and John 4:14 speaks of the subjective aspect. First John 2:8 says, "...which is true in Him and in you." Some of the truths are in Him, and some of the truths are in us. They are all truths, and we should pay attention to all of them. John 15 tells us how to bear fruit: "He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit" (v. 5). In other words, whenever the objective truth is balanced by the subjective truth, there will be much fruit-bearing. John 14:17 says, "The Spirit of reality...because He abides with you and shall be in you." He abides with you is objective. This phrase points out the fact that the Holy Spirit through Christ was with the disciples. The phrase shall be in you is subjective. It points to the fact of Christ dwelling in the disciples through the Holy Spirit. At one time this word was objective and outside of them, but once the Holy Spirit came and dwelt in them, the objective facts became their subjective experience.</P><P>On one hand, Paul in 1 Corinthians 1:30 said, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus." On the other hand, in Colossians 1:27 Paul said, "Christ in you, the hope of glory." To be in Christ is the objective aspect, and to have Christ in us is the subjective aspect.</P><P>If we want to discover these two aspects of the truth in the Bible, we can find several hundred verses which show the subjective aspect of the truth as well as the objective aspect of the truth. If we can grasp these two aspects, we are able to grasp the tracks in the Bible. A train has two tracks on which to run. If there is only one track, the train will derail. With two tracks, the train can move ahead. Both the objective and subjective aspects of the truth need our attention. Emphasizing each aspect equally will render us the greatest help. I do not want to preach any theology here. Rather, I would like to speak a little on the practical side. For the time being, I will briefly mention the major accomplishments of Christ on the objective side as well as the work of the Holy Spirit on the subjective side.</P><P>First of all, Christ's death on the cross for our sins and for us is the kernel of the objective truths in the Bible. When a person touches the Bible, he will see Christ's death, Christ's redemption, and how Christ was made a propitiatory sacrifice for our sins. Once you open the Bible, you will see these things, unless you do not read it at all. He hung on the tree to personally bear our sins. This matter was accomplished on the cross. He has borne your sins, my sins, and the sins of so many people. These are the facts.</P><P>If the Lord Jesus has borne your sins, my sins, and the sins of all the people in the world, then why are all the people not saved? Why is it that some of the ones who have believed in the Lord and who we know are saved do not have the joy of salvation? Why are they grieved over their sins? They are grieved because they always see the subjective side of how inwardly sinful, filthy, and unclean they still are. Consequently, they do not see how they can be saved. We need to know that all that Christ has accomplished is on the objective side and cannot be found on the subjective side. If a lamp is on this side, how can you find it on the other side? What the Lord accomplished at Golgotha was not accomplished in us. If we search within ourselves, we will never find it. Although I cannot find Christ's dying for us within, can it be found on the cross? If Christ's death for us can be found on the cross, then we can declare, "Hallelujah! Christ has borne my sins; I am saved." Whenever our faith latches on to the objective things, the Holy Spirit will infuse power into our inner being and will cause us to have the peace of forgiveness and the joy of salvation. If we try to find the death of Christ on the subjective side, we will never be able to find it because this is not God's way. God first gave His Son to man, and then He gave the Holy Spirit to man. The giving of the Holy Spirit follows the giving of God's Son. Christ came first, then the Holy Spirit. What the Holy Spirit is doing is to complete in us what the Lord has accomplished on His side.</P><P>The book of Hebrews tells us that faith is like an anchor, secure and firm, which brings us within the veil (Heb. 6:19). Suppose we are on a ship with a very large anchor. If it is always kept on the ship, what use is this anchor? The anchor should be cast into the water to keep the ship from rocking; it should not be kept on the ship. This is how faith should operate. Faith never comes from believing in ourselves; faith comes from casting our anchor in the Lord Jesus, casting from our side to His side. Whenever something on the objective side is grasped by us, the subjective side becomes secure in us. Suppose a ship with an anchor on board is rocking incessantly. Will fastening and putting more anchors on the ship cause it to steady? Even if the ship had larger anchors or was filled with anchors, it would still rock unsteadily. The ship will only become steady when the anchor is cast into the water. The more we look at ourselves, the more disappointed we will become. If we cast our faith upon the cross of the Lord Jesus, we will be at peace. We must be secure on the other side before we can be secure on our side; the order cannot be reversed. The correct way is to take the objective aspect as the starting point and then have the subjective aspect as the issue. If we only emphasize Christ's accomplishment on the cross without caring for what the Holy Spirit wants to do in us, we will never be able to have the experience. Similarly, if we only emphasize the Holy Spirit within us without caring for Christ's accomplishment on the cross, the result will be futile.</P><P>For example, in the matter of being crucified with Christ, is it we who crucify ourselves? No. Romans 6:6 tells us, "Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves." We do not do the crucifying; our old man was crucified with Christ when He was crucified on the cross. This is an objective truth. Our eyes must be on the Lord. It would be terrible if we were to crucify ourselves. Even though we see our wretchedness, we are not able to crucify it. The biggest mistake believers make is to say, "Even though the Bible says I have died with Christ, when I look at myself, I realize that I am still so hard-hearted. It is very easy for me to lose my temper; I am still so bad and not good." We are crucified with Him, but the more we try, the less we die. We are wrong because we are starting from our end. We should remember that Christ is the real beginning to everything. The real death is not seeing ourselves dead; when Christ died, we also died with Him. Only when the anchor is cast is it effectual. Faith is efficacious only when it is cast in Christ. If our eyes are always on ourselves, we cannot be crucified. Our pretense to be dead is a fake death, and we have no way to put ourselves to death. We have already died with Christ on the cross; this was accomplished by Christ. On the objective side Christ has died, and we have also died.</P><P>Romans 8:13 says, "For if you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live." This verse runs parallel to Romans 6:6, which speaks of being crucified with Christ; this verse speaks of putting to death the practices of the body by the Spirit. Crucifixion was accomplished by Christ, whereas the putting to death is done by the Spirit. I believe that I have been crucified with Christ. For this I can say, "Hallelujah!" When Christ died, my old man was crucified with Him. Today, on the subjective side, the Spirit will bring up a matter and tell you that this matter has been crucified on the cross. Will you follow the speaking of the Spirit? If you say you are willing, the matter will be dealt with. Then the next day the Spirit will bring up another matter and tell you that it has been crucified on the cross. Are you willing to go along with His speaking? If you agree, another matter will be dealt with. The Spirit will say, "Your temper has been crucified on the cross. You do not need to lose your temper." If you say, "I am willing not to lose my temper," then the Spirit will give you the power not to lose your temper. The Spirit will then say that your pride has been crucified and that you can be freed from your pride. If you agree with not being proud, the Spirit will give you the power not to be proud. If you are willing to go along with the Spirit in one matter after another, the Spirit will fulfill His work in you. If you only depend on yourself to suppress your anger, you will find that even gritting your teeth will not work. You must first see the accomplishment of Christ's death on the objective side before the Spirit will carry out that death in you.</P><P>In the first two centuries, believers greeted each other by saying, "The Lord is coming soon," or, "In Christ." Indeed, once we see that we are in Christ, everything is sweet and precious. At the same time, the Spirit within us will put to death the deeds of the body. Today Christians pay too much attention to either the objective truth or the subjective truth. When one pays too much attention to the subjective truth, he suppresses himself. This is like an anchor that is not cast into the water; it is useless. Then there are others who think that because Christ has died, they do not need to care for anything. This is also wrong. Christ has indeed died on the cross; but if you do not believe this, you will still perish. However, if you believe that Christ has died on the cross and are willing to believe in Him, you will be saved. Likewise, when the Spirit says to you that your temper, pride, and jealousy have been crucified, if you are willing and have the desire, the Spirit will give you the power to overcome. When you believe the objective truth, the Spirit will simultaneously make the objective truth your subjective experience. The Spirit will fulfill the outward truth you believe in you. The Spirit will fulfill what you believe has been accomplished on the cross in you.</P><P>This is not only the case with the truth of our death with Christ, but it also applies to the truth of resurrection. Ephesians 2:6 says, "And raised us up together...in Christ Jesus." How are we resurrected? We are resurrected with Him. This is of Christ and is an objective truth. Resurrection is not only spoken of in Ephesians; Peter also said, "God...has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead" (1 Pet. 1:3). In other words, the time when a Christian is regenerated is the time when he is resurrected together with Christ. Actually, every regenerated Christian has been resurrected with the Lord, and every Christian who has been resurrected with the Lord has been regenerated. We have been resurrected with Him, and He has raised us up.</P><P>What is the meaning of resurrection? The Lord Jesus died in His body; all the blood in His body was shed; He suffered numerous wounds on His head from the crown of thorns; He had wounds on His hands and feet and a gash on His side from a spear. This is the power of death that took hold of His body. When God's life came into His body, He became alive. This is the meaning of resurrection. This life overcame all the effects of death in His body; it healed all the wounds and did away with all the pain. This is resurrection. Formerly, the eyes could not see, the ears could not hear, and the hands could not move; now they are all able to function. To be dead, according to the Bible, is to be absolutely powerless and utterly weak. Death is spiritual inability and impossibility. Formerly, the Lord was bound by numerous burial cloths. But what happened at the time of resurrection? The resurrection of the Lord was vastly different from that of Lazarus. When Lazarus came out of the tomb, his hands and feet were bound with cloth, and his face was bound with a handkerchief. He needed someone else to set him free. On the contrary, regarding the Lord's resurrection, the Bible says, "He beheld the linen cloths lying there and the handkerchief which had been over His head, not lying with the linen cloths, but folded up in one place apart" (John 20:6-7). The Lord did not slowly cut His cloths loose. God's power and life entered in and loosened every lawful or unlawful bondage. What was a corpse became a moving and liberated being. This was the resurrection of the Lord.</P><P>I remember, when I first began to work for the Lord, I would ask the Lord to resurrect me together with Him. I thought that if the Lord would resurrect me together with Him, then I would have the power to do God's will. I was wrong in praying that way because it was something initiated by me. The Bible says I have been resurrected together with Christ. This is an accomplished fact. Please remember that the more we turn to ourselves, the worse we will be. It is not that we should not have subjective experiences, but we should first believe the objective truth. I can now say, "Lord, I thank You; You have resurrected, and I have been resurrected together with You." We must first believe the fact that we have been resurrected. How were we resurrected? Do we feel like we have resurrected? No, it is Christ who resurrected us. We can ask how we were saved. While we were yet sinners, we heard the gospel that the Lord Jesus died for us and cleansed us from our sins with His blood. We believed and were immediately saved. We did not look at ourselves to see whether we were qualified, but we looked away to what the Lord accomplished on the cross. Once we lay hold of this fact, we will be at peace.</P><P>However, if we only pay attention to the objective truth and not to the subjective truth, we are like one-winged birds trying to fly. We should not emphasize one half and neglect the other. Ephesians 2:6 tells us that we have been raised up together with Christ Jesus. On the other hand, Ephesians 1:19-20 says, "And what is the surpassing greatness of His power toward us who believe, according to the operation of the might of His strength, which He caused to operate in Christ." Although the believers in Ephesus were resurrected with Christ, the apostle Paul still wanted them to know the exceeding greatness of His power. Verse 19 tells us the greatness of this power; verse 20 tells us that this power is the resurrection power. In other words, although we have been resurrected, we still need to know the greatness of this power. On the objective side we have resurrection; on the subjective side we still need to know the power of resurrection. One cannot say, "My temper has been crucified, but I still can lose my temper." On the objective side his temper has been crucified, but on the subjective side he should still put his temper to death by the Spirit. On the subjective side he still needs to be empowered by the Spirit to deny the world and obey God's will. With the reality of the objective aspect, one still needs to have the subjective experiences. One very bad phenomenon is that some people do not believe the objective facts but only focus their efforts on subjective experiences. Other people only believe the objective facts and ignore the subjective experiences. According to the Bible, if one lacks faith, he will never experience spiritual deliverance, and if he lacks obedience, he will also not experience spiritual deliverance. Faith is toward what Christ has accomplished, while obedience is specifically toward what the Spirit will accomplish. Faith is toward Christ, and obedience is toward the Spirit. Therefore, it is very crucial to believe and obey.</P><P>Philippians 3:10 says, "To know Him and the power of His resurrection." Paul said that the goal of his counting all things loss was to know the power of resurrection. He did not say he wanted to know resurrection, because once a person has believed, he has resurrection. But on the subjective side he still needed to count all things loss in order to know the power of His resurrection.</P><P>Ascension is the last great accomplished truth in the New Testament. The Lord's incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection and ascension are some of the greatest truths in the Bible. Concerning the Lord's ascension, you do not know how much time I spent shortly after I was saved thinking how good it would be if only I could daily sit in the heavenlies and have my sin under my feet. I was like an airplane in the sky that could not stay in the sky forever. I continually besought the Lord that one day I would be able to sit steadily in the heavenlies and break my record of ascension. Then one day I read Ephesians 2:6: "And raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus." I realized then that when Christians were raised up together with Christ, they were also seated together with Him in the heavenlies. This is not due to their diligence or prayers. It is because Christ brought us into the heavenlies when He ascended. Because He is in the heavenlies, I am also in the heavenlies. However, I should allow the power of the Lord's ascension to be manifested in me.</P><P>On the other hand, Colossians 3:1-3 says, "If therefore you were raised together with Christ, seek the things which are above, where Christ is, sitting at the right hand of God. Set your mind on the things which are above, not on the things which are on the earth. For you died, and your life is hidden with Christ in God." This is subjective. Ascension means that our life has been hidden with Christ in God. Because we have died, resurrected, and ascended, we ought to seek the things which are above and daily set our mind on the things which are above. Suppose a sinner hears that the Lord Jesus has died for him and thinks that since the Lord has died for him, he can go on sinning. We all know that this is not right. We have the position of ascension. However, if we continually set our mind on the things that are on the earth, even our ascended position will do us no good. If we believe in Christ's ascension and, at the same time, continually set our minds on the things above rather than the things on earth, we will not only be in the heavenlies objectively, but we will also be in the heavenlies subjectively.</P><P>Brothers, only having objective facts without having subjective experience is too theoretical; one will not have any taste of heaven from this. It is absolutely necessary to believe all that Christ has done on the objective side. It is also absolutely necessary to obey what the Spirit wants to do on the subjective side. All spiritual experiences come first from believing what Christ has accomplished and then by obeying the Spirit's leading. Christ's accomplishments cause us to gain the position; the Spirit's leading causes us to gain the experiences. The accomplishments of Christ are facts for us to believe. The leading of the Spirit is the principle for us to obey. All spiritual experiences begin from the objective side; there is no exception. Our anchor must be cast in Christ's death, resurrection, and ascension.</P><P>John 15:4-5 says, "Abide in Me and I in you. As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me. I am the vine; you are the branches. He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit; for apart from Me you can do nothing." The order in this passage is most important. Being "in Me" is first. The "Me" in this verse is the Lord. One must first be in Christ. This is the objective side. Then "I in you" follows. "I in you" is Christ abiding in us. This is the subjective side. We must first have the objective aspect, then the subjective aspect will be added. What follows thereafter is a promise that we will bear much fruit. Being in the Lord is the objective side. Once we have the objective side, then we will have the subjective side of the Lord abiding in us. When we believe in the objective fact, everything on the objective side will come into us. The issue of the objective plus the subjective is fruit-bearing. There will not be any fruit-bearing if we only have the objective side; similarly, we will not bear any fruit if we just have the subjective side. Whenever the objective and subjective sides are joined together, there will be fruit-bearing.</P><P>When the church began in Jerusalem, there were both men and women praying in the upper room. In typology, men represent the objective truth, while women represent the subjective truth. The presence of men typifies the presence of objective truth or doctrine, while the presence of women typifies the presence of subjective truth or experience. The result of this was three thousand and then five thousand souls being saved. This was the way the church began. In the future, at the time of Christ's second coming, there will be the Lamb of God on the objective side. There will also be the bride of the Lamb, "clothed in fine linen, bright and clean; for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints" (Rev. 19:8). This is the subjective aspect.</P><P>Whether or not the Lord is pleased with a Christian's living depends on how balanced he is regarding these two aspects. In the church today, some preach only the subjective truth. An example of this is the so-called holiness group; they only have the female aspect. However, others only teach the objective truth. An example of this is the Brethren; they only have the male aspect. Both of these extremes suffer loss. By paying attention only to the subjective side, one not only fails to gain any experience, but he also suffers daily. On the other hand, those who pay attention solely to the objective side and live a carefree daily life, thinking that they have died, resurrected, and ascended with Christ and, therefore, need not care for anything else, will not have any experience either. God's way is not to pay attention only to the objective side or only to the subjective side. The principle in the Bible is for us to first have the objective aspect and then the subjective aspect. We should first have the facts of Christ and then follow the leading of the Holy Spirit. The result will be much fruit-bearing. May God teach us to obey Him more and serve Him more according to His way.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE RENEWING OF THE MIND</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 29</H2><P>In the Bible there are two ways of translating the word mind: in some places it is translated "mind," and in other places it is translated "understanding." But in Greek it is the word nous. This word nous is used twenty-four times in the New Testament. Their references will be listed below. After this we will see how nous is related to the believers. The believers must have a renewed nous. Only then can they progress before God; only then can they progress in their spiritual walk.</P><P>Man is composed of three parts: spirit, soul, and body. The Bible shows us that man not only has a spirit, but a body also; he not only has a spirit and a body, but a soul as well. Why must man have a soul even though he has a spirit and a body? The soul lies between the spirit and the body and serves as a medium between the spirit and the body. The soul is the part which interposes. Everything that God wants to make known to us, He makes known through the intuition of the spirit. The spirit gives us God-consciousness; it enables us to have communication with God and sense God. The body is given to us by God to communicate with the world; through the body we can feel everything in the world. God has also given us a soul, which gives us self-consciousness and by which we can sense ourselves. Human beings are not like angels who have only a spirit without a body. Human beings have a spirit and a body. Our soul, the buffer zone, is between the spirit and the body. Everything of our spirit and body is expressed through our soul.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HEART OF MAN</H2><P>Incidentally, I want to mention what the heart of man is so that we may understand what the mind of man is. What we usually call the heart, according to the Bible, is the conscience in man's spirit plus the mind in his soul. This is the heart. The spirit is the organ for communicating with God, for being intimate with God, for understanding the will of God, and for knowing God. The heart is the administrator of the spirit; it expresses everything that is in the spirit. Everything the spirit has is expressed by our heart. The heart is composed of man's conscience plus his mind. The whole Bible speaks about the heart in this way. Therefore, the heart is the point of mutual interaction for the spirit and the soul, the contiguous place and the place of intersection. It is like the central exchange of the telephone company where all the lines intersect and all the calls pass through. Anything that wants to enter the spirit must pass through the heart before it can enter. Anything that is expressed from the spirit must also come out through the heart, because the heart is the place of mutual interaction, the point of contact, and the place of mutual reception. The spirit reaches the soul through the heart. The soul, including what it feels from the outside, reaches the heart, and from the heart passes through to the spirit. This is where our personality lies; it is our true self and the real "I." The heart is the connecting point of the spirit and the soul. Therefore, the heart is the "I." We have to read the Bible to find out what it says about the heart. After this we will see how the heart is related to us and how important a position it occupies. Let us read several verses in the Bible concerning the heart.</P><P>Psalm 4:4 says, "Consider in your heart upon your bed,/ And be silent." In other words, your heart is your self; therefore, you commune with it. It is like the Chinese saying: "The heart discusses with the mouth."</P><P>Proverbs 4:23 says, "Keep thy heart with all diligence; for out of it are the issues of life." "Keep thy heart" should be "guard your heart." The word "issue" should be translated "outlet." You should guard your heart because it is the outlet of life. All fruit that man bears outwardly originates from the heart. This is why I have said that the heart is the person himself.</P><P>Matthew 12:34-35 says, "Offspring of vipers, how can you, being evil, speak good things? For out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks. The good man, out of his good treasure, brings forth good things, and the evil man, out of his evil treasure, brings forth evil things." The Lord Jesus said that out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks, because the heart is the man himself. Therefore, a good man out of the good treasure of the heart brings forth good things, and an evil man out of the evil treasure of his heart brings forth evil things. Therefore, the sins and evil deeds that a sinner commits all come out of the heart. The heart is the mingling of the spirit and soul. Therefore, all evil things come out of the heart.</P><P>Matthew 15:18-19 says, "But the things which proceed out of the mouth come out of the heart, and those defile the man. For out of the heart come evil reasonings, murders, adulteries, fornications, thefts, false witnessings, blasphemies." What comes out of the heart is unclean because what is inside of man is unclean.</P><P>It is very interesting that, even though man is composed of three parts (spirit, soul, and body), when the Bible speaks of our regeneration, it does not say that God gave us a new soul, but it says that God gave us a new spirit and new heart. God gave us a new spirit, which enables us to communicate with Him and which causes our deadened spirit to recover its function. God also gave us a new heart, which enables us to have a new living on earth and new inclinations.</P><P>Although there is something in common between the spirit and the heart, the Bible maintains a boundary between the two so that there is no confusion. Ezekiel 36:26 says, "A new heart also will I give you, and a new spirit will I put within you: and I will take away the stony heart out of your flesh, and I will give you a heart of flesh." God does not say, "I will give you a new spirit and a new soul." In God's view the organ of the soul does not need to be changed. The personality of man does not need to be changed either. However, the heart of man does need to be changed because out of the heart are the issues of life. This is why the heart should be fixed.</P><P>What happens to a believer's spirit and heart when he sins? Psalm 51:10 says, "Create in me a clean heart, O God; / and renew a right spirit within me." This verse speaks of the heart and the spirit. The heart and the spirit are what God is concerned with. If the heart of a believer is defiled, he should ask God to create in him a clean heart and a right spirit. Therefore, our hearts must be clean and our spirits must be right.</P><P>The Bible places this emphasis on the heart in order to cause us to see the important position that the heart occupies in the Bible. The heart is very important because the heart is our real self. The condition of our heart is our real condition. The heart is the source of man's life. The heart includes the conscience in his spirit and the mind in his soul. We communicate with God through the spirit, but God sees our heart. In our living, the heart is the most important element. We say that we are saved, but exactly how are we saved? It is by believing in our heart. How do we serve God? We serve God from the heart. What kind of people does God bless? God blesses those who are upright in their heart. In the future, what part of man will God judge? God will judge the hidden things in man's heart. Therefore, in order to come before God, we must have a good heart. But in order to have a good heart, we must have a good mind. Therefore, today I want to talk especially about the nous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VARIOUS TRANSLATIONS OF NOUS</H2><P>The word mind is nous in the original language. It is used twenty-four times in the entire New Testament. We will list them one by one. We hope that the readers will remember the similarities between these verses.</P><P>Luke 24:45 says, "Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures."</P><P>Romans 1:28 says, "And even as they did not approve of holding God in their full knowledge, God gave them up to a disapproved mind, to do the things which are not fitting." A disapproved or reprobate mind is a reprobate nous.</P><P>Romans 7:23 says, "But I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind." The word "mind" in "the law of my mind" is nous.</P><P>Romans 11:34 says, "For who has known the mind of the Lord?" The mind of the Lord is the nous of the Lord.</P><P>Romans 14:5 says, "Let each be fully persuaded in his own mind." The "mind" in "his own mind" is nous.</P><P>First Corinthians 1:10 says, "That you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion." The same mind is the same nous.</P><P>First Corinthians 2:16 says, "For who has known the mind of the Lord and will instruct Him? But we have the mind of Christ." Here the mind of the Lord is the nous of the Lord, and the mind of Christ is the nous of Christ.</P><P>Ephesians 4:17 says, "This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their mind." The vanity of their mind is the vanity of their nous.</P><P>Colossians 2:18 says, "Let no one defraud you by judging you unworthy of your prize, in self-chosen lowliness and the worship of the angels, dwelling on the things which he has seen, vainly puffed up by his mind set on the flesh." The fleshly mind is the fleshly nous.</P><P>Second Thessalonians 2:2 says, "That you be not quickly shaken in mind."</P><P>Revelation 17:9 says, "Here is the mind which has wisdom." The mind which has wisdom is the nous which has wisdom.</P><P>Romans 7:25 says, "So then with the mind I myself serve the law of God."</P><P>Romans 12:2 says, "But be transformed by the renewing of the mind."</P><P>First Corinthians 14:14 says, "But my mind is unfruitful."</P><P>First Corinthians 14:15 says, "What then? I will pray with the spirit, and I will pray also with the mind; I will sing with the spirit, and I will sing also with the mind."</P><P>First Corinthians 14:19 says, "But in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind, that I might instruct others also."</P><P>Ephesians 4:23 says, "And that you be renewed in the spirit of your mind."</P><P>Philippians 4:7 says, "The peace of God...will guard your hearts and your thoughts." The word "thoughts" is nous.</P><P>First Timothy 6:5 says, "Perpetual wranglings of men corrupted in mind."</P><P>Second Timothy 3:8 says, "Men corrupted in mind."</P><P>Titus 1:15 says, "Their mind and their conscience are defiled."</P><P>Revelation 13:18 says, "Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast." The word "understanding" is nous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NOUS<br>AND A CHRISTIAN</H2><P>How is the nous related to a Christian's living, work, service to God, walk, etc.? Those who believe in the Lord Jesus have a new spirit and a new heart. This is a fact and cannot be overthrown. No matter how weak or strong a believer is, he is born of God, and he has a new spirit and new heart. That is why he can love someone, serve God, and do everything from his heart. But even though the heart may be a new heart, the part in the heart which belongs to the nous is not renewed. According to human reasoning, one would think that since the heart has been made new, the conscience and the mind, which are included in the heart, must also have been renewed. This is not so. For instance, the part of the conscience in the heart was new when we were saved, but it is not necessarily always new afterwards, nor is it necessarily new every day. When a dress is bought, it is new, but it is not going to stay new forever. One must put in a certain amount of work for it to stay new. When you were saved, your mind was new. But it is not necessarily true that it will remain new after a while. This is an experience common to many believers. Let me tell you that once a man believes in the Lord and is saved, his conscience is new. The function of his conscience is recovered to its original state, so that he now hates sins and dislikes sinning. But can the conscience always remain so new? No, it cannot. If one sins, or if he tolerates sins over and over again and does not listen to his conscience, after repeated sins the conscience will no longer rebuke; it will lose its function. Just as the conscience can lose its feeling or be renewed, the same is true of the mind. Therefore, I want to speak concerning the matter of the nous because this has a crucial relationship to the believer's position and living.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WHAT IS THE NOUS?</H2><P>What exactly is the nous as spoken of in the New Testament? We can see it from three aspects. Human beings have a brain. This speaks of the physiological aspect. We also have a nous, which speaks of the psychological aspect. Moreover, we have an intuition, which speaks of the spiritual aspect. Everything that is related to the physical aspect has to do with the brain. Everything that is related to the intellectual aspect has to do with the nous. However, I dare not say that the nous is the mind, even though a big portion of the mind is the nous. Our spirit receives its feeling from God through the intuition. At this time our soul, through the nous, translates the intuition so that we understand what is conveyed to us. Although we know the will of God through the intuition, this intuition is without reason and order. Therefore, we need the nous in order to express what the intuition knows.</P><P>Let me say this more accurately. Man has three faculties with which he gains knowledge: (1) with the body, it is the brain; (2) with the spirit, it is the intuition; (3) with the soul, it is the nous. However, the nous is also controlled by the intuition. We all know that when a brain is being surgically dissected, no more than some gray and white matter can be seen. This is the brain. How about the intuition? Sometimes we feel we have it; sometimes we feel we do not have it. It seems that sometimes something urges us and sometimes it stops us. This is the intuition within us. Our nous falls between our brain and our intuition. The nous expresses what the intuition wants to say and facilitates the brain in thinking and expressing. No matter how strong the intuition of a believer is and how good his brain is, if something is wrong with his nous, he will live without any principle from morning until night. Even in his preaching, he will not be able to express what is within him. From morning until night he will live foolishly. This condition is due to his nous not being renewed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NOUS OF THE SINNERS</H2><P>Now I want to talk about the nous of the sinners. Romans 1:28 says that they have a disapproved, or reprobate, nous. Ephesians 4:17 says that they have a vain nous. Colossians 2:18 says that they have a fleshly nous. Second Timothy 3:8 says that they have a corrupt nous. Titus 1:15 says that they have a defiled nous. This is the condition of the sinners' nous. Since you were saved, you have come away from that condition. Try to recall how you were toward God before you were saved. What is the condition of the sinner's nous before God? Suppose that there is a most foolish sinner, who is totally ignorant of everything. Once you start talking to him about God, he will have many arguments. He will argue that you are wrong on this or that point. He will stubbornly say that there is no God. This foolish one will, amazingly, have so many arguments about there being no God. This is because his heart is darkened. His nous is also darkened and dead. Furthermore, his spirit is altogether in darkness. He has no way to know God. He has no understanding regarding the truth of God. But he can still put forward many argumentative reasons because his nous is reprobate, corrupt, defiled, and vain. This is the condition of a very foolish person in the world. On the other hand, if you speak about God to some who are wise and philosophical, they may understand and know everything, but still not believe in God. They may also find many reasons to argue. Both the wise and the foolish ones will equally oppose God. Although these two kinds of people have differences in intelligence and are as far apart as the sky and the sea in many things, they are one in mind and purpose in the matter of not believing in God. There is no reason for this, other than the fact that their nous is darkened and their spirit is dead. Since their nous is darkened, they cannot see the light of God. Their thoughts are not on the right track and are wild. Therefore, concerning the unsaved, God says that the eyes of their heart have been blinded by the god of this age. Their heart is darkened, and the light of the gospel cannot shine on them. Although they know philosophy and many other things, they do not know anything about God. They may know some biblical teachings according to the letter, but they are not able to enter into the depth of the teaching clearly and thoroughly and are not able to understand or know God in a definite way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NOUS AND SALVATION</H2><P>What is it to be saved? It is to know God. "And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ" (John 17:3). Eternal life is the ability to know God. What is it to be saved? It is not the ability to speak of certain doctrines, but the ability to know God. If we invite the most educated person in the entire world to talk to a young believer, that is, to one who is just saved, the educated person may present hundreds of reasons to argue against the existence of God. The young believer cannot win the argument, but he can say, "I know I have eternal life. I know I am saved." This is the difference between the two. An unsaved person's nous is blocked and has no light. Once he is saved, his nous will have light and will be able to know God. When many people hear the gospel preached with power the first time, their eyes are opened; they realize that they are sinners and that Jesus Christ is their Savior. Although they still cannot fully understand with their reasoning, they have a certain knowledge and are able to say, "I know I have received a great light. I know that I am a sinner and that Jesus Christ is my Savior. I know I am saved." This knowing is the work of the nous.</P><P>Whatever God wants to give us in the intuition is transmitted to the brain through the nous. Once God moves in the intuition of a spiritual person who lives before God, immediately there is a registration in his nous, and his brain immediately understands. After we are saved, we have the knowledge of God. These three parts-the intuition, the nous, and the brain-are connected and work simultaneously. We speak of them separately only for the sake of analysis.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE RENEWING OF THE NOUS</H2><P>When we were saved, our nous was enlightened. We think it is sufficient if we have a new heart, but the Bible speaks not only of this; it also says that our nous needs to be renewed. This is very clear in the English translation of the Bible. (In some places the English translation is much clearer than the Chinese translation; while in other places, the Chinese translation is much better than the English translation.) Our nous was new at the time we were saved. But is it renewed? The part that is toward God has been enlightened. But how about the other parts? I am afraid that after many are saved, their nous is not renewed; it remains just as it was before they were saved. I wish to speak very frankly: the thoughts of many believers today are still like those of a sinner. I often sense that the spirit and the heart of many believers are new but that their nous is not. Their nous is just the same as the nous of the sinners. If the nous of the believers has not been renewed, they should not expect to be useful in the hands of God. Therefore, our nous not only needs to be new; it should also be renewed. Our problem today is this: at the time we were saved, we had a great revelation. But since being saved, our nous has not been renewed. Being saved was the biggest revelation of our lives. But have we continued to receive any big revelations other than that one time? I am afraid that many do not have any other big revelations. Surely the revelation of salvation is the greatest revelation of a lifetime. It is a revelation that we will bring into eternity. But do we continuously receive new revelations? When we first believed in the Lord, why were we enlightened to confess our sins? Why were we not afraid of persecution? Why did we allow our parents and others in the world to oppose us, and why were we willing to forsake the world? It was the nous that enabled us to understand salvation, confess our sins, forsake the world, and allow our parents to persecute us. If this light of the nous shone daily in our life, we would not be in the same condition that we are today. We would truly have a living under the shining.</P><P>Once there was a girl who loved the world very much and would not forsake it for anything. One day she heard a man preaching in a church. The preaching was not particularly attractive, but the verse he read, "This is the victory which has overcome the world-our faith" (1 John 5:4), was attractive. This word captured the girl. She heard him repeat it seven or eight times: "This is the victory which has overcome the world-our faith." She had not known what the world was for her entire life. But that day she realized what the world was. On that day she put the world away. This realization is the knowledge of the nous. Many are not able to put everything away because their nous has not been enlightened to see through it all. Other matters such as listening to a message or working for the Lord are likewise unprofitable if the nous does not cooperate. Every time we listen to a message, we need the cooperation of our nous. Before we were saved, we would not believe, no matter how people tried to persuade us with various reasons. But one day we believed because our nous realized something, and that realization could not be overturned. "And this is eternal life, that they may know You, the only true God, and Him whom You have sent, Jesus Christ" (John 17:3). What are the functions of the nous? The functions of the nous include the ability to think, judge, and observe.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONDITION OF THE UNRENEWED NOUS</H2><P>What is the condition of an unrenewed nous? We will discuss the condition in three aspects: (1) toward man, (2) toward God, and (3) toward ourselves. Whether or not our nous has been renewed can be determined by these three aspects: toward man, God, and ourselves. It is determined by how we control our thoughts. (Please take note that nous is the transliteration of the original word. This word is very hard to explain. If translated "mind," it still cannot fully express the original meaning. The nous is composed of the power of apprehension and the thoughts. The original meaning of this word cannot be expressed if it is translated simply as "apprehension" or "thoughts." Therefore, I have no alternative but to use the word nous constantly.)</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. The Unrenewed Nous to Man</H2><P>If a man's nous is not renewed, this nous will have some particular experiences in its dealing with men. If a man's nous is not renewed, naturally he will have some very inaccurate thoughts toward other men. One interesting thing is that he will never trust in anyone; he will always have doubts about others. Only criticisms come out of him; his thoughts are engaged in "splitting hairs" to find fault, and he always speaks poorly of others. We can find out how our nous is by asking ourselves what kind of thoughts we have toward others. The Bible says that the Lord Jesus never judged anyone according to what He saw and heard; He judged everything according to the sense in His spirit. However, we judge others only according to what we see and hear. It would be wonderful if we could, as Paul said, prove all things. The nous of a criticizing believer is wrong. There is a very precious verse in the Epistle to Philemon; Paul said that Philemon had faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ and toward all the saints. If a believer depreciates everyone else, something must be wrong with his nous. Therefore, every time we see others or listen to others speak, we should ask ourselves if we are depreciating them.</P><P>I know a brother who always undervalues the things others give to him. For example, if someone gives him something worth two dollars, he will say it is worth only thirty cents. If someone gives him a gift worth thirty dollars, he will say that the gift is worth only about ten dollars. He is not the only one like this; many believers have the same kind of mentality. What is the reason for this? It is because their nous is worldly and old. Worldly people always think that others are not good, that others are wrong, and that there are always hidden words behind the words of others, just as there are fillings within pie. This is not the way we should think. The reason we have these kinds of thoughts is that our nous is not renewed and also Satan is working behind us. An unrenewed nous is the base for Satan's working. Everything from Adam can become the base for Satan's working.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. The Unrenewed Nous to God</H2><P>Our Christian lives are not necessarily the same toward God. In a believer whose nous has not been renewed we can see the following characteristics toward God: he cannot trust God, he cannot know God in the same way that he knows the Lord Jesus as his Savior, and he has many doubts. He doubt God's power, God's wisdom, and God's lovingkindness. These three points constitute his attitude toward God: he doubts God's power, thinking that He is not capable; he doubts God's wisdom, thinking that He is wrong; and he doubts God's lovingkindness, thinking that He is unwilling.</P><P>In addition, he cannot understand the Scriptures; he cannot understand God's teaching; his nous is not clear, and he cannot receive God's light in his nous. It is true that he did have an enlightening at his conversion. If his nous were open to God every day, it would not be as powerless or critical as it is today. If every one of us has an open nous, we will receive much enlightening. If we can only be a courier, simply passing on to others what we have received without receiving anything directly from God, our nous must be wrong. If we merely depend on others to pass things to us and then simply pass to others what little we have received, without receiving anything directly from God, we are not very useful. I am not saying that we do not need to receive help from others. Rather, I am saying that if we do not receive something directly from God, something is wrong with our nous. I myself like very much to receive help from others. As long as the one who speaks receives his words in his nous through God's enlightening, his message will surely enlighten the nous of others and help them. That is why I say every one of us needs to receive something from God in our nous.</P><P>A person with an unrenewed nous surely cannot know God's will. He may reason with logic, but he cannot know the will of God in his nous. He should know God's will in the same way that he knew that Christ is the Son of God and that he was saved at the time of his conversion. To know God's will should be a matter of inward knowledge. Concerning the knowledge of God's will, there are many times when we only know that a matter is God's will, but we have no reason that can explain it. This is like putting a newly saved country person with an unbelieving but knowledgeable person and asking them to debate. The latter may argue with the former for two or three hours, and the country person may not be able to retort with any reason, but he can say that he knows he is saved. It is the same way in regard to knowing the will of God.</P><P>Today many people do not know God's will. The reason they do not know it is that they do not have the organ to know God's will. Today is the Lord's Day; it can be considered the busiest day for the radio stations in the whole world. All the big denominations in the Western countries have radio programs to broadcast their messages. These radio waves bring the sound from very far away. Why can we not hear anything? The only reason is that we do not have a radio. In the same way, the will of God should be very obvious. But because there is not an organ to know God's will, we become ignorant of His will. It should be as easy for us to know God's will as it is for us to tell the wheat from the tares. Why do we not know God's will? It is because we do not have the receiving organ. It is because we do not have a renewed nous. At the time we were saved, our nous was new; we received the revelation of God. But not very long after that, it became no longer new.</P><P>How about our thoughts today? Our thoughts have become corrupt. After we are saved we think that Christians should have a good heart. We think that if we harbor hatred toward others in our heart, if we sin, if we commit fornication, we will offend God. Therefore we think that we should keep our motives from being improper. However, we forget that our thoughts should also be proper. Are our minds, our language, and our thoughts the same as they were before we were saved? For the time being, I will not touch on our motives and the purpose in our heart. I would just like to ask about the condition of our mind after we were saved. It is very amazing that before a man is saved, his mind is very unorganized, and even after he is saved, his mind remains the same. His language is the same as when he was first saved. His thoughts are the same as when he was first saved. If we cannot overcome our thoughts, we fail in everything.</P><P>In a letter to Miss Dora Yu, Miss Barber once wrote these few words: "If Satan can take hold of our thought life, he has taken hold of all our life." This is a fact. Do not think these few words were loosely spoken. She had over fifty years of very deep experience with God before she spoke these words. O brothers, do not think that as long as our motives are good, everything is all right. Even though the people we think about and the things we perceive may have changed, if our thoughts and perceptions toward others are the same as before we were saved, we will still make decisions the same way as before. If we cannot overcome our thoughts, we are in the hands of Satan, and we have no way to overcome the enemy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. The Unrenewed Nous to Ourselves</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>A. Being Unable to Manage One's Own Thoughts</H2><P>A person with an unrenewed nous is absolutely unable to manage his own thoughts. The mental energy of many Christians is wasted. If our hands can only work for eight hours a day, and what we do during these eight hours is improper, it becomes a waste of energy and a hindrance to proper work. Likewise, we can only use our mind for so many hours a day. If we waste our thoughts on meaningless and improper things, we cannot think about something proper. A brother once asked me, "Why can I not concentrate? After I pray for five minutes, my mind starts wandering." I asked him, "Does your mind wander all day long or just at the time of your prayer?" I could answer for him that his thoughts were never concentrated during the day; they were always touring the world. His thoughts were entirely in disarray. If our mind is in disarray twelve hours a day, how can we concentrate while we pray? If we cannot concentrate all day, why is it strange that we cannot do the same when we read the Bible or when we pray? Therefore, if our nous is not renewed, we cannot manage our mind. Friends, I must emphasize again that if we cannot manage our own thoughts, we are not very useful in the hands of God.</P><P>It is said that if all the heat generated from the sun in one day was collected together and put into all the factories on the earth, it would be enough for all the factories to use for ten million years. But people cannot use solar energy because it cannot be collected in one place. If we use a magnifying glass to collect the light from the sun, the heat can burn a finger underneath the glass. It is very regrettable that many believers waste their thoughts in vanity. They think day and night without producing one good thing. They waste their entire day in their disorderly thoughts. It is no wonder that God cannot use them. They can only be proper believers when their nous is renewed.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>B. Considering One's Past</H2><P>The biggest fault of a believer is thinking about his past. Believers think that introspection is good. Actually, introspection cannot enable us to know ourselves. There is not one believer who acquires self-knowledge by looking into himself. The knowledge of one's self comes from God's light; only after he receives God's light will he know himself. (I have spoken in detail concerning the matter of self-knowledge. Please see "Self-knowledge and God's Light" in The Present Testimony.) Self-criticism, self-analyzing, or any thought concerning the self, whether good or bad, causes one's mind to become restless. We should not secretly compare ourselves to others, no matter who it is. Every time a believer looks at himself he will have no progress. Consider a person walking along the road: if he looks at himself, he will stop going forward. He cannot look at himself and walk forward at the same time. Therefore, whoever looks at himself is either going backward or standing still. The same is true in the spiritual realm. If you always consider yourself, eventually you will be very discouraged. If no one leads you on, you will put yourself in a dangerous position, and you may even think that you are not saved, that you have committed an unforgivable sin, or that God has forsaken you. All these are the results of your introspection. This is the condition of an unrenewed nous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>C. Unable to Minister Well<br>the Word of God to Others</H2><P>If our nous has not been renewed, we cannot minister to others what God has given us. Some believers are very capable in conversation. No matter how many matters are being discussed, they can relate them one by one in proper utterance. They truly have eloquence. But when you ask them to talk about spiritual things or about the truth, they cannot explain even one thing to others clearly. The reason is that their mind is not qualified to be used by God. Their mind is like a child's arm which cannot bear anything that weighs more than ten pounds. Their nous is too weak. Though they have many thoughts, they are all without order. They cannot understand what comes from God. They understand what they receive in their intuition, but they cannot compose what they understand into a proper teaching in order to share with others. This is because their nous has not been renewed. If God wants us to speak forth His Word, He will certainly give us the utterance. But even though this is necessary, if a person does not have a renewed nous, he cannot express what he has received within him. Suppose a believer has his nous enlightened but not completely renewed. As such, he cannot put together God's Word and minister it to others. We cannot regard such a one as our pattern, and we cannot presume that being enlightened once is enough. We should have a clearer understanding day after day and should be able to use words to express what we know inwardly, so that others may understand.</P><P>A believer needs to have a renewed nous to guide him through his days on earth. Otherwise, he will suffer loss and damage in his life. He will think wrongly of others. He will not be able to understand God's will. He will also think wrongly of himself. He will not be able to properly live his life. This is why everyone needs to seek after the renewing of the nous in a specific way. With the people in the world, there are only two categories: the saved and the perishing, the regenerated and the unregenerated, those in Christ and those in Adam. These differences are absolute; the two are completely dissimilar. In like manner, with the nous of the believers, there is also the renewed nous and the unrenewed nous. There is an absolute boundary between the two. If we are saved, our nous must also be renewed. Furthermore, the renewing of the nous should not occur just once, but daily. If we are like this, we will be very clear concerning God's will.</P><P>Once Mr. Moody was walking on the street. Suddenly, he went into the house of one of his neighbors and asked to be allowed to go upstairs to do something. The owner of the house agreed, and he went upstairs and prayed to God, "O God, Your hand should stop. It's too much; I cannot bear it." If you daily have a renewed nous, you will see that you cannot bear what God shows you of yourself through your nous. I say again, you should do this singleheartedly, just as you did when you were regenerated. If your regeneration has caused a change in your living, your nous should also be enlightened in a specific way and be renewed daily.</P><P>You should not think that your mind is too dull. Do not think that only those who are naturally intelligent will grow and quickly understand the truth of God. There is no such thing. If man's growth in the truth were governed by his natural intelligence, it would be entirely a matter of the flesh. Your personal growth has nothing to do with your intelligence. If your nous is renewed, you can understand God, and you can know everything of God. The person beside you may be the most intelligent and wise person, but he cannot understand; only you can understand. Therefore, you should specifically ask God to give you a renewed nous. Otherwise, you will have no way to go on. Once again I stress that you must go to God in a specific way to seek after this.</P><P>Before you believed in the Lord, you did not love men. After you believed in the Lord, you began to love men more. If there was no such change in you, I am afraid that you are still not saved. If you are saved, you will surely see a change of heart and an improvement in the matters of loving, forbearing, and serving. Before, you loved to be great, but now, you would rather suffer, be defrauded, and forbear. This is because you have a new heart. Others will also see your change and say that you were a certain way before, but that now you are changed. But my question is: has there been any improvement in your thoughts? Has there been any improvement in your mental power? Are your thoughts more orderly and concentrated? Or are they still the same as they were before you were saved? If this is so, your nous is still not renewed.</P><P>Regardless of whether a believer is wise or foolish, he should know that his mind as well as his heart should be proper. Furthermore, in his nous he should have the same improvement. God is without respect of persons. He destroys the wisdom of the wise and the understanding of the prudent. God puts the wise and the foolish all on the same level. The nous of the foolish needs to be renewed. The nous of the wise also needs to be renewed. As long as your nous is renewed, you can know God, understand His will, perceive, analyze, and synthesize what God has given you. This is what you did not know, understand, or see and what you could not verbalize or analyze before. Furthermore, you will be able to run the race before you.</P><P>Indeed, the difference between a renewed nous and an unrenewed nous is like the difference between a bright, clear window and a dark, dirty window. If a believer's nous has not been renewed, he cannot think or work like a person with a renewed nous. If his nous is renewed, his thinking ability will be at least several times (if not ten times) more than before. Furthermore, his mental power will be much improved. But if his thoughts are not renewed, his thinking will not be improved because his thoughts are dead. Just as there is a great difference between death and life, there is a great difference between a renewed nous and an unrenewed nous. Just as there is a difference between heaven and earth, there is a difference between a renewed nous and an unrenewed nous. If we earnestly and single-mindedly deal with our nous in the way that we dealt with our salvation in the past, our sky will always be clear.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE RENEWING OF THE MIND</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 30</H2><P>God communicates with us through our spirit, not through our soul or our body. Therefore, we always need to keep an open and unveiled spirit in the presence of God so that we can have a living communication with Him. But today I want to draw attention to the relationship between the spirit and the nous. Whenever there is a closed nous, there is a closed spirit. If the nous is closed, God cannot give light to the spirit, because even if He gave light to the spirit, there would be no channel to express what the spirit had received. If the head of a Christian is sick, his spirit will also be sick. The illness of a Christian's body will not affect his spirit. Many Christians have been bedridden for years and still can serve God, obey God, and do the work of prayer. However, if the nous of a Christian is not proper, his spirit will also not be proper, for the problem in his head will directly affect his spirit.</P><P>There are two passages in the Bible which tell us that the believers' nous should be renewed. If one's nous is not renewed, it will be hard for him to go on. Let us look at the Scriptures.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>INTERPRETATION</H2><P>Ephesians 4:17-24 says, "This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their nous, being darkened in their dianoia [Greek for "understanding"], alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart; who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness. But you did not so learn Christ, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus, that you put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your nous and put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality."</P><P>In this passage of the Scripture, nous is mentioned twice. We have to pay attention to this nous.</P><P>Verse 18 says, "Being darkened in their understanding." Understanding according to the original text is dianoia. This word has the same root as nous in verse 17, but changes a little from the root to form dianoia. So the meaning from verse 17 to verse 18 is, "You should no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their nous, being darkened in their dianoia." What is the difference between nous and dianoia? Nous is an organ; dianoia is a kind of function. This is like saying that the eye is an organ, while seeing is a function of the eye. Therefore, the eye is the object, while seeing is the function of the object. The nous is the organ, while the dianoia is the function. Nous is an organ, and verse 17 talks about the nature of this organ. Dianoia is a function, and verse 18 talks about the function of the organ.</P><P>Verse 18 says, "Alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart." The "heart" in this verse is the true "I," that is, the self, one's own personality.</P><P>Verse 19 says, "Who, being past feeling." The meaning here in the original text is to have lost all feeling and to be numb. This term is used by medical doctors quite often. Every doctor knows that the wound of a patient hurts, but when the hurt goes beyond a certain stage, the person does not feel the pain anymore. Although the wound is still inflamed, the consciousness of pain is utterly lost. This verse means that there is no longer any feeling. It means that the heart is so hardened that it has lost its feeling.</P><P>In verse 22 we have, "That you put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man." The meaning here is that since you have heard and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus, that your old man has been put off, etc., you should do the things recorded in verses 25-32.</P><P>"The old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit" (v. 22). According to the original text the meaning here is, "The old man, which through the lusts of the deceit is heading towards corruption."</P><P>"And that you be renewed in the spirit of your nous [the Greek word for mind]" (v. 23). This is a continuation of a preceding verse concerning the reality in Jesus, that is, what the believers have received in Christ. We not only have put off the old man, but we should renew the spirit of our nous frequently. The meaning in the original text is to be continually renewed in the same way that the old man is continually being corrupted.</P><P>Verse 24 reads, "And put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality." "Put on the new man" in the original text can be rendered "having put on the new man." This corresponds to verse 22. Verse 24 also speaks of the facts which we have in the Lord. Verses 22 through 24 are all facts that we have in Christ. Based on these verses, verse 25 and the following verses command and tell us what we should do.</P><P>In this passage we see three particularly important things: (1) our spiritual life, (2) our heart, and (3) our nous. Verse 17 speaks of the nous; verse 18 speaks of dianoia, which is the function of the nous, something concerning the nous. Verse 18 says, "Alienated from the life of God." This means that the spirit is closed and can no longer communicate with God. Not only can Gentiles be like this, but Christians can also have a closed spirit. "The hardness of their heart" in verse 18 refers to the heart. "Being past feeling" in verse 19 refers to the numbness and the loss of feeling in man's heart. In short, this passage mentions the condition of three things: the nous, the spirit, and the heart.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE HEART BEING CORRUPTED FIRST</H2><P>Let us pay attention to verses 17 and 18 which say that the nous of the Gentiles is corrupted by vanity, and the heart is hardened and alienated from the life of God. A Gentile is so corrupted that he has lost all feeling. But where does this corruption really begin? If we know where it begins, we can deal with that part first. Does the nous of a man become corrupted first? Does his life or heart become corrupted first? If we know what becomes corrupted first, we can deal with it accordingly. If the disease starts from the heart, we should deal with the heart first; if it starts from the nous, we should deal with the nous first; if it starts from life, we should deal with life first. Verses 17 and 18 show us the order of corruption for these three. The apostle told us not to walk in the vanity of the nous. (The vanity of the nous is like what the Chinese call "the palace in the sky" and Westerners call "the castle in the air.") We should not walk like the Gentiles walk because the function and thoughts of their nous are darkened. The function of the nous is darkened because the Gentiles are alienated from the life of God, and they are alienated from the life of God because they are ignorant and hardened in their heart. Therefore, the trouble starts from the heart. Because the heart is hardened, a person is alienated from the life of God, and because he is alienated from the life of God, the dianoia is darkened. Brothers and sisters, the cause of all diseases lies in the heart. I have often told the co-workers that it is not the head of a person that is improper, but the heart that is improper. People always think that man's head is improper, but I say no, it is the heart that is improper.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GENTILES BEING UNWILLING<br>TO BELIEVE IN THEIR HEART</H2><P>Did not the last message say that man's head rather than his heart is improper? Yes, but that was another matter. This matter concerns morality. If a man wants to be proper in his conduct, his heart must first be proper. Do you know why a Gentile will not believe in the Lord Jesus and has many arguments? Is it because we do not have enough reasons to convince him to believe in God or Christ? No, we have the reasons. Psalm 14:1 says, "The fool has said in his heart,/ There is no God." He will not believe because he has said in his heart that there is no God, not because he is incapable of believing. The Lord asked the Jews why they would not believe in Him and come to Him that they might have life. This is a problem of the heart, not a problem of the intellect. It is the heart that does not believe.</P><P>I can give some people who do not believe in God many reasons for the existence of God. They respond by saying that this sounds very reasonable. I can then tell them the reason that the Lord is the Savior. Again, they respond by saying that this sounds very reasonable. But this is not enough to make them believe. Man's head is not improper; his heart is improper. Paul said, "If you...believe in your heart...you will be saved" (Rom. 10:9). The Lord Jesus also said, "Whoever...does not doubt in his heart....believe that you have received them, and you will have them" (Mark 11:23-24). The head is not the problem; it is not the issue. The heart is all that is needed to believe. The heart is our true "I," our person. This is why the Bible speaks of "an evil heart of unbelief" (Heb. 3:12), instead of "an evil head of unbelief." The heart, not the head, has been corrupted. This is why men will not believe and be saved. The heart has become improper. As a result, the nous has also become improper.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br>A CHRISTIAN'S MOTIVE AND HIS NOUS</H2><P>Not only are the Gentiles like this; even Christians are like this. Many Christians do not know God's will; they are unwilling to obey God and do not understand the Bible at all. They are like this because their heart is sick. A bad nous is just the symptom; the cause of the bad nous is a bad heart. I am not saying that the nous is not sick; the main point I am emphasizing is that the heart is sick first. Therefore, the heart must first become right before the action of the nous can be corrected. It is useless to deal with the symptom; the only way to cure the trouble is to deal with the source.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. Concerning Obedience</H2><P>Let us take baptism as an example. This truth is quite obviously and accurately revealed to us in the Bible. Many Christians disobey the teaching of the Bible, while creating many distinctions not because the head has trouble, but because the heart has trouble. Suppose a believer hears that baptism is according to the Bible and is something that God has clearly commanded. If he hears about baptism and looks in the Bible, he will find God's will and obey, saying, "God, this is from You; I am willing to obey." But if another believer, after hearing about baptism, refuses to obey and dismisses it as being meaningless, he will not understand even if he reads the Bible later. When he subsequently hears others speaking about this truth, he will be motivated like a lawyer in court. He will not care whether the other side is reasonable; he will only care for his own reason. The first motive of a lawyer is to defeat the other side in the debate. Therefore, when problems arise, the question is not the condition of the head, but whether or not the motive is proper.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. Concerning Listening to a Message</H2><P>The same is true in regards to listening to a message. When someone preaches something that is different from our belief and practice, we should ask God if his speaking is really improper. If his speaking is not improper, then are we improper somewhere? If we can learn humbly before God, our hearts will be proper. Consequently, even though our thoughts may be improper at times, our minds will not be improper all the time. However, if our motives are not proper and we only want to argue, we will always be able to find a couple of verses to oppose the truth taught by others. Many Christians study the Bible like a lawyer studying a law book; their purpose is only to defend their own case. Therefore, it is their motive that is corrupted first, not their mind. They first have a tendency to covet in their heart; then their mind and whole being are dragged into the peril of covetousness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Concerning Reading the Bible</H2><P>Among our brothers and sisters, is there anyone whose mind cannot understand the Bible? I would say the reason we do not understand the Bible is that our heart is improper. The Spirit will guide us into all truth. I often wonder why some people understand the Bible so poorly. The reason is that they are improper in the inclinations of their heart. Perhaps they are too subjective. As a result, their nous cannot receive the light of God's Word. The heart becomes corrupted, and the nous follows. If the heart is not calm and balanced, the mind will become corrupted. Someone said that Eve did not fall because she ate the forbidden fruit, but because her motive was not proper in the beginning. When she spoke with Satan, her heart was dissatisfied with God and already corrupted. Soon after, Genesis 6 says that every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart was only evil continually. The nous becomes corrupted after the heart has been corrupted.</P><P>One brother in the West said that before Eve ate the forbidden fruit, she had fallen already. When she added the words "neither shall ye touch it" in her conversation with Satan, her heart was not proper. By Genesis 6, God pronounced every imagination of the thoughts of man's heart to be only evil continually. First, the heart is improper; second, man is alienated from the life of God; and last, man's imagination and thoughts become totally evil. Any Christian who has a proper heart can read the Bible; he can receive God's light from the Bible, he can know God's will easily, and he can receive full grace from God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>4. Concerning Listening to Others</H2><P>If you want to know whether or not a person's heart is proper and his mind is right, you need only talk to him. Whoever can listen well has a good mind. Some Christians' minds are like a wheel; they rotate all day long and cannot listen to what others say to them. Just as the wheel splashes dirt as it rotates, these Christians only raise questions and do not take in the truth. These conditions indicate that a person's mind is improper. The mind is improper because the heart is improper. If a person likes to interrupt the conversation of others, it is also a sign of sickness in the heart. In listening to others, we can sometimes add a few remarks to indicate whether or not we agree, but constant interruption is a sign that there is sickness in the heart.</P><P>If the thoughts that go through your mind swirl around and around all day long, your nous must be sick. In this condition, a person cannot listen to others; he cannot even listen to God's speaking. The root of the sickness is in the heart. A self-righteous, self-confident heart, a heart that believes in its own cleverness, or some prejudice in the heart makes it impossible for one to listen to others. Not being able to listen to others is a sickness of the nous. But the root of this sickness is an improper heart. No matter what we hear, we have to transfer what we hear to our inner being before we can understand it. This work of transferring is somewhat like the work of language translation. For people who do not understand English, words must first be translated into Chinese before they can be understood. This work of "translation" within us goes on quickly. If a man cannot understand what others say, it means that his nous cannot translate. If a man misunderstands what others say, it means that the nous mistranslates. Once I was preaching in a certain place, and I told the people that man is saved not according to work, but according to what Christ has accomplished. There were two Taoists in the audience. After hearing my words, they told others, "He was only exhorting others to do good!" Many people are filled up inside; they cannot receive God's word. If we do not empty out what is inside of us, we will never be able to understand the Word of God. Our heart should be as meek as a child's, ready to be taught before God. We must tell Him, "God, I do not know if what this person says is good or bad, right or wrong. I pray that You grant me judgment, so that I will know what is right and what is wrong." By this, we will understand and see what God wants us to see. Many people think that the inability to understand the truth is due to the sickness of the mind. Actually, the basic cause is the sickness of the heart.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>5. Concerning the Thoughts</H2><P>Some people think too much with their head; others are too empty in their head and do not think at all. Sometimes people are inwardly lazy; they do not want to think too much. Sometimes people feel dull in their head and cannot think properly. A Christian's mental condition mainly falls within these two categories: either it continues to think without stopping, or it is idle and not thinking at all. Some believers have a very bad memory and can only rely on their diary. I personally do not object to a diary. But if a believer only relies on his diary to remember things, his head must be sick. Mrs. Penn-Lewis said that believers should not be the slaves of their diaries. Of course, we all have times that we forget. Some things have not formed a deep impression in our mind and are forgotten. This is natural. But if the impression is deep enough, and we still cannot remember, something must be wrong. Being an amnesiac or forgetting things too easily are abnormal. If we cannot direct our thoughts, it is the symptom of a sick mind. The only time our limbs cannot be used is when they are paralyzed. In the same way, the only reason that the mind cannot be exercised is because it is sick. Once a man cannot think for himself and can only act according to the thoughts given by others, he becomes a mentally passive person. A mind which cannot think is sick, while a believer's mind which thinks constantly is also sick. Thinking constantly speaks of the mind's inability to stop, while failing to think speaks of the mind's inability to move. Both are wrong. Some people's minds are dull and seemingly bound; they cannot think at all. This condition is as sick as not being able to stop the thoughts.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DANGER OF AN UNRENEWED NOUS</H2><P>I have mentioned only a few conditions of a sick nous. The root of all sickness can be traced to the position of the heart. The reason many people are depressed and dull in their mind is that they are lazy in their heart. This is like patients who have become so accustomed to sickness that they eventually like being sick. They would rather be sick than get up and work. Many times when the mind is too tired to think or work, it should take some rest. But if a person always dislikes working, his heart must be lazy. When a man's mind thinks too much or when it thinks nothing at all, it is a symptom that the nous is sick.</P><P>The apostle said in Ephesians 4:18 that because of the hardness of their hearts, the Gentiles were alienated from the life of God, and God's light could not shine into their nous. Because the light of God's life cannot shine into their nous, their nous is darkened, and the function of their nous is also darkened. The condition of their nous is due to the hardness of their heart. This is the condition of the Gentiles. Before God there is a danger of a believer being in the same condition as the Gentiles.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RENEWING OF THE NOUS</H2><P>We want to know how we can have our nous renewed. We have the new life. We also have the new heart. Our nous has been renewed at least once and has been enlightened by God at least once. What we need to do now is to open our nous to God daily, so that we can receive everything from God, know God's will, understand God's desire, and understand the teaching of the Bible. This is our emphasis today. Brothers, do you want to understand God's will? Do you want to understand God's desire? Do you want to understand the teaching of the Bible? If you do, your nous must be renewed.</P><P>In the passage in Ephesians 4:17-24, the apostle says that since we have heard and been taught the reality in Jesus, we should manifest it in a practical way. His exhortation after verse 24 is based on his teaching given in verses 20 through 24. In other words, verses 20 through 24 are the facts which Christians possess in the Lord, and the following verses show the conduct that Christians ought to have based on that position. Today I am not going to talk about this whole passage. Rather, I will consider the renewing of the mind and its relationship with the old man and the new, based on our position in the Lord in this passage. As far as the fact is concerned, we have put off the old man in Christ. However, this does not mean that in experience we will not see the shadow of the old man. Positionally, our nous has been renewed. But this does not mean that we do not need to renew our mind frequently. Frequent renewing of the nous is essential.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN AS REGARDS<br>THE FORMER MANNER OF LIFE</H2><P>Verses 22-23 say, "That you put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit, and that you be renewed in the spirit of your nous." Notice the phrase "the spirit of your nous." There is a special relationship between the nous and the spirit. If we want the spirit of our nous to be renewed, we must put off the old man. If we do not put off the old man in our experience, we will not be able to experience the renewing of our mind.</P><P>Putting off the old man is a specific matter; it is like a gate which we go through, rather than a road which extends continuously. Believers must have a specific and definite dealing. A gate is different from a road. Passing a school entrance examination is a gate; studying after getting into the school is a road. If a believer wants to ask himself if he has a renewed nous, he only needs to ask if he has ever specifically put off the old man, the former manner of life, and put on the new man. Please notice another thing: the old man in Romans 6 is spoken of in a different way than it is spoken of here. Romans 6:6 speaks of the facts we have in the Lord; it speaks of our old man being crucified. This is why we only have to reckon and believe. Ephesians 4 does not speak of the fact of crucifixion, but the fact of putting off. The crucifixion is something that we need to believe in; it is a matter of faith. But "putting off" is something of the will. Putting off something is an act of the will. We not only must believe that our old man is crucified, but we must also exercise the power of our will to cast away our old man. If we only exercise faith, without exercising the will to remove the old man, it will not work. We need our will as much as we need our faith.</P><P>This passage shows us that if we want our understanding and mind to be renewed, we must specifically put off our old man. If we want to be renewed continuously, we must put off continuously. Just as we exercise our will to take off our clothes and cast them aside when we undress, we should exercise our will to specifically put off the old man and cast it aside. Everything that belongs to the old man, whether it is our speech, thoughts, or behavior, should be specifically cast aside; we should reject everything sinful, unclean, or of the self. At the same time, we must seek the Lord single-heartedly and trust in the Holy Spirit to renew our nous. This renewing work belongs to the Holy Spirit. If we remove the obstacles and trust in Him to do the renewing work, He will renew our nous gradually.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>DEALING WITH THE SIN IN OUR HEART</H2><P>We should pay attention to one more matter: the trouble with man's nous originates in man's heart; therefore, if the nous is to be renewed, the prejudiced heart must also be corrected. Although this correcting does not mean a so-called cultivation of the heart, that idea is, nevertheless, included in this correcting. An improper motive will block the light of God. Something as tiny as a little leaf can block the sunlight. It only takes a very tiny sin to block God's light. Most people have sin in their hearts. Once the sin in the heart is dealt with, everything else will be taken care of properly. If a believer's heart is proper, he will be able to understand God's will. Every believer who does not understand God's will is in this condition because his heart was improper in the first place.</P><P>Whoever is willing to say to God, "God, if You teach me right now, I thank You; if You do not teach me right now, I will not insist," can be taught by God. When a person who has been taught by God listens to another's preaching, he will ask, "God, am I wrong or not? Is what he said right or wrong?" The way a believer listens to a message proves whether or not his heart is proper.</P><P>The most precious thing about a renewed nous is that it can open as well as close one's thoughts. A renewed nous, with respect to God, is able to know His will; with respect to the self, it is able to control one's own mind and clarify his thoughts; and with respect to others, it can discern, receive, and understand the words of others.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</H2><P>Verse 24 reads, "And put on the new man, which was created according to God in righteousness and holiness of the reality." This is our conduct on the positive side. If we want to renew our nous, or have our nous renewed frequently, we must put on the new man in our experience. This also is an act of the will. What does it mean to put on the new man? Our new man, which is according to God's image, was created in righteousness and holiness of the reality. In other words, the characteristics of the new man are righteousness and holiness of the reality. Righteousness is God's way; holiness is God's nature.</P><P>Concerning God, we can speak of three aspects: (1) glory, referring to God Himself; (2) holiness, referring to God's nature; and (3) righteousness, referring to the way God acts. We were created according to God's image, but this is limited to the aspects of God's righteousness and holiness; we cannot be like God in His glory, since glory has to do with His Godhead. We cannot be part of this. But we have God's righteousness and holiness. Therefore, if a believer wants to be like God, he should let God's nature deal with him in God's way. Today how many believers have deep feelings about sin? I am ashamed to say that my feeling about sin is not deep enough. Miss M.E. Barber deeply understood sin and God's holiness. Usually one only senses pride or jealousy but does not know what pride and jealousy are. But if you went to Miss Barber, you would have a feeling that you otherwise would not have had. She hated sin the most, and she dealt with sin the best. She dealt with herself very strictly. As a result, she was also extremely straightforward with others. The minute one came into her presence, he realized what pride and jealousy are. She truly knew God. This is why I say that many times we cannot learn truths from a man's preaching, but we can learn from the truth he practices.</P><P>If you yield to sin the first time, you will lose the feeling about sin the second and third time. If you call sin by the right name and acknowledge sin as sin the first time, if you have the right view and right attitude toward sin, and if you deal with sin the right way the first time, you will be able to deal with sin the next time. If you do not consider sin as sin the first time and deal with it, but rather consider losing your temper as a common thing for a Christian, you will commit the same sin the next time. Whoever does not know sin will not know holiness. What is holiness? Holiness is having the knowledge of sin. Adam and Eve were only ignorant and innocent before they sinned; they were not holy. Only those who know sin know the meaning of holiness.</P><P>What is unrighteousness? Whatever is improper is unrighteousness. Originally, I did not know what unrighteousness was. One time I saw a story in a magazine which said that there was a man who listened to someone preaching in a chapel. After he preached, the speaker walked down the aisle and sat next to the listener. While he was seating himself, he unintentionally stepped on and dirtied the raincoat of a lady sitting in front of him. He kicked the raincoat aside without removing the dirt and did not apologize to the owner of the raincoat. The listener criticized the preacher, saying it was unrighteous. What is unrighteousness? Unrighteousness is to be indebted to someone. Even if the man did not indemnify the lady, at least he should have removed the dirt for her; otherwise, before God there is an indebtedness forever.</P><P>Therefore, the nous is related to our living before God. Whenever we yield to sin, we become unrighteous. We are not able to fellowship with God, and our nous is darkened. Therefore, we should put off uncleanness, improper motives, and unrighteousness on the negative side and put on the new man on the positive side. Brothers, we must pass through this gate. The renewing of the nous is something very specific. Do not think that all that is needed is to grow gradually.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN THE NOUS AND SPIRIT</H2><P>Several years ago I saw in a magazine something written by Mrs. Penn-Lewis which said, "If your spirit is obstructed, it is because your nous is obstructed." In other words, the spirit is closed because the nous is closed. I saw and appreciated these words, but my spiritual life at that time was very shallow, and I could not fully understand. Sometime later I realized how real these words were. If a person's nous is closed, his spirit must also be closed. Since the spirit expresses itself through the nous, the spirit will have no outlet if the nous is closed. Although an electric current has power, if the filament of the light bulb is broken, no light will shine. This does not mean that the electric company has run out of power; it only means that electricity cannot circulate through the bulb. In the same way, if our nous is closed, our spirit will have nowhere to express itself and have no power to express itself. I do not know what more I can say to lead you into this deep truth and help you have a renewed nous. If your nous is closed, your spiritual power will find no expression.</P><P>I am not saying that our mind can help God's work; what comes out of the mind is just the power of the soul. But if a believer's nous is not renewed, his spirit will have no outlet, and God will not be able to use him. Peter said, "These men are not drunk" (Acts 2:15). If they had been drunk, their mind would not have been clear. If their mind had not been clear, they would not have had an open spirit for God to use. As far as I know, those who are greatly used by God are very clear in their spirit, understanding, nous, thinking, and logic. The amount of knowledge they have is another matter altogether; not everyone who is used by God has great knowledge.</P><P>If our nous is renewed and our understanding is quick, we can understand God's will, God's desire, and the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONSECRATION<br>AND THE RENEWING OF THE NOUS</H2><P>Romans 12:1-2 says, "I exhort you therefore, brothers, through the compassions of God to present your bodies a living sacrifice, holy, well pleasing to God, which is your reasonable service. And do not be fashioned according to this age, but be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is, that which is good and well pleasing and perfect." The word mind in the original text is nous. Here the renewing of the nous is mentioned again. Paul exhorted others to present their bodies to God and serve God. The renewing of the nous is based on consecration.</P><P>Friends, are there things which drag you down, hold you back, and bind you tightly? If you can consecrate these things to Him and put them upon the altar, your renewed nous will receive double strength from God, and you will understand God's desire and will; you will be able to think and understand everything about God. At the same time, you can also dispense them to others. You should practice this matter in a definite way before God. The result is "that you may prove...." (The meaning of that is "so that" or "in order that.") The result is that your mind will understand God's will, and you will be able to see clearly and prove God's will, that which is well pleasing to Him.</P><P>Many people say lightly, "I will obey, no matter what." Actually, they are far from what they say. They do not know what they are talking about. When the Lord was going to die, Peter said, "Even if I must die with You, I will by no means deny You" (Matt. 26:35). Many people are like Peter. They do not know what God is asking of them. They simply have no idea what God requires of them. This is why they never make any progress. If you want to see how deep or how advanced a believer's spiritual life is, just find out what God is asking of him. A sinner who is newly saved gives up smoking and gambling, etc. These cannot be considered as signs of very much growth. All of us know that this is a basic step in the spiritual pathway of a saved person. Soon afterwards, he realizes that envy, pride, etc. are bad. This signals a further progress. Further on, God shows him that in his work he should drop his opinion. This is another, deeper step. In short, God's demand deepens and increases little by little. Some Christians know that they should not smoke or gamble. Other Christians know that they should not be proud or jealous. Yet they often do not know anything more. We must offer ourselves to God according to what we know. Only then will our nous be renewed. At the same time, our renewed nous will teach us how we should consecrate ourselves to God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NOUS AFTER IT IS RENEWED</H2><P>Originally, the nous of many people is like a kitchen window that is covered with grease. After the nous is renewed, it is like a clean glass window which allows sunlight to come through. A person with a renewed nous will become more and more clear and will understand God's demand more and more. His nous will become very sharp and quick, and he will become very clear concerning God's requirement. Many Christians do not understand God's will because they do not have the proper receiving organ. They can only infer, guess, and presume; they cannot understand God's will. But if the nous is renewed, this organ will enable a person to know God's will more and more clearly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1. Judgment</H2><P>Romans 14:5 reads, "One judges one day above another; another judges every day alike. Let each by fully persuaded in his own mind." The "mind" in this verse is the nous. Paul says that one man esteems one day above another, and another thinks that all days are the same. By what should we judge what is right and what is wrong? It is judged by our own nous. We can judge clearly by our nous. If there is a question of God's will, it can be decided clearly by the nous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>2. Understanding the Bible</H2><P>Luke 24:45 reads, "Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures." The "mind" here is nous in the original text. The Lord Jesus opened their nous. Why did He do this? He did this in order that they would understand the Scriptures. Please remember that the Lord Jesus has to open our nous before we can understand the Scriptures. When the nous is opened, the result is the understanding of the Scriptures. Every time you read the Bible, you have to tell God, "I humble myself before You like a child. I do not know or understand the meaning of this passage of the Scriptures. Please grant me the light." God will grant you the understanding or the possession of His truth, though not necessarily at the moment you are reading. Sometimes your nous is opened, and you understand the truth while you are walking, working, going to bed, or getting up. Once God opens you, you will become more and more systematic. According to my own experience as well as that of others, God never gives an incomplete truth to man. At the beginning, when we read the Bible, we may only get pieces; but later on, we will understand the whole truth from God. For instance, I know a man in the Lord who was caught by the truth concerning authority for four or five months. God continually showed him everything in the Bible concerning the truth of authority. Nevertheless, he also received other things as well in his daily morning watch.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>3. Preaching</H2><P>Once someone asked me, "Is it necessary for one to prepare before he preaches?" I said, "On one hand, there is no need to prepare. On the other hand, one has to prepare every day." We should receive from God daily. All the time, we should receive the truth God reveals to us in our nous. Following a long period or sometimes even a short period of time, we will know and understand the whole truth. A message does not come merely with two hours of preparation. This kind of preparation is useless. Many spiritual persons yearly receive from God clear, systematic, and great truths. God shows them truths in their nous and sustains them with these truths. At the same time, He enables them to bring these truths to others to help and sustain them with these truths.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONTROLLING THE MIND</H2><P>Concerning the process of renewing, we need to do our job, and God will do His job. The renewing may be resolved all at once; it may also not be resolved all at once, but rather grow like an infant. The most important thing is that a renewed mind is under a person's own control; he can stop when he wants to stop, and he can think when he wants to think. One should be able to control himself in a spontaneous way. After the mind is renewed, one should not allow outside thoughts to control him. If he does, his mind will become sick. This does not mean that one should analyze his thoughts. If he analyzes, it will be a great suffering to his mind. This control should be exercised very spontaneously, as spontaneously as the opening and closing of the eyelids. There is no need to think or command; the eyelids open and close spontaneously. Concerning controlling our thoughts, in the beginning we may have to exert some effort. But after a while, we will no longer need to exert any more effort; the control will come spontaneously. We should control our thoughts. However, this should be done most spontaneously and naturally. There is no need to analyze or become introspective. If we do, we will suffer and come into danger. This is something to which we should pay attention.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>FAITH AND OBEDIENCE</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>(Notes from the Conference in 1932)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 30</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rom. 6:11-14</H1><P>Today I will speak about the principles of Christian living. The entire New Testament shows us that there are only two principles of Christian living; everything else is merely fruit that issues from these two principles. Patience, meekness, truthfulness, temperance, and whatever else are not the principles of Christian living. There are only two principles of Christian living: one is faith; the other is obedience. All good fruit issues from these two principles. In our fellowship with the Lord, we need faith and obedience every day.</P><P>In the New Testament, many verses speak about faith and obedience. I will only mention Romans 6:11 and 13. Verse 11 says "reckon." This is faith. Verse 13 says "present." This is obedience. Verse 11 speaks of faith in reference to what Christ has accomplished. Verse 13 speaks of presenting our members to God, which will preserve the ground we gain through faith. If we can balance the principles of faith and obedience, all spiritual experiences will open before us, and we will be able to enter into these experiences freely.</P><P>What are faith and obedience? All the objective truths are in Christ and have been accomplished. All the subjective truths are in the Holy Spirit and will be accomplished by Him. I do not know if all of you understand the difference between redemption and salvation. Redemption was accomplished more than nineteen hundred years ago, while salvation was accomplished on the day you believed in the Lord. Therefore, redemption is objective; it has been accomplished in Christ. Salvation is subjective; it is what the Holy Spirit accomplishes in us. The order of these two matters cannot be reversed. The Lord Jesus did not accomplish salvation nineteen hundred years ago, neither did the Spirit within me accomplish redemption today. One was accomplished long ago; the other is waiting to be accomplished. Suppose I have not yet believed in the Lord. When you preach the gospel to me, you can only say that redemption has been accomplished; you cannot say that salvation has been accomplished, because I have not yet been saved. Salvation is accomplished only after I have believed in the Lord, but redemption was accomplished long before I believed in the Lord. All the redemptive work is past. All the objective works are in the past; they are absolute and eternal. All subjective works are accomplished in the present and in the future. One has been accomplished; the other is waiting to be accomplished. On the one hand, death, burial, resurrection, and ascension are accomplished. On the other hand, the death which the Holy Spirit puts within you is accomplished only when you believe. The resurrection of Christ took place more than nineteen hundred years ago, but it is manifested in you on the day you believe. Everything objective is in the past; it is absolute, complete, and nothing can be added. Everything subjective is accomplished in the present and in the future. Receiving something objective and receiving something subjective require two completely different principles. Since the objective has been accomplished, we should just believe. Since the subjective is accomplished now and in the future, we need to obey. If we pay attention only to one side, we will go astray by either becoming theoretical or ascetic. The objective death, resurrection, and ascension require our believing. However, it is not enough just to believe. Day by day we also need to obey. Crucifixion with Christ requires obedience; the power of resurrection requires obedience; and the place of ascension requires obedience.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, we need an outward Savior and an inward Savior. We need the Word incarnated in the flesh and the Word manifested in the Holy Spirit. We need the Christ of Golgotha and the Christ in the Spirit. The Savior who is without demands our faith, whereas the Holy Spirit who is within demands our obedience. Now I would like to speak about some experiences in order for us to understand faith and obedience.</P><P>What does believing mean? This is something that we cannot give up even for a single day. Objective truths need our believing. A man should not say that he needs to die, resurrect, and ascend. Rather, he should say that he has died, resurrected, and ascended. What is faith? Faith means that you have known, seen, and acknowledged. A man cannot believe in what he has not seen. Whether it is death, resurrection, or ascension, there must first be the revelation of the Holy Spirit before there can be the faith. A doctrine is a presentation of the facts, while a truth is the reality behind what is presented. Many times, many doctrines are not truths to us. When something is really there, it will not only be a doctrine, but a truth. The death of the Lord Jesus on our behalf is not only a doctrine, but also a truth. Theology is about doctrines. In other words, doctrines are theology. The objective truth requires that we believe. We must know that it is real. In Greek, truth means reality. The death of the Lord is a truth, which means that the death of the Lord is a reality. The resurrection of the Lord is a truth, which means that the resurrection of the Lord is a reality. The ascension of the Lord is a truth, which means that the ascension of the Lord is a reality. This is what we call the truth.</P><P>How do we know that these truths are real? Every time we receive a truth, it is not due to what was said by the preacher. The only One in the whole world who can bring men into the truth is the Holy Spirit. Preachers can only speak doctrines to men, but there must be the revelation of the Holy Spirit before men can have faith. Brothers and sisters, have we seen this? I am not speaking about our death, resurrection, and ascension with Christ. I am only speaking about the Lord's death on our behalf. In the past we did not know sin, neither did we know God or Christ. Perhaps one day when we heard someone speak about the death of the Lord Jesus on our behalf, there was one word that touched our heart. As a result we said, "Oh, that is what this is!" Suddenly we "saw" sin, we "saw" God, we "saw" Christ, and we "saw" salvation. We saw that our sins were forgiven, and we had the boldness to say that our sins were forgiven. Someone might have asked us how we knew our sins were forgiven. Despite their question, we were very clear about it because we had seen.</P><P>What is the revelation of the Holy Spirit? It is the Holy Spirit removing the veil and showing you what lies behind a preacher's speaking. You may have seen what is meant by forgiveness and regeneration. This seeing is most precious. When you saw that Christ Jesus died in such a way, you believed. You may go to the countryside and see an old friend and preach to him. He may nod his head, but soon forget what you preached. He lacks one necessary thing; he has not obtained the revelation. Those who are blind cannot believe. Those who have no revelation cannot have faith. You must pray that God will make him see his sin and see the Savior. You may have preached three or five doctrines to him. But when he sees, there is no need to preach to him anymore. Just as he needs to see Christ's death, he also needs to see resurrection, ascension, and all the other truths.</P><P>Brothers, you may go to the countryside to preach the gospel to fifty people and tell them how man sinned, how the Lord died for man, and how faith brings in salvation. All fifty people may nod their heads. However, does this mean that all fifty are saved? Although they nod their heads, they walk away with no realization that lying and pride are sins. They have heard about sin but have not seen sin. They have heard about the Savior but have not seen the Savior. Thus, there is no possibility for them to believe. Every time we preach the gospel to someone, we must ask God to open their eyes so that they will weep at seeing their sin and receive the Lord when they see Him. After some time a theological professor may come and tell them that their sins are not really sins and that the Lord's death was merely an act of self-sacrifice. However, they will not be moved if they have seen something. They believe because they have seen something.</P><P>Death is an objective truth. It demands our believing. All the other objective truths also demand our believing. We have paid considerable attention to preaching the Lord's death. Nevertheless, it has not been effective. Something is wrong in the matter of faith, and this means something is wrong with the revelation. Once I preached about the truth of our crucifixion with the Lord. A brother said that it was good and that he would be victorious from then on because he now knew the way to victory. I said that after a few days it would not work because he had not yet seen. You may ask someone how they were saved, and they may say that they heard the teaching. However, this kind of salvation will not last for more than a few days. Mere understanding in the mind is not faith. When you read the Bible or hear in the meeting that you have died, resurrected, and ascended, you should not say, "I have examined myself and have not found any resurrection or ascension." Neither should you say lightly, "I have died, resurrected, and ascended." Instead, you should ask the Lord, "Make me see that I have died, resurrected, and ascended." If you pray in this way, the Lord will usher you into the objective truth, that is, into Himself. You will see that in Christ, you are dead, resurrected, and ascended. Since He has died, you also have died; since He has resurrected, you also have resurrected; and since He has ascended, you also have ascended. In this way you will say, "Lord, I thank You. In You I have died, resurrected, and ascended." You will say this because of faith. This faith is based on the facts behind the words.</P><P>Mr. Hudson Taylor was at one time continuously experiencing failure and weakness. Once he wrote to his sister about how his heart was very troubled because he felt that he was lacking sanctification, life, and power within. He thought that if he could only abide in Christ, everything would be fine. His sister prayed for him. For a few months he prayed, struggled, fasted, made resolutions, read the Bible, and used more time for quiet meditation. However, nothing was effective. He wished he could abide in Christ forever, but it seemed that after dwelling in Him for a short while, he came out again. He said, "If I only knew I could abide in Christ, then everything would be well; but I could not." From his diary we read the following story: one day he was praying again. He thought that if he could abide in Christ and could draw His juice and receive His nourishment and supply, he would have the power to overcome sin. He prayed again and read the Bible again. Then he came to John 15:5, which says, "I am the vine; you are the branches." He said, "I am the most foolish man in the whole world. I have been praying to be a branch; I wanted to abide in Christ. However, the Lord has said that I already am a branch and abiding in Him." O brothers, if we realize this, we will say, "Hallelujah!" We do not need to enter anything, because we are already in. We do not need to strive to be a branch, nor do we become a branch only after we have overcome sin. We are already a branch, and we are abiding in Him. The purpose of John 15:5 is to tell us that we are abiding in Him and that we should not leave this abiding. We are a branch. All the juice, nourishment, and love are ours. Mr. Taylor said that since he saw this, he became a new Hudson Taylor. This was a great turning point in his life.</P><P>Believing is not changing God's word into reality. It is believing that God's word is reality. During last year's special conference, I mentioned that the grace of God comprises three things: the promise, the fact, and the covenant. The promise is something which will be accomplished. The fact is something which has been accomplished. All the objective truths have been accomplished and are real. We only need to say to God, "Your Word says I have died, resurrected, and ascended. Therefore, I also say that I have died, resurrected, and ascended." Indeed, this is the way we can stand firm. God has spoken, and it is so.</P><P>Mr. ______ was a famous speaker in the Keswick Conventions. The turning point of his life was due to one incident. Once he chose 2 Corinthians 12:9, "My grace is sufficient for you," to be the topic of his message. After he had prepared the outline, he knelt down to pray, "I respectfully present the draft of this message before You. O God! I pray for Your blessings." After the prayer he realized that he could not use this message. "I was going to preach to the people that the grace of God is sufficient for us. But if anyone would ask me whether the grace of God is sufficient for me, I would definitely have to say no because I still have my temper and pride. If the grace of God is not sufficient for me, how can I say to people that it is sufficient for them? I cannot say that." It was Saturday, there was no time to prepare for anything else, and he did not have the choice not to preach. Confronted with this difficult situation, he knelt down and prayed again, "O God! Today let Your grace be sufficient for me. May this become my own experience. I have been proud, jealous, lustful, and filled with unclean thoughts. Make me overcome all these if Your grace is truly sufficient for me." He prayed the whole afternoon, but it seemed the more he prayed, the further God was away from him. Later he became tired and walked from his desk to the side of the fireplace for a rest. There on the wall by the fireplace hung a verse saying, "My grace IS sufficient for you." Immediately he became clear that the grace of God is not "going to be sufficient for me," nor "awaiting to be sufficient for me," but rather it "is sufficient for me." He did not need to ask God to give him sufficient grace; God's grace was sufficient for him. He jumped to his feet and said, "The grace of God is sufficient for me. Why do I have to pray?" This is faith, and this is also a revelation. He said, "Thank God, for many years I always anticipated sufficient grace from God. On that day God revealed to me that His grace is sufficient. I came to a great turning point in my life." The next day he was exceptionally powerful. Later in the Keswick Convention, he gave many messages and helped many people. Someone asked him how he became the way he was. He answered that he had seen the sufficiency.</P><P>There are many people who pray for death with Christ, but God says that in Christ we are dead. There are many who pray for resurrection and ascension, but God says that in Christ we are resurrected and ascended. There are many who pray to overcome the world, but the Word of God says that the victory which has overcome the world is our faith (1 John 5:4). Everything is in Christ. We must see this in order to believe. Suppose there is a brother or a sister here who has seen the objective truth. They may not have seen many things, but as long as they see one verse and truly believe in it, they can walk in the path before them. Many people make blind requests to God. Have you heard of sinners asking the Lord to die for them? Once when I was preaching the gospel, I heard someone pray in this way: "O Lord! I am a sinner. I ask that You die on my behalf." This prayer is wrong. There are many people who pray for the Lord to die for them or that they would die together with the Lord. This is utterly a joke. The mind is really useless. We must believe in God's Word more than our circumstances, feelings, trials, sins, lusts, and unclean thoughts. If we can do this, we definitely will be different. It is not enough that we listen. We must have the faith. May we see that God has accomplished everything in Christ.</P><P>However, we have to know that merely believing like this is not enough. The one thing that has to follow is obedience. On the one hand, we must believe. On the other hand, we must obey. Our self-will must be subdued, and we must present every member to God. Brothers and sisters, after we have a living faith, day by day we have to learn to obey God. Whenever God touches us on a certain point, and instead we want God to go along with us, we are not obeying God. Whenever our will is not subdued, we are unable to believe God. A sinner who does not repent cannot believe. Likewise, a believer who willfully does not obey cannot believe.</P><P>Some have many things stored in their houses. Some are hesitant to consecrate their children. Some do not have a right attitude towards their husbands. Some do not exercise proper stewardship of their money. Have you consecrated yourself to God? Are you willing to go wherever God sends you? If God wants you to do the most trivial job, are you willing to do it? Brothers and sisters, believing alone cannot keep you walking on the path ahead. Perhaps God wants you to obey immediately after you have believed, or He may wait a little while before He asks you to obey. With some people the Lord wants them to obey Him first, and then He gives them the faith. With other people God first gives them the faith, and then He demands obedience. With still others God gives them faith and at the same time demands their obedience.</P><P>I do not know what the Lord requires from each one of us. But I know that there is a great lack if we only have one of these two aspects. Anyone who has not presented his body to God and thinks that believing alone is sufficient is like an unturned cake. May we see that we must obey God. We must pass this step in a specific way. This is a hurdle. In order to be God's stewards, we must have a specific starting point. There must be a point at which we say to God, "From today on, I offer myself to You." There must be a specific dealing this way. There must be a time when we say to God, "From now on I offer You my time, my mind, my money, my family, and my all." God touches everyone in a specific way. With some, God touches them on one point; with others, God touches them on another point. Many times God's demand appears to be harsh and severe. But whatever God demands of us, we must obey. God wants us to prove that we will obey Him. Nothing is more precious to Him than Isaac. It is not enough just to say verbally, "I offer Isaac as a sacrifice." We must present Isaac as an offering in reality. If we do this, we will see the lamb God has prepared. God is not satisfied until we have fully obeyed. We must experience specific dealings with the Lord.</P><P>We have an American friend who was once in China. His faith is truly great. The way the Lord led him to advance spiritually was as follows: He had a master's degree, but he continued working in the university toward a doctorate of philosophy. He was a pastor and studying philosophy at the same time. He felt something wrong with his spiritual life, and he prayed to God, "I have a great deal of unbelief on many occasions. I cannot overcome some sins, and I do not have the power in the work." For two weeks he specifically prayed for God to fill him with the Holy Spirit. He wanted to acquire the victorious life and power spoken of in the Bible. God told him then, "Do you really want this? If you really do, two months from now you should not take the examination for the doctorate of philosophy. I have no use for a doctorate of philosophy." He felt that this was rather difficult. His doctorate of philosophy was something he definitely wanted. It would indeed be a pity if he did not go for the examination. He knelt down to pray and bargain with the Lord. He asked why He would not let him be a doctor of philosophy and a pastor as well. But God never bargains with man. Once God has made a demand, that is the demand. What God has said and commanded cannot be changed. During those two months, he was in considerable turmoil. When the last Saturday came, he was in a real battle. Should he choose the doctorate of philosophy, or should he choose the filling of the Holy Spirit? Is it better to have a doctorate of philosophy, or have a victorious life? If others can earn a doctorate of philosophy and at the same time be used by God, why could he not do the same? He continuously struggled and bargained with the Lord to no avail. A doctorate of philosophy was desirable; the filling of the Holy Spirit was also desirable. However, God would not yield. If he wanted a doctorate of philosophy, he could not live a spiritual life. If he wanted a spiritual life, he could not have his doctorate of philosophy. In the end, he said in tears, "I obey. Although I have studied philosophy for over two years, and for the past thirty some years since my childhood, I have looked forward to a doctorate in philosophy, I have to give up this pursuit for the sake of obeying God." He wrote a letter to notify the school that he was not going to take the examination on Monday. Thus, he forsook his doctorate of philosophy degree forever. The next day he did not have a message on the pulpit because he was very tired from the previous night. So he simply related to the congregation the story of his obedience to the Lord. On that day, three-fourths of the people in the congregation shed tears and were revived. He himself was also very empowered. He said that had he foreseen this result, he would have obeyed God's leading much sooner.</P><P>No one used by the Lord can ever avoid this kind of crisis. If we wish to avoid this kind of crisis, we cannot expect to experience progress in the spiritual life. We must believe and also obey. Not only do we need to obey once, but we must obey continuously. Otherwise, we will come short and be unbalanced. Obedience without faith is powerless. Faith without obedience is idealistic. It is very painful to be obedient without faith. Please remember the scriptural principles for our living: believing and obeying. We cannot believe without obeying or obey without believing. To believe and yet not obey is false belief. To obey and yet not believe is asceticism. Today in the Lord's church, men either err in faith or in obedience. Every failure is the result of a shortage in one of the two or in both. There is either faith without obedience or obedience without faith, or there is neither faith nor obedience.</P><P>If we are willing to believe and obey, we will experience a long-lasting spring and an eternal sunshine. The path of the righteous is like the dawning light growing brighter and brighter until the high noon. May God bless us and make us perfect men before Him, that is, may we be men who will believe and obey. </P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 31</H2><P>Brothers, I have recently felt, more strongly than ever before, that if we want to serve the Lord, we must specifically know the Lord. Many experiences, many gifts, and considerable Bible knowledge cannot present Christ in a living way to people. We must know what He can do for us. Each day we must depend on Him to do what we cannot do, to live a life which we cannot live. Nothing should be out of us, everything should be out of Christ! It is not a matter of what we can or cannot do. It is a matter of what Christ can do. To see this, realize this, and experience this is life, power, and a miracle! Christ is all. Blessed are those who realize this. Only they can lead others to enter into the life of Christ.</P><P>Under God's further shining, I have seen that there is nothing in me but failure. In the last few years, although we have seen God's blessing in many ways, God has still been limited. Many times I waited for the sympathy of the Body or for confirmation in the environment. But in the end, because of our fear of men, these only became snares. Henceforth, may there be "only Christ." May we all be able to say, "Henceforth let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brands of Jesus."</P><P>Many brothers have written to me and asked if and when we are going to have a special conference this year. Let me answer these questions all at one time. For many reasons we will not have time for a conference this fall. Some co-working brothers felt that the dry, clear weather in the fall would be a better time for us to go out to preach the gospel and that it would be a pity to use this good weather for a conference. They felt that since the rainy, windy weather in the spring hinders us from going out to preach the gospel, it would be better for us to use the spring for a conference. Concerning this matter, we now are waiting for God's confirmation in our spirit. If it is according to His will, we may have a conference during this winter vacation. We have not made any decision at this point in time. After we have decided, we will, of course, send forth an open announcement.</P><P>May the peace of Christ be with you all!</P><P>A servant of Christ<br>Watchman Nee, Shanghai<br>October 20, 1933</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE POWER OF PRESSURE</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 31</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:8-10</H1><P>In 2 Corinthians 1:8-10, what did Paul want the brothers to know? He wanted them to know of the affliction which befell him in Asia. What was the nature of this affliction? It was the affliction of being under pressure. To what degree were they pressed by this pressure? They were pressed beyond their power, to the point that they despaired even of living. This was the outward condition. And what was the inward feeling? It was the same. He said that they "had the response of death" in themselves. The final outcome was this: "We should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead; who has delivered us out of so great a death, and will deliver us; in whom we have hoped that He will also yet deliver us" (vv. 9-10).</P><P>We have paid special attention in our Lord's Day morning messages to the principles of spiritual life. Today we will talk about the relationship between pressure and power, or we may say, between compression and power. Brothers and sisters, Christians pay considerable attention to the matter of power. Among spiritual believers, even more attention is paid to the matter of power. They often ask whether or not a certain person has power and whether his power is great or small. Wherever we are, we hear this kind of talk.</P><P>We want to consider the biblical teaching concerning the relationship between pressure, or compression, and power. First I want to say that pressure and power are directly proportional one to the other. Where there is pressure, there is power. If a Christian does not know pressure, he cannot know power. Only those who have experienced the stress of pressure can understand power. The more pressure one experiences, the more power he has, and the more he understands power.</P><P>Before I explain the spiritual relationship between pressure and power, I want to point out their relationship in physical terms, so that we can understand the spiritual principle from physical things. Have you ever seen how water boils on the stove? You must have seen how boiled water is sold in a boiled-water shop. Water is boiled from morning until evening, all year round. The shop is always filled with steam, but the steam is not very useful because it does not have much power. On the other hand, if you look at a boiler on a train engine or ship, you can see an intense fire under the boiler. The water in the boiler is boiling, but the steam cannot easily escape because the boiler is made of very thick steel. The steam is kept inside the boiler and gradually accumulates. Because of the external pressure and the fact that no steam is allowed to escape, the steam is pressurized to become a source of power. When the power of this steam is released through a small hole, it can drive trains and ships forward with great speed. In both cases we have steam. But why is there such a great difference in the power they produce? In the boiled-water shop, the steam is useless, but in a train or a ship, it is useful. In one case the steam is not compressed; it is scattered and, therefore, useless. In the other case the steam is compressed; it is not scattered, and when this compressed steam is released from one outlet, it becomes a source of great power. Brothers, this principle is not only true in physics; it is also true as a spiritual law. Whenever there is no pressure, there is no power. Only pressure can produce power.</P><P>If a Christian wants to understand what power is, he must first understand what pressure is. Pressure or stress was always upon the apostles. They were pressed daily, were under tension daily, and bore heavy burdens daily. Furthermore, they were continually occupied so that they could neither live quietly nor peacefully. This, however, was the means by which God bestowed power upon them. The apostles were pressed so much that their power multiplied to the point that it became unmatched by anyone else. Pressure forced them to rely upon God. Brothers, how much pressure is upon you? You can only measure your power by your pressure. The pressure of the boiler determines the power of the steam. There has never been a believer whose power was greater than the pressure he experienced. If a believer wants to measure how much power he has before God, he should know that his power is only equal to the pressure he experiences. This law is never violated.</P><P>Many times believers pray, "God, please give me power." Do they know what they are praying for? If God responds to their prayer, He will cause them to be pressed, because God knows that the power of life can only be produced from the pressure of life. A life that is pressured is a life that has power. A life without pressure is a life without power. A life with great pressure is a life with great power. A life with a little pressure is a life with little power. The power I am referring to here is the power of life and not the power of anything else.</P><P>Now we want to take a look at some spiritual matters to prove the accuracy of the principle that pressure is power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRESSURE OF SIN</H2><P>I would like to ask the brothers who are sitting here today: how many of you have the clear experience of overcoming sins? Which of you is clear about the law of the Spirit of life setting us free in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death? Are there any among you who have ever dealt with sin and been clearly set free from sin? Why are there only a few Christians who have been set free from sin and overcome sins? Perhaps the reason is that most people do not know how to apply this principle. They do not know how to use the pressure of sin. When sins oppress them, they lapse into despair at this oppression, instead of using this oppression to call on God and look to His deliverance. Many times we have to be oppressed by sin to the extent that we can no longer help or save ourselves, and our inner being can no longer bear or sustain its oppression. At such times, we will find the power to come to God and the power to receive the victory of Christ. Only then will we obtain deliverance.</P><P>Suppose a believer finds himself lying unintentionally from time to time. A little carelessness, and a lie rushes out of his mouth. He will never overcome if he does not feel the evil of lying, if he does not feel the pain of lying, and if he does not realize that he has no strength to fight against his lying and that he is oppressed by his lying. When he tries to overcome this sin, he feels its oppression. Every time he struggles against it, he feels its pressure. Yet he finds himself still speaking untrue things and feels frustrated. When will he be released from sin? Finally, one day he feels that he has to overcome this sin and that if he cannot overcome it, he will not be able to go on. He feels the pressure of this sin and can stand it no longer. The pressure has become so great that the power to overcome it also has become great. At such times, he finds himself with more power to come to God and call on Him. It seems that he has more strength to accept the work of Christ. At such times, he can say to God, "O God! If You do not make me overcome my sins through what the Lord Jesus has done, I cannot go on." If he holds on to God like this, he will have the victory. Can you see this? The pressure of sin brings him the power to come to God and be freed.</P><P>Let me give you another example. Some believers often complain that unclean thoughts go through their mind. They often cannot stop thinking unclean things. They realize that this is not good. However, they never oppose them and never find the strength to pray to God about them. They may have resisted and prayed a little, but they have done so only in a halfhearted and powerless way. Why do they behave this way? The reason is that they have not felt the pressure of sin. As a result, they have no strength to overcome sin. If they thought about this once, twice, a hundred times, and resisted it once, twice, a hundred times, and found themselves failing again and again, confessed to God, and felt the frustration of these failures, they would realize that the pressure of sin is too great, and in the end, they would not tolerate it even for five minutes. Then they would find the faith and power to overcome their sins. At ordinary times, they may feel that their faith is powerless. But when they feel the mounting pressure, they find strength in their faith. At ordinary times, they may find themselves powerless to resist. But when the pressure becomes great, they find that they have the strength to resist. Please remember that pressure produces power. May we turn all the pressure that we encounter in our daily life to power, so that we can advance forward. Please remember that a powerful believer does not have any more power than we have; he only knows how to use the pressure that is put upon him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRESSURE OF NEED</H2><P>There is a brother who asked me why his prayer was not answered. I answered that it was because there was no pressure. He then asked why pressure was necessary? I replied that prayer can be answered only when there is pressure. I often ask the brothers if God has listened to their prayer. They frequently answer, "After I pray for something three or five times, I forget about it." Why do they forget? They forget because they do not feel the pressure of the need. It is amazing that most people are like this. If you forget, you cannot blame God for also forgetting. If you just pray a few words in a halfhearted way, God surely will not accomplish it for you. Many prayers are like a composition. It would be better if you did not pray these prayers at all. Many prayers have broken the first principle of prayer. No wonder these prayers are not answered. What is the first principle of prayer? It is not faith. It is not promise. It is need. Where there is no need, there is no prayer. Therefore, in order for God to answer your prayer, the first thing He has to do is put a need within you. The first thing God will give you is pressure. By this you will feel a need and realize that you have to go to God. Then you will receive His answer.</P><P>John Knox was a person who prayed effectively. Queen Mary of England once said, "I do not fear the whole army of Scotland, but I fear John Knox's prayer." How did John Knox pray? He said, "O God! Give me Scotland, or I die!" Why did he pray this way? He prayed this way because the pressure in him was great. The pressure was so great that he could bear it no longer. He had such a pressure in his heart that he had to utter such a prayer. Today the churches in Scotland remain the best churches in the whole world.</P><P>You may not understand why Moses prayed, "Yet now, if thou wilt forgive their sin-; and if not, blot me, I pray thee, out of thy book which thou hast written" (Exo. 32:32). Moses prayed this way because he had a need. He was pressured by this need to such an extent that if God would not save Israel, he would rather be blotted out. That is why God listened to his prayer.</P><P>It was the same with Paul. He said, "For I could wish that I myself were a curse, separated from Christ for my brothers, my kinsmen according to the flesh" (Rom. 9:3). If Israel could not be saved, he would rather lose his own salvation. These were not just words on his lips, nor were they an outburst of his emotion. The pressure of a need gave him such a feeling. Many times people imitate the prayers of others, but there is no power, and the prayers are useless. This is because there is no pressure. Has anyone ever prayed, "God, if You will not answer me, I will not rise up"? If you have such feelings, and you utter such words, God will surely answer. Perhaps some will go home and say the same words. That is not what is important; what is important is to feel the pressure.</P><P>There was a very good believer in Tsinan. He had a brother who always opposed and ridiculed him in his school class. Last year when I was working at his school, I talked with the unbelieving brother, but he would not believe. His brother used to testify about the Lord very often on the campus and help many others. But one time he stopped testifying and the smile left his face. Another believer told me about his situation when I was there. They were afraid that he was discouraged and backslidden, and they hoped that I could render him some help. Although I met with him several times, he would quickly walk away after we exchanged a few words. I was surprised that he was trying to avoid me. In a conversation with another believer, I was told that there was nothing wrong with him except that his brother had not yet been saved. He would no longer testify unless his brother was saved. The conversation was concluded with the comment: "Although this is what he said, I wonder if there is some other hidden reason." After our last meeting, I talked with the discouraged brother again. I asked him what was the reason for his recent behavior. He answered, "If God will not save my brother, I will never testify of the Lord again." Then I realized that he had a special burden for his brother and was greatly pressured. There could be only two reasons for his situation: either the enemy had deceived and discouraged him from working and advancing, or God intended to save his brother. If God had given him this pressure and was causing him to pray in such a desperate way, his brother would surely be saved. But the pressure on him was too great; he could not get through. That is why he had this kind of reaction. Immediately after I returned home, I received a letter from another brother at that school, telling me that this person's brother was saved. Not long after I left, the unbelieving brother had become very sick. Then he decided to receive the Lord, and he recovered from his illness.</P><P>We can realize a principle from this brother's experience. Before God listens to our prayer, He always puts a great pressure on us so that we have to pray. At first we did not have the power to pray. But with pressure, we can pray. The stronger the pressure is from God, the more powerful our prayers will become. Therefore, let us learn the lesson that pressure produces power. The purpose of pressure is not to oppress us, but to afford us the opportunity to turn it into power. Now we can understand why God listens to some prayers, but not to others. We can understand why God listens to prayers concerning big things, but not to prayers concerning small things. Why does God listen to your oppressed prayer when someone you love, either a friend or co-worker, is very sick? Why does God not immediately answer your prayer when you have a headache, flu, or cut? As I have said before, every prayer that does not touch you can never touch God. This is altogether a problem of power, and power is always determined by pressure.</P><P>Why does God allow difficult things, unsolvable things, and unavoidable things to happen to us? The only reason that God allows these things to come to us is so that we will use the pressure to gain the power to seek for God. Our failure lies in the fact that we do not know how to turn our pressure into power. We know that all pressures have a purpose. We do not have to wait until we are pressed beyond measure before we begin to pray. We have to learn to pray with pressure and without pressure. However, if there is pressure, we should turn it into power. If we turn every pressure into power, we will see that pressure comes for the purpose of manifesting God's power of resurrection. No power is greater than the power of resurrection. If we are pressed, and things are hopeless on all sides, we will clearly feel the power of resurrection rising up within us. If I were to ask how many times our prayers were answered during our lifetime, every one of us could recall at least some prayers that have been answered. Why were those prayers answered? Is it not because the pressure was too great, that we were not able to get through, and that we poured out our hearts to God and He listened? Perhaps we had never fasted before that time. But on that day we found that we had to fast. We felt that we were forced to come to God. We found that prayer was no longer a burden, but the removal of a burden.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRESSURE OF ENVIRONMENT</H2><P>Not only is there the pressure of sin and the pressure of need; there is also the pressure of environment. God wants the believers to go through pressure on earth so that they may lead a proper life. There are many adverse events that happen from time to time in a believer's environment. Sometimes difficulties come from within the family. At other times they come from friends outside the family. Sometimes it is a business that has gone bankrupt. At other times one may suffer a loss in business, discrimination from colleagues, oppositions and misunderstandings from others, or financial difficulties. Why do these things happen? Many people do not realize the preciousness of the regenerated life they have received. Although they are saved and regenerated, they do not know the preciousness of the regenerated life. Only after they are pressed do they realize that the regenerated life, the new life they have received from God, is able to overcome all of the environment. Every pressure in the outside environment is for the purpose of proving the reality and power of the regenerated life. The Lord puts us in adverse circumstances in order to show us that we cannot stand without His life. The power of His life is manifested through outward pressure. If we encounter something which pierces us with heart-searing pains, causing us to weep silently with no way to comfort ourselves or get through the matter, and we trust in God at these times, we will experience complete victory. We will be amazed at the great power we have which enables us to overcome. This is because the outward pressure will cause us to spontaneously trust in God, which results in a demonstration of the reality of the power of His life. Of course, an unbeliever who does not have the regenerated life will not be able to go through this adverse environment; he will surely be pressed down by this outward pressure. But a Christian is a regenerated person, and within him there is a life which is stronger than the outward pressure. He knows that the times when he is pressed are the times when he overcomes. The pressure in the environment only manifests the regenerated life within him.</P><P>I once read an English tract entitled, "Be a Gas Engine." It told the story of a particular man in the city of Pittsburgh in the United States. There, everyone was using gas lamps. The owner of the gas factory was a Christian. One time he ran into much adversity. His customers frequently wrote letters of complaints about trivial matters. Those who did business with him opposed him and would not even give him the normal courtesies due him. He prayed to God for strength to overcome all of these. But after his prayer the situation became worse. One day a worker came and told him, "Today every machine in the plant stopped running. We cannot find the reason, and we do not know what the problem is. You need to go look for yourself." He had no choice but to go and look. After checking, he found out that there was nothing wrong with the engine except that the valve of the boiler had been damaged. Without pressure, the steam could not be utilized, and every machine stopped running. At that moment he heard a small voice saying to him, "You need to be a gas engine." He told people afterwards, "As the donkey spoke to Balaam, this gas engine spoke something to me that day. I thank and praise God." He went on to say, "If the valve is bad, there is no pressure. If there is no pressure, none of the gas lamps in the city can be lit. Pressure makes every gas lamp shine. I should not reject any pressure. Instead, I should be a gas engine."</P><P>Brothers, the power of life in a person can never be greater than the pressure he can bear. There was a brother among us who would not bow to worship his ancestors in his wedding. His uncle had found him a job in a bank, but due to his refusal to worship his ancestors, he was not given the position. We all felt sorry for him, but this incident only showed how much power was really within him. If I can remain standing after someone has pushed me, this indicates how much power is within me. The outward push only manifests the inward power. The power manifested within is as great as the pressure from without.</P><P>The Bible tells us not only of the fact of resurrection, but also of the principle of resurrection. The Lord Jesus was raised from the dead; this is a fact. But there are also many teachings about resurrection, such as knowing the power of resurrection. These are the principles of resurrection. Therefore, resurrection is not just a fact, but also a principle that should be proven in our lives. The principle of resurrection is based upon the fact of resurrection. Originally, there was a man whose body was crucified and then made alive. He died and was physically buried, yet He was raised from the dead. The bondage of death had no power over Him. In Him there was something more powerful than death. He has passed through death and still lives; He is not touched by death. The principle of resurrection is to pass through death and still live.</P><P>If there is a brother who is naturally very patient, gentle, and kind, he has only his natural virtues. God will allow his friends, relatives, and co-workers to oppress him, pierce him, take advantage of him, and hurt him until, being unable to contain himself, he will lose his temper. Then he will realize that his natural virtues are inadequate because they cannot pass through death. This is a great test. If he will lift up his head to God at these times and say to Him, "God, my patience has run out; manifest Your patience in me," he will be amazed to find patience in the midst of all the death situations. This is resurrection. Resurrection is for God's life to pass through death and still live. Everything natural encounters death and does not resurrect. Everything of God passes through death and still lives. Many people do not know what is of themselves and what is of God; they do not know what is of the flesh and what is of Christ, what is old and what is new, what is natural and what is of resurrection. This is why God allows death to come upon them, so that they will realize how much of what they have is able and how much is not able to pass through death. Only then will they know resurrection. Why does God allow pressure to come upon you? The only reason is to show you that everything you think you can do and everything you think you can endure or withstand will disappear and fail. You will be pressed to such an extent that you can only say, "God, I can stand it no longer. My power has run out. Manifest Your power in me." God wants you to be pressed to such an extent that the pressure produces the power. By then the pressure will not only become the strength for you to call on Him, but will become the factor that ushers in the power of God's work.</P><P>The Lord had this same experience. He said, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit" (John 12:24). May we know Christ and the power of His resurrection more deeply day by day. The goal of Paul's life was the same. He did not consider himself as having already obtained or as being already perfected, but he pursued after the power of Christ's resurrection in order to know, that is, experience it (Phil. 3:12, 10). He did not want to know just the fact of Christ's resurrection. In 2 Corinthians 4:8-10 he said, "We are pressed on every side but not constricted [this indicates the outward circumstances]; unable to find a way out but not utterly without a way out; persecuted but not abandoned; cast down but not destroyed; always bearing about in the body the putting to death of Jesus that the life of Jesus also may be manifested in our body." This was Paul's environment and his life. He experienced a great deal of pressure outwardly. At the same time, he experienced a great deal of power inwardly. The outward pressure was for the manifestation of his inward power.</P><P>All of our environment is arranged for us by God. Please remember that whether we are at home, in school, working in an office or in any other place, it is God who has arranged the environment for us. Whether we are in a good environment or an adverse environment, we should remember that God's intention is for us to manifest the resurrection life of Christ. Whether or not we are growing depends on how we deal with our environment. All the things that oppress us are for the purpose of training us in order that we will gain the resurrection life. Who are the ones who have the power? The more we grow, the more power we have. But what does it mean to have greater power and deeper life? It means that we encounter greater pressure and are able to deal with such pressure. If we want to know how deep a believer's life is, all we need to consider is the way he deals with pressure. It is a pity that Christians always want to preserve their natural power. Many times we do not want to die, and we do not want the Lord to die. But if the Lord had not died, there would have been no resurrection. Many Christians wish that there were fewer problems and sufferings. Whenever they encounter upsetting, painful, or mournful things, they ask God to remove them. If we do this, we will only be living, but we will not be resurrecting. If we can only endure the rebuke of ten persons, we may ask God not to give us temptations from more than ten persons. But God may give us the pressure of eleven persons. We may say to God that we can bear it no longer and that we are not able to do what we should. But this is exactly where God wants to bring us; He wants us to be so pressed that our own strength, our natural patience, and our fleshly goodness will not be able to sustain us any longer. Then we can only say to Him, "I can stand no more. Grant me the strength to overcome these things." Then we will see that we are not only able to overcome the pressure from ten persons, but able to overcome the pressure from twenty, and we will receive fresher and greater strength. Therefore, the greater the pressure, the greater the power. If we find ourselves powerless, it is because we have not passed through the discipline of pressure. But we do not have to wait until we are at the end of ourselves before we look to God. As soon as we find the situation too difficult to handle, we should look to God. In this way we will receive the power. Every time we encounter new pressure, we should turn the pressure into power. If we do this time after time, our power will grow.</P><P>God never keeps anything natural; He only wants resurrection. He wants everything natural to go through death and resurrection. God never changes the natural things. He is the God who gives life to the dead and the One who calls things not being as being (Rom. 4:17). To call things not being as being is the creative power of God. To give life to the dead is the resurrection power of God. The God whom Abraham believed is the God who gives life to the dead and calls not being as being. Man wants to keep and preserve his own life, but God does not want such a life. God wants to cast it down. After your life has been cast down by Him, you will say to God, "O God! I cannot do it. I am just like a dead body lying before You." Then God will give you resurrection. This is the secret to life and power. Day by day as you face more pressure, remember that pressure is power. You should not neglect pressure. In the end the greater the pressure you face, the greater the power you have, and you will find yourself overcoming everything and receiving more power.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRESSURE OF WORK</H2><P>Many of God's works have to go through pressure before they will have good results. (The co-workers should pay special attention to this point.) However, few workers have this experience or want to have this experience. If you are a faithful person, you may have had this experience already, and you may very well have more in the future. If you have never had this experience before, you will surely have it in the future. God has to bring all of your works through death. He does not like death, but He has to bring your work through death before it will be in resurrection.</P><P>Some people see many souls being saved at the beginning of their work; they find their work prosperous, and everything goes smoothly. But to their amazement, this condition does not last long. After some time, the initial work stops. The ones who were saved do not seem to grow anymore. Still later, not only is the work stopped, but everything seems to have become cold and dead. They still want to carry on, but nothing seems to work. It appears as if they have lost all power, and they wonder why this is the case. They feel as if all hope is gone. God does not seem to be blessing their work anymore. At these times, God will give the light and search their heart. Then they will realize whether they were for God in the first place or for themselves. They will realize whether they were doing things in competition with others or doing them for God's glory. Who are they working for? When the work is prosperous, they will think they are doing everything for God. But when the work is under pressure, they will realize whether they are working for God or whether their work is mixed with their own element.</P><P>Whoever has had this experience knows that these are the most bitter times. You feel that everything is depressing and deadening. You are pressed to such an extent that you ask, "God, why are things this way? Why is there no one saved? Why are all the believers dead?" You are so pressed that you cannot help but ask what you should do and where you are heading. You see that your past strength is not sufficient to deal with the present environment and that your past experiences are not enough to meet the present needs. God will probably show you that at the time of prosperity, you were self-contented and self-satisfied; you were secretly harboring spiritual pride and were zealous for your own glory. You loved to compete with others, and many things were done for the sake of men and not for God. It is only right that your work pass through death. Then you will realize that pressure in your work is very profitable to you.</P><P>Moses had to understand what circumcision was before he could work. Before he became the bloody husband, God wanted to put him to death. God cannot allow the flesh to be mixed in with His work. God wants you to be pressed to a point that you will not care if the work dies, if anybody is saved, or if all the brothers are dispersed. This is because the work and everything else belongs to God, not to you. Then you will say, "As long as God glorifies His own name, it is all right if He casts everything down or allows everything to go wrong." In this way you will pass through death. This is the most important principle in God's dealing with His workers. After this God will once again put the burden of the work on you in a clear way. But it will be totally different. Previously, the work belonged to you, and you did it because of your interest in it. Now the work belongs to God, and your interest is not a matter of importance. The work is God's, and He should take the credit; you should not take it. Under these circumstances, you will ask God to give you the strength to fulfill His work in the darkest and dullest hour. You will be pressed, but you will ask God to revive His work. Soon you will find new changes, and a prosperous situation will return! But then you will see clearly that it is not you, but God who is working. This pressure will grant new power to accomplish your work. Previously, it was you who worked. Now it is God who works. God has brought your work through death and has turned it into something in resurrection. After you pass through this, you will see that nothing can stop your work.</P><P>But unfortunately many of God's workers are not willing to put themselves in His hand. If you are faithful and obedient, you will surely suffer great pressure. There will not be an easy day for you. Someone asked a brother, "How is life in Shanghai? Is it easy? Are there any trials?" He laughed and asked, "Is there anyone that God uses who does not suffer trials and who has an easy life?" The first person had nothing more to say.</P><P>Our power can never exceed the pressure we have. The greater pressure God gives to man, the greater is the power within man. God works through death. If a man has never passed through death, he can do nothing. I am afraid that most people do not put their pressure to the right use. Pressure to them is like the steam in the boiled-water shop; it cannot drive even the smallest car half a mile. During the past two years, I have felt one thing deeply: pressure brings in power. If you have such experience, you will say, "All my power comes from the pressure. The power I have in my contact with others comes from the pressure." In that day when we stand before God, we will realize what pressure our Lord Jesus Christ suffered, what pressure was upon the apostles, and what pressure was upon all those who were very much used by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRESSURE OF THE ENEMY</H2><P>At present many believers do not know the pressure of Satan. The enemy can do many works in our living, environment, and life. Unfortunately, we do not know this. We do not realize why we have many confused thoughts and why there are so many turmoils in our environment. Actually, some of them are allowed by God, while others are the work of the enemy. There was a brother who always had a wandering mind and found it hard to concentrate. He once was tempted to cut his throat and kill himself. When he told me about this, I said to him, "Where does this thought come from? Is it yours? Is it from God? Or is it from the enemy? Surely it is not from God. Therefore, this thought can only come from two sources. If it is not from you, it must be from the enemy. How can you differentiate your thought from that of the enemy? If it is your thought, you must have thought about this matter before." So I asked him loudly, "Have you ever thought about these things? Is the thought yours? Or is there anyone else who thought about it for you and put the thought into your mind? This is a very important principle. Did you think of it yourself, or did anyone think it for you and then put this thought into your mind? Whatever you have thought by yourself is your thought. Otherwise, it is from the enemy." He said, "I have never thought in this way." I said, "Then it must be from Satan."</P><P>We can never be nice in dealing with the enemy. The first one in the world who was nice to the enemy was Eve, the one who brought sin into this world. Some Christians think that we should reason with the enemy. When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, the enemy even testified for Him and said, "Jesus, Son of the Most High God." What did the Lord do? He shut the enemy's mouth. Ordinary believers think that one or two thoughts coming from the enemy do not matter. It is a pity, however, that with many believers, all of their thoughts come from the enemy. Their minds are the thinking machine of Satan; they have been used by the enemy who keeps them thinking all the time. Some believers never learn to discipline their own thoughts. Once we try to learn to control our thoughts, we will realize how hard it is to discipline our mind.</P><P>Concerning our sicknesses, we have to admit that many sicknesses result from breaking the natural laws. However, there are some sicknesses that are from the enemy. Job's sore boils were from the enemy; they did not come because Job neglected hygiene or because he was infected by some uncleanness. I do not mean that all sicknesses come from the enemy. I am saying that some sicknesses do come from the enemy.</P><P>Some people consider everything that a man encounters as from the natural realm. But when Job's house fell upon his children and they were crushed to death, when the oxen and the asses were taken away by someone, and when the sheep were consumed by fire from heaven, were these things accidents? They were all works of the enemy. Therefore, there are many things in our daily life which are oppressions from the enemy. Unfortunately, there are some people who foolishly live with these things and never place a question mark on them.</P><P>Several brothers were passing out gospel tracts on the train one day, and they met a Christian. They began to converse with him. Seeing that his face was filled with sorrow, they asked him why he was so sorrowful. He said, "I am a businessman and have encountered many misfortunes during these few years. Either something happened to my family or something happened to my business. I am really in a terrible state. My situation has gone from bad to worse. I have no way out. So I am prepared to commit suicide. I am taking the train to another place to kill myself." The brothers knew that this was the work of the enemy and said to him, "Do you think that all the things that happened to you during these few years happened accidentally? Or is there someone who secretly arranged these things for you?" He thought and then said, "It seems that someone has arranged all these things behind my back. It seems that there is a hand behind the chessboard moving the pieces step by step." My friends told him that this was the work of the enemy. They told him to resist the enemy, and they prayed together with him. Then he went home peacefully. Later on he wrote my friends a letter, saying, "After I went home, I resisted the enemy daily. I rejected and resisted any work that was from the enemy. Now the situation is being recovered little by little. Thank God that even though I have not obtained complete recovery, I have obtained deliverance."</P><P>I am concerned about the fact that many of us do not resist the enemy. At first the enemy gives us one or two thoughts, but in the end, our whole being, family, and environment will be destroyed by Satan. It is wrong for us to be oppressed and not to resist. We should turn our oppression into a kind of power of resistance. Whenever we find that we can bear it no longer, we should resist then and there, and soon there will be a way out. Many times we find that we have no strength to resist. When we are so pressed that we cannot bear it any longer, a power wells up within us to resist. Therefore, when we are oppressed, we should never consider such oppression to be useless. On the contrary, we should utilize the pressure, knowing that pressure produces power. Let us keep in mind that if we know how to utilize pressure, it will not become an obstacle. In fact, the stronger the pressure, the greater will be the power of resistance.</P><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE GATE AND THE WAY</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 31</H2><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Matt. 7:13-14</H1><P>My purpose today is not to expound Matthew 7:13-14 but to show the kind of way a Christian should take. Matthew 5 through 7 is meant for Christians. I will not delve, however, into the specific lessons that are intended for the Christians because this is not the purpose of my message. I am only borrowing Matthew 7:13-14 as the theme of my message. These two verses touch on two main principles: entering through the gate and walking on the way. There is one extreme of emphasizing only entering and not walking. There is another extreme of emphasizing only walking and not entering. God has put before every Christian both a gate and a way; there is a way, and there is a gate. Without these two things, the Christian life would be unbalanced.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, what does it mean to enter a gate? Entering a gate means passing through a barrier. The gate has a door which acts as a barrier. When you cross it you enter an area where you have not previously been. No matter how big the door may be, crossing and entering takes less than five minutes. In an instant, you are through the crossing, and you will notice a clear difference. There is a big difference between the time before and the time after entering the gate. A few minutes ago you were in one world; a few minutes later you are in another. First you were outside the gate; now you are inside the gate. Entering the gate means experiencing a big difference within a short time; it means crossing the biggest barrier within the shortest time. After this your situation becomes completely different. For example, outside the park all you see is dust and cars; however, once you cross the gate of the park, you immediately experience a different world.</P><P>A Christian must not only cross a barrier, but must also walk on a way before him. The way is long and takes time to cover. Does entering the gate take much time? No, one step is all that is necessary. Does it take more time to enter the gate or to walk on the way? The way takes more time. To enter the gate without walking on the way is not balanced. Once a person enters the gate, he has to advance step by step. To walk means to progress gradually and advance step by step. It only takes one step to enter the gate, but walking is not a one-step work. Rather, it takes a long time for one to walk step by step. Once a person enters a gate, he will notice an obvious difference. Having crossed one barrier, it may take a hundred steps before he needs to cross another barrier. It may take another thousand steps before he needs to cross yet another barrier. The minute a person enters a gate, he has to begin walking.</P><P>To enter a gate means to cross a barrier, and to walk on a way means to make progress.</P><P>Today Christians have many arguments. One group emphasizes crossing barriers, another emphasizes making progress. Some consider entering the gate a super-experience. Others think that there is no need to enter a gate and that there is only a need to walk on the way. Walking on the way is surely a way of making progress, but this alone does not give one a clear separation. Both groups have deviated. We must recognize that we must cross the barrier and walk on the way; we must walk on the way as well as cross the barrier. Entering the gate and walking on the way are two great principles in the Bible. The entering and the walking should receive equal attention from us.</P><P>According to the Bible, the spiritual pathway begins with an entry into a gate and is followed by a walk on a way; that is, it begins with the crossing of a barrier and is followed by a walk. This is opposite to the way of the world. The pathway in the world involves first walking and then entering. For example, you have to walk on Hardoon Road before you can enter through the gate of Wen-teh Lane. But the spiritual pathway is different. The spiritual pathway is more like a palace or an imperial burial ground; there is a huge wall, and a person has to go through a gate. Then he has to walk a long way before he reaches his destination. The Bible often mentions the gate and the way together. I will take the two matters of faith and obedience to show you what is crossing the barrier and what is making progress.</P><P>Faith is the principle by which we walk. In addition, there are two minor principles to faith. Faith is governed by these two minor principles. Faith is both a gate as well as a way. Those with some spiritual experience know that faith has two aspects: believing and trusting. There is a difference between the conduct of faith and the attitude of faith. Our act of believing is the crossing of the barrier, while our continual trusting is the way of progress. The one-time act of believing is what I call entering the gate. The subsequent sustaining of the attitude of faith is what I call walking on the way. If a Christian wants to believe in God in a certain matter, he must first have a one-time specific act of believing; he must have a one-time genuine faith in God before he can walk on the way of faith. Passing a gate of faith is crossing a barrier of doubt, receiving a specific promise from God and believing specifically in such a promise. This is to pass a barrier and enter through a gate. Please remember that a believer must first pass through the gate of faith before he can advance in faith, maintain an attitude of faith, and continually trust in God and walk the way of faith. Many people think that simply maintaining an attitude of faith and trusting in God continually is all that is needed; they think that there is no need to have a specific act of faith initially or to pass a barrier of faith. But whoever does not enter the gate can never walk on the way, and whoever does not pass a barrier can never make progress. There must be a definite break with the past and then a definite acceptance of God's testimony. This is entering through the gate. Otherwise, there will never be spiritual progress. Faith is entering through the gate and then walking on the way.</P><P>Among all the things we believe in, one chief item is the matter of being "in Christ." According to the New Testament teaching, God has saved us and put us in Christ. There is no position higher than this. The forgiveness of sins is in Christ. Justification is in Christ. Sanctification is in Christ. Every spiritual blessing is in Christ. No matter what things there are, they are all in Christ. Being in Christ is higher than any kind of grace. All that God has given to us is in Christ. The big question is how can we be in Christ. Mr. Hudson Taylor yearned for a victorious living. Although he knew that everything is in Christ, he struggled fruitlessly to abide in Christ. It seemed like he was always falling away from Christ. One day God gave him a revelation and showed him that he was in Christ. He did not need to ask how he could be in Christ. He was regenerated; therefore, he was in Christ. What he needed to do was rest on the fact. This is the meaning of abiding in Christ. He was in Christ. He could not be more "in Christ." This was how he gained the victory. This was for him the gate of faith, and he entered this gate. Only after entering the gate this way could he grasp the fact of his being in Christ day by day, and only then could he continuously trust in God in an attitude of faith. Otherwise, even though he believed, his trusting would not be effective.</P><P>Although the words in Christ are short, the truth behind them is quite profound. In fact, it is so profound that it is unfathomable and unsurpassed by anything else. Ephesians 1:3 says that God "blessed us with every spiritual blessing in the heavenlies in Christ." All the blessings are in Christ. Since there are so many blessings in Christ, why do so many people not receive them, even though they seem to have believed? The reason is that they do not realize the two sides of faith. There is the need for the act of faith, and there is the need for the attitude of faith. Many people have believed, but what they have is just the attitude of faith; they do not have the act of faith. In other words, they have never specifically, desperately, and as a one-time act, believed in God's fact. They are misled to think that an attitude of faith is faith. If they would first pass through the barrier of faith and then maintain an attitude of faith, they would experience many blessings in Christ. We have said that the day we pass through the barrier is the day we received everything. We have received everything, but it is another matter whether or not we have experienced everything. When we come into a garden, we can see everything in it. But this does not necessarily mean that we have walked through all the paths of the garden. After we have entered, we still have to claim everything that is ours before we can gain all that is ours. First we enter the gate; then we walk in the way.</P><P>When God ordered the Israelites to pass over the river Jordan, He first said to Joshua, "Now therefore arise, go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people, unto the land which I do give to them, even to the children of Israel. Every place that the sole of your foot shall tread upon, that have I given unto you, as I said unto Moses" (Josh. 1:2-3). Before they passed over Jordan, God promised them the land of Canaan. He only required them to pass over. Did the Israelites have the faith? They did. Those who did not have the faith died in the wilderness. Those who entered into Canaan had the faith. They laid hold of God's word and crossed the river Jordan, saying, "From now on, the land of Canaan is ours. We only need to cross the river to get the land."</P><P>After they passed over the river Jordan, did they gain all the land immediately? Satan was not willing to concede so easily. The wall of Jericho was very high, and the gate to the city was shut tight. If we were there, we would probably go back to God and say, "You said the land of Canaan has been given to us, and we have also crossed the river. But the wall of Jericho is so high, and the gate of the city is shut tight. Could it be that Your words have failed?" But the Israelites were not like this. They went by God's word and laid hold of God's promise. They circled the city once on the first day and did the same thing the next day. This went on for six days. On the seventh day, they circled the city seven times. Then they shouted, believing that the Lord had given them the city, and the walls of Jericho crumbled. After that they gained every city that they passed through. Although they experienced failures and did not chase out the seven tribes of Canaan, they managed to possess most of the cities.</P><P>We ought to lay hold of all the spiritual blessings in Christ by faith in the same way that the Israelites crossed the river and gained the land by laying hold of God's word. This is like a father passing on a title deed to his son before he dies. The son has to locate the land and manage the property according to what is written in the title deed. The property is his, but he has not yet seen it or managed it. He has to examine and manage it according to the words of the deed. Accepting the title deed is an act of faith; it is the gate. Enjoying the content of the title deed is an attitude of faith; it is the progression.</P><P>God says, "Go over this Jordan, thou, and all this people." This is a gate of faith. After passing through the gate, they destroyed city after city; this is to walk on the way. The way of faith is to claim the cities one by one according to His word. If you read the New Testament, you will see that everything in Christ is yours. If you still do not think you have anything, you have not yet passed through the gate of faith. If you have not passed through the gate of faith, you can never walk the path of faith, and your spiritual condition will not advance. It is of no use to merely hear many doctrines on faith. You must pass through a gate, saying, "O God, I thank You! You have given me the land of Canaan; this land is mine." You must lay hold of the title deed to possess the land. Do not simply ask if the land is yours. Claim it because it is yours.</P><P>The first thing to do is to pass through the gate. Take your "title deed" and accept from God the blessings in Christ; this is the gate of faith. You may feel that you have jealousy, pride, and passion and that you lack kindness, humility, and meekness. You may ask the Lord once, twice, even dozens of times to deliver you. However, when the Lord reveals the riches in Christ, you will see how foolish it was to ask for deliverance this way. If God has shown you His Word which says, "My grace is sufficient for you," why do you have to pray anymore? The Lord says, "I am holiness; I am meekness; I am full of all kinds of grace." Everything is in Christ. God has to show you the riches in Christ before you can pass through the gate. After this, you will increasingly experience the grace that is in Christ.</P><P>Mr. Austin-Sparks is a servant much used by the Lord today. The most precious truth to him is "in Christ." The turning point in his life came when the Lord opened his eyes to see the riches in Christ. He showed him that he was a rich man living in poverty, that he had forgotten about the riches in Christ. Brothers and sisters, this is one gate we have to pass. May the Lord open our eyes through the spirit of wisdom and revelation to see the oneness we have with the Lord.</P><P>However, after we have seen the oneness we have with the Lord, does this mean that we will no longer lose our temper or that we will never be jealous again? Does it mean that we will have meekness and love from that point on? The devil will be like the Canaanites; he will block and stumble us all the way. If we do not stand firm in the victory of Christ, we will fail. All those who have not passed the gate of faith will never be able to walk the way of faith. Once God has opened our eyes, we will see the riches in Christ, and the devil will come and tempt, saying, "You say that all the blessings are in Christ. Why then are you still losing your temper and steaming with wrath? You say that all the blessings are yours. Which one do you now have? The revelation you have received is not real; it is just cheating you. You say that God has given you the land of Canaan. Why then is the wall of Jericho so high and the gate shut so tight? How can the seven tribes of Canaan be driven out? All that God has said is false and in vain. Maybe you should return to the east side of Jordan." But crossing the Jordan without encircling Jericho is like entering the gate of faith without walking on the way of faith. Crossing the Jordan without encircling Jericho will never bring down the walls of Jericho. Entering the gate of faith without walking on the way of faith will never result in any spiritual progress. The spiritual experience of every Christian is built on the footprints of faith.</P><P>Satan will never easily loosen his grip on the things we possess. We have heard that everything is in Christ. But after a little while, Satan will say, "You do not have love. You do not have meekness. Nothing is yours." Are we going to say, "Since these are not mine, I will just go home?" No, we should not say that. Instead, we should be like a property owner, claiming our property based on our title deed. We should walk east, west, south, and north all over our land and manage it according to our title deed. There is no need to beg or dispute; just take out the title deed and announce it. This title deed is a sealed document; it has an official seal on it. Satan can do nothing about it. When temptation comes, we should apply the appropriate verses to withstand the temptation. If it is a matter of temper, we should take care of it with the verses that deal with temper. If it is love that we need, we should apply verses that speak about love. Once we find the right verse, we should declare, "God said that this is my property. Therefore, this is my property." We can tell Satan that he is a liar and that he should go away. By faith we should say, "By the grace of Christ, I can be patient and meek." What should go away is our temper, not our faith. What should be removed is the mountain, not our faith. Faith should not bow down and surrender; the temper should bow down and surrender. Faith does not have to move; the mountain has to move. If we stand by faith, no city will be too high for us to bring down. Did the Israelites fight with dozens of wooden staffs? No, they did not need even one wooden staff. They circled the city and went home. Then they circled the city again and went home. They continued this for six days. To the inhabitants of Jericho, this must have been child's play. However, on the seventh day, having circled the city seven times, the Israelites cried with faith, believing that Jericho would surely fall down, and Jericho did indeed fall down.</P><P>Some Christians have crossed the gate of faith but have not walked the way of faith. They may say, "Oh, my temper, my jealousy, my pride, and my lust are still here. What should I do?" At this point please remember that first you must see the riches you have in Christ-this is the gate through which you enter into faith. After the gate, you need to stand firm in your position. When temper comes, you withstand it. When lust comes, you withstand it. When jealousy comes, you withstand it. When pride comes, you withstand it. You should stand firm and declare, "All these should fall down," and they will fall down. Hallelujah, this is a fact! The Israelites encircled Jericho, shouting and believing that the city would certainly fall down. How foolish this was from man's view. But just as Jericho fell at the Israelites' shouting, so will our temper, lust, pride, and jealousy fall at our shouting. To cross the gate is to see that everything is in Christ; this is the first step of faith. You need to lay hold of everything in Christ in the same way that you lay hold of a title deed. It is the devil's work to tell you that once you lose your temper you are done, and your "title deed" is gone.</P><P>Colossians 3:3 says, "For you died." God has shown you that you are dead; you can no longer lose your temper. If you believe this, then you have entered the gate. Satan will come at once, perhaps through your wife, daughter, a student, or someone else, and cause you to lose your temper. Immediately, you will think, "Perhaps the words `for you died' are not a fact to me." If you trust in your feeling, your faith will immediately disappear. Suppose my father has bought a piece of land and has given me the title deed. He has told me to go to a certain place to locate the land and manage it. Suppose I come to the countryside and encounter a ruffian, who asks me, "Sir, what are you doing here?" I say, "I have come to look for my father's land." Suppose he says, "How could this be your father's land? It is my father's land!" If I think that my father's word is not dependable and that it is the other man's land, I will go home. But if I say, "No, my father cannot be wrong; according to the title deed, the land is mine," he will have to leave. Either I go or he goes; one has to go. God has given you the blessings in Christ. The Bible is the "title deed" that God has given to administer the property. It is the "title deed" by which you can exercise your ownership. When you believe in the Bible, Satan will have to leave. Unfortunately for many people, when a little temptation from Satan comes, they toss away God's word and lose their faith. It is not enough to receive God's word once; we must stand firm on His word every time we are tempted. This is to walk on the way of faith.</P><P>Some people may proclaim one day, "I have triumphed over my temper in Christ." But the next day pride comes in. They may think, "Oh no, why is it that yesterday I overcame my temper, but today pride is rising up in me? Could it be that the word in the Bible that says, `For you died,' is not dependable?" No, we have to walk on the way of faith. The Israelites experienced the victory at Jericho. But the very next minute they were defeated at Ai. If we trust in ourselves, we will immediately fail. But if we rely on God's word, we will overcome all the enemies. We must never entertain the thought of living in ease and comfort; we have to deal with our temper, and we have to deal with pride. The battle of faith must go on, and the way of faith must be traveled. Every step on this way must be planted with faith.</P><P>All the principles of spiritual living revolve around crossing a barrier and walking on the way. Previously, I did not realize that all spiritual blessings are in Christ; now I do. This is to cross the barrier. After we cross the barrier, step by step, we have to stand on the word God has shown us. This is to walk on the way. We need to pay attention to both aspects. All those who have not crossed the barrier cannot walk on the way. If a person has crossed the barrier, yet is too lazy to progress in the way, he will not be able to go on and not be able to advance. One must take definite steps, one by one, and must occupy the land, city by city. The enemy will never surrender without a fight. Spiritual warfare is something that we have to experience.</P><P>With the matter of obedience, there is also a gate and a way. One must first enter the gate of obedience, then take the way of obedience. I have met two or three sisters who said to me, "It is very difficult to submit. It seems rather easy for other sisters to submit, but for me to submit is like bearing the hardship of the whole world." I answered them by saying, "Since you have never entered through the gate of submission, how can you walk on the way of submission?" Brothers and sisters, if you have not specifically put down your will and surrendered it to God, if you have not dropped what is precious to you and rejected the things you love, you should not expect to be able to walk on the way of obedience. It is impossible for many people to persuade others to obey the Lord because the ones they are trying to persuade are still outside the gate. You must lead them through the gate first before you can help them obey God in one thing after another and walk on the way of obedience.</P><P>The principal of the Bible school that I mentioned yesterday definitely crossed the barrier when he laid aside his pursuit of a doctorate of philosophy. If anyone asked me, "Who are some that have helped you the most in your life?", I would answer, "He is one of them." By passing the gate of obedience, he has helped many people.</P><P>Brothers and sisters, did you at one time sever yourselves from your past? Did you at one time sever yourselves from your stubbornness? Did you at one time sever yourselves from your pursuit of self-glory? If you have not severed yourselves in this way, you have never walked on the way of obedience because you have not yet entered the gate.</P><P>When Rebekah was asked, "Wilt thou go with this man?", she answered, "I will go" (Gen. 24:58). She then left her father's house. The Psalm says, "Forget...thy father's house; so shall the King greatly desire thy beauty" (45:10-11). In the matter of obedience, Christians are like a girl on her way to the marriage; she must first leave her father's house and protection. After that, she has to ride on a camel and go through the way of the wilderness. After leaving her father's house, she has to take the way of suffering (a camel means suffering). Only by this can Rebekah be a helpmate to Isaac and gain his pleasure. Christians should tell the Lord, "From now on, for Your sake I will drop any person, matter, or object." Otherwise, God may say to you today, "Give this up," and you may respond, "I cannot do this. This is too hard." Tomorrow God may say to you again, "Give that up," and you may respond, "I cannot do that. That is too hard." It will seem that God is always picking on you. This is because you have not left your father's house. If you at one time made a definite decision, you will be able to walk on this way.</P><P>I have often told friends that many Christians have not suffered enough because God has never asked them for anything. There are also many Christians who have suffered much, but are not joyful. This is not good enough. Whenever we suffer, there should be the adequate joy. Many Christians still do not know what God requires of them. Brothers and sisters, if you still do not know what God requires of you, what He expects of you, and how He deals with this or that matter, and if you are still at a loss about everything, you have never entered the gate of obedience. You must tell God in a specific way, "O God, from now on I am putting aside my desire, hope, ambition, and will, and I will cut them off." If you do not do this, God will still not ask anything from you. If they had not been married, Isaac could not have asked anything from Rebekah. If we do not obey God in a definite way, God will never ask us for a penny. If we offer money for our conscience's sake, we are acting from our conscience-God did not ask it of us.</P><P>Please remember one thing: if we hope to walk the way of obedience, we must pass the gate of consecration. Whether we are a brother or a sister, if we have not made any spiritual progress, it is because we have not yet started to walk. It is important that we surrender to God. If we do not pass through the gate, we should not dream that we can walk on the way. We belonged to God when we were redeemed. In our experience, however, our belonging to God begins with our consecration. Has anyone really consecrated themselves to God? Have we obeyed when God touched us concerning certain things? Are we a little afraid when God asks for something from us? Friends, the very thing that we are afraid of may or may not be what God wants from us. But whatever we dare not think about or touch, and whatever we try to dodge, may well be what God is after. God may be speaking to us about these things. Many problems are confronting us, and the Holy Spirit is working in us, but we do not want to think about it. We even try to run away, say something else, think of something else, or read the Bible, hoping that we can escape this kind of voice. Many people are called by God to preach the gospel, but they try to escape. God says to some people, "Your motive towards money is not right." To others God says, "Your relationship with a certain person is not right." To yet another, God says, "Your standing in the church is not right." When God touches them in this way, it is most painful. However, only this kind of touch from God will secure them and bring them the blessing. Do we think that God cannot discern the depths within our heart? We are all naked before God. It is best for us to tell God once and for all in a definite way, "O God, from now on, I belong to the Lord Jesus. From now on, my vision is only on the Lord Jesus. From now on, there is nothing on earth that I desire besides the Lord Jesus." When you do this, you pass the gate of obedience. There is not one good Christian who has not passed through this gate or entered this door. There is also not one good worker who has not passed through this gate or entered this door.</P><P>When you have really entered through the gate, offered yourself, and laid down everything, the Lord will come to test you. The Lord will test you to the point of His satisfaction, to the point that He is assured that you are for Him and to the point that you are also assured that you are for Him. After Abraham crossed the river and entered Canaan, God tested him step by step. Finally, God asked him to offer up Isaac. God wanted to prove that Abraham loved Him. God also wanted Abraham to be assured that he loved the Lord. After you have passed through the gate, there may be something that you like and admire in a hidden way. But if God says to you, "You should give up this thing," you must give it up to be faithful. If you are not faithful, you will try to bypass the cross. Too many Christians are going around the cross. Whenever God wants anything from them, they go around. Therefore, they have a longer way to go. If they are faithful, they will have a much shorter way. If they are not faithful, going around the cross only makes their journey much longer.</P><P>My only purpose today is to show us that with faith and obedience, entering through the gate is always the first step, and walking the way is the second step. We should pay attention to both the gate and the way. If we only emphasize one aspect and have not yet entered the gate, do not ever say, "I have consecrated myself to God." Do not ever hope that we can walk the way. Whether with faith or with obedience, we must first enter the gate and then walk the way. Otherwise, all is vain. We can talk a great deal about the teaching of faith and obedience, but this will be vain talk. We may also hear a great deal about the teaching of faith and obedience, but the hearing will also be in vain.</P><P>May God bless us today and open our eyes to see that for His sake nothing is too difficult, no price is too high, and no offering is too much. Because I believe in Him, I will enter the gate of faith. Because I love Him, I will enter the gate of obedience. Because He is faithful, I will walk the way of faith. Because He has a loving heart, I will walk the way of obedience. The path of the righteous is like the dawning light growing brighter and brighter until the perfect day.</P></body></html>
