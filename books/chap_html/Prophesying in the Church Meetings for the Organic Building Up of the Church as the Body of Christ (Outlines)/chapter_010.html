IN THE CHURCH MEETINGS<br />
FOR THE ORGANIC BUILDING UP<br />
OF THE CHURCH AS THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd" start="25">
<li>A concluding charge concerning our prophesying according to God&rsquo;s standard for the building up of the church:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The six days of the week spent with the Lord in His Word each morning to richly enjoy Christ and to receive His enlightenment gives us the basic content for our prophesying:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Compile the top points at the end of the week from your daily enjoyment, enlightenment, and inspiration.</li>
		<li>Compose a short message as a prophecy, using the points you have compiled.</li>
		<li>Practice speaking that message.</li>
		<li>Prophesy in the meetings of the church using the words of your preparation and practice.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>When we prophesy we must have the instant inspiration of the Spirit; otherwise, our speaking will be mechanical:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Prophesying is not a speaking that is according to the letter but a speaking that is filled with the instant inspiration and the revelation of the Holy Spirit.</li>
		<li>Our prophesying is not to read what we have composed but at the opportune time to speak what we have composed in a living way.</li>
		<li>Our prophesying should not be merely something we have prepared and are speaking to the saints out of our memory; we must follow the feeling we had in fellowship with the Lord and the instant leading of the Spirit as we speak:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>What we speak may not be altogether according to what we have prepared beforehand; rather, as we are speaking a further seeing with new utterance comes, causing our speaking to be fresh and powerful:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Watchman Nee said that we cannot be a good speaker if we do not have the instant utterance.</li>
				<li>2) Andrew Murray said that a powerful and unlimited speaker always has some instant utterance, something new.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>If we only speak what we have prepared as an old foundation, this will not be adequate; every good speaker must look to the Lord for some fresh utterance and some fresh new light.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>When we speak, we must exercise not to use old terminology, but we must look to the Lord while we are speaking that He would give us the timely utterance with the instant view, the instant seeing, the instant inspiration; this will strengthen the spiritual nature of our prophesying.</li>
		<li>Our prophesying should not be mere doctrine gained from a Bible study, but something of a spiritual vision.</li>
		<li>Our prophesying must be organic, that is, living and fresh; otherwise, we may only build up an outward method with a correct practice.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Four additional vital points that must be cared for if we would be able to prophesy properly and adequately:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We must love the Lord, have fellowship with the Lord, live in the presence of the Lord, be joined to the Lord, and be one with the Lord.</li>
		<li>We must labor to learn the truth by studying the Bible and books that expound the Bible, such as, the Life-studies, Recovery Version footnotes, <em>Life Lessons,</em> and <em>Truth Lessons,</em> that we might be saturated and constituted with the Word of God.</li>
		<li>We must have a living spirit and walk according to spirit.</li>
		<li>We must have a heavenly view, a broadened view, a clear view that knows Christ and knows the church, not having our own opinions and viewpoints but rather God&rsquo;s viewpoint concerning His interest on the earth, His Body, the church, the local churches, the individual saints, ourselves, the world situation, the sinners condition, and God&rsquo;s economy; this heavenly view is gained through God&rsquo;s light, His Word, and the experience of Christ as life and the Spirit.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Go to practice prophesying, learn to prophesy, and then perfect others to do the same.</li>
