<p>Calling on the Lord implies a lot. When you open your mouth with the exercise of your spirit to call on the Lord, right away you are under His shining. You are enlightened and exposed. Then you see all your defects, shortcomings, and mistakes. As a wife, you see your mistakes in dealing with your husband. As a husband, you see that the way you deal with your wife is altogether not in the spirit. Then you make a thorough confession of your sins, failures, mistakes, defects, trespasses, transgressions, and wrongdoings. You cannot make such a thorough confession unless you are enlightened in the light of the Lord. Who can be enlightened in the light of the Lord? Only those who call on Him from a sincere and pure heart. This is the initial experience of Christ in calling on His name. Then the Lord will continue to transfuse all His particular riches into your spirit and even into your mind. In this way you will participate in and enjoy the Lord’s riches.<p>All the messages I have passed on to you came to me in this way. If you do not touch the Lord, how can you see His light and receive His revelation? Do not think that all these revelations have come to us just because we studied the Bible thoroughly. I know some who have studied the Bible very diligently, but they only know the Bible according to the letter. In my home town, about sixty years ago, there was a brother who was a Chinese scholar in the Ch’ing dynasty. He was put into prison by the Ch’ing dynasty, and it was there that he got saved. After he was released from prison, he studied the Bible. Eventually he remembered every verse of the Bible, so we called him “the living concordance.” If you wanted to know a verse of the Bible, you could ask him instead of going to the concordance. I knew him. But I can testify before the Lord that this brother who was a living concordance did not have much light. He could not tell you the truth concerning regeneration or the church. If you know the black and white, this does not mean that you know the Bible. The Bible is not just the black and white. The black and white is a conveyer to convey the spiritual, divine, intrinsic reality to us.<p>Paul in Ephesians 6 said that the Spirit today is the word. The Bible must become the word as the Spirit. This means your Bible must be one with the Spirit. Your Bible is the Spirit, and the Spirit is your Bible. How can we get this? There is no other way except by calling on the Lord, by touching the Lord daily and moment by moment. If we are all such persons living in the presence of the Lord by calling on Him, by praying to Him unceasingly day after day and hour after hour, we will be the reality of the fulfillment of the typology in 1 and 2 Kings.<p>This is my strong burden I would fellowship with the elders. Every local church needs this. Do not invent many formalities. You yourself should practice calling on the Lord. You yourself should practice pray-reading the word as the Spirit. You need to practice the unceasing prayer. You need to practice never quenching the Spirit, but rather, fanning the Spirit all the time into flame. You need to practice not despising any prophesying. You elders should take the lead to practice this. First, you be the model. Then your practice in such an intimate way with the Lord will influence the saints in your church. Especially as elders, you can exercise much influence over the members of the church.<p>Probably after about one year, your church will become a model. When we talk to people about the vision we have seen, they will say, “Where is such a church?” Then we can say, “I’ll bring you to one so you can see the model.” This is what we need now. I do not believe that we need further revelations. We have seen enough. The urgent need today is the practice of a kind of living that belongs to God-men, and the God-men are the very components of God’s economy.<p>All the elders and co-workers should pursue this reality so that they will be made into a model by the Lord, a model living in the economy of God. Then they and their churches will become such a model. In my prayer, this is what I call the genuine revival. There are over two hundred churches in the United States. Just in Southern California alone, there are fifty churches. If all these churches would be such a model, that would be a prevailing testimony.
