   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WISDOM AND JUSTICE OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The kingdom is also related to the wisdom and justice of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The kingdom proves both the wisdom and the justice of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Without the kingdom, God s wisdom and justice cannot be proved to the fullest extent.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Also, apart from the truth concerning the kingdom, it is very difficult to solve the debate between Calvinism and Arminianism.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Calvinists stress eternal security, while the Arminians stress that one can lose his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For many generations these two groups have been quarreling and debating.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Both of these sides have their points.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Calvinists can point out many passages which prove eternal security.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Arminians, however, will bring up other passages, such as Hebrews 6 and 10, which seem to indicate that a person can be saved and then fall and be lost again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without the kingdom truth, these two extremes can never be reconciled.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no doubt that once we have been saved, we are saved forever.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our salvation is eternally secure.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But on the other hand, besides God s salvation there is God s wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is the truth concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In addition to salvation there is the matter of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Today the kingdom is an exercise for us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After we were saved, God set the kingdom before us as an exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In a sense, we are born in God s home, but we are exercised in God s kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The home is a place for birth and enjoyment, but the kingdom is a place for exercise and responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After we have been regenerated, we must be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The home is the place to enjoy grace, but the kingdom is the place to exercise responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should not take one and neglect the other.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have to take the grace, and we also have to take the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have to take the home, and we also have to take the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We enjoy and share in the home by partaking of the grace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We share in the kingdom by being exercised to take the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today, in the church age, the kingdom is an exercise to us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the age to come, the millennium, the kingdom will be a reward to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we exercise well today, the Lord will reward us at that day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not exercise well today, we will lose the reward of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By this the wisdom of God is proved, and the justice of God is maintained.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Salvation is eternal; once we gain it, we will never lose it John 10:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we may suffer the loss of the kingdom reward, though we will still be saved 1 Cor 3:8, 14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Besides eternal salvation there is the matter of the kingdom, which requires our exercise in this age to be a reward to us in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>THE EXERCISE OF THE KINGDOM</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We need to read a number of passages which indicate that in addition to salvation there is the exercise of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First Corinthians 3:12-15 says, But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble, the work of each will become manifest; for the day will declare it, because it is revealed by fire, and the fire itself will prove each one s work, of what sort it is.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If anyone s work which he has built upon the foundation remains, he will receive a reward; if anyone s work is consumed, he will suffer loss, but he himself will be saved, yet so as through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These few verses show clearly that if we exercise properly, we will receive a reward, but if we do not exercise properly, we will suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It does not mean that we will lose our salvation but that we will suffer a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Both the reward and the loss are something in addition to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once we receive salvation, we have it eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But besides salvation there is the matter of the reward or the loss.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must realize that after we are saved, we are put into the kingdom to be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because we are born again, we must be under the rule of the heavenly kingdom, under the heavenly government.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>For this exercise, there will be a reward or a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is no problem concerning salvation, but there is a problem concerning the exercise.</S>
