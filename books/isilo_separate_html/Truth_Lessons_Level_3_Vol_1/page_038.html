As the Beloved of God the Father</h2><p>According to the biography of Joseph recorded in the Bible, he was altogether perfect, without defect. Joseph is the perfect one in the Old Testament, and Christ is the perfect One in the New Testament. Hence, Joseph is the perfect type of Christ. Genesis 37:3 says that Israel loved Joseph more than all his sons. The Gospel of Matthew also records that after the baptism of the Lord Jesus and at the time of His transfiguration, God the Father declared, saying, &ldquo;This is My Son, the Beloved&rdquo; (3:17; 17:5). This indicates that according to what Joseph was, he typifies Christ as the Beloved of God the Father.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> </body></html>
