   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A NEW HYMN THE MEANING OF HUMAN LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another new hymn for this gospel campaign is The Meaning of Human Life :</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God made man a vessel he</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With a spirit, soul, body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God to man his content be</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That through man His glory see.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Man does have God s image true,</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Noble in his status, too.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But God s life man also needs</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Divine nature to receive.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ in death as God expressed</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Man redeemed, His blood was shedd st.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In His resurrection He</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Enters us our life to be.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man without Christ will perceive</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That all things are vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Human life is meaningless</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Without hope or purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But when man takes Christ as life,</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He s in spirit born anew.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When he daily lives by Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Vanity is turned to song.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, man can God express</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That the whole world he would bless.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Living water flowing out</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>People s thirst to satisfy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When in glory Christ returns</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Glorified our body be</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To His glorious body conformed</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With Him for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to know a hymn, we first need to learn to pay attention to its special features.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes only a few lines or stanzas of a hymn are good, or perhaps only a certain part is outstanding.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, the hymn The Meaning of Human Life has seven stanzas, but stanzas 4 and 5 are the best.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Stanza 4 speaks about man s sense of vanity and emptiness, and stanza 5 speaks about man s experience of joy and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we preach about the meaning of human life, we need to speak about man s sense of vanity and emptiness on the negative side and man s experience of joy and satisfaction on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Stanza 4 is the peak of this hymn on the negative side.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It does not merely say that all things are vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Rather, it says that man perceives that all things are vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Vanity is not a doctrine or a theory that convinces people in their mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Vanity is a feeling of human life and the conclusion of human experience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, this stanza repeatedly uses the word without to intensify the feeling of vanity.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>On the other hand, stanza 5 is the climax of this hymn on the positive side, describing the human life of vanity being turned into song.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the human life is full of joyful singing, it is full of song.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These two stanzas comprise a complete gospel message.</S>
