   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Thank the Lord that in these recent years so many have been rescued and delivered to a certain extent from religion.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Yet we still have a certain amount of religion within us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By all these verses we may see that the Lord Jesus has nothing in His mind and heart but Himself and His church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have been greatly distracted from Christ and the church by so many religious things, political things, matters concerning the sound faith and how to interpret the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Years ago, the interpretation of the Bible was my favorite occupation and a real temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a person came to me with one verse, I would expound fifty to him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if you come to me today with a verse, I will reduce your verse to nothing but the living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Forget about the interpretation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sometimes the dear saints ask when the Lord Jesus will return.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All I can answer is simply that He will return.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes they ask what the signs of His coming are.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All I can say is that the signs are simply the signs.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Would you be willing to forget about all this and care only for the living Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether He comes today or tomorrow, with this sign or with that sign, it matters little.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just care for Christ; then you will be ready for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Whenever a person asks concerning any matter, I would eventually say, "What think ye of Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Look at Christ today.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is the exalted One!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was God in the beginning, who was incarnated and passed through all the human living on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He experienced crucifixion and resurrection and was raised to the peak of the universe in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now, after His ascension, He is here as the Spirit of life and power, moving on this earth to establish His churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the Son of man walking in the midst of all the local lampstands.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is here among us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is the very thing for which we must care.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He cares for the growth in number in the local churches, and He cares even more for the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He would say to us, "Do not be foolish like the chief priests, elders, Pharisees, Herodians, and Sadducees.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Forget all the things they cared for, and concentrate on Christ and the church."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we don't understand some passage of the Bible, we simply don't understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We don't care for the mere understanding of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we don't know what portion or chapter is the greatest in the Bible, we simply don't know.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We don't care merely for knowing that.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But we know that Christ is there and Christ is within us and Christ is among us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Oh, we care for the ascended Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is not only the Son of man, but also the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He is not only the seed of David, but also the root of David.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why is it then that in the local churches we are dealing with the Bible all the time, we are pray-reading the Bible continually?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not merely for learning or understanding anything, but for eating Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Yet in our meetings there is still some element of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why are we so careful about keeping a certain kind of good order?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is because we are still religious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You may argue that the Apostle Paul tells us to do everything decently and in order.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the very fact that you mention this exposes the religion in you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Try your best to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I would like to hear and see you speak freely in your meetings about nothing but Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Just come to the meeting in the spirit and feel free to say something about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Feel free to present Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Feel free to minister Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Just feel free don't be so careful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some of you have been careful for years.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I am afraid that at least a few of your hairs have turned gray by being careful in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Would you be willing to forget about being careful and just be free with Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Come into the meeting and be free with Christ, not in a sloppy way, but livingly in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you read through the entire Book of Matthew you will see that the Lord Jesus, while He was on earth, was not once careful concerning the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From the time He came to be baptized by John the Baptist He cared nothing for it nor was He ever careful concerning religious sensibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the contrary, He always acted in human eyes so roughly and wrongly.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He did it purposely to impress His disciples never to care for anything religious, but only for Christ and His church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I would advise you to read and to pray-read chapters 21 and 22 of Matthew five times.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You will see how the Lord Jesus was absolutely outside of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He cared only for Himself and His building, the church.</S>
