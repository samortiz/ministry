   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Though Christianity has spread all over the world, not a soul can say that his eyes have actually beheld Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is a startling fact that, though Christianity has such a place on the earth, Jesus is concealed from the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Brothers and sisters, does the wonder of it not strike you?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do you believe in the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You say, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Do you love the Lord Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You say, "I do."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The heathen may ask you, "Where did you meet Him?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And not only will they raise questions, you yourself will raise questions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I remember when, over twenty years ago, I used to wonder if I had been deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I loved Jesus intensely, I believed in Him heartily; but I had never seen Him.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Had I perhaps come under the influence of men?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How could I love someone I had never seen?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>How could I believe in someone my eyes had never beheld?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I began to doubt.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But the astonishing thing was this just as I was questioning, I fell on my knees and prayed, "O Lord Jesus, You are too good; You are too lovable; You are too trustworthy."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And even while I was kneeling in prayer, this mind of mine was still saying, "Perhaps I've been deceived.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Where is Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Have you ever seen Him?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But, all the while my mind was questioning, my heart was saying, "O Lord Jesus, how I thank You!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You died for me on the cross, and now You are in heaven as my Mediator, and Your Holy Spirit is within me."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Just see those two streams of life the outer man doubting, the inner man praying!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Is it not surprising that often both of these experiences are simultaneous?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now, why have I spent so much time elaborating this one point?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>So that God's children may see that in all His intercourse with us, in all His activity in our lives, His ways are in keeping with His disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Just as we, in our intercourse with our friends, inevitably act in accordance with our dispositions, so God, in all His relations with us, is true to His disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>And what is His disposition?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a disposition that hides itself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is very active and yet very hidden; He is truly present and yet so concealed that you can be totally unconscious of His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If at any time you become aware of Him, He will change His activity and that awareness will go.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our Lord Jesus had close intercourse with His disciples for three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Little by little He made Himself known to them until they began to realize that He was a man indwelt by God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>How they appreciated Him then!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They looked at Him, they touched Him, and one of them even reclined on His breast.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Just as they really thought they possessed Him, however, He broke in with these startling words: "I go away"!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They were all deeply distressed.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Formerly they had not known Him; now they knew Him, now they appreciated Him, now they prized Him; and now just as they thought they really had Him forever He spoke of leaving them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How could He?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But listen to what He said: "It is expedient for you that I go away."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>His disciples were more perplexed than ever.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"Expedient for you that I go away"?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yes, "expedient...for if I do not go away, the Comforter will not come to you."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Who is He?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"He" is still "I."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"I am going away and I am coming to you."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>"I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you" John 14:18, 28; 16:5-16 .</S>
