Exhibiting That God Desires Mercy</H2><P>The Lord Jesus told the Pharisees God desires mercy and not sacrifice (Matt. 9:10-13). His human living exhibited that God desires mercy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Proclaiming God's Acceptable Year of Jubilee</H2><P>A jubilee is the biggest release, the biggest liberation. In the Old Testament, the Israelites could have only one jubilee every fifty years (Lev. 25:8-17). Fifty is a number of fullness in people's age. This indicates that the longer we live, the more we become bound and imprisoned. A newborn babe is not bound or imprisoned by anything. But as he gets older he becomes more and more bound and imprisoned. This is why we need a jubilee. God is merciful, and God desires to bring His people into a jubilee, a time of liberation. When the jubilee comes, everyone&#151;old and young, male and female, strong and weak&#151;is released unconditionally and without exception. In His human living Christ proclaimed God's acceptable year of jubilee through the words of grace proceeding out of His mouth (Luke 4:19-22a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Under the Anointing of the Holy Spirit<br>and the Divine Power with the Presence of God</H2><P>Acts 10:38 says that Jesus was anointed with the Holy Spirit and with power and that He went about doing good and healing all those who were oppressed by the devil, for God was with Him. In His human living, He was the Son of God anointed with the Holy Spirit, and He was with the presence of God the Father. Here we can see the entire Divine Trinity moving in the man Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. To Declare the Triune God in Doing Good</H2><P>He declared the Triune God in doing good. The good things He did were a display of His virtues saturated with God's attributes to declare the Triune God under the anointing of the Holy Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. To Show People the Power of God</H2><P>He did many miracles under the anointing of the divine power to show people the power of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. To Heal the People Oppressed by the Devil</H2><P>He fought down the evil one to release his captives, healing the people oppressed by the devil. On the one hand, Christ in His humanity did many good things, expressing God's attributes in His virtues. On the other hand, He performed many miracles in power to defeat God's enemy and to release all the oppressed ones.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> </body></html>
