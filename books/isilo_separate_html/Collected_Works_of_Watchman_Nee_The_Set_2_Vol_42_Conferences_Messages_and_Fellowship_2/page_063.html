Man was created according to God's image and likeness. As far as his outward appearance is concerned, man is like God already. Man is like God in both image and likeness, yet he does not have God's life within him. Man must receive God's life before he can reach God's goal. Adam's spirit was not the Spirit of God, but the spirit of man. If Adam's spirit had received God's Spirit, he would have received God's life and fulfilled God's purpose. There are four kinds of spirits in this universe&mdash;the spirit of the angels, the Spirit of God, the spirit of man, and evil spirits. The spirit is the faculty for worship. Lions are strong, and monkeys and dogs are clever, but they do not have a spirit. Thus, they have no faculty to worship God. They are lower forms of creatures. Man is between the angels and lower forms of animals. The angels have a spirit and a soul, but no body. The lower forms of animals have a soul and a body, but no spirit. But man has a spirit and a soul, like the angels, and also a soul and a body, like the lower forms of animals. The lower animals belong to one category of living beings. Man belongs to another category of living beings. God's life is yet another category&mdash;His life is much higher than our life.</p><p>Was God's purpose fulfilled after man was created in this way? No! After God created everything, the Bible says, "And it was so." But after man was created, it does not say, "And it was so," because the work was not completed. This is why the final word was not pronounced. The final word had to be spoken by man himself. Therefore, God put man in front of the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Only after man made the right choice would God's purpose have been fulfilled.</p><h2 class="head1">MAN'S FREE WILL</h2><p>God created man for the purpose of receiving and sharing His life to become His sons. Man's spirit was made to contact God's Spirit and receive His life, become His son, and fulfill His purpose in creating man. Yet God gave man the right to choose; man has a free will. After He created man, God put man in front of two trees. The created and completed man was sinless; he was innocent. God placed him in front of two trees, setting two principles before man. The tree of life represents dependence on God, whereas the tree of the knowledge of good and evil represents independence from God. These two trees represent two kinds of lives. The tree of life represents the life of God, whereas the tree of the knowledge of good and evil represents Satan's sinful life. When man rejected the tree of life, he rejected the life of God. In effect, he was saying to God, "I do not want to take You. I will be a man by myself."</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S PURPOSE BEING FRUSTRATED</h2><p>In Genesis 2:17 God said, "But of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." This word is not a word of punishment, but a description of a natural law. If one eats, his stomach will be filled. If one puts his hands to the fire, he will be burned&mdash;these are laws. If man eats of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he will die&mdash;this also is a law. God did not say that man would be punished by death when he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. God did not say this, and we, of course, cannot add such a footnote. God only said that man would surely die when he ate of it. Conversely, if man did not eat of the tree of life, he still could not have been a son of God. In God's eyes, he was still without life. God's purpose in creating man was that he would be His son. For this reason He gave man a free will. He wants man to choose the tree of life and become His son by his own free will.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_062.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_064.html">Next</a> </body></html>
