   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Baptism Freeing Us from the World</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The above four portions of the Scripture clearly show us what baptism is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once we are baptized, we are freed from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We do not need years to be freed from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first thing for a new believer to do is to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You must see the position of the world before God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You have renounced your former position in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You must put off the world completely.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From now on, you are no longer a part of the world; you are on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Once we believe in the Lord, we should realize that we are no longer a part of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our baptism is a sign that we are freed from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Through baptism we assume a different role.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Henceforth, we abide in the ark and are persons on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can tell others that we do not do certain things because we have believed in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But, even more, we can tell others that we do not do them because we are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have crossed the bridge; we are on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Today we must recover the place of baptism before God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What is the meaning of baptism?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Baptism means to come out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is a step which we take to free ourselves from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our baptism is a declaration to others that we are out.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is like the words of a hymn which say, "Then the grave, with dear ones weeping,/Knowing that all life has fled" Hymns, #628 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our dear ones know that we are finished and that we have come to the end of our road.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are through.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only this kind of baptism is effective.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If this is not our realization, our baptism is too light and insubstantial.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must realize that we have been freed from the old circle and have come out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Eternal life is something that our spirit gains before God, but salvation is an act of our separation from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BAPTISM</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone who is already baptized needs to look back and consider the meaning of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even if you were baptized ten or twenty years ago, you still need to review this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should always remember the verse which says, "Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rom 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This verse is spoken in retrospect, not as a forethought.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The verses in Mark 16, Acts 2, Acts 22, and 1 Peter 3 are for those who have not yet been baptized, whereas the verses in Romans 6 and Colossians 2 are for those who have been baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They address those who have been baptized already.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is telling them, "Do you not know that when you were baptized, you died together with Christ and were buried and resurrected together with Him?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Romans 6 emphasizes death and burial even though it also speaks of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Colossians 2 is more advanced; it emphasizes burial and resurrection, with resurrection as the focus.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The emphasis of Romans 6 is death: "Or are you ignorant that all of us who have been baptized into Christ Jesus have been baptized into His death?"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The main point here is death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should die together with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Romans 6 is on death and burial, whereas Colossians 2 is on burial and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The water of baptism typifies the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today, when we put a person into the water, it is as if we are burying him in the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we raise him up from the water, it is equivalent to raising him up from the tomb.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Before one can be buried, he must first be dead.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You cannot bury a living person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a person rises up again after he is buried, this is surely resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The first part of this truth is found in Romans, and the second part of this truth is found in Colossians.</S>
