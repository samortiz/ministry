   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE OVERCOMERS A FEW NAMES IN SARDIS A. Not Having Defiled</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Their Garments with Death</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 4 the Lord says, But you have a few names in Sardis who have not defiled their garments.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Garments in the Bible signify what we are in our walk and living.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To defile the garments means particularly to stain them with deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Death is more defiling before God than sin Lev 11:24-25; Num 6:6, 7, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this verse, the defilement denotes anything of the death nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The defilement in Sardis was not the defilement of sin; it was the defilement of death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Death is dirtier than sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to the Old Testament, if anyone sinned, he could be forgiven simply by offering the sin offering Lev 4:27-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, anyone who touched the dead body of a man had to wait seven days before he could be cleansed Num 19:11, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This indicates that the defilement of death is more serious than that of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Christians today have no consciousness of death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you go to Las Vegas to gamble in a casino, you will sense that you have sinned.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But if you came to a meeting in a dead way, you may not sense the seriousness of it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But in the eyes of God, this death situation is more serious than gambling in a Las Vegas casino.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although Christians condemn sin, they do not condemn deadness.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>People sit in the meetings like corpses and they see nothing wrong with it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not like to be near anything dead.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One day, my mother died.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Although we all loved her, none of us dared to stay near her dead body overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If your dear wife would dirty herself while doing something for you, you would love her more than ever before.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if she were to die, you would not want to be near her dead body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord hates death.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, most Christians in the reformed churches do not have this concept of death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They may say, What is wrong with the denominational churches?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They are not only wrong they are filled with death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Though there may be nothing wrong with the corpses in a mortuary, they are full of death.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Death is the greatest problem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How ugly it is!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is a stench to God, and He cannot tolerate it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the local churches, we all must hate death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I would rather see the people in the churches wrong than to see them dead.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many times I have asked the brothers and sisters why they do not function in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Often their reply was, I m afraid of making a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To this, I responded, The more mistakes you make, the better.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Living children make many mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the dead children in the cemeteries make no mistakes at all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you simply sit in the meeting without doing anything, you will never be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Although you may be right, you will be dead right.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I would rather be livingly wrong than dead right.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I may make mistakes, but everyone will know how living I am.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Which do you prefer to be dead right or livingly wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>B. Walking with the Lord in White</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Speaking of these who have not defiled their garments, the Lord says that they shall walk with Me in white for they are worthy v. 4 . White not only signifies purity, but also approvedness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>White garments here signify the walk and living which are unspotted by death and which will be approved by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is a qualification for walking with the Lord, especially in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE PROMISE TO THE OVERCOMER</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If you read the context of Revelation 2 and 3, you will see that every time the Lord gives a promise in these seven epistles, strictly speaking it refers to the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It never refers to eternity, to our eternal destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Rather, it refers to our future in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the basic and governing principle in understanding all the promises in these seven epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In verse 4 the Lord promises that the living ones, those who have not defiled their garments, will walk with Him in white.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When will this be?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the wedding day of Christ which will last for a thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To walk with the Lord in white means to walk with Him during these thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In principle, this must also be applied to our walk with the Lord today.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In verse 5 the Lord says, He who overcomes, he shall be clothed in white garments, and I will by no means erase his name out of the book of life, and I will confess his name before My Father and before His angels.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>To overcome here means to overcome the deadness of the Protestant churches, that is, to overcome dead Protestantism.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The whole of verse 5 is the Lord s promise to the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom after He comes back.</S>
