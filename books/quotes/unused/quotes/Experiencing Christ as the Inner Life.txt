That life is but a figure, a shadow, that points to the real life, which is God Himself in Christ as the Spirit
The central matter in the Christian life is not the acquisition of holiness, power, or any other spiritual matter
Not only have the unbelievers missed the mark however even we Christians do not know Gods desire much less have a clear vision concerning it
When we believed into the Lord and were regenerated, God as life came into our human vessel, and we and the Lord became one spirit
Many Christians realize that at the time of their regeneration they received forgiveness, peace, joy, rest, and satisfaction
Very few believers have the central concept that in addition to these things, we have received God Himself as life
Although many of us may have insight into this question, it is very difficult to answer with clarity and specificity
Hebrews 8:10-11, 10:16, and Jeremiah 31:32-34 all speak of the Lord imparting a law into us and writing this law upon us
If you do this, you will have a foundation upon which you will be able to take in the fellowship in the following chapters
It is possible for people to be helped to know that Christ is life to them yet not be helped to know the proper way to experience this life
If you are going to experience the inner life, Christ Himself as the divine life, you have to know what the fellowship of this life is
In his Gospel, John stresses mainly that we can have this eternal life but spends little time telling us exactly how we can experience it
If the lights are not on, although we still have electricity, we do not have the current, the operation, of electricity
If we check with our experience, we will realize that before we were saved, we did not have this kind of flow within
It was only from the time that we opened ourselves to the Lord and received Him as our Savior and life that this flow began within us
Having the flow is just like breathing: the air is all around us, but unless we breathe, there is no way to take it in
The way to know whether we are in the fellowship living by Christ and experiencing Christ is simply to check whether there is a flow within
Because we are so full of the current, flowing, and bubbling of the divine life within us, instead of being quiet, we must shout and speak
You will find that the more you express what is flowing within, the more the fellowship of life will flow within you
If we want the fire to burn, we must give the fire ventilation by opening the chimney's flue and throwing open the doors and windows
When we let the air come in and ventilate the fire, the fire will burn brightly, even to the point of consuming our entire house!
If you are careful not to quench the Holy Spirit and if you allow the Spirit to flow, you will most certainly do the same thing
On the other hand, if sometimes the saints do this in the meetings, we should not be disturbed, for this is something in the spirit
Corinthians 5:13 says, 'For whether we were beside ourselves, it was to God; or whether we are sober-minded, it is for you'
You have to be a Christian to such an extent that, because there is a current within you, you are beside yourself
When we are in the flow, it will be very easy for us to experience the Lord's presence and know His mind and will
The flow is not stopped only by disobedience toward the Lord; it is stopped even by the slightest argument or struggle with Him
When the flow abates, we must realize that we are wrong, and we must stop whatever it is that we are doing and cry out to the Lord
When we live by Christ, something within us shines, enlightening us within and bringing us into a realm of light
When we are in the darkness, we can quarrel with the brothers, even to the point of losing our temper, yet not feel that we are wrong
If we quarrel and become angry yet have no sense of wrongdoing, this proves that we are in darkness and that there is no light within us
If we are experiencing the shining of the light of life within, when we go to quarrel with a brother, we will realize that we are wrong
Of course, we will still need to pray, read the Scriptures, attend the meetings, and fellowship with the saints
We have to realize that all these proper Christian activities are actually the result of the flowing and the shining
At the same time, all these practices are the instruments, the means, by which we experience more flowing and shining
If all the saints among us would take care of this matter day by day, what living, shining, and flowing Christians we would be!
The enjoyment of the fellowship of life and the light of life must be our day-by-day and moment-by-moment experience
If you do not have the inward flow and shining, you are a dead Christian-one who has lost the fellowship, the inward current, of life
If this is your case, you have to recover the fellowship of life by going to the Lord, dealing with Him, and being dealt with by Him
Let us forget about the other things and care for this one thing, that is, for the inward flowing and the shining
When the Lord within us is flowing and shining, we sense it; we have a deep feeling that there is something flowing and shining within us
When we talk about the fellowship of life and the light of life with them, they think that we are superstitious
There is no need for us to go to the supermarket to purchase air, no need to store it in the refrigerator, and no need to cook it
If we all practice this, we will be victorious Christians and spiritual persons, and we will enter into the real church
The American Standard Version renders the phrase 'I will put My law within them' as 'I will put my law in their inward parts'
The law of the old covenant, which is contained in the Old Testament, is the law of Moses, the essence of which is the Ten Commandments
If we have God in Christ, we have the life of God; if we do not have God in Christ, we do not have the life of God
The Ten Commandments that God gave to Moses are thus a description of God's character-even a full description of God Himself
If people who are just, kind, and full of love create laws, their laws will be full of justice, kindness, and love
In the same way, the laws written by God on the two tablets of stone are the description and definition of God Himself
Because God is holy, righteous, and full of love, the holiness, righteousness, and love of God are items, or laws, of this new law
The more we love the Lord, the more He will be troublesome to us, and the more strict His inward regulation will be
The issue of this inner regulation of the law of life is that we are transformed and conformed to the image of Christ
Every day, every hour, in all things, and in every place, this living law, which is God in Christ as the Spirit, is regulating us
It is by the operation of Himself as this inner law of life that God transforms us into His image and makes us the same as He is
The proper way for us to experience Christ as life to us is to take care of the inner regulating of the law of life
Practically, this means that when we go shopping, we must take care of the inner operation and go along with it
If we simply take care of this regulating, we will be refreshed, strengthened, nourished, enlightened, and transformed into His image
In the previous chapter we saw that Jeremiah 31:33 speaks of one law, whereas Hebrews 8:10 and 10:16 speak of many laws
We also saw that Jeremiah says that God will put His law into our inward parts and write His law in our hearts
Now as regenerated ones, we need the law to be written into our inward parts in our daily, moment-by-moment Christian experiences
On the one hand, there was the law as a whole; on the other hand, this one law was itemized into ten commandments, or laws
As we have more and more experiences, the law that was put into us at regeneration is gradually written into us item by item
Through this process of inscribing, something of God's character is mingled with and even woven into our character
If we go along with this law when it regulates us with regard to the holiness of God, the holiness of God will be woven into our being
The law of life works constantly within us, regulating us tenderly, softly, delicately, and subtly, but by no means weakly
By going along with the regulating of the law of life and yielding to God, we will experience Christ as life and grow in life
Both our growth and the manifestation of our spiritual function thus depend upon our cooperation with the inner regulating
The growth in life depends absolutely upon our going along with the inner regulation of the Triune God within us as the law of life
We simply take care of the standard of good and evil and pay little attention to the inner regulating of the law of life
We may know how to differentiate between good and evil, but we may not know how to experience Christ as our life
The experience of Christ as our life is not in the knowledge of good and evil; it is in the inner regulation of the law of life
There are many good men in this world, but we Christians were not called by God to be good men; God predestinated us to be God-men
We become Godmen by allowing God to live within us by allowing Him to regulate us all the time and by going along with His inner regulating
Question: Would you share with us the difference between the filling of the Holy Spirit and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit?
The outpouring of the Holy Spirit is not merely for power; the outpouring and resulting power are for the release
The more we go along with the inner regulating, the more we are filled, occupied, and possessed by the Holy Spirit within
If we do not have the outpouring, it is very hard for us to release what we have experienced in the Lord's filling of us
When we experience the outpouring of the Holy Spirit we are released to minister to the saints what we have experienced of the Lord inwardly
When messengers were sent by King Saul to capture David, they saw a company of prophets prophesying under Samuel
It is thus not sufficient to have the outpouring of the Holy Spirit upon us; we also need the infilling of the Holy Spirit within us
When we receive the outpouring of the Spirit, we should not pay much attention to the manifestation, the gifts
Although the inward growth of life is absolutely a matter of infilling, the infilling needs the help of the outpouring
There is a need for us to take the infilling and the outpouring in the proper proportion according to God's way
If, on the other hand, we pay attention to the outward gifts and manifestations and neglect the inward growth of life, we will suffer damage
Perhaps two or three years later you came to a point where the Lord showed you something deeper concerning the inward regulation
After your first realization, you truly entered into the experience of the inward regulation, but your degree of experience was very low
After a process of several years, you suddenly realized that the inner regulating is much deeper than what you had previously experienced
The English language has only one word to express the thought of filling, whereas Greek has at least two different words that express it
As far as the baptistery is concerned, the water fills it inwardly-the water is only in it and is not outside of it
As far as the brother is concerned, he is filled with water outwardly-the water is only outside of him and not inside of him
Acts 22 says And suddenly there was a sound out of heaven as of a rushing violent wind and it filled the whole house where they were sitting
By knowing these two Greek words, we can have a clearer understanding of the filling spoken of in the New Testament
Again, with regard to the Holy Spirit in our experience, there are two kinds of fillings: one is inward; the other is outward
Near the city of Nanking, the former capital of China, the businessmen have a custom of going to teashops to drink tea early in the morning
They have a proverb: 'In the morning, the skin embraces the water; in the evening, the water embraces the skin'
In this one verse we have the two aspects of the filling of the Holy Spirit: the inward filling and the outward filling
Others maintain that although he may be regenerated, because he has not spoken in tongues, he is not baptized by the Holy Spirit
Since this Holy Spirit who regenerated us now dwells within us, we must yield to Him, go along with Him, and cooperate with Him
We must experience the outpouring of the Spirit upon us as power both to release us and to equip us for service
The Spirit as the clothing for us to wear in Luke is quite different from the Spirit as the water for us to drink in John
The real function of the gifts depends upon the growth in life, which results from the infilling of the Spirit
If we do not have the infilling, we will not have the growth in life and consequently not have the proper function
Then whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord
When the Lord said 'this do' two times, He was referring first to taking the bread and eating and second to taking the cup and drinking
In the previous chapter, Paul writes, 'The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ?
The first aspect of the meaning of the bread is the Lord's physical body that was sacrificed, nailed to the cross, and crucified for us
After He died and resurrected, He regenerated us and brought us together so that we could become His mystical Body
The first is remembrance, which comes from a repeated phrase in 1 Corinthians 11:24-25: 'unto the remembrance of Me'
The cup we drink is the fellowship of the blood of Christ, and the bread we break is the fellowship of the Body of Christ
When we realize that the bread signifies the Lord's physical body, which was nailed to the cross for us, we remember the Lord
It is because we are Christ's mystical Body that none of us can take the Lord's table in our home for and by ourselves
You cannot say that the bread is only you; you can only say that this bread is the Body of Christ, which includes you
To take the bread, which is the symbol of the mystical Body of Christ, we need other saints, the representatives of the Body, to be with us
Whenever we come to the Lord's table and partake of the bread, we make a twofold declaration to the whole universe
The Lord Jesus on the cross shed His blood, cleansed us from our sins, brought us back to God, and brought God back to us
When we have such a realization, the enemy, Satan, will come to us and accuse us, saying, 'How about your sin'?
In this final chapter, we go on to consider another aspect of experiencing Christ as the inner life: the anointing
It is by the laws that are put into our minds and written into our hearts that God is God to us and we are a people to Him
The second occurrence of knowin the phrase all will know Meis oida and it means the inner consciousness of a person about a certain thing
By this living law, which regulates us constantly within, we know God and have the inner knowledge and consciousness of Him
John 2:27 begins, 'As for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you'
Today in the New Testament age, there is no need that any person teach us, because we have the anointing, which abides in us
In the previous chapters, we learned that this law is God Himself as life to us, constantly regulating us within
We have not only the oil but the anoint-ing- that which is the working, moving, acting, and living of the Spirit within us
God's eternal purpose and ultimate goal is to work Himself as life into us so that He would be our content and expression
The law of life is the regulating of the Triune God within us, and the anointing is the constant working of the Triune God within us
The fact that a law was something set up by God obviated any need to seek God as to whether they should observe it
In the same way, if someone wanted to steal something, they did not have to ask the Lord whether it was right or not for him to steal
The Old Testament law corresponds to the law of life, and the Old Testament prophets correspond to the anointing
As regenerated ones living in the New Testament age, we live not according to the law of letters, but according to the law of life
Just as those in the Old Testament age had the law and the prophets, we in the New Testament age have the law of life and the anointing
Whether or not a sister should go to the department store to shop and when she should go are a matter of guidance, that is, the anointing
Once she is in the department store, there is not much need for guidance because the law of life regulates her from within
Again, this is my experience not of the guidance of the anointing but of the regulating function of the inward law of the divine life
These laws that is these many items of the one divine law as they are written into us transform our mind emotion and will into Christs image
When we believed into the Lord, we were regenerated in our spirit, and when the Lord comes back, our body will be transfigured
The Spirit, who is Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God, lives in our spirit , but He does not want to remain there
He is waiting for the chance to saturate our mind, our emotion, and our will, that is, to transform the inward parts of our being
We are transformed in our soul by the indwelling Triune God as life regulating us in our daily walk and daily living
In whatever we do, whether in working or in determining whether we should go to a certain place, we need guidance
Acts 16:6-7 says that when the apostle Paul tried to stay in Asia to speak the word, he was forbidden to do so by the Holy Spirit
Just as with Paul, it is by this anointing, this working of the Holy Spirit within us, that we know the will of God
As with all matters of the divine life, the experience of the anointing is quite profound, and no one can fully understand it
On the one hand, He is life to you; as life He is the law that regulates your daily walk and your daily living
In whatever you are planning on doing, you have to be purified in your motive, seeking nothing besides the Lord Himself and His glory
You will walk, you will work, you will live, and you will do things according to the guidance of the Lord and according to His will
