 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE</h1>

<h1 class="title">GRADUALLY AND POSITIVELY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 14:26; Heb. 10:25; Matt. 16:18; Eph. 4:12-16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE APPLICATION OF THE BIBLICAL WAY<br />
FOR THE BELIEVERS TO MEET AND TO SERVE<br />
BEING GRADUAL ACCORDING TO<br />
OUR PRESENT SITUATION</h2>
<p>The application of the biblical way for the believers to meet and to serve should be gradual according to our present situation. In doing anything you have to take care of the situation. We may use a medical doctor to illustrate this principle. When a doctor treats someone, he always proceeds gradually according to the condition of the illness and the real situation of the patient. You must take care of the situation in your local church. Not all the churches today are on the same level in the application of the biblical way to meet and to serve. Some churches have just started; some churches may still be considering how to take this way; and some churches may have gone much further and may be at a higher level. You need to take the present situation of the church in your locality into a thorough, careful, and fine consideration. Then you will know how the Lord will lead you, and you will know what to do.</p>
<p>From the initiation, the beginning, of the biblical way, we should practice only the beginning part. Do not present all the points and all the parts of this biblical way at once. As in a feast, you should put out course after course. You need to consider what the first and second courses should be, what the last course should be, and how long each course should last. In a fifteen minute feast, one course may take only two or three minutes. All of this depends on the situation of the eaters. Some people do not eat so quickly, and they may not be happy with all the courses. We all must learn how to consider the situation of the eaters, how they appreciate and receive the courses of the feast, and how well they eat.</p>
<p>After a certain period of time, we may practice a further part of the biblical way to meet and to serve. I cannot tell you what parts should be practiced first in the church in your locality. Again, this all depends upon the situation and the condition of the saints. Thus, part by part, we practice the entire biblical way with much patience from the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE APPLICATION ALSO BEING POSITIVE</h2>
<p>The application of the biblical way to meet and to serve should also be positive. We human beings always tend to be unbalanced, like unturned cakes (Hosea 7:8). When we turn the cake on one side, we tend to leave it there; that side will be burnt while the other side is raw. We have to &ldquo;turn the cake&rdquo; quite often. As we practice to be gradual, we must at the same time be positive. To be gradual does not mean that we do not go further. Rather it means that we go further steadily and positively. We need much exercise, much wisdom, and much grace with patience. We all have to learn how to enjoy the Lord as our patience, our wisdom, and our grace.</p>
<p>While practicing the biblical way part by part, we should practice every part positively with much endeavoring to labor, strive, and struggle by the Lord&rsquo;s great power of resurrection that operates in us until we reach the goal in the full recovery of the truth covered in 1 Corinthians 14:26 and Hebrews 10:25. Nothing exhausts our power as much as a situation requiring patience. Therefore, we need to labor, strive, and struggle by the Lord&rsquo;s great power of resurrection.</p>
<p>During the period of such an endeavoring practice, we should do everything we can to avoid any kind of opinion or dispute. We should not have any discrimination in the church life. We should not say that a certain saint is for the new way and that another saint is not for the new way. To speak in this way is to create differences among the saints. Whether a saint is taking the new way or not should not matter to us. We must go on positively, not making an issue out of any differences among the saints. We should not look down on those who seemingly do not practice the new way, nor should we uplift those who do practice the new way. There should be no looking down or lifting up in the church life; all are the same. It is easy for us to push something when we are in it and to oppose something when we are not in it. This is a bad habit, causing a bad situation. From the beginning, I did not expect that all the attendants of the church meetings would or could practice the new way. I only expected that one-fourth of the saints would practice this way. You must honor and respect your church for what it is. Do not create any differences or build up something according to your own way. This kind of building always becomes a tearing down.</p>
