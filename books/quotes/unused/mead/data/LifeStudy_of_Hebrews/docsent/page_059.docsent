   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF HEBREWS MESSAGE NINETEEN THE REMAINING SABBATH REST 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last message we saw the real meaning of the Sabbath rest, seeing that it is not merely a rest after the completion of work but that it means satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If your desire has not been satisfied, you cannot have rest.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The best rest, the real rest, is the satisfaction of our heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When we consider this matter of the Sabbath rest, we must learn what is God s heart s desire.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>From the beginning of the Bible to the end, we can see that God s desire according to His eternal plan is to have Himself expressed and represented by man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was for this reason that He created man in His own image and gave him dominion over all things Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When man is on the earth expressing God and representing Him, God s desire is satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we are satisfied in our God s desire, we are resting even as we are laboring and working.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the Bible first mentions man, it speaks of God s image and dominion, indicating that man was destined to express God with His image and to represent God with His dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In other words, man has been destined by God to express Him and represent Him in His image and with His authority to set up a kingdom, a divine realm, for God s rule on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is clearly pictured in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When we come to the end of the Bible, after centuries of God s work of creation, redemption, transformation, and glorification, we see a city with God s appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God sitting upon the throne has the appearance of jasper Rev 4:2-3 , and the entire city of New Jerusalem also has the appearance of jasper Rev 21:11, 18a , signifying that God will be fully expressed in and through that city.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When you look at that city, you will see God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There, in the New Jerusalem, God will be fully expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moreover, in the center of the city is the throne of God Rev 22:1, 3 , showing that God s dominion also is there.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the New Jerusalem God s image will be expressed and His authority will be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, in eternity future on the new earth, the New Jerusalem will be God s complete expression and dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That will be the true Sabbath rest to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>At that time, God will be fully at rest because His heart s desire will have been completely satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He will have obtained what He desired to have.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the real meaning of the Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>IX.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE SABBATH REST IN VARIOUS AGES A. Israel as God s Sabbath Rest</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Based upon this understanding of the Sabbath rest, we can see in the Bible different ages or periods in the Sabbath rest.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Firstly, the children of Israel in the Old Testament age were God s Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The children of Israel expressed God and represented Him on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although there are many negative stories concerning the children of Israel in the Bible, they did, nonetheless, express and represent God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should not only look at the black side of the history of the children of Israel but also at the white side.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When I was a young Christian, almost everything that I heard about the children of Israel was negative.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In message after message we were warned not to be like Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As a result of this, I received the deep impression that the book of Numbers was the worst book in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many years later I learned that the book of Numbers was glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although there is the black side in this book, there is also the white side.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, what happened when Baalam was hired to curse Israel?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God sovereignly took care of this matter, and out of Baalam s mouth came blessings instead of cursings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Baalam said, He hath not beheld iniquity in Jacob, neither hath he seen perverseness in Israel Num 23:21 , and, How goodly are thy tents, O Jacob, and thy tabernacles, O Israel!</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Num 24:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Old Testament reveals that Israel, God s chosen people, became God s rest, His Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Israel secured the good land, and that good land became the land of Emmanuel Isa 8:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The word Emmanuel means God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The land of Canaan was called the land of God with man, the land where God was able to be with man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Since God secured that land through the children of Israel, the children of Israel became His Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Eventually the children of Israel built the temple for God, and the shekinah glory of the Lord filled it 1 Kings 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>On that day, God not only came down from heaven, but His shekinah glory filled the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That was more precious than God s creation of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If God could only create the earth but not gain it and build His temple, His habitation, on it, then what was the use of the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After the temple was built, God could say, Now I have a habitation on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The land secured by the children of Israel not only became the land of Emmanuel, the land of God with man, but also the site where God s habitation was built.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God s expression was there in the temple, which was a symbol of Israel as God s habitation on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the temple had been built and was filled with God s glory, God rested.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do you not believe that the children of Israel were also at rest?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Yes, they all rested with God; that was a Sabbath to them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As all of them rested with God, they surely kept the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>That was the first stage of the Sabbath rest.</S>
