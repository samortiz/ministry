   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR THINGS A CHRISTIAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SHOULD PAY ATTENTION TO Issue No. 39 Scripture Reading: Matt 9:38; Mark 11:22; 2 Cor 5:7; Rom 1:1, 14; 2 Cor 12:1, 4, 7; Gal 2:20; 2 Cor 4:10; Matt 13:9, 52; Hosea 7:8; Matt 5:48</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We hope to see by the help of God the kind of way God ordains for us to take.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have taken verses from various places in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Some may wonder what these verses are all about.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In particular, I want to draw your attention to Hosea 7:8, which says that "Ephraim is a cake/Not turned."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Brothers, in God's eyes, there are always two sides to whatever we do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A bird can only fly with two wings.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even a blade of grass has to have two sides before it can be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, a door has to have two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this universe, everything is balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is true in the physical realm is also true in the spiritual realm; everything should be balanced between two sides.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hosea 7:8 says, "Ephraim is a cake/Not turned."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is an unturned cake?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although many of us have not made cakes before, we all have eaten cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even if we do not know how cakes are baked, we have at least seen others cooking bean curd or frying vegetables.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If a person only cooks one side without turning it over, the result will surely be that one side is raw, and the other side is overcooked.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One side will have too little heat, while the other side will have too much heat.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Anyone who cooks vegetables or bean curd knows that the same amount of heat has to be applied to both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If one keeps cooking only one side, the result will be that one side is burnt and the other side is uncooked.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Anything burnt cannot be considered proper food; it cannot feed others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Today I will not expound on Ephraim becoming an unturned cake through mixing himself with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I will only draw attention to the phrase "a cake not turned."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a principle from God for our living.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a person pays too much attention to anything, he becomes a cake not turned.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One can, of course, cook one side by exposing it to fire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But if he does not turn it to the other side, the whole piece will not be well-cooked and will become useless.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The most important thing for a Christian to do is to be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We will pick out some examples to see how a Christian who over-emphasizes one aspect of things will become a cake not turned.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Many Christians are living a life of an unturned cake.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many emphasize personal spiritual living and neglect the corporate life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is an unturned cake.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some pay much attention to the corporate life but forget about the individual life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such people are also unturned cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some pay too much attention to righteousness and have no grace at all.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such people are unturned cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is right to be righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But paying attention to righteousness all the time without taking care of grace is being an unturned cake.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Some people are nice; they are good to others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But they do not have any principle of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They do not want to deal with others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They pay too much attention to grace and no attention to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This also is an unturned cake.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Some people pay most of their attention to the objective truths and forget the work of the Holy Spirit within man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These people are also unturned cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some people pay too much attention to the subjective truths and do not pay much attention to the accomplishments of Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They also are unturned cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We can say much more about what an unturned cake is.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But because of time, I will only mention these few cases.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No truth should be over-emphasized.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>There is always the need of balance, and there is always the need to pay attention to both sides.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>With the Bible, we should be aware of two things.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first is fact, and the second is principle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A fact requires us to believe in it, while a principle requires us to obey it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Many people pay attention only to the facts and not to the principles.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These persons are unturned cakes, being burnt on one side.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Other people only pay attention to the principles and speak much about obedience, but they do not pay attention to the accomplished facts of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>These people are also unturned cakes, being burnt on the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Such an over-emphasis of one side will cause a Christian to have a distorted living and not bring him to perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today I will draw your attention to the matter of being a Christian in four aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not be an unturned cake.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I cannot enumerate all the examples of unturned cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I can only mention a few of them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now I will speak on being a four-sided Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the one hand, we will consider the Lord's commands.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On the other hand, we will consider Paul's pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Gospels show us the Lord's commands, while Paul's Epistles show us his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>THE LORD'S COMMANDS</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>First, the Lord commands His disciples to know.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He says, "He who has ears to hear, let him hear" Matt 13:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Again He says, "For this reason every scribe discipled to the kingdom of the heavens is like a householder who brings forth out of his treasure things new and old" v. 52 . This refers to knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If a believer is not an unturned cake, he will surely advance in knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Second, one should have faith because the Lord says, "Have faith in God."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the original meaning of Mark 11:22.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Third, the Lord says, "Therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest" Matt 9:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This refers to zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We should be zealous for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Fourth, the Lord says, "You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect" Matt 5:48 .</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This refers to life and in particular to love.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We may not be as perfect as the heavenly Father is in other aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>But at least we should pursue to be as perfect as our heavenly Father is in love.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The Lord once passed through Samaria, and the people there would not receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>When James and John saw this, they said, "Lord, do You want us to command fire to come down from heaven and consume them?"</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Luke 9:54 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The Lord turned and rebuked the two disciples, saying, "You do not know of what kind of spirit you are" v. 55 . Oh, we should know of what kind of spirit we are.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have not divided these subjects randomly.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If we read the Gospels carefully and group the Lord's commands together, they are of these four categories.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The Lord turns our attention to either faith, zeal, knowledge, or life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is always one of these four things.</S>
