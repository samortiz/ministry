When the Pharisees asked Him as to when the kingdom of God should come, He answered them and said, &#8220;The kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, Behold, here it is! or, There! For behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you&#8221; (Luke 17:20-21). In Matthew 12:28 the Lord also said, &#8220;But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you.&#8221; Wherever the Lord Jesus went, His enemies were subdued. On the negative side, sin, sickness, demons, evil spirits, and Satan himself were all conquered, subdued, and defeated by Christ. On the positive side, God was expressed and glorified. In His human living on earth, people saw the glory of God, that is, God expressed through Him and in Him. Therefore, wherever He was, there the kingdom was also.<p>Many people do not have the proper thought concerning the kingdom. It is possible to read the four Gospels by our human mentality and understand them merely in word. However, we need the heavenly vision to have the proper insight. To be sure, we must understand the words, but we must understand them by the heavenly vision. The teaching concerning the kingdom by the Brethren, for example, is too technical, too much in letter, and too dispensational, lacking light and impact. Before God and in the Lord, I have the full assurance to speak the real truth concerning the kingdom, not in doctrine in dead letters but in the way of living revelation. The kingdom is a matter of God&#8217;s authority and God&#8217;s glory which was brought to man by His incarnation.<p>When the Lord Jesus was incarnated as a man to live, walk, and work on this earth, He brought the divine authority and God&#8217;s glory with Him. Thus, wherever He was, there was God&#8217;s kingdom. All God&#8217;s enemies were subdued, conquered, defeated, and overcome, and God&#8217;s full glory was expressed through Him. This is the full meaning of the kingdom of God. When Christ as the Head comes into us, all the enemies of God within us are also subdued by Him, and the full glory of God is expressed in us. In this way, we have the kingdom of God within us.<p>The principle will be the same when Christ comes back the second time. On the negative side, Christ will come with the full authority of God to subdue all things. On the positive side, He will express God in a full way as God&#8217;s glory. This will be the kingdom in its manifestation in full. That is something in the future, but today the same principle is already here. The principle of the kingdom is of two aspects: divine authority to deal with the enemy of God and God&#8217;s glory to express God Himself.<p>In order to understand the Scriptures fully, we must first grasp the principles and not the details. In order to understand the map of a big city, for example, we must first know the main streets. If we are clear about the main streets, then we can go anywhere without getting lost or confused. To grasp the main principles and treat the details as secondary is the best way to study any matter. Here, therefore, we are presenting a sketch without getting into many technical details. We must be impressed with the principles. As we have seen, the first principle of the New Testament is incarnation, God mingled with man and becoming a man. The second principle, or main item, of the New Testament is the kingdom. God&#8217;s divine authority with His full glory was brought to man by His incarnation.<h2 class=head2>Being Born Again to Enter into the Kingdom</h2><p>With the kingdom there is a demand, or requirement, which is much higher than the requirements of the Mosaic law (Matt. 5:17-48). The requirements of the law of Moses are that we be just, right, good, kind, and holy, whereas the requirement of the kingdom is that we be the same as God. The Lord Jesus tells us in Matthew 5:48, &#8220;You therefore shall be perfect as your heavenly Father is perfect.&#8221; Not only must we be just, right, good, kind, and holy, but we also must be the same as God. This is the requirement of the kingdom, which far surpasses the requirements of the law.<p>In order to enter into the kingdom there is a condition. Merely to be good and just is not sufficient. The terms, the condition, for entering the kingdom is that we be born again, that is, born of God (John 3:5; 1:13). Regardless of how good we are, we are still not qualified to enter the kingdom because we need another birth; we must be born anew (3:3). To be born anew means to be born again.<p>Even if we were as good as Confucius or even better, we still would have no qualifications to enter into the kingdom. No matter how good we are, we must realize that we are only created by God, not born of God. Therefore, in order for us to enter God&#8217;s kingdom, we must be born of God, that is, we must have the life of God, God Himself within us as life. Merely by our natural life, we can never fulfill the requirements of the kingdom; this is beyond all possibility. We need another life, the divine life, which is God Himself. We must have God Himself within us in order to fulfill the requirements of the kingdom. This is why the opening word of the New Testament tells us to repent for the sake of the kingdom.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>General Sketch of the New Testament in the Light of Christ and the Church, A - Part 1: The Gospels and the Acts &nbsp; pg 4</div><br></body></html>
