In the Son&#8217;s Human Form</h2><p>[The golden lampstand is not a lump of gold but gold in a definite form and purposeful shape. The form, the shape, of the lampstand signifies the Son&#8217;s human form. Christ, the Son, is the embodiment of the Godhead, the embodiment of the Father&#8217;s nature (Col. 2:9). Therefore, the church should have not only the Father&#8217;s divine essence but also the Son&#8217;s human form.<p>The fact that the form of the lampstand signifies the Son as the embodiment of the Godhead indicates that the church should not be vague but should have a definite shape. In chapters two and three of Revelation the Lord Jesus, as the embodiment of the invisible God, was clearly standing as He spoke to the churches. All the churches should also stand, having the Son&#8217;s shape.]<h2 class=head3>3. Through the Spirit&#8217;s Expression</h2><p>[Furthermore, the golden lampstands as the testimony of Jesus have the Spirit&#8217;s expression. The seven lamps of the lampstand shine for God&#8217;s expression. These seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God. Thus, with the lampstand are the Father&#8217;s essence, the Son&#8217;s human form, and the Spirit&#8217;s expression. Since the golden lampstand has these three aspects, we can say that the golden lampstand signifies the embodiment of the Triune God, with the Father as the substance, the Son as the form, and the Spirit as the expression.<p>To say that the church is the embodiment of the Triune God is not to make the church a part of deity or an object of worship. We mean that the church is an entity born of God (John 1:12-13), possessing God&#8217;s life (1 John 5:11-12) and enjoying God&#8217;s nature (2 Pet. 1:4). The church has the divine substance, bears the likeness of Christ, and expresses God. Because we have been born of God, we have God&#8217;s life and possess His nature. Now we may enjoy this life and nature day by day and learn to live not by our natural life but by the divine life and nature. As we live this way and are transformed, there will be the fullness, the expression, the form, the appearance of Christ. Furthermore, we shall shine by the sevenfold, intensified Spirit.<p>As symbolized by the golden lampstand, the church is the embodiment of the Triune God to express Him. As members of Christ, we are sons of God born of Him, having His life and possessing His nature. Now we are learning to live by this life and nature that we may be filled and saturated with the processed Triune God to become His corporate expression through the sevenfold, intensified Spirit.]<h2 class=head2>B. To Be Consummated in the New Jerusalem</h2><p>[The churches as golden lampstands will be consummated in the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem, the holy city, is the aggregate of all the lampstands. If we consider the facts that the New Jerusalem is a golden city (Rev. 21:18b), that it has one street which reaches all twelve gates (Rev. 21:21; 22:2), that the wall of the city is one hundred forty-four cubits high (21:17), and that the city itself is twelve thousand stadia high (21:16), we shall realize that the city proper must be a mountain. On top of this mountain is a throne, from which the street spirals down to the bottom to reach the twelve gates. On top of this golden mountain is the throne as the center. On the throne is Christ as the Lamb with God in Him (22:1). This Lamb is the lamp with God in Him as the light (21:23; 22:5).<p>This golden mountain is a stand, and upon this stand is a lamp. Therefore, this golden mountain-the New Jerusalem-is a golden lampstand. As a golden lampstand, it has Christ as the lamp with God in Him as the light shining out for eternity. Thus, the New Jerusalem, the aggregate of all the lampstands, the totality of today&#8217;s lampstands, is a consummate, universal golden lampstand to shine forth God&#8217;s glory in the new heaven and new earth for eternity.]<h2 class=head2>C. Expressing the Processed Triune God in Eternity</h2><p>[As the consummation of the golden lampstands, the New Jerusalem will express the processed Triune God in eternity. The New Jerusalem will be a mountain of gold with pearl gates and with a jasper wall built upon twelve layers of precious stones. Gold expresses God in His nature, pearls express Christ in His death and resurrection, and the precious stones express the Spirit in His work of transformation. Therefore, the New Jerusalem will be the triune expression of the processed Triune God-the expression of the Father as the source, the Son as the embodiment, and the Spirit as the realization and transmission.]<p>This is the final aspect of the status of the church. This aspect is very exciting because the same symbol was used for the Triune God, the children of Israel, and the church. We will be mingled with Him to such an extent that we will express Him in full. One of the symbols used for Him, the lampstand, is also used for the church. This is wonderful! What else can we say except &#8220;Hallelujah! To You, O Lord, be glory forever in the church. Your plan for the church is marvelous. I will give my whole life to You for Your church. I will spend my energy for the building up of Your church. I will dwell in Your church forever and ever. Amen!&#8217;&#8217;<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> </body></html>
