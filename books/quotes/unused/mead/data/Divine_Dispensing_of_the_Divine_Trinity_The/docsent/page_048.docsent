   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ANOTHER PARACLETE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Spirit is another Paraclete John 14:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Paraclete is the anglicized form of the Greek word paracletos.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a very inclusive word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It means one who serves you, who is called to your side to help you in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It also denotes one who is taking care of your case like an attorney, or who intercedes for you like an intercessor.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It also denotes a kind of patron.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Further, it denotes consoling and comforting, which is why the King James Version renders it comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Spirit, the Third of the Trinity, is the total consummation of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is not just one third of the Godhead; He is the totality of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such a One is your helper, your patron, your counselor, your comforter who takes care of your needs in your daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The same word is used concerning the Lord Jesus in 1 John 2:1 where it is translated advocate.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These are not two; these are one.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As our advocate He is with the Father, and as our paraclete He is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have such a One within us taking care of all our need.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you need a helper, He is such a helper.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you need an attorney, He is such an attorney.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you need someone to pray for you, He is such an intercessor.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the Paraclete.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first part of the word, para, is a prefix which means alongside or along with you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Someone is alongside of you, along with you, all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He is like a nurse taking care of a sick person.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is like an attorney taking care of your case in the heavenly court.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is everything to you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>GIVEN BY THE FATHER IN ANSWERING</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE SON S REQUEST</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Spirit is given by the Father in answering the Son s request John 14:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even now I cannot fully understand this point.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Son requested the Father to give the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This one act involved the Three of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Second requested the First to give the Third.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What is this?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I don t know, but I do know the Three of the Godhead are working together to give us the Spirit, as revealed in John 14:16.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>SENT BY THE FATHER IN THE SON S NAME</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit was sent by the Father in the Son s name John 14:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>John 14:26 is not easy to interpret.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Does it mean that the Father does something in the Son s name?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Or does it mean that the Spirit is sent in the Son s name?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Regardless of which way we interpret it, the result is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Whether the Father sent the Spirit in the Son s name, or whether the Father sent the Spirit and the Spirit came in the Son s name, the coming is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This indicates that the Three have never been separated.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When One moves, the other Two are with the One.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>One is sent, and the other Two join the coming.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the Son comes, He comes in the Father s name, and He comes as the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the Spirit is sent, He is sent in the Son s name.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>That means He is sent as the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>So the Son comes as the Father, and the Spirit is sent as the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This simply means that the Three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You cannot separate them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The First sent the Second, and the Second comes in the name of the First as the First; then the Second sent the Third, and the Third comes in the name of the Second.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Among the Three there is a definite distinction, but there is no separation at all.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>PROCEEDING FROM WITH THE FATHER</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Spirit proceeds from with the Father John 15:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Spirit does not come by Himself alone.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He comes from the Father, and He comes with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In other words, His coming brings the Father with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>So when He comes, the Father comes also.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Two, He and the Father, are one.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>RECEIVING ALL THAT IS OF THE SON,</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>THUS BECOMING</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>THE SON S TRANSFIGURATION</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Spirit receives all that is of the Son John 16:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whatever the Son is and has, has been disclosed, passed on, to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Spirit then discloses everything He has received to us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>So actually He is the transfiguration of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Whatever the Father has is the Son s, making the Son the very embodiment of the Father Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whatever the Son has, has been passed on to the Spirit, making the Spirit the transfiguration of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>So the Son is the embodiment of the Father, and the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many Christians today would not use these two terms: embodiment and transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Instead they would use the word representative.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They would say that the Holy Spirit within us is the representative of Christ who is in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This word representative is a leaven; it leavens the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the Triune God there is no representation, but there is the embodiment and the transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Father is embodied in the Son, and the Son is transfigured into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>There is no thought of representation.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Son does not represent the Father, nor does the Spirit represent the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Son embodies the Father, and the Spirit is the transfiguration of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Representation would indicate that the Father is separate from the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This would also indicate that the Son is separate from the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This would indicate a separation between the Three, between the One who represents and the One who is represented.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>But embodiment indicates union, oneness, and identification.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In principle transfiguration does the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Most of the truths in the Bible have been leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is a subtlety of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He has leavened the truths, depriving them of their riches and weight.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is why we need the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The Lord wants to recover all the leavened truths.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Don t use the word representative, and don t bring in the thought of representation concerning the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We should use the words embodied and transfigured, or embodiment and transfiguration.</S>
