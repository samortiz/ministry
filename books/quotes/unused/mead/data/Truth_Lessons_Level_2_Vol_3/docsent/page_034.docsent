   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>27.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Rest</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is not only the believers' peace and joy but also their rest.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In Matthew 11:28 the Lord Jesus called people, saying, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The toil spoken of in this verse refers not only to the toil of striving to keep the commandments of the law and religious regulations but also to the toil of struggling to be successful in any work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Whoever toils thus is always heavily burdened.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord called such toiling ones to come to Him for rest.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Rest refers not only to being set free from the toil and burden under the law and religion or under any work or responsibility, but also to perfect peace and full satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then the Lord showed us the way to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He said, "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls" v. 29 . To take the Lord's yoke is to take the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not to be regulated or controlled by any obligation of the law or religion or to be enslaved by any work, but to be constrained by the will of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord lived such a life, caring for nothing but the will of His Father John 4:34; 5:30; 6:38 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He submitted Himself fully to the Father's will Matt 26:39, 42 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, He asks us to learn from Him, the One who is meek and lowly in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did not resist any opposition, nor did He esteem Himself highly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In all the opposition He was meek, and in all the rejection He was lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He submitted Himself fully to the will of His Father, not wanting to do anything for Himself or expecting to gain something for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, no matter what the situation was, He had rest in His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was fully satisfied with His Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we take His yoke upon us and learn from Him, we will find rest for our souls.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is an inward rest.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we are opposed as we minister, and we resist, we will not have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if instead of resisting we learn from the Lord and submit to the will of the Father, we will have rest in our souls; that is, we will enjoy the indwelling Christ as the rest in our deepest part.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>SUMMARY</S>
