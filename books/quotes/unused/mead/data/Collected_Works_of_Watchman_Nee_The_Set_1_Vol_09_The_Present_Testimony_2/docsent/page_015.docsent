   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Gravity is a law, but if you hold a book with your hand, the power of the hand overcomes the law of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It does not mean that the law of gravity is removed; it merely means that another law has overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the same principle, the law of the Spirit of life frees me from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The law of sin and of death has not been annulled, but another law prevents me from being ensnared by the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Consequently, I do not feel that there is a law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose the government has a law that forbids robbery.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I never have the inclination to be a robber, the law has nothing to do with me.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It does not mean that there is no such a law; it merely means that I have never wanted to be a robber; therefore, I never feel the existence of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sin is an outward act, while a law is an inward demand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a man overcomes sin, he has only overcome isolated acts.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If he overcomes the law of sin, he has overcome the demand of the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Suppose a man loves to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He can force himself once or twice not to drink, but he cannot remove from within him the desire for wine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have a friend who was addicted to theatrical shows before he believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As soon as the gong and the drums sounded, he would be moved in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Once in a village near our school, there was a theatrical show in honor of the idols, and the plays went on for three days and three nights.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He attended the shows the whole time and did not go home for three days and three nights.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When he became too tired, he fell on the floor and slept.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After he woke up, he watched the shows again.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He did this continuously for three days and three nights.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After he believed in the Lord, the Lord delivered him from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now he does not have to force himself not to go; there is something within him that makes him not want to go.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is how God delivers us from sin and death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God delivers man first from within so that man will not be bound by the inward law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After this, there will spontaneously be good conduct without.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God frees us from the law of sin and of death; He does not make the law of sin and of death depart from us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Suppose that I do not want this book to fall on the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not have to exert all of my strength to remove the force of gravity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All I have to do is to hold this book.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The law of gravity may still be there, but the gripping force in my hand has overcome it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Although the law of gravity is still there, it has been made of no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God's way of salvation is not to remove the fiery serpents, but to set up the bronze serpent John 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We thank and praise God that He can save us to such an extent that we can overcome the demand of the law of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even if I have not given a good sermon today, as long as you hold onto God's Word, everything will be all right.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God says that the law of the Spirit of life has freed me in Christ Jesus from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have been freed from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From now on, I am a freed man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, after you have believed this way, and you have gone home, the law of sin may appear to still be there.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You may ask yourself, "In the meeting I believed that I am freed from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why does it seem to still be there?"</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At such times Satan will come and accuse you, saying, "What difference has believing made to you?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When you did not believe, you were like this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now that you believe, you are still like this."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>At such times your faith is being tested.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you ignore your feelings and the accusations at such times, you will overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You cannot keep yourself by being more cautious or alert.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's word will keep you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What God says counts.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When the first temptation comes and you stand fast, you have overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God has to test your faith to see if it is real, and you also have to test if the salvation in God's Word is real.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the faith is not real, you will not receive God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if we believe and say to God, "I hold onto Your Word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What You say counts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For this reason, I believe that I am freed from the law of sin and of death."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When God removes the veil, you will see what facts have been accomplished in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Please remember that your eyes have to be set on God and not on yourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Bible has never asked you to look at yourselves or to look at your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The righteous live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need faith to be saved, and we need faith to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have to glorify God at the time of temptations.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Satan will say, "After all the believing, you are still the same."</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You have to say, "After all that you have done, I still believe."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Satan will say, "God's Word may not be true."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You have to say, "God's Word is true, and only the devil is a liar."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Brothers and sisters, I truly feel that it is easy to tell people to do good, but it is most difficult to exhort people to believe in God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I have to tell you that without believing in God's Word, there is no victory.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Why does verse 1 say that we are no longer powerless in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Verse 2 explains the reason clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The reason is that we are in Christ and freed from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The reason for our powerlessness and bondage is the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This law has entangled us and has caused us to do the things that we wish not to do.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we are in Christ, His resurrection life and the Holy Spirit free us and deliver us from the law of sin and of death.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>When we are in Christ, we are no longer powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But we have to remember that this freeing is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, this experience of no longer being powerless must also be in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We cannot expect God to do something within us that will make us feel that we are quite good, sufficient, and can now overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There is no such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We can only have the experience of no longer being powerless when we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Once we are out of Christ, we are as powerless as before.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is why John 15 commands us to abide in Christ all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Romans 8:3 states, "For that which the law could not do, in that it was weak through the flesh, God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This verse tells us that since the law could not do anything because it was weak through the flesh, God sent the Lord Jesus to the world to accomplish the work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>On the one hand, He became a sacrifice for sin and died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>On the other hand, He brought our sins to the cross and judged them there.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In this way, sin has power no more.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Romans 8:4 states, "That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This verse tells us that when we are in Christ, we will fulfill the righteous requirement of the law, accomplish God's will, and please God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Thank and praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We believe today, we have power today, and we have victory.</S>
