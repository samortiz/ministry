THE BLESSED HIGHWAYS&#151;THE HIGHWAYS TO ZION</H2><P>Psalm 84:5 tells us that the one is blessed in whose heart are the highways to Zion. The highways to Zion are the blessed highways for seeking the incarnated Triune God in His consummations (comprising the washing laver, the showbread table, the lampstand, and the ark of the testimony). From our spiritual experiences we have learned that, on the one hand, we have entered into God, but, on the other hand, we are still on the way to enter into God. None of us can say that our entering into God has been completed. For many of us, the entering into God has only begun. We are in God, yet we are still on the highways to enter into God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Having Strength in God</H2><P>Verse 5a says, "Blessed is the man whose strength is in You." This indicates that one who is on the highways to Zion has his strength in God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Passing through the Valley of Baca</H2><P>Verse 6a speaks of passing through the valley of Baca (weeping). On this highway we have times of weeping.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Making the Valley of Weeping a Spring</H2><P>Those on the highways to Zion make the valley of weeping a spring (v. 6b). This spring is just the Spirit. How wonderful!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. The Early Rain Covering<br>the Valley of Weeping with Blessings</H2><P>"Indeed the early rain covers it with blessings" (v. 6c). The early rain signifies the Spirit. This indicates that the more we weep on the highways to Zion, the more of the Spirit we receive. While we are weeping, we are being filled with the Spirit, and the Spirit becomes our spring.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Going from Strength to Strength</H2><P>"They go from strength to strength" (v. 7a). This indicates that as we are walking on the blessed highways to seek the incarnated Triune God, we go from strength to strength. As a result, no one can turn us aside.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_251.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_253.html">Next</a> </body></html>
