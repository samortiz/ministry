<h2 class="head4">b. The Apostles&rsquo; Preaching of Him<br />
Being Yes in Him</h2>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 1:17-18 Paul says, &ldquo;This therefore intending, did I then use fickleness? Or the things which I purpose, do I purpose according to the flesh, so that with me there should be Yes, yes and No, no? But as God is faithful, our word toward you is not yes and no.&rdquo; Here Paul indicates that he did not use fickleness; he did not change from yes to no and from no to yes. Moreover, he defended himself and his co-workers by saying that God is faithful so that the word of their preaching was not yes and no. Hence, neither were they fickle persons of yes and no. Their being was according to their preaching. They lived according to what they preached. The word of the apostles&rsquo; preaching in 1:18, that is, their word toward the Corinthians, was their message concerning Christ (v. 19).</p>
<p>Second Corinthians 1:17-18 indicates that Paul was one with the faithful God. He was the same as God in being faithful. His word toward the Corinthians, the word of his ministry, was not yes and no. Paul did not change his tune. From the first time he came to the Corinthians until the writing of this Epistle, his preaching sounded the same note. There was no change at all in the word of the ministry.</p>
<p>In verse 19 Paul continues, &ldquo;For the Son of God, Jesus Christ, who was preached among you through us, through me and Silvanus and Timothy, did not become yes and no, but our word has become yes in Him.&rdquo; <em>For</em> introduces the reason for what is mentioned in the preceding verse. God is faithful, never changing, especially in regard to His promises concerning Christ. Hence, the word the apostles preached concerning Christ was likewise never changing, because the very Christ whom God promised in His faithful word and whom they preached in their gospel did not become yes and no. Rather, in Him is the Yes. Since the Christ whom they preached according to God&rsquo;s promises did not become yes and no, the word they preached concerning Him was not yes and no. Not only their preaching but also their living was according to what Christ is. They preached Christ and lived Him. They were not men of yes and no but men who were the same as Christ.</p>
<p>The apostles&rsquo; preaching of Christ never changed; likewise, in our preaching concerning Christ, we should never change our tune. We can testify that the tune of our preaching in this ministry has never changed. Although we have encountered much opposition to this ministry, today in our preaching of Christ, we still sound the same note. Our preaching of Christ in Him is yes.</p>
<h2 class="head3">39. The Anointed One</h2>
<p>For our experience and enjoyment, Christ is also the anointed One. &ldquo;The One who firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us is God, He who has also sealed us and given the Spirit in our hearts as a pledge&rdquo; (vv. 21-22).</p>
<h2 class="head4">a. God Firmly Attaching the Believers Together<br />
with the Apostles unto Christ</h2>
<p>God firmly attaches the believers together with the apostles unto Christ. This means that God has attached the apostles, the ministers, with all those to whom they ministered. The apostles, who preached Christ according to God&rsquo;s promises and lived Christ according to their preaching, and the believers, who received Christ according to the apostles&rsquo; preaching, are joined to Christ, becoming one with Him, through whom they say Amen before God to the great Yes of God&rsquo;s promises, which is Christ Himself. It is not they but God who attaches them together unto Christ. Their being one with Christ is of God and by God, not of themselves and by themselves.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 1:21 Paul speaks of being firmly attached with the believers unto Christ, the anointed One (Dan. 9:26; John 1:41). The Greek words rendered <em>firmly attaches us with you</em> can also be rendered &ldquo;firmly connects us with you.&rdquo; Literally, the word <em>attaches</em> means &ldquo;establishes.&rdquo; God establishes the apostles with the believers in Christ. This means that God firmly attaches the apostles together with the believers unto Christ, the anointed One. Hence, the apostles and the believers are one not only with Christ, the anointed One, but also with one another, sharing the anointing that Christ has received of God.</p>
