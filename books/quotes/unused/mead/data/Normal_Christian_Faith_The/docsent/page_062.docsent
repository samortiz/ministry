   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SECTION THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHRIST AND THE NEW LIFE CHAPTER NINE FORGIVENESS OF SINS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In accomplishing His work in man, God does not deal with individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He includes the whole of humanity in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Whatever He executes in Christ is carried out in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The doctrine of salvation is found in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God also gives man a new life in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God has no desire to change our outward behavior; He only wants to change our life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His one intention is to replace our old life with a new one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He can only accomplish this in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we are in Christ, this work of replacement is automatically applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A FEW PREREQUISITES</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, before God can dispense a new life to us, some matters need to be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If these things are not settled, God can never give life to us, and we will never have the right to receive anything from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We know that the most crucial matter in the Christian faith is the possession of a new life from God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But there are a few prerequisites, without which it is impossible to partake of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Therefore, these items occupy an important position and rightly demand our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>FORGIVENESS OF SINS</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first item is the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This provides God with a proper standing to dispense life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all know that the manifested behavior of our natural life is extremely evil.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is hopeless beyond measure.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our corrupt behavior is made known by the sins we commit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some commit rash and ugly sins, while others indulge in more refined and subtle ones.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In either case, all these sins have to be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They have to be forgiven justly and properly before we can receive the life of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE SOLUTION TO THE OLD LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Second, the very life which activates sins must be dealt with thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Unless this life is removed from its root, the possibility of sin remains; it will continue to bear corrupt fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Sin will still be manifested in our thoughts and actions.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God must give a final solution to our old life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It must be terminated once and for all.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>After these two things are taken care of, God can freely dispense a new life to us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we can walk according to it day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We will also be able to live a God-like life on earth and fulfill His purpose.</S>
