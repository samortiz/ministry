ONLY THE REVELATION<br />
ON THE SURFACE OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 2 says that Paul spoke God&rsquo;s wisdom in a mystery, the wisdom which has been hidden, which none of the rulers of this age have known (vv. 7-8), and which eye has not seen, ear has not heard, and which has not come up in man&rsquo;s heart (v. 9). Paul spoke this word to the wisdom- and philosophy-seeking Greeks, and he seemed to be saying that even the greatest Greek philosopher could not imagine God&rsquo;s mystery. This mystery was hidden in the Bible, but Paul spoke this mystery to the saints. When he preached the gospel to sinners, he spoke the revelation on the surface, but once the sinners were saved, he spoke the deep mystery in the Bible. Today a person who reads the Bible several times may think that he knows the content of the Bible; however, he may not know the mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, the Pharisees and the scribes read the Old Testament, spoke on the Old Testament, and even adorned themselves with verses from the Old Testament. They thought that they knew the Bible. One day, however, they asked the Lord Jesus a difficult question, and He told them that they knew neither the Scriptures nor the power of God (Matt. 22:29). The Pharisees and scribes thought that they knew the Scriptures, but the Lord said that they did not know the Scriptures. They knew the letter of the Scriptures, but they did not know the power of God. The power of God is a mystery. The Scriptures contain not only letters but also the power of God. A person who thinks that he knows the Bible may understand only the letter of the Bible. Many seminary professors, missionaries, pastors, and Bible teachers expound the Bible and write commentaries, thinking that they understand the Bible. However, I am afraid that the Lord Jesus might say they do not know the Scriptures. Some among us have read the Bible many times and have even worn out several Bibles, but the Lord Jesus might also tell them, &ldquo;You do not know the Scriptures.&rdquo; It is possible for us to know the things on the surface but not know the deep things in the Bible.</p>
<p>I was born and raised in a Christian family, and all the schools I attended from elementary school to technical college were Christian schools. With such a Christian background I was very familiar with the revelation on the surface of the Bible. When I was young, my mother would tell us the story of Joseph in such a way that we would cry in sympathy for Joseph. My mother also told us stories from the Gospels. I heard these stories again when I attended Sunday school. Later, the pastor told the same stories in the Sunday service. After I was saved, I heard the stories again. However, I did not know the deep mystery in the Bible.</p>
<p>When I was about twenty years old, a nationally renowned preacher spent much of his time in northern China. One day he came to my hometown and gave a message concerning the Lord Jesus&rsquo; coming so that man may have life and may have it abundantly (John 10:10). I had never heard a message on such a topic; it seemed like a new term, a new truth to me. However, after the message I was still baffled concerning what life is and what it means to have life abundantly.</p>
<p>After I was saved, I loved the Lord and the Bible very much. I read and wore out several Bibles. I also sought the truth. One day I went to the strictest sect among the Brethren; they were renowned for their Bible exposition. There I treasured what I heard. The first thing that I heard was concerning the seventy weeks in Daniel 9. The seventy weeks are divided into seven weeks, sixty-two weeks, and the last week (vv. 24-27). The last week can be divided into two parts: the first three and a half years and the last three and a half years. Each three and a half years is forty-two months, which is a thousand two hundred and sixty days. Because I liked what I heard, I was with the Brethren for seven and a half years and heard about both prophecies and types. Concerning prophecies, they spoke of the great human image in Daniel 2 with its head of gold, arms of silver, abdomen of bronze, two legs of iron, two feet partly of iron and partly of clay, and ten toes (vv. 31-45). They also spoke of the four beasts in Daniel 7 and of the fourth beast that grew ten horns on its head (vv. 3-7). They said that the ten toes of the great human image are the ten horns of the fourth beast. Besides prophecies, they also spoke of types. I learned much concerning the various types in the Bible.</p>
<p>However, I did not hear about the Spirit, about life, or about Christ living in me. I did not hear about the church being the Body of Christ or about the Body being the one new man. Even though I was saved in 1925, it was not until 1932 that I began to see the deep mystery in the Bible. By then I was more than twenty-five years old. I was born in a Christian family, educated in Christian schools, and had heard sermons in Christianity from a young age, but I knew only the revelation on the surface of the Bible. I did not know the deep mystery in the Bible.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_002.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_004.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Great Mystery-Christ and the Church &nbsp; pg 3</div><br></body></html>
