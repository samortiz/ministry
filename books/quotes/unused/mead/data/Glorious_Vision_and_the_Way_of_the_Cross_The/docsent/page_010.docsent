   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE STAGES OF THE LITERATURE WORK IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Up to now, the publication work in the Lord's recovery can be divided into two stages.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first stage was during the time of Brother Nee, which was from 1922 to 1952.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The second stage began from the publication of the magazine The Ministry of the Word in 1952 until now.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During this time, publications of my writings began to appear more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Prior to 1952, all the literature work was done by Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 1928 Brother Nee discontinued the publication of his first magazine, The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>By 1934 it was resumed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At its resumption I was entrusted with the editorial work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He took up editorship of another magazine of a deeper nature, The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first few years that I edited The Christian, I spent all the time working on Brother Nee's messages.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After I was done with most of them, I also put out some of my messages concerning the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have to know that the literature work among us was absolutely a personal ministry of Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It could not even be considered a work of us co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At that time, I only took a part in the service of it by editing the resumed The Christian magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The scope was not wide.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Besides me, there was another brother, Brother Yu, who had a part.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He paid much attention to the inner life, promoted the writings of the mystics, and did some translations.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But on the whole, the Gospel Bookroom then was the literature ministry of Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>By 1948 there was a great revival among us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The ministry of Brother Nee was recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He made fresh arrangements with the literature work of the Gospel Bookroom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Four magazines were simultaneously put out.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The deepest of them was The Present Testimony; it was taken up by Brother Nee himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A simpler one was The Way, in nature quite similar to The Christian, which Brother Nee asked me to take charge of.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Other than these two, there were a gospel magazine and another one called The Ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This latter one was equivalent to The News of the Churches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I was one of the editors of this magazine also.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By then, the scope of the literature work was expanded a little.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But within a year's time, the Communists took over mainland China, and the literature work was interrupted.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I then left the mainland to come to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Hence, 1952 was a watershed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first thirty years were mainly Brother Nee's writings.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since 1952 I continued in this ministry with the publication of The Ministry of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By 1963 when I went to the United States, I put out The Stream magazine in America and established the Living Stream Ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>By 1974 I began to put out the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Both the number of messages as well as the number of copies printed were big.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a short history of the literature work.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE DIFFICULTIES AMONG US COMING MAINLY FROM CHRISTIANS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I mention the history because for all these years I have contacted mostly co-workers and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>What bothers me within and gives me difficulty is the humanity of some of them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>During the past years, and especially during the first thirty years, I saw this bothering happen to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1922 the first church in the Lord's recovery was raised up in Brother Nee's hometown of Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It was the actual beginning of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>During the subsequent twenty or more years, Brother Nee encountered many sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There were hard times, criticisms, judgments, and attacks.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I have seen them coming wave after wave.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The few of us co-workers who were close to Brother Nee always felt that he did not seem to have a single day of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The storms came one after another.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Most of the difficulties came from the Christians and not a few from co-workers and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From 1950 on, I began to work overseas.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the beginning I was in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Later I moved from Taiwan, passing through East and Southeast Asia and eventually reaching the West.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>During the past thirty years, I also have encountered many difficulties, and most of them have been from Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brother Nee was not welcomed at that time in mainland China by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This is because the light that he saw, the way that he took, and the ground that he stood on was not welcomed by Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, some difficulties in the mainland came from Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We are not too concerned about these oppositions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>What concerns us is the oppositions that have arisen from among the elders and co-workers in the Lord's recovery during the past sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>One time fifty years ago, Brother Nee came to me and said, "Brother Witness, look how even Christians can lie!"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At that time I was quite surprised also.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It was hard for me to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That was the first alarm I received.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Furthermore, the Christian who Brother Nee referred to was not an ordinary Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He was a seeking, pursuing Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yet he lied.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Since then, the difficulties I encountered were one upon another.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>They caused great turmoil within me.</S>
