<h2 class="head2">War in Heaven</h2>
<p>Verses 7-9 say, &ldquo;And there was war in heaven: Michael and his angels went to war with the dragon. And the dragon warred and his angels. And they did not prevail, neither was their place found any longer in heaven. And the great dragon was cast down, the ancient serpent, he who is called the Devil and Satan, he who deceives the whole inhabited earth; he was cast to the earth, and his angels were cast down with him.&rdquo; <em>Dragon</em> indicates greatness, cruelty, and killing; <em>serpent</em> refers to the cunning one who always deceives; <em>devil</em> means accuser or slanderer; and Satan is the rebellious one.</p>
<p>Satan is cast down at this point because the overcomers, the man-child, are caught up to God. The principle here is that where the man-child is, there is no ground for the enemy. Satan has been judged on the cross of Christ, but this judgment needs to be executed. The church should carry out this judgment, but it has failed, so the overcomers must rise up to take the position of the church to execute God&rsquo;s sentence on Satan. Therefore, where the overcomers are, there is no ground, no place, left for the enemy of God. After the overcomers are raptured and caught up to God&rsquo;s throne, there will be no more place there for the enemy.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Overcoming the Enemy</h2>
<p>Verses 10-11 continue, &ldquo;And I heard a loud voice in heaven saying, Now has come the salvation and the power and the kingdom of our God and the authority of His Christ, for the accuser of our brothers has been cast down, who accuses them before our God day and night. And they overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb and because of the word of their testimony, and they loved not their soul-life even unto death.&rdquo; Our attitude must be that because of the blood we overcome the accusing one, Satan. All the time Satan accuses us before God and in our conscience. A seeking believer may deal with his conscience until it becomes a pure conscience. However, when the conscience becomes pure, it is easy for it to be weak; many times a keen conscience becomes a weak conscience. When our conscience is weak, the enemy always accuses us, causing us to constantly feel that we are not right. Sometimes a believer is caught by the enemy to such an extent that when he stands, he feels wrong, and when he sits, he feels wrong; when he speaks, he feels wrong, and when he is silent, he feels wrong. He always feels wrong. This is the accusation from the enemy. On the one hand, we do have to deal with our conscience, but on the other hand, we have to stand against the enemy by the covering of the blood. We have to not only claim but proclaim the power of the redeeming blood. We must have a strong conscience by the cleansing of the blood. We cannot stand against the accuser by ourselves. We have to stand against him by the blood.</p>
 <p>We also need to have the word of our testimony. When our conscience is weak, we cannot have a word of testimony, but when our conscience is void of offense, we have the boldness to give a word of testimony. A weak conscience always shuts our mouth, so we must have our conscience cleansed by the blood. Then we will have a pure conscience, a conscience void of offense, and we will have the boldness to give the word of our testimony.</p>
<p>We must also have the proper attitude. Whatever we are testifying by our word, we have to put our life into it, even unto death. We do not care about our life; this is the proper attitude. In order to overcome the enemy, we need to apply the blood, have a strong word of testimony, and put our life into our testimony. There is no other way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Dragon Persecuting the Woman</h2>
<p>Verses 13 and 14 say, &ldquo;And when the dragon saw that he was cast to the earth, he persecuted the woman who brought forth the man-child. And to the woman there were given the two wings of the great eagle that she might fly into the wilderness into her place, where she is nourished for a time and times and half a time from the face of the serpent.&rdquo; These two wings indicate the protection extended by God to His people. After God&rsquo;s people fled from Egypt, the Lord told them that He had borne them on eagles&rsquo; wings and brought them to Himself (Exo. 19:4). During the last three and a half years, God will do the same thing to the remainder of His people who will be left on the earth to pass through the period of the great tribulation. The woman is nourished for a time and times and half a time. <em>A time</em> is one year, <em>times</em> is two years, and <em>half a time</em> is half a year. During this time, God will nourish the remaining believers just as He nourished His people in the wilderness for forty years.</p>
<p>Revelation 12:15 says, &ldquo;And the serpent cast water as a river out of his mouth after the woman that he might cause her to be carried away by its current.&rdquo; Satan will send armies, signified by <em>waters,</em> to destroy the people of God. Jeremiah 46:7-9; 47:2-3; and Isaiah 8:7-8; 17:12-13; and 59:19 tell us that the armies of the enemies of God&rsquo;s people come like a flood. During the three and a half years, the devil will send his evil spirits to cause great armies to come to persecute the people of God. However, Revelation 12:16 says, &ldquo;And the earth helped the woman, and the earth opened its mouth and swallowed the river which the dragon cast out of his mouth.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Dragon Making War<br />
with the Rest of the Woman&rsquo;s Seed</h2>
<p>Verses 17 continues, &ldquo;And the dragon became angry with the woman and went away to make war with the rest of her seed, who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus.&rdquo; Those who keep the commandments of God are those Jews who by that time will fear God, and those who have the testimony of Jesus are the New Testament believers. These two groups of people are a part of the woman, the composition of all the people of God. The stronger part, the man-child, has been raptured by this time, but these two groups still remain on the earth. During the last three and a half years of this age, the Jews who fear God and the Christians who remain on earth will be persecuted by Satan and by the Antichrist.</p>
