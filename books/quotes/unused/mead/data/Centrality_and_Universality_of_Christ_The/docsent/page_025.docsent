   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LEARNING TO EXERCISE OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO CONTACT CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Now that we have discovered the Holy of Holies in our spirit, we have to learn how to enter into it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We have to learn how to get into the spirit, into the Holy of Holies, into the place of rest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is why in the preceding chapter I stressed the exercise of the spirit through prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>My intention was not to speak about prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My intention was to help you learn to exercise your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you are going to contact Christ, you have to exercise your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every contact with Christ is a real prayer in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have to learn all the time, day and night, to exercise your spirit to contact Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Real prayer is your talking in your spirit with Christ who is living within you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have been asked numerous times by people, "Brother Lee, will you tell me how many times you pray a day?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is really hard to say.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Can you count how many times you breathe a day?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you can count your breathing, I am afraid you are not a healthy person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You cannot count the breathing of a healthy person.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He is breathing all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When I am ministering to the saints, I am praying within.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I cannot minister without contacting Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes some sisters came to me and said, "Brother Lee, it is so easy for me to lose my temper.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is the best way for me to control my temper?"</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I told them not to try to control their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Whenever you are going to lose your temper, you had better contact Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then you will gain Christ more.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should learn to pray always 1 Thes 5:17 , not by the mind but by the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Always have a living talk with Him, the living One who is in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is wonderful, all-inclusive, central, and universal.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yet He is so small to you because He is confined within you and even imprisoned within you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He has been put into jail by you and has become so small within you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to learn to experience Christ as the central, universal, all-inclusive, subjective, and wonderful One.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His bountifulness is inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Do you need comfort?</S>

   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Do you need encouragement?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Just contact Him by your spirit, not by your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sometimes there is no need for you to utter clear words, but you can just say, "O Lord, O Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You just groan a little bit in this way, and you will be encouraged.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do you need power?</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is the Giver.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You should treasure Him, the Giver, more than His gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Do you need healing?</S>

   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Wherever you can breathe, there you can contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is so close to you, so available to you, and so handy to you.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He is even closer to you than the air because the air is outside of you, but He is within you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Learn to contact Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Learn to be always present with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Never be absent from Him.</S>
