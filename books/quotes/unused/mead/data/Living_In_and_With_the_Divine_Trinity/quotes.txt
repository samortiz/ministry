[1]  CONTENTS The Vision concerning the Divine Trinity The Vision concerning the Economy of the
[2]  As believers in Christ, we have such a marvelous, wonderful, excellent life, the uncreated life of God Himself, the eternal life.
[3]  In eternity past when the Father and the Son were fellowshipping, when the Father loved the Son, and when the Son was foreordained by the Triune God, the Spirit was also there because He is the eternal Spirit, the Spirit of the ages.
[4]  Acts 2:23 says that Christ was delivered up by the determined counsel of the Triune God see note 1 of verse 23 Recovery Version .
[5]  The Wuest translation of the New Testament says that Christ was delivered up by the counsel of God "in the council held by the Trinity."
[6]  The creation by God was for the old creation, but the incarnation is for the new creation.
[7]  John 1:14 reveals that the Triune God became incarnated.
[8]  Acts 10:40 and 41 show us that, on the one hand, God including the Father and the Spirit raised this One the Son on the third day; on the other hand, He the Son rose from the dead.
[9]  Regarding the Lord as a man, the New Testament tells us that God raised Him from the dead; considering Him as God, it tells us that He Himself rose from the dead.
[10]  We need to see the portions of the Word that reveal the Divine Trinity in the church life.
[11]  First Corinthians 12:28 reveals that the Triune God has placed some in the church: firstly apostles, secondly prophets, thirdly teachers...administrations.
[12]  Ephesians 4:16 says that out from Christ the Head the Son , all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.
[13]  OF THE DIVINE TRINITY Scripture Reading: Eph 1:9-11; 3:2-11 MYSTERY, WILL, GOOD PLEASURE, PURPOSE,
[14]  Ephesians 1:9-11 says, "Having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself unto a dispensation of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth, in Him, in whom also we were made an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who operates all things according to the counsel of His will."
[15]  The economy of the Divine Trinity, which is His plan, arrangement, or dispensation, was made by God the Father and the Spirit according to God's purpose of the ages eternal in Christ Jesus our Lord the Son Eph 3:11 .
[16]  The economy of the Divine Trinity became the apostles' stewardship of God's grace.
[17]  Ephesians 3:2 says, "If indeed you have heard of the stewardship of the grace of God which was given to me for you."
[18]  THE DISPENSING OF THE DIVINE TRINITY Scripture Reading: John 1:14, 16; 3:16; 1 John 4:9; Gal 4:4; Rom 8:3; John 6:32, 40; 5:24; Heb 2:14; 1 Tim 3:16; John 1:17b; 10:10b; 19:34; Titus 2:14; Matt 26:26; John 6:32-33, 48-51, 57b; Rev 2:17; 1 Cor 10:3; Rev 2:7; 22:2; Eph 3:8; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:6; Rom 8:11; Phil 1:19-21a; Rev 22:1; 1 Cor 12:13; 10:4
[19]  John 3:16 says that the Triune God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son, that everyone who believes in Him should have eternal life.
[20]  The dispensing of the Father can be seen in the Gospel of John.
[21]  The Son is our life supply as manna, even the hidden manna John 6:32-33, 48-51, 57b; 1 Cor 10:3 .
[22]  In John 6 the Lord compared Himself to the heavenly manna that was given to the children of Israel in ancient times.
[23]  In the seven epistles in Revelation written by the Lord Jesus to His seven churches, Jesus is revealed as the hidden manna 2:17 .
[24]  Ephesians 1:3 says, "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ the Son , who has blessed us with every spiritual blessing blessing of the Spirit in the heavenlies in Christ the Son ."
[25]  Ephesians 1:4-14 reveals the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, moving to dispense Himself into us.
[26]  We feel that a better translation of verses 4 and 5 is as follows: "According as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world that we should be holy and without blemish before Him, in love, predestinating us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will."
[27]  In this verse are the foreknowledge of God the Father, the sanctification of the Spirit, and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ the Son .
[28]  Matthew 1:20-23 also refers to the birth of Jesus, the Son of God.
[29]  Verses 20 and 21 show us the divine conception of the Holy Spirit and the birth of Jesus the Son .
[30]  In John 14:26 we see the Father sending the Comforter, the Holy Spirit, in the Son's name.
[31]  In this verse there is the blood of Christ the Son .
[32]  There is also Christ, the Son, through the eternal Spirit offering Himself without blemish to God God the Father .
[33]  In Matthew 28:19 the Lord charged His disciples to baptize people into the name of the Divine Trinity the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.
[34]  Then God God the Father bears witness to the great salvation by signs and wonders and by various works of power and by distributions of the Holy Spirit.
[35]  Ephesians 2:18 speaks of our access through Christ the Son in one Spirit unto the Father.
[36]  Why do we have to approach the Father through Christ in the Spirit?
[37]  First John 4:13 and 14 show that we are abiding in God the Father and He in us, that God the Father has given us of His Spirit, and that the Father has sent the Son as the Savior of the world.
[38]  Verse 13 says that God the Father has given us "of" His Spirit.
[39]  This means He has given us something of the Spirit, which indicates that all the riches of Christ are now the very content of the Spirit.
[40]  Romans 8:9 speaks of the Spirit of God the Father dwelling in us and also speaks of the Spirit of Christ the Son .
[41]  The Spirit of God and the Spirit of Christ are not two Spirits.
[42]  Ephesians 3:14-19 reveals the apostle praying to the Father; the Father strengthening the believers through the Spirit; Christ making His home in the believers' hearts; and the believers' being rooted and grounded in love, apprehending the dimensions of Christ, and knowing the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ to be filled unto all the fullness of the Triune God.
[43]  Paul prayed to the Father, "of whom every family in the heavens and on earth is named" 3:15 .
[44]  The Father is the source, not only of us, the regenerated believers, the household of faith Gal 6:10 , but also of the God-created mankind Luke 3:38 , of the God-created Israel Isa 63:16; 64:8 , and of the God-created angels Job 1:6 .
[45]  The other three families have only the created life of God as their source, but we, as the family of the faith, have the divine life with the divine nature of God Himself.
[46]  Ephesians 4:4 reveals that there is one Spirit for one Body with one hope.
[47]  All six chapters of the book of Ephesians are constructed with the Triune God.
[48]  In Ephesians 6 the Divine Trinity is moving for the defeating of His enemy, for dealing with His opponent.
[49]  For the Triune God to defeat His enemy, we need to be empowered in the Lord the Son and in the might of His strength v. 10 . Then we need to put on the whole armor of God the Father , that we may be able to stand against the stratagems of the devil v. 11 . Finally, verse 17 says that we need to receive the sword of the Spirit which the Spirit is the word of God the Father . Through the Divine Trinity, we receive the power and strength, we have the armor, and we also have the sword.
[50]  The love of God is the source, since God is the origin; the grace of the Lord is the course of the love of God, since the Lord is the expression of God; and the fellowship of the Spirit is the impartation of the grace of the Lord with the love of God, since the Spirit is the transmission of the Lord with God, for our experience and enjoyment of the Triune God the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[51]  Second Thessalonians 2:13 and 14 say, "But we ought to thank God always concerning you, brothers beloved by the Lord, because God chose you from the beginning unto salvation in sanctification of the Spirit and belief of the truth, to which also He called you through our gospel unto the obtaining of the glory of our Lord Jesus Christ."
[52]  Revelation 1:4 and 5 say, "Grace to you and peace from Him the Triune God including the Father who is, and who was, and who is coming, and from the seven Spirits who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ the Son , the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth."
[53]  In Revelation 22:1 and 2 there is a river of water of life the Spirit proceeding out of the throne of God the Triune God including the Father and of the Lamb the Son , and on the two sides of the river there is the tree of life Christ the Son .
[54]  These verses show us Jesus standing in the baptizing water, the Spirit of God descending as a dove upon Jesus the Son , and the Father speaking out of the heavens, saying, "This is My beloved Son, in whom I delight."
[55]  Romans 5:5 and 6 show the love of God God the Father having been poured out in our hearts through the Holy Spirit given to us and Christ the Son having died for the ungodly.
[56]  The pouring out of God's love was carried out through the Holy Spirit whom God has given to us.
[57]  Based upon this the Spirit was given to us, and through this Spirit given to us, the love of God has been poured out in our hearts.
[58]  Second Corinthians 5:5 and 6 show the Triune God having wrought us for our transfiguration; the Spirit having been given to us as the pledge; and we, at home in the body, being away from the Lord the Son .
[59]  In Romans 15:16 Paul said that he was a minister of Christ Jesus the Son to the nations, ministering as a priest the gospel of the Triune God, that the offering of the nations might be acceptable, having been sanctified in the Holy Spirit.
[60]  Paul was a priest of the gospel of the Triune God, ministering Christ Jesus, the Son, to the nations.
[61]  Eventually, the result of his work was to offer the nations to God as a sanctified entity through the Holy Spirit.
[62]  In 2 Corinthians 3:3 Paul tells the Corinthians that they are a letter of Christ the Son ministered by the apostles, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God the Triune God .
[63]  In 1 Corinthians 3:10-16 Paul speaks of the grace of God the Triune God given to Him v. 10 , the foundation laid being the Son Jesus Christ v. 11 , and the Spirit of God dwelling in us as the temple of God v. 16 . This portion of the Word describes how the church comes into being and how the church exists.
[64]  It shows the move of the Divine Trinity to have the church for His corporate expression.
[65]  In 1 Thessalonians 1:4-7 Paul told the believers that they were beloved by God the Father , that the gospel came to them in power and in the Holy Spirit with the joy of the Holy Spirit, so that they became imitators of the Lord the Son .
[66]  CHAPTER EIGHT LIVING IN THE DIVINE TRINITY 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:2; Acts 13:39; Rom 3:24; John 1:12-13; 3:6b, 15; Eph 1:13; John 15:5; 1 John 2:6, 24; 3:24; 2:27
[67]  In this chapter and in the following chapters, we want to see the practical experience of living in and with the Divine Trinity.
[68]  The Lord Jesus told us in John 15 that He is the vine and that we are the branches of the vine.
[69]  Following this sanctifying work, we were justified through the redemption of Christ Acts 13:39; Rom 3:24 .
[70]  After repenting, we did not know much about Christ, but we began to treasure Him, to appreciate Him.
[71]  We need to be those abiding in the Lord 1 John 2:6 .
[72]  To abide in the Triune God is to abide in the Lord.
[73]  In order to understand what it means to abide in God, we need to read 1 John 3:22-24: "And whatever we ask we receive from Him, because we keep His commandments and practice the things which are pleasing in His sight.
[74]  And this is His commandment, that we should believe in the name of His Son Jesus Christ and love one another, even as He gave a commandment to us.
[75]  The pronouns "Him" and "His" refer both to the Son and the Father who were previously mentioned v. 24 . They may also refer to the eternal life v. 25 . The anointing is the anointing of the Father, the Son, and the eternal life.
[76]  In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning our living in the Divine Trinity.
[77]  The Triune God is embodied in the Son, and the Son as the embodiment of the Triune God with all His members is the organism of the Divine Trinity to produce fruit for the expression of the Triune God.
[78]  Verse 62 says, "What then if you should see the Son of Man ascending where He was before?"
[79]  Verses 63 through 65 show us Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit.
[80]  At this point, the Spirit who gives life is brought in. After resurrection and through resurrection, the Lord Jesus, who had become flesh, became the Spirit who gives life, as is clearly mentioned in 1 Corinthians 15:45.
[81]  We need to be those living by Christ as the life supply John 6:57b-58 .
[82]  Galatians 5:25 says, "If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit."
[83]  We live Christ for His magnification only through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ v. 19 . When we live by the Spirit and walk by the Spirit, spontaneously we live Christ to magnify Him.
[84]  Eventually, what we see, what we believe, what we appreciate, and what we get is the grace.
[85]  We have seen that to live in the Divine Trinity is to dwell in Him as our home.
[86]  To live in Him is to abide in Him, to remain in Him.
[87]  Revelation 22 reveals the throne of God and of the Lamb, out of which proceeds the river of water of life v. 1 . On the two sides of this river grows the tree of life, yielding its fruit each month to be the food of God's redeemed for eternity v. 2 . God's redeemed will be His slaves and His priests v. 3 . While they are serving God, they will see God's face, and the Triune God's name will be on their forehead v. 4 . This indicates that they are one with the Triune God.
[88]  To live in the Divine Trinity is to abide in Christ, and to live with the Divine Trinity is to have Christ abide in us John 15:5 .
[89]  When we abide in Christ, Christ abides in us, and His abiding is His presence with us.
[90]  First John 3:24a speaks of God abiding in us.
[91]  To live with the Divine Trinity is to have the resurrected Christ living in us Gal 2:20b .
[92]  According to 2 Corinthians 1:21-22, God has anointed us and firmly attaches us unto Christ.
[93]  Second Corinthians 5 goes on to show us that God has wrought us for our transfiguration with the Spirit as the pledge vv.
[94]  Verse 17 says that we are a new creation in Christ.
[95]  Ephesians 3:16-17a speaks of Christ making His home in our hearts through faith by the Father strengthening us into our inner man through His Spirit with power according to the riches of His glory.
[96]  Since we love Christ, we need to allow Him to make His home in our hearts through faith.
[97]  In this chapter we want to see the revelation concerning our living with the Divine Trinity in the book of Philippians.
[98]  Many Christians do not think about God's move in this way.
[99]  Some in the Pentecostal movement like to shout, cry out, and even jump.
[100]  In Philippians 1:19 Paul said, "For I know that for me this shall turn out to salvation through your petition and the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ."
[101]  The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ is for us to live Christ for His magnification Phil 1:20-21a .
[102]  Paul said that he was magnifying Christ, as always, through the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.
[103]  In Philippians 2 God's operating is for us to work out our own salvation without murmurings and reasonings.
[104]  For this we need to take Christ as our model, our pattern.
[105]  In chapter three we see that we need to be those gaining Christ and being found in Christ vv.
[106]  We want to be those who know Christ and the power of His resurrection to be conformed to His death so that we can obtain the out-resurrection from among the dead as our reward Phil 3:11-14 .
[107]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN LIVING WITH THE DIVINE TRINITY 4 Scripture Reading: Matt 28:19; 2 Cor 13:14; Jude 20-21; Rev 1:4-5; John 17:22-23; Rev 21:22-23; 22:1-5
[108]  Our fellowship in this chapter may be considered as covering the concluding section of the entire revelation concerning the Divine Trinity in both the New Testament and the Old Testament.
[109]  At the conclusion of the Gospel of Matthew, the gospel of the kingdom, the Lord revealed that we have been baptized into the name the person of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit 28:19 .
[110]  To enjoy the Divine Trinity in full is to participate in the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.
[111]  Love is God the Father, grace as the outflow of love is Christ the Son, and the fellowship is the transmission of the Holy Spirit to transmit what the Son is as grace and what the Father is as love.
[112]  In Jude's concluding word of his Epistle, he charges us to pray in the Holy Spirit and keep ourselves in the love of God, awaiting the mercy of our Lord Jesus Christ unto eternal life vv.
[113]  The issue of our enjoyment of the Divine Trinity is the oneness.
[114]  This is why the Lord prayed, "And the glory which You have given Me I have given to them, that they may be one, even as We are one" v. 22 . Then the Son prayed that we would be perfected into one by having the Divine Trinity in us by living with the Divine Trinity v. 23 . To be perfected into one is the unique result, the unique issue, of our enjoyment of the Triune God.
[115]  The holy city as the tabernacle of God is for God to dwell in 21:2-3 , and God and the Lamb as the temple are for us to dwell in. God is our temple, and we are His tabernacle.
