 <h2 class="head1">KNOWING CHRIST, THE POWER OF HIS RESURRECTION,<br />
AND THE FELLOWSHIP OF HIS SUFFERINGS</h2>
<p>When you read this word, you may feel that you are not able to fulfill it. No, we cannot do it. This is why we need to pay attention to Paul&rsquo;s word in Philippians 3:10: &ldquo;To know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being conformed to his death&rdquo; (Gk.). Here we see that Paul desired to know three things: Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings. The &ldquo;Him&rdquo; in Philippians 3:10 is the &ldquo;Me&rdquo; in Matthew 16:24. We are not able to deny ourselves and go to the cross. But by the power of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection, we can do these things. Furthermore, through His resurrection, we can enter into the fellowship of His sufferings and be conformed to His death. Although in ourselves we cannot do this, we have One living within us who can do it.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WORKING OUT OUR SALVATION</h2>
<p>In Philippians 2:12 Paul says, &ldquo;Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling.&rdquo; In the New Testament the word salvation is used in various ways. Regarding our eternal salvation, we cannot work anything out. The Lord Jesus has done everything to accomplish this. But we do need to work out the salvation that enables us to be built up together. For the building of the church, we need to work out this salvation.</p>
<p>The entire book of Philippians is a book on the building. Among the Philippians there was division and the lack of building. Thus, the Apostle Paul wrote this Epistle to help them to be built up. Paul was telling them to work out the building, for this building was their salvation. Many Christians today are missing the building. This indicates that they are not working out their salvation.</p>
<p>Suppose you are living in the brothers&rsquo; house. When you first moved in, you thought living with the brothers would be wonderful. However, after a short period of time, you found that you could not get along with certain brothers. There is nothing you should do about this. Rather, remain in that brothers&rsquo; house to be killed. Although you cannot suffer this killing, there is One in you who can. You simply need to follow Him to work out your salvation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD WORKING IN US</h2>
<p>Philippians 2:13 tells us how to work out our salvation: &ldquo;For it is God which worketh in you both the willing and the working for his good pleasure&rdquo; (Gk.). God is in us doing this work. We simply need to exercise the key of self-denial and say amen to the Lord. We need to exercise the key to lock the self. If we all learn this lesson, we shall be built up together, and we shall become a strong testimony. We shall be able to testify that although we have different characters, dispositions, temperaments, and backgrounds, we can be one and can be built up together. This is precisely what the Lord is dealing with in Matthew 16.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOCKING UP THE SELF FOR THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>Matthew 16 has been veiled for centuries. Perhaps you have read this chapter again and again and again without knowing what the Lord was really saying. But now the Lord has given us further understanding to see how the church can be built up through the exercise of the keys. We need to be afraid of ourselves and use the key to lock up ourselves. We should do this not only in the church life, but also in our family life. If you exercise the key to lock the self, you will have no problems in your marriage. All the problems are from Satan who comes out through the gate of the self. When this gate is locked, Satan is confined, and there are no problems.</p>
<p>In these messages I am not concerned with mere doctrine. Instead, I am presenting to you what I have learned through years of suffering. We need to find out how the church can be built up. If you say that the church is built up through the cross and the resurrection, that is still too doctrinal. We need to go on to learn to exercise the key of self-denial to lock up the self in every situation. Whether a situation is for you or against you, you must lock up the self. Whether the brothers love you and welcome you or hate you and do not welcome you, you still need to lock your self. If you do this, there will be no problems, and it will be possible to have the building of the church. But without the locking up of the self, there is no possibility of having the building.</p>
