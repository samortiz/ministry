[1]  The Operation of the Triune God Upon the Elect for Their Participation in His Full Salvation
[2]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE ONE AN INTRODUCTORY WORD Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:1-2
[3]  With this message we begin our Life-study of the Epistles of 1 and 2 Peter and Jude.
[4]  In the past we have somewhat neglected the writings of Peter.
[5]  Peter s writings are brief, containing only eight chapters.
[6]  Nevertheless, the span of Peter s writings is vast.
[7]  For example, in 1:2 he speaks of the foreknowledge of God the Father.
[8]  PARTICIPATION IN HIS FULL SALVATION Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:1-2 A TRANSFORMED PERSON
[9]  First Peter 1:2 says, According to the foreknowledge of God the Father, in sanctification of the Spirit, unto obedience and sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ: Grace to you and peace be multiplied.
[10]  The phrase according to the foreknowledge of God the Father modifies chosen in verse 1.
[11]  Here, the divine economy through the operation of the Trinity of the Godhead for the believers participation in the Triune God is unveiled.
[12]  Grace is God as our enjoyment John 1:17; 1 Cor 15:10 .
[13]  AND ITS ISSUES 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:3-4
[14]  In the writings of Peter a single word is often rich in meaning.
[15]  Take, for example, Peter s use of the word sprinkling in 1:2.
[16]  The inheritance in verse 4 comprises the coming salvation of our souls see verses 5 and 9 , the grace to be received at the unveiling of the Lord v. 13 , the glory to be revealed 5:1 , the unfading crown of glory 5:4 , and the eternal glory 5:10 . All these items of our eternal inheritance are related to the divine life which we received through regeneration and which we are experiencing and enjoying through our entire Christian life.
[17]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE FOUR THE SANCTIFICATION OF THE SPIRIT,
[18]  AND THE LIVING HOPE Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:2-4 DOCTRINE CONFIRMED BY EXPERIENCE
[19]  Now we come to the obedience and sprinkling of the blood.
[20]  The obedience of the blood and the sprinkling of the blood are Jewish, Old Testament, dispensational matters.
[21]  The use of these terms in 1:2 implies and indicates that in Peter s writings the dispensation has changed from the Old Testament to the New Testament.
[22]  In the Old Testament God gave Moses commandments concerning the law and concerning the blood of animals, a type of the blood of Christ shed for our redemption.
[23]  In 1:3 and 4 Peter goes on to say, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from among the dead, unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you.
[24]  For many years, I have been trying to understand the words living hope.
[25]  I could not understand how this living hope could be the inheritance, as indicated by the fact that, according to grammar, the inheritance in verse 4 is in apposition to the living hope in verse 3.
[26]  THE THREE STAGES OF GOD S FULL SALVATION The Initial Stage
[27]  The full salvation of the Triune God comprises many items in three stages.
[28]  The first stage, the initial stage, is the stage of regeneration.
[29]  In this stage, God has justified us through the redemption of Christ Rom 3:24-26 and regenerated us in our spirit with His life by His Spirit John 3:3-6 .
[30]  Thus, we have received God s eternal salvation Heb 5:9 and His eternal life John 3:15 , and become His children John 1:12-13 , who shall not perish forever John 10:28-29 .
[31]  At this point I would like to comment further on the Spirit s sanctification.
[32]  The sanctification of the Spirit is of two aspects: the sanctification of the Spirit before justification, the first aspect, and the sanctification of the Spirit after justification, the second aspect.
[33]  We saw from verse 5 that we are being guarded by the power of God through faith unto salvation and that this salvation is ready to be revealed at the last time.
[34]  The power of God is the cause by which we are being guarded, and faith is the means through which the power of God becomes effective in guarding us.
[35]  In verse 7 Peter indicates that the proving of our faith may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the unveiling of Jesus Christ.
[36]  Peter s use of the word unveiling in verse 7 is significant.
[37]  What is the difference between praise, glory, and honor?
[38]  It is characteristic of Peter that he does not stop with the word praise but goes on to mention glory and honor.
[39]  In 1:1 and 2, we have the operation of the Triune God: the selection of God the Father, the sanctification of the Spirit, and the sprinkling of the blood of Jesus Christ.
[40]  Then in the remainder of the first chapter we have the full salvation of the Triune God.
[41]  The Father s regeneration has brought His eternal life into us and has also brought us into the enjoyment of this eternal life.
[42]  The initial stage, the stage of regeneration, is composed of redemption, sanctification positional 1:2; 1 Cor 6:11 , justification, reconciliation, and regeneration.
[43]  In the progressing stage of salvation God is also causing us to grow in His life 1 Cor 3:6-7 .
[44]  He is transforming us by renewing the inward parts of our soul by the life-giving Spirit 2 Cor 3:6, 17-18; Rom 12:2; Eph 4:23 through the working of all things Rom 8:28 .
[45]  He is building us together into a spiritual house for His dwelling 1 Pet 2:5; Eph 2:22 , and He is maturing us in His life Rev 14:15 for the completion of His full salvation.
[46]  First Peter 1:3-25 is concerned with the full salvation of the Triune God and its issues.
[47]  Verses 3 through 9 cover the Father s regeneration unto a living hope; verses 10 through 12, the Spirit s application; and verses 13 through 25, Christ s redemption.
[48]  In verse 11 Peter says that the prophets searched not only into what time but also into what manner of time.
[49]  Although it is easy to understand the meaning of what time, it is difficult to know what Peter means by what manner of time.
[50]  The salvation in verse 10 refers to the salvation of the soul mentioned in the preceding verse.
[51]  The phrase salvation of the soul indicates a full salvation.
[52]  In 1:10 and 11 Peter says, Concerning which salvation the prophets, who prophesied concerning the grace unto you, sought out and searched out, searching into what or what manner of time the Spirit of Christ in them made clear, witnessing beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glories after these.
[53]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that in verse 11 Peter refers not only to what time but also to what manner of time Christ would suffer and be glorified.
[54]  Peter may have been a fisherman, but he was also an excellent writer.
[55]  He spent a great deal of time studying the Old Testament.
[56]  He found out into what the prophets had searched, and he had the boldness to say that while the prophets were searching, the Spirit of Christ was in them.
[57]  In verse 11 Peter says that the prophets witnessed beforehand the sufferings of Christ and the glories after these.
[58]  Christ first suffered and then entered into glory Luke 24:26 .
[59]  The sufferings of Christ, as revealed to the prophets and prophesied by them in Psalm 22:1, 6-8, 12-18; Isaiah 53:2-10a, 12b; Daniel 9:26; and Zechariah 12:10 and 13:6-7, are for the accomplishment of God s redemption, which has solved all the problems between man and God, and terminated the old creation on the negative side, and has released the eternal life of God for the fulfillment of His eternal purpose on the positive side.
[60]  The glories of Christ are for His glorification, which He asked of the Father before His crucifixion John 17:1 , and which is for the execution of God s New Testament economy for the carrying out of God s eternal purpose.
[61]  The sufferings of Christ and the glorification of Christ with the glories in different steps the factors of God s full redemption and salvation being applied to us and experienced by us, equal the salvation mentioned in 1 Peter 1:5, 9-10.
[62]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE TEN PETER S WELL-SPEAKING
[63]  Verse 3 says, Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.
[64]  It is important for us to realize why Peter uttered such a well-speaking concerning the Triune God in a letter written to scattered saints.
[65]  According to 1:1, this Epistle was written to the chosen pilgrims of the dispersion of Pontus, Galatia, Cappadocia, Asia, and Bithynia.
[66]  The fact that the believers to whom this Epistle was addressed were scattered in these provinces of Asia Minor was a significant part of the background of Peter s well-speaking concerning God.
[67]  In verse 4 Peter goes on to say, Unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you.
[68]  The major point in this verse concerns the inheritance.
[69]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE ELEVEN THE FULL SALVATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD
[70]  The first twelve verses of 1 Peter 1 are deep and full of complications.
[71]  In verse 13 Peter also charges us to set our hope completely on the grace.
[72]  This hope is the living hope which has issued from regeneration v. 3 . We need to set our living hope completely on the grace that is being brought to us at the unveiling of Jesus Christ.
[73]  In verse 17 Peter continues, And if you call upon as Father the One who without respect of persons judges according to each one s work, pass the time of your sojourning in fear.
[74]  In this verse Peter comes to the matter of God s government, the particular point that he covers in his Epistles.
[75]  AND ITS ISSUES 7 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:15, 18-19 BECOMING HOLY IN ALL OUR MANNER OF LIFE
[76]  Before we go on to verses 18 and 19, I would like to say a further word concerning the matter of becoming holy in all our manner of life 1:15 .
[77]  Verse 18 says, Knowing that you were redeemed not with corruptible things, with silver or gold, from your vain manner of life handed down from your fathers.
[78]  According to grammar, verse 18 is related to pass the time of your sojourning in fear in verse 17.
[79]  This indicates that in order to pass the time of our sojourning in fear, we need a deep realization concerning the redemption of Christ.
[80]  In verse 18 Peter says that we were redeemed not with corruptible things.
[81]  The blood of Christ is a material substance, yet its effectiveness, function, worth, power, and authority are eternal and incorruptible.
[82]  The blood of Christ, by which we are sprinkled and thus marked out from common people, is more precious than silver and gold.
[83]  For this we should have a holy fear, a healthy, serious caution before God that, as God s elect, redeemed with such a high price, we would not miss the purpose of this most high redemption of Christ.
[84]  Verse 19 says, But with precious blood, as of a lamb without blemish and without spot, the blood of Christ.
[85]  It is important to understand what Peter means by blemish and spot and to know the difference between them.
[86]  In 1:20 Peter speaks of Christ: Who was foreknown before the foundation of the world, but was manifested in the last times for your sake.
[87]  Christ was foreordained, prepared, by God to be His redeeming Lamb John 1:29 for His elect according to His foreknowledge before the foundation of the world.
[88]  In eternity past, on the day of the ordination of Christ and all the believers, God could see all the millions of Adam s descendants.
[89]  In a very real sense, all of Adam s descendants were there before Him.
[90]  Then God could choose, approve, and ordain certain ones, for no reason that is apparent to us.
[91]  AND ITS ISSUES 9 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:22-25 THE PURIFICATION OF OUR SOULS
[92]  In order to understand what it means to purify our souls by obedience to the truth, we must be clear concerning the meaning of truth in this verse.
[93]  Truth here is the sanctifying truth, which is God s word of reality John 17:17 .
[94]  In verse 22 Peter says that we purify our souls by obedience to the truth unto unfeigned brotherly love.
[95]  Since the purification of our souls concentrates our entire being on God that we may love Him with all our heart, with all our soul, and with all our mind Mark 12:30 , it results in unfeigned brotherly love.
[96]  We love from the heart fervently all those whom God loves.
[97]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE FIFTEEN GROWTH IN LIFE AND ITS RESULTS 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:1-4, 6-8 A PICTURE OF THE CHURCH LIFE
[98]  First Peter chapter one is a complete section of this book.
[99]  This section clearly reveals that the Triune God operates upon His chosen people to carry out His economy and to bring them into the full participation of Himself so that they may enjoy Him as grace.
[100]  Verse 2 says, As newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow unto salvation.
[101]  Born through regeneration 1:3, 23 , the believers become babes who can grow in life unto further salvation, and that for God s building, by being nourished with the spiritual milk.
[102]  Guileless in verse 2 does not mean unadulterated, in contrast to less pure teachings; instead, it is guileless in contrast to the guile in verse 1.
[103]  This understanding of verses 1 and 2 comes from experience.
[104]  It was also through experience that I have come to understand Peter s writing.
[105]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE SIXTEEN GROWTH IN LIFE AND ITS RESULTS 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:1-4, 6-8
[106]  First Peter 2:1 and 2 say, Therefore, putting away all malice and all guile and hypocrisies and envyings and all evil speakings, as newborn babes, long for the guileless milk of the word, that by it you may grow unto salvation.
[107]  In the foregoing message we pointed out that we need to do two things.
[108]  Nourishing food will cause transformation only when it is given to something living and organic.
[109]  If you try to give nourishment to something lifeless and inorganic, that thing would become corrupt and unclean.
[110]  In verse 4 Peter goes on to speak of Christ as a living stone: To whom coming, a living stone, having been rejected by men, but with God chosen, held in honor.
[111]  The Greek word rendered coming can also be translated approaching, drawing near, coming forward.
[112]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE SEVENTEEN GROWTH IN LIFE AND ITS RESULTS 3 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:4, 6-8
[113]  We have pointed out that a living stone not only possesses life but also grows in life.
[114]  In verse 7 Peter goes on to say, To you therefore who believe is the preciousness; but to the unbelieving, A stone which the builders rejected, this became the head of the corner.
[115]  The very Christ chosen by God as a stone, even a cornerstone held in honor, is the preciousness to His believers.
[116]  We should not regard Peter as being too strict because of the way he wrote in 2:6-8.
[117]  Actually, the Lord Jesus was the first to utter such a strict word.
[118]  In Matthew 21:42 He asked the religious leaders, Have you never read in the Scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, this has become the cornerstone; this was from the Lord, and it is marvelous in our eyes?
[119]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE EIGHTEEN GROWTH IN LIFE AND ITS RESULTS 4 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:5, 9-10 GROWING UNTO SALVATION FOR THE BUILDING
[120]  In this message we shall consider 2:5, 9 and 10.
[121]  Verse 5 says, You yourselves also, as living stones, are being built up a spiritual house, into a holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices acceptable to God through Jesus Christ.
[122]  In verse 5 Peter indicates that the believers are living stones.
[123]  We, the believers in Christ, are living stones, like Christ, through regeneration and transformation.
[124]  In verse 5 Peter speaks of both a spiritual house and a holy priesthood.
[125]  Spiritual denotes the qualification of the divine life that lives and grows; holy, the qualification of the divine nature that separates and sanctifies.
[126]  The house of God subsists mainly by the divine life; hence, it is spiritual.
[127]  We are such a race, priesthood, nation, and people so that we may tell out the virtues of Him who has called us out of darkness into His marvelous light.
[128]  The Greek word rendered tell out also means proclaim abroad.
[129]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE NINETEEN CHRISTIAN LIFE AND ITS SUFFERINGS 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:11-20 GOD S DESIRE
[130]  God wants a built up house and a priesthood for His expression.
[131]  The beauty of Peter s thought is seen in the outline of this Epistle.
[132]  I can testify that I spent a great deal of time to outline 1 Peter.
[133]  Introduction to the Pilgrims in Dispersion under the Operation of the Triune God 1:1-2 Full Salvation of the Triune God and Its Issues 1:3-25 The Father s Regeneration unto a Living Hope, an Inheritance Kept in the Heavens and Ready to Be Revealed at the Last Time 1:3-9 The Spirit s Application through the Prophets Prophesying and the Apostles Preaching 1:10-12 Christ s Redemption unto a Holy Life by the Holy Nature, and Brotherly Love through Purification by the Sanctifying Truth, Based on Regeneration of the Incorruptible Seed through the Living Word of God 1:13-25 Growth in Life and Its Results 2:1-10 Growing by Feeding on the Milk of the Word unto Full Salvation 2:1-3 Transformed unto the Building Up of a Spiritual House for God s Dwelling, a Holy Priesthood for God s Service 2:4-8 To Tell Out the Virtues of the Calling One 2:9-10 Christian Life and Its Sufferings 2:11 4:19 A Life in an Excellent Manner toward All Men in All Concerns 2:11 3:13 As Pilgrims among the Nations 2:11-12 Toward Human Institution 2:13-17 Servants toward Masters 2:18-20 The Model of Christ 2:21-25 In Marriage Life 3:1-7 In Common Life 3:8-13 Suffering for Righteousness by the Will of God as Christ Did 3:14-22 Arming Themselves with the Mind of Christ for Suffering 4:1-6 Ministering as Good Stewards of the Varied Grace of God 4:7-11 Rejoicing in Sharing the Sufferings of Christ 4:12-19 The Elders Shepherding and Its Reward 5:1-4 The Shepherding Patterns 5:1-3 The Chief Shepherd s Reward 5:4 The Mighty Hand of God and Its Goal 5:5-11 Humbled under God s Mighty Hand 5:5-9 Perfected and Grounded by the God of All Grace 5:10-11 Conclusion 5:12-14 Testimony of the True Grace of God 5:12 Greetings 5:13-14
[134]  If we consider Peter s thought according to this outline printed above, we shall see that in this Epistle he covers five main points: full salvation, growth in life, the Christian life, the elders shepherding, and the mighty hand of God.
[135]  If we get into the depths of this book, we shall see that these are the basic matters Peter was seeking to cover as he wrote.
[136]  With God s full salvation, we have a twofold issue, a holy manner of life and brotherly love.
[137]  In 2:12 Peter goes on to say, Having your manner of life excellent among the nations, that wherein they speak against you as evildoers, they may, by observing your good works, glorify God in the day of visitation.
[138]  The manner of life here must be the holy manner of life 1:15 and the good manner of life in Christ 3:16 , a life not only for God but filled and saturated with God.
[139]  In verse 12 Peter is saying that if we have an excellent manner of life among the nations, they will eventually glorify God concerning us in the day of visitation.
[140]  In this verse Peter seems to be telling the saints, The opposers now speak evil against you.
[141]  But if you live a life that is excellent among them, a life that is beautiful in quality and excellent in manner, they will observe your good works and glorify God in the day of visitation.
[142]  In verses 19 and 20 Peter says, For this is grace, if anyone because of conscience toward God bears sorrows, suffering unjustly.
[143]  The Greek word rendered grace in verse 19 is charis, referring here to the motivation of the divine life within us and its expression in our life, becoming in our behavior gracious and acceptable in the eyes of both man and God v. 20 . The same Greek word is used in Luke 6:33-34 and Romans 7:25 for thanks.
[144]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE TWENTY CHRISTIAN LIFE AND ITS SUFFERINGS 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 2:21-23 A FURTHER WORD CONCERNING GRACE
[145]  In 2:13-20 we have several matters related to our daily life.
[146]  Toward the end of this portion Peter says in verse 19, This is grace, and at the end of verse 20, This is grace with God.
[147]  Based upon what he says in verses 19 and 20, Peter goes on to say in verse 21, For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model that you should follow in His steps.
[148]  Christ s living on earth was a model of this grace.
[149]  In the previous message we considered what it means for Christ to be our model.
[150]  We saw that He is the master copy, the original copy, and that through a process of spiritual xeroxing we are becoming a reproduction of Christ.
[151]  First Peter 2:21 and 22 say, For to this you were called, because Christ also suffered on your behalf, leaving you a model that you should follow in His steps; who did no sin, nor was guile found in His mouth.
[152]  In 2:23 Peter says that God the Father is the One who always judges righteously.
[153]  This means that He governs in a righteous way.
[154]  Now we need to ask why Peter uses the expression live to righteousness.
[155]  This is related to the fulfilling of God s governmental requirements.
[156]  Actually, God s government requires just one thing righteousness.
[157]  In 2:18-25 we have five important matters, five aspects of Christ: grace, the model, the Savior, the Shepherd, and the Overseer.
[158]  Christ is the grace within us, and He is the model for our spiritual direction.
[159]  First Peter 3:1-13 is still in the section concerned with a life in an excellent manner toward all men in all concerns 2:11 3:13 .
[160]  In this section we have already covered the living of the believers as pilgrims among the nations 2:11-12 , the believers being subject to every human institution 2:13-17 , the subjection of household servants to their masters 2:18-20 , and the model of Christ 2:21-25 .
[161]  In 3:1-7 Peter is concerned with marriage life, and in 3:8-13, with common life.
[162]  In verse 1 Peter tells the wives that if they subject themselves to their own husbands, the husbands will be gained without a word through the manner of life of their wives.
[163]  The word here refers to the word of God 1 Pet 1:23, 25; Rom 10:8; Eph 1:13 .
[164]  In the previous message we considered 3:1-6, Peter s word to the wives concerning married life.
[165]  In verse 1 Peter indicates that, as household servants are subject to their masters, so the wives should be subject to their own husbands.
[166]  Then in verses 3 and 4 Peter points out that what is costly in the sight of God is the adornment of a meek and quiet spirit, which is the hidden man of the heart.
[167]  In verse 7 Peter says that the husbands should dwell together with their wives according to knowledge.
[168]  The phrase according to knowledge can easily be misinterpreted.
[169]  Grace of life is God as life and life supply to us in His Trinity the Father as the source of life, the Son as the course of life, and the Spirit as the flow of life, flowing within us with the Son and the Father 1 John 5:11-12; John 7:38-39; Rev 22:1 .
[170]  In this message we come to 3:14-22, a section that speaks of suffering for righteousness by the will of God, as Christ suffered.
[171]  Although this portion is included in the section on Christian life and its sufferings, it actually speaks concerning Christ s death, resurrection, and ascension.
[172]  These verses involve two major problems that have been debated over the years, one problem related to Christ s death and the other regarding baptism in relation to His resurrection and ascension.
[173]  Verses 14 and 15 say, But even if you suffer because of righteousness, you are blessed; and do not be afraid with fear from them, nor be troubled, but sanctify Christ as Lord in your hearts, being always ready for a defense to everyone who asks of you an account concerning the hope in you, but with meekness and fear.
[174]  In verse 16 Peter goes on to say, Having a good conscience, that wherein you are spoken against as evil-doers, those who revile your good manner of life in Christ may be put to shame.
[175]  Since the conscience is a part of our human spirit Rom 9:1; 8:16 , to care for our conscience is to care for our spirit before God.
[176]  The Christian good manner of life should be one that is in Christ.
[177]  According to verse 18, Christ was put to death in flesh, but made alive in spirit.
[178]  This is not the Holy Spirit, but the spirit which is Christ s spiritual nature Mark 2:8; Luke 23:46 .
[179]  The crucifixion only put Christ to death in His flesh, which He received through His incarnation John 1:14 , not in His spirit.
[180]  In the previous message we covered the matters of sanctifying Christ as Lord in our hearts, having a good conscience, Christ dying concerning sins, the righteous on behalf of the unrighteous, and Christ, being put to death in the flesh, but made alive in spirit and going in His enlivened and empowered spirit to make a proclamation to the spirits in prison, to the rebellious angels.
[181]  In this message we shall pay special attention to what Peter says in verses 20 and 21 concerning baptism.
[182]  The Greek word rendered appeal is eperotema, a question, an inquiry.
[183]  The right meaning of the phrase seems to be, as Alford said, the seeking after God of a good and pure conscience, which governs the proper Christian life.
[184]  Peter s thought here may be that baptism is the appeal to God of the baptized one for a good conscience unto God.
[185]  Baptism, as a symbol, a counterpart of our belief in all the accomplishments of Christ, testifies that all the problems we have before God and with God have been solved.
[186]  Hence, it is also a testimony, witnessing that in our conscience there is no more offense, but rather we are full of peace and confidence that we have been baptized into the Triune God Matt 28:19 and organically united with Him through the resurrection of Christ, that is, by Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of life.
[187]  Verse 21 ends with the words through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.
[188]  Apart from the resurrection of Jesus Christ, we could not have resurrection life, and we could not have the life-giving Spirit within us.
[189]  Through faith and through baptism we all have been put into an organic union with the Triune God.
[190]  It is through the resurrection of Christ that we are brought into the Triune God.
[191]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE TWENTY-SIX CHRISTIAN LIFE AND ITS SUFFERINGS 8 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 4:1-4 ARMED WITH THE MIND OF CHRIST
[192]  In 4:1-6 Peter comes to the matter of the believers arming themselves with the mind of Christ for suffering.
[193]  The word arm indicates that the Christian life is a life of battle.
[194]  In 4:1 Peter points out that those who have suffered in the flesh have ceased from sin.
[195]  Pleasure heats up the lusts of our flesh v. 2 ; suffering cools them down.
[196]  The purpose of Christ s redemption is to deliver us from our inherited vain manner of life 1:18-19 .
[197]  In verse 3 Peter not only speaks of the indulgence in lusts; he also includes unlawful idolatries.
[198]  Wherever there is the indulgence in lust there will be idolatry.
[199]  Verse 1 says, Christ, therefore, having suffered in the flesh, you also arm yourselves with the same mind, because he who has suffered in the flesh has ceased from sin.
[200]  Peter s word concerning arming ourselves indicates fighting, warfare.
[201]  This kind of persecution is considered by Peter in this book as God s judgment, according to the government of God, which begins from the house of God v. 17 . The gospel was preached to these dead believers while they were living, in order that they might on one hand be judged, dealt with, by God through the opposers persecution according to men in the flesh, but, on the other hand, live by believing in Christ according to God in the spirit.
[202]  If we would understand what Peter says concerning judgment in verse 6, we need to have a full view of the entire Epistle.
[203]  God s judgment began from the rebellious angels 2 Pet 2:3-4 in Genesis 6.
[204]  In 4:7-11 Peter goes on to speak about ministering as good stewards of the varied grace of God.
[205]  Verse 7 says, But the end of all things has drawn near; therefore, be soberminded and be sober unto prayers.
[206]  This section of 1 Peter speaks of rejoicing in sharing the sufferings of Christ.
[207]  In verse 13 Peter says that as we share the sufferings of Christ, we should rejoice so that at the unveiling of His glory we may rejoice exultingly.
[208]  According to my understanding, this means that we shall not only be joyful inwardly, but we shall sound out our joy.
[209]  Verse 15 says, For let none of you suffer as a murderer, or a thief, or an evildoer, or as a meddler into others affairs.
[210]  Literally, a meddler into others affairs is an overseer of others affairs.
[211]  The thought of dispensational discipline is found not only in the writings of Peter, but also in the Epistles of Paul.
[212]  Paul deals with this matter in 1 Corinthians 11:27-32.
[213]  In verses 27 through 29 Paul says, So then, whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner shall be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord.
[214]  In the previous message we began to cover the section from 4:12-19.
[215]  In this message we shall continue with verses 17 through 19 of chapter four.
[216]  In verse 18 Peter goes on to say, And if the righteous is saved with difficulty, where will the ungodly and sinner appear?
[217]  Here the righteous refers to the believers, who became righteous by being justified through their faith in Christ Rom 5:1 and by living a righteous life in Christ Phil 3:9; 2 Cor 5:21; Rev 19:8 .
[218]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE THIRTY GOD S GOVERNMENTAL JUDGMENT 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 1:17; 2:23; 4:5-6, 12, 17-19 A BASIC THOUGHT IN PETER S WRITINGS
[219]  The concept of God s governmental judgment is a basic thought in Peter s composition of this Epistle.
[220]  God s judgment as seen in 1 Peter may be likened to the hub of a wheel.
[221]  Peter is not speaking of the final judgment of the soul.
[222]  The thing spoken of here is the daily judgment of God s government in this world, exercised with regard to His children.
[223]  THE RESULTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF JUDGMENT Disciplinary Dealing
[224]  We have seen that the results of the different kinds of judgments are not the same.
[225]  First Peter 4:5 says, speaking of unbelievers, Who shall render an account to Him who is ready to judge the living and the dead.
[226]  The relative pronoun who here refers to the nations 4:3 , who are astonished at the believers different manner of life and speak evil of them 4:4 .
[227]  They have to render an account by relating to the Lord all that they have done and spoken in their entire life.
[228]  In this message we shall continue our review of God s governmental judgment as revealed in the first four chapters of 1 Peter.
[229]  First Peter 4:17 says, Because it is time for the judgment to begin from the house of God; and if first from us, what will be the end of those who disobey the gospel of God?
[230]  In verse 19 Peter continues, Wherefore, let those also who suffer according to the will of God commit their souls in welldoing to a faithful Creator.
[231]  Persecution can damage only the body of the suffering believers; it cannot damage their souls Matt 10:28 .
[232]  Many of us have been addicted to traditional practices.
[233]  When we read the Bible, study the Bible, or listen to a message, we may apply what we read or hear in a traditional and even a light way.
[234]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE THIRTY-TWO THE ELDERS SHEPHERDING AND ITS REWARD Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 5:1-4
[235]  In 5:1 Peter says, Therefore, the elders among you I entreat, who am a fellow-elder and witness of the sufferings of Christ, who am also a partaker of the glory about to be revealed.
[236]  The word therefore indicates that 5:1-11 is a concluding word to the preceding section 4:12-19 concerning suffering for Christ in nobly doing right.
[237]  In 5:2 Peter says, Shepherd the flock of God among you, overseeing not by way of compulsion, but willingly, according to God; not seeking gain by base means, but eagerly.
[238]  To shepherd the flock of God requires suffering for the Body of Christ, as Christ suffered Col 1:24 .
[239]  Verse 5 says, In like manner, younger men, be subject to elders, and all of you gird yourselves with humility toward one another, because God resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
[240]  Peter says that God not only resists the proud, but gives grace to the humble.
[241]  Strictly speaking, this grace refers to the Triune God Himself as the life supply being multiplied in the humble believer.
[242]  In verse 7 Peter goes on to say, Casting all your anxiety on Him, because it matters to Him concerning you.
[243]  The word casting here means throwing upon, that is, committing to, giving up to.
[244]  Your adversary, the Devil, as a roaring lion walks about, seeking someone to devour.
[245]  To be sober is to have a clear mind of sobriety and self-control so that we may know, especially as disclosed in this chapter, God s purpose in disciplining us and His enemy s scheme to destroy us.
[246]  LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST PETER MESSAGE THIRTY-FOUR THE MIGHTY HAND OF GOD AND ITS GOAL 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Pet 5:5-14 THE HAND OF GOD IN HIS JUDGMENT
[247]  In 5:6 Peter says, Therefore, be humbled under the mighty hand of God, that He may exalt you in due time.
[248]  Preachers and teachers often quote the phrase the mighty hand of God without regard to what it means in the book of 1 Peter as a whole.
[249]  As a result, this verse concerning the mighty hand of God has been misused.
[250]  We have seen that the entire book of 1 Peter is on God s government, and that God s government is administrated through His judgment.
[251]  Peter says that God has called us into His eternal glory in Christ.
[252]  In Christ indicates that the God of all grace has gone through all the processes of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension to accomplish the complete and full redemption so that He may bring His redeemed people into an organic union with Himself.
[253]  Thus they may participate in the riches of the Triune God as their enjoyment.
[254]  All the steps of the divine operation are in Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God becoming the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit as the bountiful life supply to us.
[255]  It is in this Christ, through His all-inclusive redemption and based on all His achievements, that God can be the God of all grace to call us into His eternal glory and to perfect, establish, strengthen, and ground us in the Triune God 1:1-2 as the solid foundation, thus enabling us to attain unto His glorious goal.
[256]  In 5:13 Peter says, The co-chosen in Babylon and Mark my son greet you.
[257]  It may refer to Peter s wife, who traveled with him 1 Cor 9:5 , or to a prominent sister in the Lord, who had been co-chosen by God not only with the receivers of this Epistle, but also with Peter and all the other believers.
