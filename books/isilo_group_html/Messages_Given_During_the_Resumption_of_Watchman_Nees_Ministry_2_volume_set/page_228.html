Gospel Visitation<br>and Visitation of the New Believers</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Being Baptized as soon as One Is Saved</H2><P>The responsibility of visiting the new believers is quite heavy. If the church assigns a certain brother to visit someone, this brother should take along with him the one who introduced that new one to the church. As soon as a person is saved, he should be baptized right away. Many people were quite alive when they first believed, but after waiting for a while to be baptized, they became dead. As soon as a person believes, he should be baptized. If he is baptized, and if something happens later, he will not feel so free to deny his faith any longer.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Whole Church Working,<br>Bringing Increase in Quantity and Quality</H2><P>In arranging the visitation, we should divide up the city into districts according to the map. Once the time is ripe, and there is a certain number of ones desiring to be baptized, we should baptize them. If we do this, in a short time, we will double our investments. No other period of time affords as much opportunity as today for the work to go on. If the whole church rises up, there will be no place to hold the blessings. In Foochow, within one to two months, a thousand people were saved. When the whole church is involved in this kind of work, everyone who comes into the church will be up to the proper standard. Everyone who is born this way will be an eight-to nine-pound baby, and no one will be a twelve-ounce baby that has to be kept in an incubator.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Teaching Others to Serve God<br>Properly and Conscientiously</H2><P>Here I have to speak a frank word to you. You have to speak honest words to others. In the past, a certain person may have been loose, and you may have let it go. But you cannot do that any longer. If a person does not do his job, you cannot let him go; you have to compel him to work. After he has agreed to work, you still have to tell him, "Why are you so loose? Why would you not be careful in taking care of the things of God? You need to learn. Who told you to hand over yourself to be a child of God in the first place? But now, and as long as you are His child, you have to serve, and you have to serve in a conscientious way."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Perfecting of the New Believers</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Conducting the New Believers' Meetings<br>by Districts</H2><P>We have to conduct the new believers' meetings in the districts. The reason for this is that many live too far away and cannot otherwise attend this kind of meeting. At present, we have considered everyone a new believer, and we are giving make-up lessons to all of them. Among the brothers, we have selected twenty brothers to do the teaching work in the thirteen districts. The subjects covered in the thirteen districts are the same, and their contents are the same. This meeting is set up specifically for the perfecting of the new believers.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Those Who Are Absent<br>Needing to Receive Make-up Lessons</H2><P>The ones who are responsible for visiting the new believers should go out on Friday evening to give make-up lessons to those who were absent the previous week. In giving the make-up lessons, you have to do a detailed job. In this way, whether or not a person comes to the meeting, he will receive the same teachings. For example, Brother Cheng may give a message here for two hours with sweat all over him. After he finishes his message, he still has to go to the home of a brother who is absent from the meeting to give him a make-up lesson. Someone besides that other brother may say, "Look, Brother Cheng has put in so much effort to give his message already. Now when others do not come to the meeting, he still has to spend time to give make-up lessons." By saying this, the one who has been absent from the meeting will say, "That is right. Next time I think I have to come to the meeting."</P><P>This kind of work is most definite and fine. Everywhere you go, you will find out right away the things that are wrong with that place, and right away you will be able to make up the lack. If we practice this, our work will not be as confused and uncoordinated as it is today.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_227.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_229.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Messages Given During the Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry (2 volume set) &nbsp; pg 228</div><br></body></html>
