<h2 class="head2">The Items of the Eternal Gospel</h2>
<p>To fear God, giving Him glory, and to worship Him are the two items of the eternal gospel (Rev. 14:7). The gospel of grace also contains two items&mdash;repent and believe (Mark 1:15). Men must repent of their sins and believe into the Son of God. The eternal gospel, however, mentions nothing about repentance or believing. We must be careful in reading the Scriptures. The eternal gospel is a matter of God&rsquo;s dispensation. The terms, the items, the contents, of this gospel are one hundred percent different from the gospel of grace preached by believers. Whereas the gospel of grace is one of repentance and faith, the eternal gospel is for people on the earth only to fear God and worship Him. This is due to the fact that at this time the Antichrist and his followers persecute God&rsquo;s people, having no fear of God. Therefore, the angel warns them to fear God and do nothing to wrong the people of God.</p>
<p>During the great tribulation, the Antichrist will set up his image for people to worship. This idol will even be able to speak, seducing many people to worship it. Therefore, the angel warns people to worship God and not the image. To fear God means to not persecute God&rsquo;s people, and to worship God means to not worship Antichrist&rsquo;s image. This is the reason why an angel preaches a special gospel to the people on the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Judgment on the Nations at Christ&rsquo;s Return</h2>
<p>There are three parables in Matthew 25. The parable of the ten virgins is related to the Christian life (vv. 1-13), and the parable of the talents is related to Christian service (vv. 14-30). These two parables which speak of life and service pertain to the believers. The third parable is the parable of the sheep and the goats (vv. 31-46). If we read it carefully, we can see that it is not related to Christians but to the nations, the Gentiles who remain at Christ&rsquo;s coming back to the earth, after He has destroyed those Gentiles who follow Antichrist at Armageddon (v. 32). Not only the goats but even the sheep are of the nations.</p>
<p>Second Timothy 4:1 tells us that Christ Jesus will judge the living and the dead. At His coming back before the kingdom of one thousand years, Christ will judge the living Gentiles. Then at the end of the one thousand years, He will judge the unbelieving dead. In this way He will be the One who judges the living Gentiles and the dead unbelievers. The parable of the sheep and the goats in Matthew 25 gives us a picture of how the Lord, after His coming back, will judge the living Gentiles.</p>
<p>When I was young, I was bothered by this parable because I knew that we are not saved by works. The sheep, however, will be reckoned as good ones merely by their works, and the goats will be reckoned as evil ones also by their works. I could not understand how this could be a judgment that included believers. Later I received light to realize that this is the judgment exercised by the Lord Jesus on the living Gentiles, that is, on those unbelievers who remain on the earth at His coming back.</p>
<p>The Lord will judge the nations according to the way they treat the least of His brothers during the tribulation (Matt. 25:40). If they treat His brothers well, they will be reckoned as sheep. If they treat His brothers badly, they will be reckoned as goats. The criteria for the way they treat the Lord&rsquo;s brothers is whether they give something to eat and drink to the ones who are hungry and thirsty, clothe the ones who are naked, and visit the ones who are in prison. These are the conditions of persecution which the little brothers of Christ will suffer. If those of the nations treat the persecuted brothers of Christ well, the Lord Jesus will reckon them as sheep when He comes back. Otherwise, they will be reckoned as the goats. This judgment is based on the eternal gospel.</p>
<p>At the end of this age, the Antichrist will come and seduce the Gentile nations to follow him to rebel against God and persecute God&rsquo;s people until the time the Lord comes back. While the entire Gentile world is following Antichrist in this way, God will send an angel in the air to announce the eternal gospel to warn people to fear God, to give Him glory, and to worship Him. This will be a warning not to do anything against God and not to persecute His people. After this warning, Christ will come back to defeat Antichrist and exercise His judgment on those Gentiles who are still living on this earth. That judgment will not be based on the gospel of grace, for the dispensation of the gospel of grace will be over at that time. Rather, that judgment will be based on the eternal gospel.</p>
<p>Those who listen to this gospel and fear God will not dare to persecute the believers or the Jews who are God&rsquo;s people. If possible, they will do something to help them. This will be similar to today&rsquo;s situation in China, for example. The Communists persecute the Christians, but some Gentiles fear God and secretly share their food and clothing with them. The situation in the great tribulation will be like this in principle. Some will listen to that gospel, fear God, worship Him, and treat the Lord&rsquo;s brothers, the weaker ones among God&rsquo;s people, well. This will be the basis of the Lord&rsquo;s judgment on the nations when He comes back.</p>
