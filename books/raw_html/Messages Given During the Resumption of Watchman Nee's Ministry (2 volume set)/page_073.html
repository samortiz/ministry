<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>No More "Pew-members" and Nominal Christians</H2><P>We should not have the concept of coming on Sunday to a so-called service. When the brothers and sisters come together on the Lord's Day, they do not come for a "service"; rather, they come with their hearts prepared to hear the Lord's word. In the afternoon, they should go out to preach the gospel. It is not a matter of listening to a sermon, but a matter of striving together in oneness for the gospel. In the evening, they should come together to remember the Lord, to fellowship with Him and to worship Him. The prayer meeting is the time when we bring our problems and needs to the Lord. If we do all these, we will receive the Lord's blessing. We should never be "Sunday-service Christians." If you want to be a "Sunday-service Christian," you should go to the denominations. If you think that this is not the right place for you, you can go to some other place, some Christian organization. If we are merely "running" churches, organizing Sunday services, and producing "pew-members," we might as well close our doors.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Concerning the Ushering Service</H2><P>Concerning the ushering service, the ushering brothers and sisters should stand in an orderly way in the meeting hall before the meeting begins. Once the meeting has begun, they should not move around or make gestures anymore. This will frustrate the brother giving the message. The late ones should find their own seats. If the ushers stand up again, then you have one more person moving around. The ushers should also help the saints to take up the front rows first, and every row should have some brothers and sisters, so that new ones can be cared for.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Everyone Serving in Oneness,<br>Submitting to One Another</H2><P>If the brothers and sisters would take up all the services in oneness, they will realize the sweetness in serving the Lord. The church belongs to everyone; it does not belong to the preachers. Hence, in serving the Lord we need grace on both sides, on the side of the brothers and sisters, and on the side of the responsible ones, the elders. The co-workers and the elders should always be concerned that the number of serving ones would not be too few. They have to do their best to invite others to join the service. At the same time, all the brothers and sisters should learn to listen to others and to submit to one another.</P><P>In degraded Christianity, a person "runs" a church; a pastor is hired, a Sunday service is held, and everyone comes to listen to a sermon and attend a service. But this is not our way. When we come together, everyone puts in his portion, and we all serve the Lord together. This is what the Lord is after today.</P>
