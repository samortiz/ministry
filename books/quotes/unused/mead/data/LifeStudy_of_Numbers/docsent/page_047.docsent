   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Presenting the Levites to God</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the Levites were cleansed, they were presented to God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verses 9 through 22 describe this presenting of the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Sons of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Laying Their Hands upon the Levites</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>"You shall bring the Levites before the tent of meeting, and gather the whole assembly of the sons of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>And you shall bring the Levites before Jehovah, and the sons of Israel shall lay their hands upon the Levites" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here we see that the sons of Israel laid their hands upon the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This means that the sons of Israel identified themselves with the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually, the services of the tabernacle should have been taken care of by the sons of Israel, yet God chose the Levites to replace the sons of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Now these Levites were about to be presented to God, meaning that all the sons of Israel would be presented to God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, the sons of Israel laid their hands upon the Levites to identify themselves with the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Aaron Offering the Levites to God</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>as a Wave Offering</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Aaron shall offer the Levites before Jehovah as a wave offering from the sons of Israel, that they may do the service of Jehovah" v. 11 . In typology, a wave offering signifies the resurrected Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here the offering was not composed of cattle but of living persons, the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Levites were offered as a wave offering that they might do the service of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Levites Laying Their Hands</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>upon the Heads of the Bulls, and</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Moses Offering One for a Sin Offering</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>and the Other for a Burnt Offering</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>"Then the Levites shall lay their hands upon the heads of the bulls; and you shall offer the one for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to Jehovah, to make propitiation for the Levites" v. 12 . For the Levites to lay their hands on the bulls meant that they identified themselves with the bulls.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here three parties were identified with one another through the laying on of hands: the sons of Israel, the Levites, and the bulls.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moses offered one bull for a sin offering and the other for a burnt offering to make propitiation for the Levites.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Levites had been cleansed, but they were still held condemned because they still had sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>On the one hand, Aaron could offer them to God, yet, on the other hand, Moses had to make propitiation for them.</S>
