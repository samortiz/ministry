Last year we made some arrangements concerning the responsibility for each kind of business affair. A few days ago, we made some new arrangements for each area of work in the church. We now feel that another arrangement of responsibility must be made in order for every aspect of the work to be carried out successfully.</p><p>The more people there are in a local church, the harder it is to shepherd, fellowship, and visit the saints. The elders must bear the responsibility for shepherding, caring, and leading. But in a place with as many brothers and sisters as Shanghai, how can the elders cover things thoroughly? We have considered how we should take care of the need, and the result is the following arrangements: We have now divided the church into fifteen districts. Each district has a few responsible ones. These ones are not elders; they are merely learners learning to be deacons. Every district has its own leading brothers and leading sisters. There are also some helpers. Whoever is responsible for a district will make the arrangements for visitation and leadership in that district. Some districts, however, have two hundred people. Even the smallest district has a few dozen people. The responsible ones will not have time to care for everybody. Therefore, we have looked at the number of people in each district and subdivided the districts into groups. Each group has at least thirteen people and no more than eighteen people. Each group has two responsible ones. Each of these two will be responsible for visiting and leading an average of seven or eight people. In this way we will know if a person attends the meetings and what his spiritual condition is. We will not be cut off like we were in the past.</p><p>I call this assignment the "main roles of responsibility." The elders take the main role in the local churches. The deacons take the main role in the districts. The responsible ones take the main role in the groups. The elders bear the responsibility of overseeing the church. They oversee the progress of each of the responsible ones in the districts. The responsible ones in the districts are like parents. They must know every situation and care for every need. We must have those who can preach the gospel, visit for the gospel, edify the new ones, visit the new ones, make up lessons with the new ones, help the poor, visit in emergencies, and visit when people come from other places. We must ask the right person to supply and fill up whatever need arises.</p><p>Therefore, even if we have a thousand or two thousand people, the responsibility of everyone is fixed. May we go on in this way, and may the Lord bless those who are taking main roles in the responsibility.</p><p>For the sake of our own benefit and for the successful moving on of the church, we have the following request:</p><h2 class="head2">Paying Special Attention to<br />These Arrangements</h2><p>Do not look on this as an organization. If it is an organization, may God have mercy on us. We are one hundred percent not an organization. These are arrangements. We do not depend on these means, but we use them as a tool. If we want to satisfy someone's thirst, we must use a cup for the water. We must have these arrangements before we can dispense the spiritual goods.</p><p>Some of you may be more educated or experienced in life. You may have been saved for many years and have much spiritual experience. Although we have not made you responsible for a district, we ask you to pay special attention to these arrangements. We have made these arrangements according to various considerations: Some people do not have time, some live too far away, and others have various reasons. The responsible ones for your district may not have the education or experience that you have. On the surface, it seems that you are following them, but before God, you should help them. If one with experience before God submits to a younger, less experienced person, I cannot tell you how much help the younger person receives. Conversely, if one with experience does not submit to a younger person, I cannot tell you how much damage the younger one suffers. We confess that our arrangements may not be altogether accurate, but if we learn to submit, they will always turn out to be for our profit. Learning to submit to someone inferior requires a particular measure of the Lord's mercy! Brothers and sisters, do not question whether or not the church's arrangement is right or wrong or whether or not the responsible one for the district is experienced. If we are willing to submit, we will gain the benefit in the discipline of the Holy Spirit, and we will release life through such discipline.</p><p>Finally, we hope that the brothers and sisters would consider one another as brothers and sisters and as members one of another. All of us should have the proper function and proper service.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> </body></html>
