   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO TREES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then God took this man whom He had created and set him before two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Was not this a strange thing to do?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I would have thought God would take Adam and talk with him in lecture after lecture, training him in how to behave.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He would explain that Eve was his counterpart, that Adam must love her, that she would be the mother of his children, and that Adam must be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then God should have taken Eve and spent time to train her; she would need an even longer time because females always make trouble!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If Genesis 2 had been written like this, I surely would have thought it was a wonderful chapter of the Holy Scriptures, written by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>One tree was the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God did not explain what life was.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even today Bible scholars with doctoral degrees cannot explain the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Yet it is a simple name.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The other tree was more complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It was called the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God did not explain what knowledge was, nor what good and evil were.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He simply said that all the trees in the garden were good for them to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They could partake of them freely.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only one tree was an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He warned them that if they ate of that tree, they would die.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The tree of the knowledge of good and evil would bring death.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Notice the four words related to this tree: knowledge, good, evil, death.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>These four words stand in contrast to the one word: life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is the point of these two trees?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything else is secondary in God's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The only thing which is crucial is that man eat of the proper tree, the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE MEANING OF THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From the rest of the Scriptures we know that the tree of life is Christ as the embodiment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the last book the Lord promised the overcomers in the church that He would give them to eat of the tree of life Rev 2:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For eternity the tree of life will be in the New Jerusalem to feed and satisfy God's redeemed people Rev 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The other tree will be done away with; its end will be the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These verses strongly indicate that God's intention was that the man whom He had created according to Himself would take of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To eat of the tree of life means to take God in as nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We know this because the Lord Jesus told people that He Himself was a tree, the vine tree, and also that He was the bread to be eaten John 15:1; 6:57-58 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"He who eats Me shall also live because of Me."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To eat is to take in what can be digested and can provide nourishment by being assimilated into the cells to become their constituents.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The term "to eat Jesus" is not found in Christianity's dictionary.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some think it is too crude a way of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet in the verse we have just quoted, the Lord Himself speaks this way see also John 6:50-56 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the typology of the Old Testament there is the manna, which typifies Christ as food.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God's intention is to plant Himself into you as the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This planting is grafting.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This thought is implied in Romans 6:5.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Has God been planted in you?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are you a garden with God as a dear little plant growing in you?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Is this plant, called the tree of life, growing in you?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Are you growing, or is He growing?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>May God be merciful to you and grace you, that you may grow together with Him and that He may grow together with you!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Colossians 2:19 says that we should grow with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As God is growing in us, we must grow with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we are growing by ourselves, improving ourselves so that we are more patient, humble, or loving, we may be disciples of Plato or Confucius, but we are not disciples of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A disciple of Christ, a Christian, must be growing together with God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Such a tree has been planted into us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE MEANING OF THE TREE OF KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When we come to the second tree, we find Satan's counterplot.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Satan seeks to act ahead of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When he finds out what God intends, he tries to step in and act first.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God's intention was to plant Himself in man.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God, however, does not act in haste.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>It is not that He is slow or patient; the right word is steady.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Thus He did not plant Himself in man immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is strange that after creating man, God waited.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He did not enter Adam right away.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This gave Satan an opportunity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In Genesis 3 the subtle one came.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He spoke to the woman, not to the man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sisters, Satan's way is to tempt you to open your mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>"Hath God said ?"</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A question mark is in the shape of a snake.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Eve should not have answered.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>She should have gone to her husband and let him answer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Instead, she responded to the serpent's question.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>By opening up, she was ensnared and ate of the tree of knowledge with Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The evil one thus planted himself in mankind.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After Satan got into man, God came.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Adam's satanic nature came forth.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Instead of confessing his sin, he blamed God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>"The woman whom thou gavest" was the cause of the trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If God had not given him a wife, there would have been no problem.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When God then spoke to Eve, she did not take the blame either.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>"The serpent beguiled me, and I did eat" 3:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God, she implied, allowed the serpent to be there.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This way of talking is from the satanic nature.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Even though Adam and Eve were new on the earth, from that time on they were old.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>They became the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In the second generation Cain hated his brother and killed him.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Throughout the Bible two lines can be seen.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>One is of the tree of life; the other, of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
