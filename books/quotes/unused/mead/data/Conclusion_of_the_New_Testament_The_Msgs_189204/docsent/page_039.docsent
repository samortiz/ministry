   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Serving Ones</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Acts 6:3-6 speaks of seven serving ones in the church in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Acts 6:3 says, "Now brothers, select seven well-attested men from among you, full of the Spirit and of wisdom, whom we shall appoint over this need."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"Full of the Spirit" is one's condition after being filled with the Spirit inwardly and essentially.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This refers to life, not to work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The word "wisdom" here also indicates that in this verse to be full of the Spirit is for life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The word of the apostles in 6:2-4 pleased the multitude and "they chose Stephen, a man full of faith and of the Holy Spirit, and Philip, and Prochorus, and Nicanor, and Timon, and Parmenas, and Nicolas, a proselyte of Antioch, whom they set before the apostles; and having prayed, they laid their hands on them."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Since these seven were chosen to serve tables, they may be considered deacons, just as those whom Paul and his co-workers appointed later in the churches Rom 16:1; Phil 1:1; 1 Tim 3:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is significant that in the appointment of the seven serving ones no leader was appointed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that no rank or position was regarded.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the serving ones are the servants to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a good pattern for us to learn and follow that we may avoid leadership in rank and position in any form. c.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Believers</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Two verses that speak of the believers who composed the church in Jerusalem are Acts 2:44 and 5:14.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Acts 2:44 says, "All those who believed were together and had all things common," and 5:14 says, "Believers were all the more being added to the Lord, multitudes both of men and of women."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The designation "believers" denotes those who have believed in Christ as the Son of God according to God's New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This designation, of course, indicates the matter of believing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Anyone who does not have faith in Christ, who does not believe in Christ, is certainly not a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The believers are also those who have received Christ as their generating life for them to become the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Believing in Christ equals receiving Him John 1:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we believe in Christ, we receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We receive Him by believing in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, the believers are those who have believed into Christ as the Son of God to have an organic union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>John 3:36 says, "He who believes in the Son has eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Literally translated, the phrase "believes in" should be "believes into."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we believe in the Lord Jesus as the Son of God, we believe into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By believing in Him, we enter into Him to be one with Him organically, to partake of Him, and to participate in all that He has accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>By believing into Him we are identified with Him in all that He is and in all that He has passed through, accomplished, attained, and obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is composed of such believers.</S>
