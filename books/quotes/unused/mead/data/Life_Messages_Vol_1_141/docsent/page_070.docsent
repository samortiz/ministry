   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHARACTERISTICS OF A SECT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Christianity is made up of denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To be denominated means to be named.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Any group which has a particular name, not common to all believers, is a division or a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you are a Presbyterian, or Methodist, or Episcopalian, such a name is a sign that you are in a division.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Some groups may not have a distinctive name, yet they hold to a special doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They may insist that all their members be immersed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They may even require a certain style of immersion before they will receive you as a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Other groups practice a special fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Some Pentecostalists, for example, will not accept you into their circle unless you speak in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To have a name, to have a special teaching, and to have a restricted fellowship are the characteristics of a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is our name?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is the name of the church in your locality?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have no special name.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The term church includes all believers, not a select number.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If it is in Boston, it is the church in Boston.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We could compare it to the moon; no matter what part of the earth the moon is over, it is still the moon.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we were to take a particular name, we would become a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Further, we have no particular teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We are not a tongues-speaking church, though many of us may have spoken in tongues in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Neither our teaching nor our fellowship are particular.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We accept as brothers all those who believe in the Lord and are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>RESPONSIBILITY FOR DIVISION</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many Christians choose to hold on to their divisive name, their special doctrine, or their particular fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some have tried to bring tongues-speaking into the church, but if we become a tongues-speaking church we become a sect.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Others may believe in pre-tribulation rapture.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is all right for them to hold this doctrine, but if they try to preach it and make the whole church believe this way, such an attempt would lead to division.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For the oneness of the church, we must be common and general.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Those Christians who insist on their special teaching or requirement for fellowship must bear the responsibility for the division that exists.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we came into the recovery, many of us dropped our particular teachings in order to share the common oneness with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We are still learning not to be particular but to receive all real Christians and thus keep the oneness.</S>
