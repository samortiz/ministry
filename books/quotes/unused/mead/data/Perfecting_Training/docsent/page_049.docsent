   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHTEEN OUR HABITUAL LIVING VERSUS LIVING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Prayer: Thank You for Your mercy that we all have been brought into You into Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lord, we have to be all the time in Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Thank You, Lord, that it is Your mercy that brought us here.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even, Lord, we have been preserved in Your recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Oh, it is altogether by Your mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have no trust in anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, even we do not deserve Your grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But, Lord, there is such a mercy that bridges the gap, that brings us into Your grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Lord, we trust in Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We say again it is altogether a matter of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>And You will have mercy upon whom You will have it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thank You, Lord, You have chosen us to be the object of Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We stand on this standing to meet together to look unto You for Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Have mercy upon us all tonight.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need some further mercy, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The whole situation among the Christians is just pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Oh, what we need is Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Oh, do bridge the gap with Your mercy!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Thank You, Lord, You are the merciful God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You are full of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I feel I should speak a very direct and very practical word to you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This training is not merely for doctrine or for knowledge or for anything else but for the practical experience of Christ and of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the last meeting we pointed out that all the Christian doings and practices eventually all in all have become a kind of trap.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Bible reading has become a trap; even prayer has become a trap.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everything has become a trap.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Because all these things have distracted us from the living of this living Person, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God s intention is nothing but for us to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God s intention in this universe is so simple and so central that is for us to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you have really seen this vision in such a simple way, you will begin to hate everything else.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whether it is good or bad, you will hate it because it is not to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ever since I got this vision concerning the living of Christ I have been very much bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In a good sense I have peace with the Lord, and I have a lot of enjoyment with Him, yet in another sense I have been bothered because I have discovered I don t live Christ that much.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have labored for the Lord, for the Word, for the churches, but I couldn t say with much confidence that this was living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I surely have discovered that to live Christ is one thing and to labor for Him is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To live Christ is just to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God has no intention simply to do a work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Most Christians misinterpret Acts 1:8 which reads, But ye shall receive power, after that the Holy Spirit has come upon you: and ye shall be witnesses unto me both in Jerusalem, and in all Judea, and in Samaria, and unto the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Yes, the Lord did say go from Jerusalem to Judea, to Samaria, and even to the uttermost part of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was not, however, to do a work, but to be His witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord never charged us to do a work, rather He charged us to be His witnesses.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to the Bible to be His witnesses is just to live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you don t live Him, how could you be His witness?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Of course, many Christians interpretation is that it means to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But here is the snare.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>To change the wording from being a witness to preaching the gospel is a snare.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have gotten bothered that I don t live Christ that much.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I have the confidence and boldness to tell people according to my pure conscience that I don t love sin, I don t love the world, and I don t even love myself.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do believe the Lord can testify for me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Yet, I don t have the confidence to say I am living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This bothers me.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>During the time of this Perfecting Training I also have been bothered by another point: how to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I have discovered that I need to live Christ and that I don t live Christ that much, but thus far I don t know the way how to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You have to permit me to say that I am not a young man nor a stranger nor someone who knows nothing of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I have gotten through all kinds of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>From my early childhood I saw all the things in organized Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I saw how the western pastors did things, and I saw how the native Chinese pastors did things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As a little boy I saw how they celebrated Christmas and how the western pastors and missionaries celebrated the Chinese New Year.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As small boys we went to see that, and we got some candy.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I saw the Sunday School, and I saw all the different kinds of practices in organized Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I saw how they were fighting, and I also saw how they were united in a falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I even joined in a kind of Christianity march where all the denominations joined together to march and sing Onward Christian Soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Furthermore I got through fundamental Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For seven and one-half years I was under the fundamental Brethren education.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Then I got into the inner life matters.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I read through a lot of inner life books.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I had many experiences, and I was there for quite a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Even today I would not leave this inner-life field.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Then I also got involved with Pentecostal Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Finally I got into the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For forty-eight years I have been involved in these things, and I have been observing these things.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In July 1932 we had the first Lord s table meeting in my mother s living room.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I passed through all these things, but I was never told by anyone how to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I read many books on how to, but not one book was on how to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>So over the years I got so much doctrine and knowledge, but now I have been brought to a crucial point, that is, God wants us to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We could do a lot of things, yet still not be living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>As long as we don t live Christ, whatever we do means nothing in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I surely agree that in one sense God is sovereign.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God even uses Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Even Paul used Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Paul said he delivered an evil man to Satan for Satan to do something 1 Cor 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Furthermore, God used Satan to perfect Job Some would ask: Isn t it good enough that people go to the mission field to bring the name of the Lord to the heathen?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Isn t it good that someone would sacrifice their country, their family everything to tell heathen people the name of Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I surely would say that is good.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>However, there is a big but.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>But God s desire is for us to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>According to the light I have received I simply couldn t do anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Especially within the last two years I have been much strengthened and charged, confirmed, and even forced to this point.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Even if today you offered me the biggest Christian work, I would have no interest in it, because I have surely seen something of what God wants.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>What God wants is just for you and me to live Christ.</S>
