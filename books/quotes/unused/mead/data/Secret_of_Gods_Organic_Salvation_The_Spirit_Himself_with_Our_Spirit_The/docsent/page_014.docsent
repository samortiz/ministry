   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we extol You with our full acknowledgment.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We acknowledge that You are the Lord of all, that You are the speaking God, and that You are the Spirit who dispenses Your life into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Lord, we praise You that we can acknowledge so many things concerning You.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Lord, in speaking Your word, we pray that You will be one spirit with us and that You will speak in our speaking, making our speaking Your speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, we want to be one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We do not want to do anything or to speak anything without being one spirit with You.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Lord, in these days, You are teaching us to speak the things of a new culture in a new language.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Lord, we ask You to give us the new language for the new culture.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In this message we come to the next two sections of God s organic salvation renewing and transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. THE SECRET OF RENEWING</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Renewing is the fourth section of God s organic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A. One New Man</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the regenerated believers have been created into one new man in Christ Eph 2:15; Col 3:10 ; hence, they are God s new creation 2 Cor 5:17; Gal 6:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Christ we, both the Jewish believers and the Gentile believers, have been created into the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. The New Creation</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This new creation is out of God s old creation, of which so many old things should be renewed to become new.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may regard ourselves as quite good, but whether we are good or bad, we are of the old creation, and thus we need to be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>C. The Creation of the New Man</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In fact, the creation of the new man has been completed by Christ on the cross Eph 2:15 ; but in practicality, the believers, who are the members of the new man, should apply to themselves what Christ has completed by being practically renewed in their living.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to apply to ourselves what Christ has accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>D. Renewing Implied in Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Renewing is implied in sanctification, which makes the believers new while it is going on within them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The more we are sanctified, the more we are renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To be renewed, therefore, is based on the ongoing sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>E. The Continuation of the Washing of Regeneration</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Titus 3:5 says that God saved us, through the washing of regeneration and the renewing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This tells us that renewing is the continuation of the washing of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God first regenerates us and then continues to renew us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Regeneration lays the foundation of the divine life upon which the renewing continues to build up the divine life within a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Regeneration is accomplished once for all, but renewing is an ongoing process through the whole life of a believer until he becomes matured to be a full-grown man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In regeneration a new life, the divine life, is added to our natural life, causing these two lives to become one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In sanctification our distorted, crooked, and perverted nature is adjusted by God s holy nature.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In renewing the mingled spirit penetrates our troublesome mind, causing it to be changed and even to become the mind of Christ Phil 2:5; 1 Cor 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our mind is the source of all kinds of trouble and surely needs to be renewed.</S>
