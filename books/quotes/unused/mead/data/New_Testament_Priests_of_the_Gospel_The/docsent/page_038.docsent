   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING GRADUAL AND PROGRESSIVE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My burden today is to fellowship with you concerning our experience and the achievements which the Lord has given us during the past four and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We know that we began speaking of the new way here in Taipei in October 1984.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>From that time until now, it has been exactly four and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we first began to take this way, we said that this is a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We did not have any experience concerning this new way, and we were also lacking in a clear vision concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>At the same time, we pointed out a series of matters related to how Christians should meet, preach the gospel, serve God, and work for God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From the time the Apostles passed away until today, Christians during the past nineteen centuries have been debating these four things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Because these four matters were very much related to the practical move and work of Christians, the debates became more and more heated.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It even stirred up strife and hatred among brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Until today, the problems have not been resolved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We know that as far as the Lord is concerned, everything in the universe was complete as soon as it was created.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nothing in the hands of the Lord needs advancement.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But everything in the hands of man requires learning.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is because we cannot create.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God requires no learning; hence, He requires no advancement.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But human beings are different.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even to acquire fluency in a language requires a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>From this we see that man is not a creator; rather, he advances through learning.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we study church history, we find the same principle there.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The word overcome was found in the epistles of the aged Apostle John before the Apostles passed away.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To overcome is to be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It means that something that was there originally was lost due to failure.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is the need to retrieve it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the aged John wrote Revelation, the last book of the New Testament, he wrote seven epistles to the seven local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the end of every epistle, he ended with the exhortation for overcomers 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is a recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We see that before the end of the first century, the Lord s recovery began.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Thereafter history shows us that, century by century, the recovery continued on.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At times it was dim, but it was gradually becoming stronger and stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This went on until the 1500s, when Brother Martin Luther was raised up in Germany.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He inherited the items of recovery from the past and culminated all the Lord s recoveries during the preceding sixteen centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But this does not mean that the recovery was completed; rather, it continued on.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not long afterward, the national church to which Luther belonged became a dead religion.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This also became the general condition of Protestantism at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That is why the Lord told the church in Sardis, I know your works, that you have a name that you are living, and you are dead...I have not found your works completed before My God 3:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At that time, the whole of Protestantism was in a state of half completion and near death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the seventeenth century, the mystics, who emphasized the inner life, rose up from among the Catholics.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the eighteenth century, Brother Zinzendorf from the southern part of Germany began the recovery of the church life and the church practice.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These were great advances and progressions in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, these were not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord had to go on in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the nineteenth century, the Lord raised up a group of brothers in England.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>They went further in the recovery of the church life; but in certain aspects they were still a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Because of this, the Lord could not go on at that time anywhere in the Western world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the beginning of the twentieth century, the Lord came to the Far East and raised up a young Chinese brother by the name of Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Initially, the help he received was inherited from the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But after ten years, he discovered that what he had received was not that complete.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As a result, he had a turn, even many turns.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>For example, in 1938 he published the book The Normal Christian Church Life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 1948, when he was conducting a training on Mount Kuling in Foochow, he shared that at the time of the publishing of The Normal Christian Church Life he only saw the line of Antioch.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But by 1948 he had gone on to see the line of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, he turned from the line of Antioch, which was a rethinking, to the line of Jerusalem, which was a re-rethinking.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>From this example, we see that the Lord s recovery is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There have been many improvements.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Our God is a God who calls and there is.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He does not need to change, neither does He need to improve.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For us, however, this is not the case.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we were raised up to follow the Lord and to receive from the Lord, we received things step by step.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Not only did Watchman Nee have a rethinking, even Brother Paul had rethinkings.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In 1 Corinthians 7:8 he told the Corinthians, But I say to the unmarried and to the widows, It is good for them if they remain even as I. However, when he wrote 1 Timothy at an old age, he said, I will therefore that younger widows marry 5:14 . The reason is that Paul s word in 1 Corinthians represented his wish at the early stage of his ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In 1 Timothy he was advising the young widows according to his experience.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This shows us that everyone has to learn; everyone has to rethink and has need of improvement.</S>
