   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT BUILDING ON THE UNIQUE FOUNDATION Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:10-15</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 3:10 and 11 Paul says, According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, but another builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But let each one take heed how he builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For other foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is being laid, which is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we would have the proper and deep understanding of these verses, we need to know the background against which they were written.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What was the situation among the Corinthians that caused Paul to say that, apart from Christ, there is no other foundation?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The background was that the philosophical believers in Corinth were turning to their Greek culture, philosophy, and wisdom instead of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In practice they were laying other foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Furthermore, according to their philosophical mentality, they appreciated various spiritual giants.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To appreciate a certain person and prefer him is to make that person a foundation in place of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>GOVERNED BY A VISION</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many Christian leaders and teachers quote Paul s word in 3:11 about not laying a foundation other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, those who refer to this verse may not understand the background of Paul s word.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Neither do they realize that they themselves may actually be laying another foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For some, the foundation is healing or speaking in tongues; for others, it is evangelism or missionary work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we consider the situation among Christians today, we see that there is almost every kind of foundation imaginable.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Almost anything can become a foundation in place of Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we touch the depths of the truth in 3:11 and understand this verse according to its context and background, we shall see a vision of Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This truth, this vision, will then govern and control us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Where there is no vision, people run wild Prov 29:18, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>. Among the vast majority of Christians today, there is no governing vision of Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, many ministers and workers run wild to lay another foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the one hand, many refer to Paul s word in 3:11 concerning Christ as the foundation; on the other hand, even while speaking of this verse, they are laying another foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This should warn us not to understand 3:11 merely in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>EXPERIENTIAL TRUTHS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In these messages I have urged the saints again and again not to approach 1 Corinthians merely in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Nevertheless, many are still able to take only the milk of doctrine, not the solid food of the deeper, experiential, and practical truths revealed in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we read this Epistle and understand it only according to the black and white letters and do not care for the background, our understanding of it will not be very practical.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the contrary, it will be merely doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is significant that Paul speaks of the unique foundation in 1 Corinthians, but not in his other Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, because this was not part of the background of the Epistle to the Colossians, there is no word concerning it in that book.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the believers at Corinth were laying different foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those philosophical believers were making different persons and practices foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is related to Paul s word in 1:12: Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This indicates that one laid Apollos as a foundation, whereas others made Cephas or Paul their foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some of the Corinthians laid a foundation of opinion or wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, among the believers at Corinth, there were many foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This background caused Paul to say, Do not lay any foundation other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As a wise master builder, I have already laid Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I came to you, I came with nothing except Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I warn you not to lay another foundation, but to build upon the foundation already laid.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Furthermore, you must take heed how you build.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not build with Greek culture, with your opinions or philosophy or with your appreciation or preference for any persons.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To build with these materials is to build with wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To understand 1 Corinthians in this way is to touch the depths of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The problem in Corinth was that the Greek believers were exalting philosophy and spiritual giants.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>By doing this they were laying foundations other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>To understand 3:11 in this way is to go beyond mere doctrine and grasp the practical significance of Paul s word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is also to illustrate the doctrine by the actual situation among the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Knowing their situation, Paul seemed to be telling them, Don t lay Greek culture or philosophy as a foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Neither should you exalt any person and make a person a foundation other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we say that we are for immersion or for speaking in tongues, we are laying a foundation other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But according to 1:2 and 9, Christ is theirs and ours, and we have been called into the fellowship of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This Christ, God s unique center and our unique portion, is the unique foundation.</S>
