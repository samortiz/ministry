   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Fifth Way to Hell:</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Delaying and Waiting</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Holy Spirit is now working among us and causing us to realize that we must believe in the Lord Jesus before we can be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But there is a danger.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many people want to wait.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They realize that it is good to believe in the Lord Jesus and they know they will be saved by believing in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But they say that believing is inconvenient for them and they should wait.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the near future, when an opportunity comes, they will believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Dear friends, please be careful!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Consider!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not be deceived by the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The matter of believing in the Lord Jesus is the most important thing on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Think carefully if you can afford to wait and delay.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Listen to these two verses of the Scripture.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Ecclesiastes 9:10 says, "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might; for there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom, in the grave, whither thou goest."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Proverbs 29:1 says, "He, that being often reproved hardeneth his neck, / shall suddenly be destroyed, and that without remedy."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who can say how long he will live?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Who can know his own life span?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You may say that you will wait until some future day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>But how much time do you have in the future?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No one sitting here can guarantee how long he will live.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Since you cannot guarantee, why risk your soul?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is either now or never.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You have to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I remember a story.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once a young Scottish girl came to a certain Dr. T. The doctor preached to her and persuaded her to accept Christ as her Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She said, "Doctor, I need to wait a while.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not want to accept Christ now."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The doctor replied, "How long will you wait?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Are you going to wait for a year?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Are you willing to say that no matter what circumstances befall you and what opportunities you have during this year that you will not accept Christ, and that you must wait for another year before you will accept Him?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She said, "No, doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I cannot say this, for I may die in less than a year."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The doctor said, "That's right.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>So are you going to wait for another month?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Are you willing to say that during this month, no matter what opportunity there is and whatever may happen that you will not accept Christ, and that you must wait for another month?"</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>She pondered a little and then replied, "Doctor, I cannot say that I must wait for a month and that whatever opportunity or event may happen during this time that I will not accept Christ, because I may die within a month."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The doctor again said, "That's right.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Are you then going to wait for a week, and no matter what happens within this week you will not accept Jesus Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>She hesitated and then said, "No, I cannot say that.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I cannot say that I must wait for a week and no matter what circumstance I encounter and whatever may occur this week that I will not take any opportunity to accept Jesus Christ because I may die in a week."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The doctor then said, "That's right.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then are you going to wait for one day?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Are you going to wait for another twenty-four hours and within these twenty-four hours, whatever may happen, you will not accept Jesus Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She said again, "No doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I cannot even say that, because I may be dead in twenty-four hours."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The doctor said, "That's right.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now consider, is it not far better for you to accept Christ as your Savior now?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the end she could not refuse and said, "I will accept Him."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Today I put the same question before you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What are you waiting for?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Are you going to wait for a year?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Who can say that within this year, he will not encounter an accident and that he will live through the year?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Perhaps a year is too long.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You dare not guarantee anything.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But who can say that he will live for another month?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Are you going to wait for another month before you believe in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Are you willing to say that you will not believe in Christ within this month no matter what opportunity is afforded to you and that you will wait until next month to believe?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Who among us can say that he will not die during this month, that he will still be around next month, and that he will believe in the Lord Jesus next month?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Who can say that he will live another week?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you cannot say that you will live another week, why do you have to wait for another week?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Why do you have to wait for one more week to go by before you seek an opportunity to believe in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I believe no one with a sound mind would dare to say before men or in his heart that he will live for another week.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I have a friend whose cousin did not believe in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He made excuses and put off the matter all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Once my friend preached and persuaded him to believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But he said that he would wait for a few days.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>My friend told him, "Very well, I will come back in a few days to preach to you."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But during those few days, his cousin took his wife to see his in-laws in the villages and was beaten to death by bandits while he was there.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Can anyone say that they will not die in a few days?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Can anyone here say that he will not die in the next twenty-four hours?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If you cannot say it, why do you wait when you know that you should believe in Christ as your Savior and that by believing you will be saved from hell?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If you cannot guarantee your own life for the next twenty-four hours, how can you say that you will wait for the future?</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Therefore, at this time, you should hear what the Scripture says, "Whatsoever thy hand findeth to do, do it with thy might" Eccl.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>9:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Why such haste?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Because of "the grave, whither thou goest."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Man must die and go into the grave.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the grave, "there is no work, nor device, nor knowledge, nor wisdom."</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Therefore, you should not hope to believe in Christ after you die.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You should believe today; otherwise, you will not find the opportunity in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Why not make the decision now?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Why wait for another day?</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We do not know what we will face tomorrow, and we do not know how many sitting here will be gone tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Who wants to die?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Who can say that they will not die?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Therefore, we have to believe in Christ right away.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Once in Philadelphia, a big city in America, a seven-story building was on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This building was rented out to many big corporations.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>On the sixth floor there was a newspaper office containing much telecommunication equipment through which the company communicated with the world and sent out reports.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Unfortunately, this floor caught on fire that day.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The fire started on the first floor.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Everyone on the seven floors began to move things out of the building and were running for their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>One telecommunications operator remained on the sixth floor.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>He liked doing novel things so he did not leave the burning building right away.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He began to telegraph to the whole nation: "Our newspaper office is now on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The fire is on the first floor.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I am on the sixth floor."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>After a while he sent out another telegram: "The fire is now on the second floor, but I am still on the sixth floor."</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>After fifteen minutes he sent out another telegram: "The fire has come up to the third floor, but I am still on the sixth floor."</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>After a little while he sent out a telegram again: "The fire has come to the fourth floor, and I am still on the sixth floor."</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Finally he sent another telegram: "The fire has come to the fifth floor, and I am still on the sixth floor."</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He thought that sending out telegrams this way would cause a sensation in the whole nation.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>How exciting that the fire was on the fifth floor and a man was still on the sixth floor!</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>However, his life was also important.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>He paused for a while and went out to see the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>What he saw shocked him.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The fire was not on the fifth floor.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>It had been wrong to say that the fire was on the fifth floor and that he was on the sixth floor.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>He should have said, "The fire is on the sixth floor, and I am also on the sixth floor."</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>The fire had reached him.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>He thought that there was time for him to escape.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>He opened the door and wanted to run down the stairs.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>But once the door opened, billows of smoke and fire poured in. He was forced to close the door.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The stairs were burning.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Every floor of the building was on fire.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>How could he escape?</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>In the end he opened a window and saw a power line hanging across the street.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>He thought that here was the way.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>He jumped out of the window and caught the line and began to cross over with his hands.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>But streets in America are very wide and he stopped in the middle of the street.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>There were many people watching him from down below.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Every eye was set on him.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>In everyone's heart there was the question, "Can this man be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Will he have enough strength to get to the other side?"</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>After a while one of the man's hands slipped.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>After a little while the man fell and was dashed to the ground in the middle of the street!</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Dear ones, if you know that your life is precious, if you know that your soul is important, and if you know that Christ will save sinners, why do you still wait?</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>The fire of hell has started to burn.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Why are you not running for your life?</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Alas, the fire of hell is burning before your eyes!</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>What are you waiting for?</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Watch out!</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Do not think that the fire is on the fifth floor and that you are on the sixth floor!</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>The fire of hell is already before your eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>There is hell fire right where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>Why are you still waiting?</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Now is the time to accept Christ as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>If you miss the chance, it will be difficult to say if another will come.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>Satan cannot stop you now from believing in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>He knows that man fears sin and is afraid of the punishment of hell.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>He also knows that it is very reasonable for one to believe in Christ and be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>He has only one method: to make you wait and delay until the time is past and the opportunity is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Although you know that you should be saved, you will perish eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>What are you waiting for now?</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Are you going to wait until you are sick before you believe?</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Are you going to wait until you face some peril before you believe?</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Are you going to wait until you die before you believe?</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Please do not wait any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>Wait no more.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>Please come to the Lord Jesus this minute and accept Him with faith as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>Pray to Him: "Lord, I am a sinner who should go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>I ask You to save me now."</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>The Lord will hear your prayer.</S>
