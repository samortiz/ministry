<h2 class="head1">THE NATURE AND SUBSTANCE<br />OF MONEY BEING UNRIGHTEOUS</h2><p>Luke 16 speaks of the unrighteous steward and the unrighteous money. There the Lord commended the unrighteous steward for his wisdom. He used his master's money to make friends. There is a difference between the parable itself and the teaching that comes after it. The parable goes from verse 1 to verse 7, whereas the teaching begins with verse 8, which says, "The sons of this age are more prudent in their dealings with their own generation than the sons of light.'' The unrighteous steward changed the bill of one hundred measures of oil to fifty and the bill of one hundred measures of wheat to eighty. This is unrighteousness in procedure. Surely it is wrong. But after this, the Lord teaches us to bring people into the eternal tabernacles with the mammon of unrighteousness. Here we have the money itself as being unrighteous. Not only is the procedure unrighteous, but money itself is unrighteous. The parable says that the procedure is unrighteous, but the teaching says that money is unrighteous. Money itself is unrighteous in nature and substance. The parable does not say that wheat is unrighteous or that oil is unrighteous. Instead, it says that the person is unrighteous; he is an unrighteous steward. The teaching says that even money itself is unrighteous. Some people think that money is good because the unrighteous money can give us friends, cause others to be saved, and send people to the heavenly eternal tabernacles. But we have to realize that before God the nature and substance of money is unrighteous. Today we need to repent for our attitude toward money. Money stands in opposition to God. We cannot allow one thing that is in opposition to God to exist. Either we serve God or we serve mammon. Mammon demands man's worship just as God demands our worship. Once this matter is settled, our service to God becomes simple.</p><p>During these years, concerning money, the co-workers can boast that they have not been tied down with jobs for a living. Although the other brothers and sisters have more occasions to be exposed to money, they have to remember that they are serving God just as the co-workers are. We do not expect anyone among us to be a steward for his whole life and yet find no one to receive him into the eternal tabernacles.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO DEAL WITH MONEY</h2><h2 class="head2">Returning Money<br />that Comes by Unrighteous Means</h2><p>When the Israelites left Egypt, they were supposed to take as much gold as possible with them (Exo. 12:35-36). If the money that we have comes from righteous means, we can give as much as we want. But if it is gained through unrighteous means, we have to return it. Some people will never let go of the money in their hands. From now on we have to maintain our Christian standing. We should have the sense that we can rise above others' heads in the matter of money. Others consider money as their life, but we do not. Money that we gain through righteous means can be kept, but money that we gain through unrighteous means should be returned.</p>
