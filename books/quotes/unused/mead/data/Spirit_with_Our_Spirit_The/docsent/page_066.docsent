   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In message eleven we pointed out that there are three aspects of the divine sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we want to see seven steps of the divine sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we want to see the truth concerning sanctification from another angle.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Sanctification, or being made holy, has been a great subject through the centuries in the study of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We are standing on the shoulders of many who have gone before us and have helped us to see more.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They were our "ladders" and still are, so we have been unveiled to see some things which they never saw.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I. THE DIVINE SANCTIFICATION IS THE HOLDING LINE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>IN THE CARRYING OUT OF THE DIVINE ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In this message we want to see that the divine sanctification is the holding line in the carrying out of the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It was not until the 1980s that I began to use the word economy frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Formerly, we used the word plan as a replacement for economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's economy is His plan, but the word plan does not mean as much as the word economy.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Economy is a word anglicized from the Greek word oikonomia.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's economy is the intention of His heart's desire, and God made this intention a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This purpose became and still is God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sanctification is a great point in God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the holding line in the carrying out of the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We need to see what the term holding line means.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When a person goes fishing, he needs a line.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That is the holding line for his fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The line holds his fish.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In other words, the line directs his fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We say that sanctification is the holding line because every step of God's economy in His work with us is to make us holy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God created the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not one part of it was holy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then God created man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even before man's fall, he was not holy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the whole universe, only One is holy, that is, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Regardless of how perfect and good someone is, this does not make him holy.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The angels are perfect and good, but strictly speaking, they are not holy as God is.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order to be holy, you must have the holy essence.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If something is called steel, it must have the essence of steel.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, if you are holy, you must have the holy essence, and the holy essence in the whole universe is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The New Jerusalem is called the holy city Rev 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is built with gold, pearl, and precious stones on the gold vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The pearls are for the gates, and the precious stones are for the wall with its foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>These are built upon gold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Paul said in 1 Corinthians 3 that he laid Christ as the unique foundation and that now we must build upon this foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we build with wood, grass, and stubble, we will suffer punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if we build with gold, silver, and precious stones, we will be rewarded vv.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>11-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here Paul said that gold is a material.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Strictly speaking, however, gold is not the material for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Gold is the site of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The New Jerusalem is built on gold.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When a person builds a house on a plot of land, the land is not the material for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The city proper of the New Jerusalem is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The street is gold.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>On this gold the gates are built.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On this gold the foundations are laid and the wall is built.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Gold signifies God in His divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the whole universe, only God is holy in nature.</S>
