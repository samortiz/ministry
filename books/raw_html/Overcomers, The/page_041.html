<h2 class=head2>B. To Be Rewarded at the Judgment Seat of Christ</h2><p>The overcomers will be rewarded at the judgment seat of Christ (2 Cor. 5:10; Rev. 11:18c). Christ will judge His believers not concerning their eternal salvation but concerning their dispensational reward (1 Cor. 4:4-5; 3:13-15).<h2 class=head2>C. To Be the Bride Married to the Lamb</h2><p>The overcomers will also be the bride married to the Lamb (Rev. 19:7-9).<h2 class=head2>D. To Be the Army of the Lamb</h2><p>They will also be the army of the Lamb (Rev. 17:14; 19:14). According to Joel 3:11, they will come as the mighty ones with Christ to defeat Antichrist and his armies (Rev. 19:19-21) to close the great tribulation and the present age. We should not be those who love this age, because we need to become the ones to close it. The overcomers will come with Christ to close this present, evil, and ugly age. We can hasten the Lord’s coming and the closing of this age by being the overcomers to stand against the tide and the trend of the entire situation and environment on this earth.<h2 class=head2>E. To Bring in the Kingdom of God and of Christ</h2><p>When we close the great tribulation and this age, we will bring in the kingdom of God and of Christ (Rev. 11:15; 20:4, 6). The kingdom will not come spontaneously by itself. The kingdom will come by our bringing it in.<h2 class=head2>F. To Inherit the Kingdom of God and of Christ in the Fuller Enjoyment of the Eternal Life</h2><p>The overcomers will inherit the kingdom of God and of Christ in the fuller enjoyment of the eternal life (Matt. 5:20; 19:23-30; 1 Cor. 6:9-10; Gal. 5:19-21; Eph. 5:3-5; 2 Pet. 1:11). First, they bring in the kingdom, and then they inherit it. They will be the co-kings with Christ (Rev. 20:4, 6; Matt. 19:28). Christ will be the leader of the kings, and the overcomers will be the co-kings to co-reign with Christ. The overcomers will also be priests of God and of Christ in the millennium (Rev. 20:6; 22:3b) to enjoy the ruling authority over the nations (Rev. 2:26-27; 12:5). To man, the overcomers will be the kings. To God and to Christ, they will be the priests. What a blessing!<h2 class=head2>G. To Be the New Jerusalem, as the Bride of Christ for One Thousand Years, in Its Initial and Fresh Stage</h2><p>What God wants is the New Jerusalem, which will be the totality of what the overcomers are. Eventually, all the overcomers will be the New Jerusalem, as the bride of Christ for one thousand years, in its initial and fresh stage. These one thousand years will be counted as one day (2 Pet. 3:8), the wedding day. This will be the initial and fresh stage of the New Jerusalem as the bride of Christ.<p>The overcomers will also be the New Jerusalem as the present Paradise of God in the millennial kingdom (Rev. 2:7). This bride will be the Paradise of God. The three things are one: the bride, the city, and the Paradise of God.<p>The overcomers will shine forth like the sun in the kingdom of their Father in the heavenly part of the millennium (Matt. 13:43; cf. Dan. 12:2-3, 13). The millennium will have two parts: the heavenly part and the earthly part. The saved Israelites who will repent at the Lord’s coming back (Rom. 11:26-27; Zech. 12:10; Ezek. 36:25-28) will be the priests in the earthly part (Zech. 8:20-23; Isa. 2:2-3), which will be the kingdom of the Son of Man (Matt. 13:41; Rev. 11:15); whereas the overcoming believers will be in the heavenly part to shine as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. For one thousand years, the overcomers will shine forth the light, and the light is the Triune God Himself (1 John 1:5).
