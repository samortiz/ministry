   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RESULTS OF GOD'S JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As a result of God's judgment, the people of Israel first lost the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They were scattered, dispersed, and brought into captivity 12:15; 7:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To lose the good land means to lose the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They also lost the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The situation in Christianity is exactly like this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Most of the Christians are deadened, scattered, and have no enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Next, the glory of the Lord departed 9:3; 11:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the history of the people of Israel, the Lord's glory came to them twice and filled them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The first time was at Mount Sinai, when the tabernacle was erected Exo 40:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The glory of the Lord filled the tabernacle from that time until the time of Eli.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>During the time of Eli, the people of Israel fought against the Philistines with the ark in a superstitious way and were defeated 1 Sam 4:3-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The ark was captured, and the Lord's glory left the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that the Lord gave up the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the temple was built at the time of Solomon, the Lord's glory came back again to fill the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord's glory remained there until this very time when Ezekiel saw the glory of the Lord departing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The glory left the temple, left the city, and rested on the Mount of Olives.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Finally, the glory of the Lord went back into the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The glory left.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>With today's Christianity, there is no glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Rather, there is the scattering, the captivity, and the loss of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There is no need to argue concerning who is right and who is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Simply check as to whether the glory of the Lord is there.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you have the glory of the Lord, you are right; if you do not have the glory of the Lord, you are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The third result of God's judgment was that the temple was destroyed and the city burned.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>About 606 B.C., Nebuchadnezzar, the king of Babylon, came to Jerusalem and captured Jehoiachin, taking him back to Babylon 2 Chron 36:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At that time Ezekiel was also captured.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After five years he began to see the visions recorded in chapter one of Ezekiel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the following years he continued to see visions concerning a later capture of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>While he was in captivity, he was brought back in the Spirit to Jerusalem to see the coming events.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After Nebuchadnezzar captured Jehoiachin, he established Jehoiachin's uncle, Zedekiah, as the king over Israel 2 Chron 36:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But Zedekiah turned to Egypt for help and rebelled against Nebuchadnezzar.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then Nebuchadnezzar came back to Jerusalem, burned the city, destroyed the temple, and captured Zedekiah 2 Chron 36:19; Jer 52:11; Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>33:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Ezekiel saw these events in his visions before they actually happened.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There were eleven years between these two captures.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The city and the temple were not destroyed in the capture of Jehoiachin, but in the capture of Zedekiah.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the time of the capture of Zedekiah, the glory of the Lord left the holy city and the holy people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The temple and the city were both destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>That ended the history of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Everything was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Apparently, this was the end.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>GOD'S MERCY</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Though apparently everything was lost due to God's judgment, God yet showed His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There was still the visitation of God's mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In His judgment, God still exercised His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Likewise, though today's Christianity is a pitiful, hopeless case, God's mercy is still there.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No matter how much today's Christianity is under God's judgment, His mercy still remains there.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In the midst of His judgment, God was merciful to His people and provided a number of things for them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A Watchman</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>First, God provided a watchman to warn the people 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By reading these chapters in Ezekiel, we can see that the people of Israel were not happy with Ezekiel.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Ezekiel did not seem to know how to say a pleasant word to them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In like manner, people today also condemn us, saying that we speak too many negative things about Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But Ezekiel was worse.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God told Ezekiel that He was sending him to a rebellious house, with hard foreheads, and stiff hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But He said that He would make Ezekiel's forehead harder than theirs and his heart harder than theirs, as a diamond is harder than flint 3:8-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Today, we are not afraid of criticism from Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not care about their criticism; we still must sound the warning and blow the trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The facts are the facts.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Recently, when I illustrated how some people have spoken in false tongues, I received a long letter condemning me and saying that I was mocking people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I was not mocking, but speaking the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If someone feels that he is being mocked, it means that he is false.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If he is real, he will never feel that he is being mocked.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the policeman comes, only the robber will run away.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Those who did not rob have no need to run away.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you have never spoken in a false tongue, you will not feel that I am mocking you.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you have the feeling that you are being mocked, it indicates that your speaking in tongues is not genuine.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You deserve to be mocked.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Today, God has established some watchmen to warn His people.</S>
