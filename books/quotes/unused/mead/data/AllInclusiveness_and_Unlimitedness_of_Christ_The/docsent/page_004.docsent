   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE ASPECTS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From all the revelations in the Scriptures, we can see that there are three great aspects of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>These three great aspects are easy to remember.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first aspect is that Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To be sure, as God, He is all-inclusive and infinite.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The second aspect is that Christ is man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is God, yet He is also man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You may ask what is all-inclusive about man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even a large man may weigh only two hundred and fifty pounds.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even after you have graduated from a university or have obtained a doctorate degree, your stature has not increased by much.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Man is neither all-inclusive nor infinite.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A man may be strong, but can he work vigorously for twenty-four hours a day?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After working vigorously for only four hours, he may collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man is not infinite; rather, man is finite.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, as a man, Christ is infinite.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is infinite not only as God but also as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Perhaps we never dreamed that there is a man in human history who is both infinite and all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The final aspect is that Christ is the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is God, He is man, and He is our Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The title Redeemer in Chinese is literally the "saving-redeeming Lord."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Hence, it includes three things: saving, redeeming, and Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Never consider that saving and redeeming are the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Saving is one thing, and redeeming is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He saves, He redeems, and He is the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He has saved and redeemed us; consequently, He truly is our Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christians are familiar with the term Redeemer, but they do not know why this term is used.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How can Christ save us, and how can He redeem us?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Moreover, why do we need to be saved and redeemed?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many of you are young ones who may have been saved for only three or five years.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church in Taipei has a history of thirty-five years, and I am eighty years old this year.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we first established the church here, the parents of some of you, the younger ones, were not yet married.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I am very glad to see that in the church today many young brothers and sisters love the Lord very much.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In my service to the Lord for over fifty years, I feel that particularly in these last two to three years, both in the West and in the East, the condition of the ones who love the Lord is unprecedented; there are many who love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Recently I stayed for six days in Tokyo, Japan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I saw in the meetings that over eighty percent were young people.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I also stayed in Seoul, South Korea for six days.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I saw that almost a thousand people attended the meetings, and the majority were young people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I was very joyful to see so many young people loving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That is why I have a heavy burden to fellowship with you, without reservation, everything that I have dug out from the Bible and everything that I have enjoyed and experienced in these few decades.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>After I seriously prayed and sought the Lord in His presence concerning the general subject and the outlines for these messages, the Lord told me that I should speak about His all-inclusiveness and unlimitedness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, the general subject of these messages is the all-inclusiveness and unlimitedness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The burden for these messages can be summarized by the following five statements: 1 In Christ dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily; 2 The riches of Christ are unsearchable; 3 His breadth, length, height, and depth are boundless; 4 He is the One who fills all in all; and 5 He gives the Spirit without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit is the realization and transfiguration of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, Christ gives the Spirit, who is Himself, without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He is all-inclusive and unlimited, and now He has been transfigured to become the Spirit to reach us and dispense Himself into us without measure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to remember these three crucial points: He is God; He is man; and He is the Redeemer, the saving-redeeming Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There have been many great people in history, including thinkers, statesmen, philosophers, and others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although everyone has the boldness to say that he is a man, can you find one who dared to say that he was God?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As human beings, we are finite, yet Christ as a man is infinite.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Moreover, who throughout history dared to say that he could save and redeem us and that he was the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is very interesting that when people accept nearly any religion, they almost never say that they believe in the founder of their religion as the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only the gospel preaching of Christianity tells people that to believe in Christ is to believe in Him as Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is because Christ is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is no other Lord who saves in this universe; only He is Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Let us shout over and over that Christ is God, man, and the saving-redeeming Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Is it not wonderful to believe in the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Are you not happy to believe in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Have you been deceived, or did you suffer a loss to believe in Him?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>No, you did not.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>You must say, "This is a real bargain!"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Our believing in Jesus is truly a bargain.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If today you spend one dollar to buy a diamond that is worth ten million dollars, is that not a bargain?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>However, to believe in Jesus is so much more of a bargain than this.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Who is Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is God, man, and the Redeemer.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Is it not wonderful that we can receive Him simply by calling on Him?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once you confess your sins and believe in Jesus, you can receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Whom do you receive?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You receive Christ as God, man, and the saving-redeeming Lord.</S>
