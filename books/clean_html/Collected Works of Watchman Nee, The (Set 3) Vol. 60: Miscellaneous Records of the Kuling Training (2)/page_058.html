<h2 class="head1">TEMPER NOT A SICKNESS, BUT A SYMPTOM</h2><p>Why does a person lose his temper? Strictly speaking, temper is not a sickness. Among God's children today, temper is a big problem, but the Bible gives very little place to discussion of the temper. The Bible does not pay much attention to the matter of the temper. We have to tell new ones that the Bible does not pay much attention to temper because temper is not a sickness; it is merely a symptom of a sickness. A man may have appendicitis and a high fever. Appendicitis is the sickness, while the fever is the symptom. It is useless to just treat the symptom&mdash;the fever. As soon as one removes the appendix, the fever subsides. We must realize that temper is not a sickness. By the time a man loses his temper, it is too late; his sickness has advanced and is beyond the stage of prevention. Temper is not the cause of the illness. There is a cause to his temper. Unless this cause is removed, there is no way to get rid of the symptom. If we do not realize this truth, we will have a problem with such texts as Romans 6:11. When we lose our temper, we may think of this verse, but it does not do us any good because this verse deals with the root of the sickness, not the symptom. Temper has its root in the self. In order to deal with the temper, we must first deal with the self. Once the self is dealt with, the problem of the temper is solved. In order to deal with the self, we have to deal with the various expressions of the self. Once we take care of the expressions of the self, we have dealt with the self, and subsequently the temper.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO DEAL WITH TEMPER&mdash;<br />DEALING WITH THE SELF IN ITS VARIOUS FORMS</h2><h2 class="head2">Subjectivity</h2><p>The first expression of the self is subjectivity. Subjectivity is, in fact, the greatest expression of the self. Many people are very subjective. They always consider themselves as the center; their self is very important to them. If they make up their mind on something, they insist on their idea. They do not quit until they achieve their goal. If others do not agree with them or do not follow their way, they become angry and lose their temper. The root of this temper lies in their subjective will, in the fact that they are not able to carry out their subjective views. If their subjectivity is dealt with, they will say, "Lord, this is Your hand. I have nothing to say." If they surrender this way, they no longer will lose their temper. If everyone is dealt with this way, temper will disappear. No one has a proper perspective of his self when he is angry. If a man's subjectivity is beaten and broken, he spontaneously will be free from his temper.</p><h2 class="head2">Pride</h2><p>The second expression of the self is pride. A proud person does not know himself. Only those who do not know their self see themselves more highly than they should. Those who think highly of themselves and who consider themselves better than, or at least different from, others, do not know the self. A person who is ignorant of his own self and who always thinks highly of himself is a proud person. Proud persons want others to exalt them. They want to see others under them. Such ones never want to give glory to others. They always want others to uplift them. If they meet a man who does not know them and does not acknowledge their superiority, but instead, who criticizes them, they become angry with him. They become angry because their pride is wounded. From this we see that the root of temper is pride. Hence, we have to deal with pride. When we are despised, slandered, mocked, and criticized, we have to learn to say, "Lord, this is your dealing hand. I accept it. Except for Your hand, no one can do this to me." Once a man holds this view, he submits himself to the Lord's hand and denies himself. Spontaneously, his pride will be gone, and his temper will disappear. Once a man kills his pride, his temper will lose its steam.</p><h2 class="head2">Self-love</h2><p>The third expression of the self is self-love. Self-love is love for one's own self. Many people express their self-love subconsciously in the course of their communication with others. A self-loving person only pays attention to himself when he is with others. The most important person is himself. Whatever he does, he regards himself as the center. A self-loving person only pays attention to himself in every necessity of life; he is concerned only for himself. He insists on eating the best food, having the best house, sleeping on the best bed, and using the best utensils. If others have the best food, the most comfortable dwelling, or the best chair, he will feel robbed of his opportunity to pamper his self-love. As a consequence, he will lose his temper. Such a person cannot suffer or be taken advantage of. If others wound his self-love by accident, he becomes very angry. It is useless for a person to deal with temper without also dealing with his self. We should live by the Lord's grace and mercy on this earth rather than by ourselves. If our self is dealt with, we will not lose our temper even under very irritating circumstances. A person whose self is not dealt with can never be free from his temper.</p>
