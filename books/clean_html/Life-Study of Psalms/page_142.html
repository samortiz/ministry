<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Appreciating God's Care for Him&#151;<br>Sustaining Him on His Sickbed<br>and Making All His Bed in His Illness</H2><P>David also appreciated God's care for him&#151;sustaining him on his sickbed and making all his bed in his illness (41:3). Of course, this is poetic writing. But do you believe that when David was sick, God came to take care of him just like a nurse, making all his bed? Surely God takes care of us, but the apostle Paul did not write anything in his Epistles to tell us that God took care of him like a nurse to sustain him on his sickbed and to make his bed in every way. For David to speak in this way indicates that he was too much in the self.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Referring to His Righteousness<br>and Integrity Again</H2><P>David referred to his righteousness and integrity again in 40:9-10 and 41:12.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Realizing and Confessing<br>His Iniquities and Sins</H2><P>David realized and confessed his iniquities and sins. Psalm 40:12 says, "For evils encompass me until they cannot be counted;/My iniquities have so overtaken me/That I cannot see;/They are more numerous than the hairs of my head;/Thus my heart fails me." Psalm 41:4 says, "I said, O Jehovah, be gracious to me;/Heal my soul, for I have sinned against You." To make confession of our sins is very good.</P><P>When David was writing Psalms 40 and 41, he was surrounded by his enemies. He indicated that all his enemies encompassing him were evils which had become so numerous that they could not be counted. Furthermore, his iniquities were so numerous that he could not see. He was overtaken and bent over by the weight of his iniquities, and the number of his iniquities surpassed the number of the hairs on his head. This shows us that he was altogether in a very desperate situation. Enemies were surrounding him, and iniquities were suppressing him.</P>
