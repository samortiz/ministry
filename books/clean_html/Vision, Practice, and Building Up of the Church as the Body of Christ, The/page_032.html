<h1 class="title">FURTHER DETAILS FOR THE PRACTICE<br />
OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:17-24</h1>
<p>Ephesians 4:15-16 reveals that we are members of the Body of Christ, growing up into Him in all things. Through this growth we experience something of Christ, partake of Him, and enjoy Him. Then we spontaneously receive something to minister to others. As the members of the Body, we need to grow and function in this way. Moreover, to be normal, proper Christians is not an individualistic matter. Rather, we need to be built up. Regardless of how spiritual we are, we are wrong if we are individualistic. We need to be built up with others. It is not the Lord&rsquo;s purpose in giving all the gifts that we would be spiritual. Do not think that I am against spirituality. I am for being spiritual, but spirituality is not for itself; it is for the Body, the building. We find this thought even in Psalm 68:18, which says that Christ ascended as a man, representing man and for man, to receive men as gifts so that God may have a dwelling place among them.</p>
<p>Not only is this God&rsquo;s purpose, but it is also the target that the enemy attacks. The building is the target for all the flaming darts of the enemy. The enemy has done his best, and he will do even more, to frustrate people from this goal. God&rsquo;s intention is to have a dwelling, and it is for this purpose that He has given the many gifts. In these last days we need to realize that God is seeking to recover and to gain this dwelling place. Therefore, regardless of how spiritual we are, if we are not built up together with others, we are still wrong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DEALING WITH THE MIND, THE UNDERSTANDING,<br />
THE HEART, AND THE CONSCIENCE</h2>
<p>After telling us these things, the writer of Ephesians goes on to give us more details. According to the composition of this book, there is the apostle&rsquo;s prayer at the end of chapter 3, and in the first section of chapter 4 he presents the practice of the church life (vv. 1-16). After this, verse 17 begins another section. It is not sufficient to speak only about the main points in the first section of this chapter. If we remain in the first section, we still have something only in theory; we are not yet in the practice. Beginning from verse 17, therefore, the apostle goes into further detail.</p>
<p>This section begins, &ldquo;This therefore I say and testify in the Lord, that you no longer walk as the Gentiles also walk in the vanity of their mind, being darkened in their understanding, alienated from the life of God because of the ignorance which is in them, because of the hardness of their heart&rdquo; (vv. 17-18). These verses speak of the vanity of the mind, the darkening of the understanding, and the hardness, the blindness, of the heart. Without dealing with all these things we cannot practice the proper church life. It is not possible to have the practical church life with a group of persons whose mind is full of vanity, whose understanding is darkened, and whose heart is blinded. The way to hold the reality, grow, and receive something from Christ is to deal with all these things. Our mind must be dealt with, our understanding must be enlightened, and our heart must be open, not blinded. These are the details that Paul touches in the second section of chapter 4.</p>
<p>Verse 19 continues, &ldquo;Who, being past feeling, have given themselves over to lasciviousness to work all uncleanness in greediness.&rdquo; To be past feeling is to cast off all feeling. This relates to the conscience. To be past feeling comes from neglecting the conscience, not caring for the feeling of the conscience. All the vanity in our mind must be dealt with. This requires that our mind be renewed (v. 23). Likewise, our understanding must be enlightened, and our heart must be opened, not blinded, closed, and veiled. Our whole heart must be turned to the Lord. Lastly, we need to care for the feeling in our conscience. We must not cast off feeling. We need to deal with our conscience.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING CHRIST AND PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN</h2>
<p>By all the verses in this section we can see how much detail the apostle goes into. Verses 20 and 21 say, &ldquo;But you did not so learn Christ, if indeed you have heard Him and have been taught in Him as the reality is in Jesus.&rdquo; The reality in Jesus is the reality of the life of the Lord Jesus while He was on the earth. We need to learn those things of Him. Verse 22 continues, &ldquo;That you put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man, which is being corrupted according to the lusts of the deceit.&rdquo; The old man as a whole includes our old mind, heart, understanding, conscience, and all things of man. Because this man is old, all his thoughts, ideas, concepts, desires, love, hatred, decisions, intentions, and motives must be put off.</p>
<p>Only a person full of experience could write the book of Ephesians. The apostle Paul had the experience, and he knew the spiritual things, so he could write this short book with many profound items. This is why we need months to expound and develop even chapter 4 alone. There are many items in this one chapter. We need many messages to cover the matters of the mind, the understanding, the heart, and the conscience with its feeling. Then we need more messages to cover the putting off of the old man. The elements of the old man are not only anything that is worldly and sinful but also anything old, natural, soulish, and fleshly. We need to put these off; otherwise, there will be no way for us to have the church life. We cannot have the church life while we are still in the old man. If we use even the Bible in the old man, we will only damage the saints (cf. 2 Cor. 3:6).</p>
