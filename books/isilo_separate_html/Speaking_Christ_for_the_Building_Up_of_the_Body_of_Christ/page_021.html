OF THE CONTENTS OF THE HYMNS</h2>
<p>To know the hymns we have to know some of the crucial points of the contents of the hymns. First, we must know some of the hymns on the blessing and experience of the Triune God. The word <em>blessing</em> is used here not to refer to the good things the Triune God has given us but to the praise, the blessing, we offer to Him. An example of a good hymn on the blessing of the Triune God is #7&mdash;&ldquo;Glory, glory, to the Father!&rdquo;&mdash;and an example of a good hymn on the experience of the Triune God is #608&mdash;&ldquo;What mystery, the Father, Son, and Spirit.&rdquo; We also need to know hymns in the categories of the praise of the Father and the praise of the Lord.</p>
<p>Another crucial point of the contents of the hymns is the filling of the Spirit. Some have used the term <em>the fullness of the Spirit,</em> but we have seen from the Word that fullness is used for the expression of the riches of our God. This is different from filling. The Bible reveals that there are two aspects of the filling of the Spirit&mdash;the inward filling for life and the outward filling for power. The Greek word <em>pleroo</em> refers to the inward filling and the Greek word <em>pletho</em> refers to the outward filling.</p>
<p>We also need to know hymns concerning the identification with Christ. I feel that <em>identification</em> is a better word than <em>union.</em> We are not just united to be together with Christ, but we are actually one with Christ. A number of hymns in this section of our hymnal were written by A. B. Simpson, the founder of the Christian and Missionary Alliance. Many of these deeper and excellent hymns written by A. B. Simpson cannot be found in today&rsquo;s hymnals of the Christian and Missionary Alliance churches, but we have included them in our hymnal.</p>
<p>The experience of Christ is another crucial point of the contents of the hymns. Hymn #499&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, what a life! Oh, what a peace!&rdquo;&mdash;and #501&mdash;&ldquo;O glorious Christ, Savior mine&rdquo; are excellent hymns in this category. We also need to know the hymns on the crucial points of the inner life, the church, the assurance of salvation, consecration, and comfort in trials. Hymn #720 is a good hymn in this section. The first verse of this hymn and the chorus read:</p>
<p class="hbody">God hath not promised skies always blue,<br />
Flower-strewn pathways all our lives through;<br />
God hath not promised sun without rain,<br />
Joy without sorrow, peace without pain.</p>
<p class="hbody">But God hath promised strength for the day,<br />
Rest for the labor, light for the way,<br />
Grace for the trials, help from above,<br />
Unfailing sympathy, undying love.</p>
<p>We also need to know the hymns on the crucial points of spiritual warfare, the gospel, the meetings, the hope of glory, and the ultimate manifestation. Hymn #948 and #949 are excellent hymns concerning Christ as the hope of glory, and #972 is a very good hymn on the ultimate manifestation. Hymn #949 was written to the tune of &ldquo;He Lives, He Lives&rdquo;:</p>
<p class="hbody">Christ is the hope of glory, my very life is He,<br />
He has regenerated and saturated me;<br />
He comes to change my body by His subduing might<br />
Like to His glorious body in glory bright!</p>
<p class="hbody">He comes, He comes, Christ comes to glorify me!<br />
My body He&rsquo;ll transfigure, like His own it then<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;will be.<br />
He comes, He comes, redemption to apply!<br />
As Hope of glory He will come, His saints to glorify.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE STANDARD OF THE HYMNS</h2>
<p>We can choose three hymns from our hymnal to illustrate what we mean by the standard of the hymns&mdash;#70, #154, and #152. These hymns are concerning our love for the Lord and His love for us. The standard of hymn #70&mdash;&ldquo;Oh, how I love Jesus&rdquo;&mdash;is very low in life, truth, experience, and revelation. Hymn #154&mdash;&ldquo;It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine&rdquo;&mdash;is of a much higher standard. The first verse of this hymn says:</p>
<p class="hbody">It passeth knowledge, that dear love of Thine,<br />
My Savior, Jesus; yet this soul of mine<br />
Would of Thy love in all its breadth and length,<br />
Its height and depth, its everlasting strength,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Know more and more.</p>
<p>Hymn #152&mdash;&ldquo;O how deep and how far-reaching&rdquo;&mdash;is of the highest standard. The first verse of this hymn says:</p>
<p class="hbody">O how deep and how far-reaching<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is Thy love, dear Lord, to me!<br />
Far beyond my pow&rsquo;r to fathom,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Deeper than the deepest sea!<br />
It has caused Thee death to suffer<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to me Thyself impart,<br />
That in Thee I might be grafted<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And become of Thee a part.</p>
<p>In order to know the hymns, we must know the standard of the hymns. Some hymns are of a low standard, others are of a higher standard, and others are of the very highest standard.</p>
<p>A. B. Simpson&rsquo;s hymns on the identification with Christ are of the highest standard. Hymn #481 is a very sweet song on being identified with Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. Verse 2 says:</p>
<p class="hbody">&rsquo;Tis not hard to die with Christ<br />
When His risen life we know;<br />
&rsquo;Tis not hard to share His suff&rsquo;rings<br />
When our hearts with joy o&rsquo;erflow.<br />
In His resurrection power<br />
He has come to dwell in me,<br />
And my heart is gladly going<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the way to Calvary.</p>
<p>Do you feel that it is hard to die? Here is a word that tells us it is not hard to die. To die with yourself is hard, but to die with Christ is not hard. It is not hard to die with Christ &ldquo;when His risen life we know.&rdquo; This refers to Philippians 3:10 where Paul says, &ldquo;To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hymn #482 is another excellent hymn by A. B. Simpson on being identified with Christ&rsquo;s death and resurrection. I especially appreciate the third stanza:</p>
<p class="hbody">This the secret nature hideth,<br />
Harvest grows from buried grain;<br />
A poor tree with better grafted,<br />
Richer, sweeter life doth gain.</p>
<p>We can compare these hymns by A. B. Simpson to hymn #1059, another hymn on knowing the cross of Christ. The first verse and the chorus say:</p>
<p class="hbody">Jesus, keep me near the cross,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There a precious fountain,<br />
Free to all&mdash;a healing stream,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Flows from Calvary&rsquo;s mountain.</p>
<p class="hbody">In the cross, in the cross,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Be my glory ever;<br />
From the cross my ransomed soul<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing then shall sever.</p>
<p>The chorus of this hymn indicates that the writer was referring to Galatians 6:14&mdash;&ldquo;But far be it from me to boast except in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ, through whom the world has been crucified to me and I to the world.&rdquo; The word &ldquo;boast&rdquo; may also be translated &ldquo;glory.&rdquo; Thus, the hymn says, &ldquo;In the cross...be my glory ever.&rdquo; Yet this hymn does not properly convey what Paul meant in Galatians 6. Paul gloried in the cross because of the circumcision exalted by the Judaizers. The cross was really an abasement, but the apostle made it his boast. He was glorying in the shame of the cross. The most shameful death for a criminal was crucifixion. Circumcision foreshadowed the dealing with man&rsquo;s flesh; the cross is the reality of this dealing (Col. 2:11-12; Gal. 5:11). The Judaizers endeavored to bring the Galatians back to the shadow; the Apostle Paul struggled to keep them in the reality. Circumcision was fulfilled by Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion. Thus, the apostle only boasted in the cross of our Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>This truth in Galatians is not conveyed in hymn #1059. This hymn was written before A. B. Simpson&rsquo;s writings. At the time it was written, the revelation concerning the Lord&rsquo;s subjectiveness was not that deep. It is a good hymn, but it is obvious that the hymns by Brother Simpson are of a much higher standard.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_020.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_022.html">Next</a> </body></html>
