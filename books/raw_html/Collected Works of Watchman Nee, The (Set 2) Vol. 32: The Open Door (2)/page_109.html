<h2 class="head2">K'un-ming, Yunnan Province</h2><p>We had been renting the house in Dong-Si Street for our meeting. Now the owner is not willing to rent to us. Beginning from the thirtieth of last month, we moved to [omitted]. Because many of the brothers and sisters have been dispersed into the country, this place is adequate for our use now. Since the Lord's church was established in K'un-ming, we have moved seven times. We are learning to live the tent life and to thank Him as Jehovah-jireh. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Lin Yau-huei, May 3</p><h2 class="head2">Shia-Kwan, Yunnan Province</h2><p>We left K'un-ming on May 5, took the bus to Shia-Kwan, and arrived safely on the sixth. On the way we experienced the Lord's surpassing peace. Thank the Lord for putting me in this barren foreign land so that I may have the opportunity to recall all the things I have gained in the past. I remember from a sisters' meeting the story of Hagar and her bottle of water. My bottle of water can be exhausted, but there is still a well before me. Many of the teachings of God's servants have now become words in my heart and have led me through my days in this desolate land. My hospital is on a mountain, two miles from the town of Shia-Kwan. It is surrounded by mountains on three sides and faces a pond and a spring. There are forests all around, and there are fruit trees and bamboo in the forests. The produce in this land is rich, but there are not many foreign supplies. The people are frank and slow, and it is difficult to work among them. Most of the people are engaged in animal farming, and the common means of transportation is mules. Cows and goats are raised for their meat. The roads are very dirty. We have not started our work yet, because the medical supplies have not yet arrived.</p><p>Sister Chu Bao-ju<br />May 15</p><h2 class="head2">Kuei-yang, Kweichow Province</h2><p>The brothers and sisters in Kuei-yang have been preserved and are under His grace. May thanksgiving and praise be unto Him. We started meeting at my house every Sunday afternoon at two o'clock on March 26. The nature of the meetings is prayer, reading the Bible, or words of exhortation. The condition of the meetings is quite good, but the number is not great (four to eight people). Thank the Lord that His presence is with us. Please pray much for us. May the Lord shine on us so that we see where we should stand and how we should serve Him and glorify Him. Brothers Kaung and Weigh passed through Kuei-yang on their way to Chungking. They stayed in Kuei-yang for four days. There were three meetings on May 8-10. Brother Chang Teh-shu, the assistant professor at the Kuei-yang Medical School, was baptized on the ninth. He was saved a long time ago but has not been able to be baptized until now. Thank the Lord that there is now a good testimony here. I am still living in the same place. Greetings to the brothers and sisters in Shanghai.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Liu Yi-chuan<br />May 21</p>
