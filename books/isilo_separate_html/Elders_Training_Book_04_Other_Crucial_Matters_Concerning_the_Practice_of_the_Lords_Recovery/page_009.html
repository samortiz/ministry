I do not mean that we do not have the liberty to read the old books. We should not exercise any control over the saints. This is absolutely wrong. Please do not think that in my fellowship concerning the way to use the reference books and other writings I intended to control the saints from reading others&#8217; writings. This is absolutely wrong. You are free to go to any books, but if you go to the books I would say you run a risk, and you will probably waste your time. If you ask for my advice, I would say that you had better not go to others&#8217; books until you have finished the course of the Life-study Messages and the Recovery Version with the footnotes to get a strong footing and a proper foundation which gives you the best discernment. Then it is safe for you to go into other books.<h2 class=head1>SPIRITUAL BOOKS</h2><p>I would also like to give an illustration of having the proper discernment in reading the spiritual books. Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress, which was written by John Bunyan, an Anabaptist, was one of the top selling books next to the Bible. It was even more popular than George Cutting&#8217;s Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment, which is a booklet concerning the assurance of salvation. Despite the popularity of Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress, if you look into this book with some discernment, you can see that there is very little stress on Christ as life. The main theme of the book is that Christians need a full separation from worldliness. Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress helps one to get out of the world. When I was in the Southern Baptist elementary school in China, Pilgrim&#8217;s Progress, translated into Chinese, was a textbook in the classes. Many Christians received the help from that book to be separated from the world, but they could scarcely see any stress on Christ as life in it.<h2 class=head1>SPIRITUAL BIOGRAPHIES</h2><p>I also would like to fellowship with you concerning the reading of spiritual biographies. The better Christian biographies are those concerning people like Hudson Taylor, George Muller, D. L. Moody, and Charles Spurgeon. All these biographies are profitable in a number of points concerning the individual Christian life. They are very helpful to some extent, and I personally have received much from these biographies. I read most of them in my youth. We must realize, however, that the Lord&#8217;s recovery has brought us absolutely back to His New Testament economy and the New Testament ministry. We must also realize that the twenty centuries of church history are a history of the deviation from these two points-the New Testament economy and the New Testament ministry. Actually, not one of the spiritual biographies is cleansed from the matter of division.<p>I appreciate Hudson Taylor&#8217;s life greatly. I received much help from his life. We must realize, though, that even with him the element of division was still there. There was nothing wrong with him picking up a burden to bring the gospel, the Lord&#8217;s name, and the Bible to China. This was altogether God&#8217;s doing and I do believe that the burden which came to him was from God. I appreciated that from my youth. I am not speaking this in a light way, because we have paid very much attention to the China Inland Mission which was founded by this dear brother. We always considered that this was the top mission to China and was very scriptural, spiritual, and evangelical. After we had seen God&#8217;s New Testament economy with God&#8217;s New Testament ministry, however, we could not absolutely say amen to this mission.<p>This does not mean, however, that we were as strong as John Nelson Darby was concerning Hudson Taylor. In the late 1800&#8217;s the Lord raised up Hudson Taylor with a burden to bring the gospel to China. This was during the same time when the Brethren Assemblies were very prevailing. John Nelson Darby and George Muller were living at this time. These two brothers were the top brothers among the Brethren. They eventually held different opinions concerning the matter of receiving the believers. Darby felt that since denominations were condemned by Paul as something of the flesh and thus something sinful (1 Cor. 1:10-17; Gal. 5:20), anyone who joined a denomination or remained in a denomination was a &#8220;companion of sin.&#8221; He felt that the Brethren Assemblies could not receive a &#8220;companion of sin.&#8221; To join the Brethren Assembly, you must leave the denominations absolutely and officially. They used to ask people to write a letter to their denomination asking them to take their name off the membership roll. It had to be very official. This was the reason why Darby was condemned as being very exclusive, and we cannot agree with him in this point.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
