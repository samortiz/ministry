And in His New Testament economy God first made Christ our wisdom (1 Cor. 1:24, 30). The wisdom of God is needed for practical Christian perfection. Hence, we need to ask God for it.</p><p>According to the composition of this Epistle, although it seems that James did not have a clear vision concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy, he had the wisdom to portray things concerning the practical Christian life.</p><p>James was reputed to be a man of prayer. Here he charged those who received his Epistle to pray for wisdom. This implies that his own wisdom was given by God through prayer. In this Epistle James emphasizes prayer (5:14-18). Prayer is a virtue of practical Christian perfection.</p><p>In verse 5 James tells us that if we lack wisdom, we should ask God for it. In order to be perfect in our behavior, the basic need is for wisdom. A foolish person cannot be perfect. But if we are full of wisdom, then in every activity of our daily life we shall behave perfectly. This indicates that perfection is mainly carried out through wisdom. A wise person can be perfect. However, if we lack wisdom, we may offend others by our foolish talk. Our speaking may indicate that we do not have adequate wisdom. When we are short of wisdom, we should ask God for it.</p><p>James says that if we ask God for wisdom, He will give generously and will not reproach. To give generously is to give with simplicity and liberality, without reserve (Rom. 12:8; 2 Cor. 8:2).</p><p>James&rsquo; word here indicates that he is godly and that he knows God. In this verse James did not say, &ldquo;If you lack wisdom, you should learn of me. Let me give you some lectures or some books to read. Then you will have wisdom.&rdquo; Instead of speaking this way, James, being godly, encourages the readers of his Epistle to ask of God. He knows God and in particular knows that God is generous. James tells us in this verse that when God gives, He does not reproach. But a stingy person does not want to give anything. If he does give something, he may give with reproach, with stinging words. The generous God is not like such a man. God gives generously, and He gives without reproach. Being a godly man, a man who knew God, James realized this.</p><h2 class="head1">ASKING IN FAITH</h2><p>In verse 6 James goes on to say, &ldquo;But let him ask in faith, doubting nothing, for he who doubts is like a surge of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.&rdquo; The Greek words rendered &ldquo;doubting&rdquo; and &ldquo;doubts&rdquo; also mean wavering and wavers. Someone who wavers in prayer is like a surge of the sea, driven by the wind and tossed.</p><h2 class="head1">A DOUBLE-SOULED PERSON</h2><p>Verses 7 and 8 say, &ldquo;For let not that man suppose that he will receive anything from the Lord. He is a double-souled man, unstable in all his ways.&rdquo; God made man only one soul, with one mind and one will. When a believer doubts in prayer, he makes himself double-souled, like a boat with two rudders, unstable in direction. Faith in prayer is also a virtue of practical Christian perfection.</p><p>Verses 6 through 8 indicate that James surely was a godly man. No doubt, he was a man of wisdom, a man of faith, and a man of prayer. As such a man, he knew God.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
