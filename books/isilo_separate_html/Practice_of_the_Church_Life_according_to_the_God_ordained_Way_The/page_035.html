Elohim, God in Plural,<br>the Faithful Mighty One</H2><P>To learn the person of God, we must first know that God's name in Hebrew is Elohim (Gen. 1:1). This word is a noun which is plural in number. The meaning of this divine title is that God is the faithful, mighty One. God is mighty and faithful. Hence, He is altogether trustworthy. Because He is mighty, He can do everything for us. Because He is faithful, He will do everything for us according to His word, according to His promise, and according to His covenant.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit</H2><P>God is unique. He is uniquely one, and yet He is also three. He is the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Gen. 1:26-27; Matt. 28:19). The word triune comes from Latin. Tri is three and une is one. Thus, triune is three-one. God is the three-one God. In mathematics, there is no such number as three-one. Nevertheless, our God is three-one. He is one yet three, and He is three yet one.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>1) The Godhead of the Divine Trinity</H2><P>Many preachers, ministers, pastors, and Bible teachers unconsciously believe in three gods. According to theology, they are taught that God is one, yet they may have difficulty concerning God also being three. He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit (Matt. 28:19). Some have said that there is one God in three persons. But the term person is not found in the Bible in regard to the Triune God. W. H. Griffith Thomas, one of the founders of Dallas Theological Seminary, said that the term person must not be pressed too far, or it will lead to tritheism. The term person can be borrowed temporarily in order to describe the three of the Godhead. But most theologians agree that the proper word to describe the three of the Godhead is hypostases. The Greek word for hypostasis, the singular form of hypostases, refers to a support under, a support beneath, i.e., something underneath that supports, a supporting substance. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are the hypostases, the supporting substances, that compose the one Godhead.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD5>2) The Essential Trinity</H2><P>There are also two aspects of the Divine Trinity: the essential Trinity and the economical Trinity. The essential Trinity refers to the essence of the Trinity. In order to understand the aspect of the essential Trinity, we have used the three words substance, element, and essence. Each of these words has a particular denotation. The essence is the finest part of any substance, item, or entity. Within the substance, there is an element, and within the element is the essence.</P><P>An orange can be used to illustrate these three things. An orange itself is a substance, and in the orange is the element. In order to get the essence, you must press the orange. The orange juice is the essence of the orange. When liquor is produced by distillation, the essence is called the spirit. The finest part, the intrinsic part, of liquor is the spirit. This spirit is actually the essence.</P><P>John 4:24 says that "God is Spirit." There is no article between the words is and Spirit. Hence, this verse refers to God's substance. Within this divine substance, there is the divine element, and within the divine element is the divine essence. Ephesians 4:4-6 says, "One Body and one Spirit...one Lord...one God and Father of all." The Spirit, the Lord, and the Father are the Divine Trinity. In the three of the Divine Trinity, the Father is the source, the Son is the element, and the Spirit is the essence. The Father is the source of the divine substance, the Lord is the element of that divine substance, and the Spirit is the essence in the element of the divine substance. The substance has a source. In the substance, there is the element, and in the element, there is the essence. The Father, the Son, and the Spirit as the source, element, and essence are the essential Trinity. This essential Trinity is for the Triune God's existence and living.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> </body></html>
