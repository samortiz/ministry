<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE JUDGMENT OF CHRIST UPON THE DESOLATORS</H2><P>Psalm 75 is concerned with the judgment of Christ upon the desolators. Some may wonder how with respect to this psalm I can speak of the judgment of Christ, since this psalm does not mention Christ or the Messiah. The basis for my speaking here is the fact that, according to John 5:22, God has given all judgment to Christ the Son. Thus, the very God who judges in Psalm 75 should be Christ. Christ, as the second person of the Divine Trinity, is the One who will execute judgment upon all sinners. Here Christ's judgment is upon the desolators.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. At the Time Appointed by Him</H2><P>Christ's judgment upon the desolators will be at the time appointed by Him (vv. 1-3). "When I choose the appointed time,/It is I who judge with equity" (v. 2). The "I" must refer to Christ, the just Judge.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Cutting Off the Uplifted Horns<br>of the Wicked to Vindicate<br>That Exaltation Comes from Him in the North</H2><P>In verses 4 through 10 the psalmist speaks of the cutting off of the uplifted horns of the wicked to vindicate that exaltation comes from Him in the north. Verses 6 and 7 say, "Neither from the east nor from the west,/And neither from the south, does exaltation come;/For God is the Judge:/He puts this one down and exalts that one." Here we see that exaltation comes from the north, where God dwells (cf. Isa. 14:13-14). For exaltation to come from the north means that it comes from God, who dwells in the north. Furthermore, this indicates that Christ is unique. Exaltation should not come from any direction other than where He dwells. Therefore, preeminence should be given to Him.</P>
