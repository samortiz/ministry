   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>INTRODUCTION IS IT CHRIST, OR IS IT SOMETHING ELSE?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The following five chapters are messages given by the Lord s servant some time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because of the present urgent need of all the saints everywhere for these kinds of messages, we have published them today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to God s desire, plan, and redemption, He has ordained that His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, be all spiritual matters and things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a man touches Him, he touches the reality of all spiritual matters and things.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After a man gains Him, he gains all spiritual matters and things that God has prepared for him.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But man has replaced Him with many so-called spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although these many things, in man s eyes, belong to Him, they are nevertheless not Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Rather, they are a replacement of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, they do not render man real help in his spiritual life.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Is it Christ, or is it something else?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If it is Christ, we are touching the reality that God has ordained for us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If it is something else, no matter how good and valuable, we are merely touching vain and unprofitable things!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today Christ is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In order to touch Him, we must be in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We can use our mind to touch the things which are apart from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But in order to touch Him, we have to use the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to touch the things that are apart from Him, we only need human zeal and cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But in order to touch Him, we need God s revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to look to Him for His mercy and grace!</S>
