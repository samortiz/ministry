<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Los Angeles, California. The first seven messages, which cover various aspects of our experience of Christ as the mystery of God, were given from December 4 through 11 of 1962. The last two messages, which reveal that God&rsquo;s desire is to gain the church as the mystery of Christ, were given on January 22 and 24 of 1963. These messages were not reviewed by the speaker.</p>
