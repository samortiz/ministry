   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE EXERCISE AND PRACTICE OF THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY MESSAGE FIVE HOW TO CARRY OUT A SUCCESSFUL CONTACT WITH THE SINNERS Scripture Reading: John 15:16; Rom 15:16</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the New Testament, the Lord's first call to us is, "Come" John 1:39; Matt 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then after we have followed the Lord, His first charge to us is, "Go" John 15:16; Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord charges us to "go forth and bear fruit."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To carry this out there is the need for us to contact the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, to my observation, not many Christians are successful in contacting sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In this message we will fellowship concerning how to carry out a successful contact with the sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>REALIZING OUR SOLEMN RESPONSIBILITY TO GO FORTH AND BEAR FRUIT</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To bear fruit we first need to be clear that if we have been saved by the Lord, we have also been charged by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a serious matter in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our Lord is also our Master.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One day the Master will come and set up a judgment seat, and He will call us to come before Him and be judged Rom 14:10; 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Matthew 25:14-30, we are His slaves, and He is the Master.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He has given each of us some talents as capital with which to do business for Him, and He requires that we make a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The slothful slave came to his lord and said, "Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter; and I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He did not lose anything of his lord's, yet he was rebuked.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His lord said to him: "Evil and slothful slave, you knew that I reap where I did not sow, and gather where I did not scatter.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You ought therefore to have deposited my silver with the bankers, and when I came I would have recovered what is mine with interest" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This parable in Matthew 25 applies to each of us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We were redeemed; we were "bought with a price."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, we are His slaves, and He is our Master 1 Cor 7:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first thing the Master wants us, His slaves, to do is to invest the talent or capital He has given us, that is, to do business for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The profit from our doing business for the Lord is the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We are not only slaves; we are also branches, ministers, and priests.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As slaves we must use what the Lord has given us to do business for Him; as branches in the vine, we must bear fruit; as ministers of Christ, we must minister Christ into others; and as the New Testament priests of the gospel of God, we must handle the gospel daily.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all must realize our solemn responsibility before the Lord to be faithful in each of these aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To the worldly people today, it seems that the Lord is silent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They have heard about Christ; they have heard about Jesus; but they do not care.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They would say: "Where is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Where is Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You have been preaching and talking about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But where is He?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The unbelievers may talk in this way, and many believers may have similar feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Inwardly they may say: "Christ told us He was coming quickly, but nearly two thousand years have passed and He is not here yet."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because of this kind of thought, most Christians today live sloppy lives.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In doing so, they disobey or disregard the Lord's charge to go forth to save sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many Christians love John 15 because it teaches us how to abide in the vine, how to enjoy the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, in verse 16 the Lord says, "You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit, and that your fruit should remain."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Lord did not choose us without a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>His choosing was for His appointing.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He has appointed us for three things: first, we should go forth; second, we should bear fruit; and third, our fruit should remain.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this matter we have no choice; the Lord requires that we accept our appointment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Regardless of how much we have spoken concerning this, there are some who think: "That is good!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is nothing wrong with preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If He has burdened that brother so much, then he should go.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But I do not feel burdened to go.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Surely, if the Lord wanted me to go, He would have burdened me."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We may not speak this, but this may be in our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>One day, when we stand before the judgment seat of Christ, we will have to give an account of what we have done.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we have not been faithful, we will have to tell the Lord why we did not bear fruit, and the Lord will rebuke us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He may even remind us of this message concerning John 15:16 and ask why we would not take His charge to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Some say that they are busy and do not have any time.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is not true.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If our house were on fire, we would not say: "I am too busy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I do not have time to take care of the fire."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What we have time for depends upon what we consider is more important.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But regardless of whether we have the time or not, whether it is in season or out of season, we have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is not up to us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He is the Master, and He has charged and is still charging us to go forth and bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He will not let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is very serious.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we do not bear fruit, we will be cut off from the enjoyment of the riches of the vine John 15:2a, 6 .</S>
