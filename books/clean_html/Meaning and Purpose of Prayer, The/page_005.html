<h2 class="head2">Prayer Being to Express God&rsquo;s Heart</h2>
<p>Let us look at how Abraham prayed that day. He asked God, &ldquo;Suppose there are fifty righteous within the city; will You indeed destroy...it?&rdquo; (v. 24). God said, &ldquo;If I find in Sodom fifty righteous within the city, then I will spare the whole place for their sake&rdquo; (v. 26). Abraham immediately subtracted five, saying, &ldquo;Suppose the fifty righteous are lacking five?&rdquo; and God said, &ldquo;I will not destroy it if I find forty-five there&rdquo; (v. 28). Then Abraham knew that there were not even forty-five righteous in the city. He therefore said, &ldquo;Suppose forty are found there?&rdquo; and God said, &ldquo;I will not do it, because of the forty&rdquo; (v. 29). Abraham was even clearer that there were not forty and subtracted another ten, saying, &ldquo;Suppose thirty are found there?&rdquo; and God said, &ldquo;I will not do it if I find thirty there&rdquo; (v. 30). Abraham knew again that there were not even thirty and said, &ldquo;Suppose twenty are found there?&rdquo; and God said, &ldquo;I will not destroy it, because of the twenty&rdquo; (v. 31). Then Abraham knew that there must not have been twenty and immediately said, &ldquo;Suppose ten are found there?&rdquo; and God said, &ldquo;I will not destroy it, because of the ten&rdquo; (v. 32). Then Abraham knew that the righteous ones whom God would not destroy must have been the family of his nephew Lot. Hence, he spoke no more. This is what makes prayer marvelous. God speaks the things on His heart, and we pray for them as His friends, but neither God nor we explicitly state the object of our concern. Both God and Abraham were concerned about Lot, yet neither mentioned Lot. This was the sweetness of that conversation between intimate friends.</p>
<p>The best prayers are prayers to God as a friend. Such prayers are not uttered by men who are far below a very high God. Such prayers are spoken by men to a God who is on their level. Some may condemn this and say that it is heresy to uplift man to the same level as God. However, in the matter of God communing with man, of His wanting man to pray, God likes to be on the same level as man. Thus, real prayers are made by men who stand on the same level as God and consult with God. This is not man uplifting himself but God humbling Himself. It is not our going to God&rsquo;s palace but God coming to our tent. Every real prayer is God condescending Himself in order to draw near to us, humbling Himself to come to us, and placing Himself on the same level that we are on so that we may be at ease to speak with Him. This is real prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO LESSONS ON PRAYER</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Learning to Absorb God</h2>
<p>If we want to learn lessons on prayer, we must first learn to absorb God. We should not regard God as being so high while we are so low. This is not according to God&rsquo;s revelation. If we know God, we will be able to say, &ldquo;God, under the blood of Your Son I can come to Your throne of grace to meet You and to behold Your beauty face to face.&rdquo; We need to open our spirit and absorb Him. We should not say much, nor should we pour out our miseries. We should offer God some praise. We may say, &ldquo;You are so glorious, sweet, and humble. You came to be with me. I worship You and thank You from my heart.&rdquo; To commend, praise, worship, and thank God in such a way is like the first part of Abraham&rsquo;s fellowship with God. Abraham invited God in, set a meal before God, stood by without saying much, and watched God eat and enjoy the meal. This is the best prayer.</p>
<p>The best prayer is not one in which we tell God many matters. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Do not be anxious, saying, What shall we eat? or, What shall we drink? or, With what shall we be clothed? For all these things the Gentiles are anxiously seeking. For your heavenly Father knows that you need all these things&rdquo; (Matt. 6:31-32). Hence, we do not need to tell God our distresses and miseries, for He already knows them; they are not a problem to Him. We also do not need to tell Him our condition. To do so does not require learning and is a natural prayer, not prayer according to revelation.</p>
<p>A prayer of revelation is one in which we do not consider our failures or weaknesses. Rather, in spite of how distressed or burdened we may be, we set our eyes on God and turn our heart to Him. Instead of caring about our condition, we enter into God&rsquo;s presence to contact God by looking to Him, beholding Him, praising Him, giving thanks to Him, worshipping Him, and absorbing Him. This is a sweet lesson. If we would learn this lesson, we will enjoy God&rsquo;s riches and taste His sweetness. If we would spend a little time to enter into God&rsquo;s presence and absorb Him every day, we will receive light and power; we will be peaceful, bright, strong, and empowered.</p>
<p>An electric iron that is not connected to electricity has no way to heat up. But once it is connected, it will get hot. Hence, we should not say that we are weak and unable to rise up, or that we cannot overcome and live a holy life. Even if we are cold, weak, defeated, and unable to rise, if we would come to God, contact Him, draw near to Him, behold Him, praise Him, thank Him, and take time to linger in His presence, He will touch our spirit. Strength, power to rise up, and victory are in God. No method or message can make us overcome. Victory is God, and overcoming power is God. When we contact God daily, we are &ldquo;electrified&rdquo; within, become &ldquo;hot,&rdquo; and possess His riches. If we need leading, He is our leading. If we need light, He is our light. If we need comfort, He is our comfort. If we need power, He is our power. He is everything that we need. We must learn this precious lesson.</p>
<p>My greatest fear when I stand at the podium is that I would not be connected to God. Sometimes I do not need to spend much time to prepare a message; however, I do need to spend a long time to contact God in His presence, that is, to be connected to the &ldquo;electricity.&rdquo; My greatest fear is to be disconnected from God while giving a message. That would be miserable.</p>
<p>As Christians, we are miserable, weak, and unable to rise up when we are disconnected from God. When we are disconnected from God, we are through. God is everything to us, so we should spend some time and effort to contact Him every day. The first lesson on prayer is to contact God and absorb God.</p>
