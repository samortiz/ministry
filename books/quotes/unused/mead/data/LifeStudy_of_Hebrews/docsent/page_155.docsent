   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE ETERNAL SALVATION A. By Grace through Faith</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eternal salvation, as Ephesians 2:8 clearly reveals, is by grace through faith, having nothing to do with our works.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whatever we have done, whatever we are doing, and whatever we shall do cannot affect our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is absolutely a matter of God s grace through our faith in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>B. Not of Works</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Salvation is not of our works Eph 2:9; Rom 11:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It does not depend on what we do, on what we are, nor on the way we behave ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As it is by grace through our faith, it is no longer of our works; otherwise, grace is no longer grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>C. The Saved One Shall Never Perish</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The saved one shall never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not pay any attention to the teaching which says that we can be saved and lost again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John 10:28 and 29 are a strong word of assurance that the saved one shall never perish.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus said, I give to them eternal life, and they shall by no means perish forever, and no one shall snatch them out of My hand.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My Father Who has given them to Me is greater than all, and no one can snatch them out of My Father s hand Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The life we have received is the eternal life which nothing can terminate.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>And we have two hands holding us, the Lord s hand of power and the Father s hand of love, out of which nothing can snatch us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our salvation is eternally secured by the eternal life and by the two divine hands.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>D. The Saved One May Not Receive a Reward,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>but Suffer a Loss</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>First Corinthians 3:15 reveals that a saved one may not receive a reward but suffer loss; but he himself shall be saved, yet so as through fire Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>. We need to pay close attention to this verse and its context.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 8 says, Now he that planteth and he that watereth are one: and every man shall receive his own reward according to his own labour.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This verse indicates that here it is not a matter of salvation but of reward.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verse 12 we see two categories of materials with which we may build: gold, silver, and precious stones the produce of the law of life; wood, hay, and stubble the produce of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verses 13 and 14 continue, Every man s work shall be made manifest: for the day shall declare it, because it shall be revealed by fire; and the fire shall try every man s work of what sort it is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If any man s work abide which he hath built thereupon, he shall receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Once again, it is not a matter of salvation but of reward.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If a man s work is burned, he shall suffer loss, but he shall not suffer perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He himself shall be saved, yet so as through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul was very careful in writing this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said that we may suffer loss but still be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Lest we think that since we shall still be saved there can be no problem, Paul said that we shall be saved, yet so as through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no need for me to interpret this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Simply take it as it is.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It certainly is not a good thing to be saved as through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do not know what kind of fire that will be, but I do not want to pass through it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What we have been saying here is the pure word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is not, as some have falsely said, the Catholic doctrine of purgatory.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That is devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>What we are doing here is simply quoting the pure word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not pick and choose verses out of the Bible according to our taste.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everyone loves John 3:16 and many have it written on a scroll hanging on a wall in their home.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But I have never seen a scroll with 1 Corinthians 3:15 on it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Chapter three of 1 Corinthians is on the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Today God has only one concern the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we are right with God in this matter, we shall receive a reward.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If not, we shall suffer loss but be saved yet so as through fire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hebrews 10:35 uses the word reward, and 10:27 speaks of fiery zeal.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Moreover, 12:29 says, Our God is also a consuming fire.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This consuming fire deals not with the faithful ones, but with the unfaithful, and it is not for reward but for punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>As we have seen, such punishment has nothing to do with eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must always discern between punishment and perdition, just as we discern between reward and salvation.</S>
