   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>APPENDIX THE OVERCOMERS AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>GOD'S DISPENSATIONAL MOVES Scripture Reading: Rev 12</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the Bible, the seed of the woman will bruise the head of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The seed of the woman in Genesis 3 primarily refers to the Lord Jesus, but the overcomers also have a part in this seed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The seed of the woman includes the church, especially the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even though the Lord bruised Satan's head, he is still at work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The fulfillment of the seed of the woman bruising Satan can be seen in the man-child in Revelation 12.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The only Overcomer includes all the overcomers vv.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>GOD DISPENSATIONAL MOVE "NOW" VERSE 10</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When God changes His attitude towards a certain matter, He makes a dispensational move.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Every dispensational move brings in God's new way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>His most important dispensational move is in Revelation 12.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He wants to end this age and bring in the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His purpose is not general and ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>How can He bring this age to a close and bring in another?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He must have His dispensational instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is what God wants to do today.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE NEED OF THE MAN-CHILD</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The rapture of the man-child brings an end to the church age and introduces the kingdom age.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The man-child enables God to move.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If there is not a man-child and a rapture, God cannot make a dispensational move.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should never forget that God can be limited.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He waits for man in all of His moves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's binding in heaven is based on our binding on earth; God's loosing in heaven is based on our loosing on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everything depends on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is God's desire that created beings would deal with fallen created beings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>According to His purpose, the whole church should deal with Satan; however, the church has failed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, there is the need for the overcomers to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God's purpose is fulfilled in the overcomers because they work with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We can see the principle of the overcomers throughout the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God always lays hold of a group of overcomers to make a dispensational move.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>DISPENSATIONAL MOVES IN THE WORD OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After creation, life went on in a very ordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then God began with Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God laid hold of Abraham and Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He wanted a nation, but He began with just two people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God worked on these two, choosing them from out of all the other nations to produce a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Abraham left his kindred and country.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Abraham was greater than Abel, Enoch, and Noah because of God's choosing.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It was as if these earlier men were quite ordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They had no dispensational value to God, but Abraham did.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then God said that his seed would go into Egypt and remain there for four hundred years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was God's next move.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God laid hold of Joseph, not his brothers, and took him to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Joseph ruled in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's actions were meant for good.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Joseph was an overcomer in Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He showed forth his power in the kingdom and showed forth his knowledge of God through dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God had made a dispensational move.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He put an overcomer in Egypt; He did not put someone who could be defeated there.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a principle of God's working.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After four hundred years, it was time for them to come out.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that point God laid hold of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Without the events in the first few chapters of Exodus, there never would have been an exodus from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Moses came out of the water.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He had an exodus from water.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then he had an exodus from Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Moses was triumphant over death.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God chose him to deal with Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Moses dwelt in the palace, which was the Egypt of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Not only did his spirit leave Egypt, but his body left Egypt as well; therefore, God chose him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who can only say, "Go," but not "Come," will have no effect.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All of God's dispensational moves are based on one man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is a principle of the overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When the nation of Israel wanted a king, the people chose Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He was a head taller than all the other men, but all of his ability was in his head.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, God chose His own king David.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Even when he was in the wilderness caring for the sheep, he was a king.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>He did not run when a lion came but went against it in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Fear is not a kingly attitude, but when Goliath came, Saul was fearful.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In contrast, David trusted in the Lord and went to fight against Goliath.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Whoever is truly a king can be a king in any place.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Later, David became a servant of Saul.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When Saul became his enemy, David even had an opportunity to kill him, but he did not.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Whoever cannot control himself is not worthy to be a king.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>There was no king of Israel greater than David.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Only he was called King David, because he had dispensational value to God.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>When Israel was taken into captivity for seventy years, God still had a dispensational move for Israel because of Nehemiah; he was a true overcomer.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Even as he was serving a foreign king, he was preparing to go back to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>He was not touched by Shushan and the affairs of the palace.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Because God gained Nehemiah, He could make a dispensational move.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>At the beginning of the New Testament, a group of special people were waiting in Jerusalem for the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Anna, Simeon, and all those Luke 2:38 were waiting for redemption in Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Their waiting brought in the fullness of the time, the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God will not do things automatically; He will wait for His children to work with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The Lord has two works on earth: redemption and building the church.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The church is built on "this rock" Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The apostles were the first to stand on this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Even though they were weak in the flesh, their spirits were not weak.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Because of this the twelve apostles have a special position not even Paul is reckoned with them; they were a dispensational instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Paul said that he was less than the least of the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The apostles and disciples waited for ten days, praying in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They might have said, "We have a great work to do after these days; we should rest now."</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Instead, they prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>There were one hundred and twenty, but where were the others who had followed the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Clearly, not everyone will work with God.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>These one hundred and twenty were overcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>DISPENSATIONAL MOVES IN CHURCH HISTORY</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In church history the first special move was the Reformation.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>God used Luther in this dispensational move.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The Brethren were also used.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Darby, Groves, and Grant were His instruments.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>After the Welsh revival, a new move of God began.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Both Evan Roberts and Mrs. Penn-Lewis knew about spiritual warfare; they knew how to deal with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The truth of the kingdom began to be known in 1924.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>When Evan Roberts was seen after an absence of ten years, he said, "I have been praying kingdom prayers."</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Every time God wants to make a dispensational move, He must obtain His instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Are we at the end of the age?</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>If we are, the kingdom will soon begin.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If a dispensational move is near, then God needs an instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>General work is no longer adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The children of God lack a vision; they do not see the seriousness and intensity of the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Now is a matter of dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>Just being a good servant of the Lord is no longer good enough; this is not of great use to God.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Please note that we are not saying that it is of no use.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>What are we doing to close this dispensation?</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>What are we doing to bring in the next age?</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This is a special time, so there is the need of special Christians to do a special work.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Today God is waiting for the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Only the rapture can precipitate the events in Revelation 12:10.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>God has an order, and He works according to that order.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>His eyes have left the church; they are now on the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>An overcomer works according to the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The principle of the Body annuls sectarianism and individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>After the rapture the woman will be persecuted three and a half years.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Many other of her children will go through the tribulation, but God will keep them.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Being an overcomer is not primarily for escaping the tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>We need to see of what value the rapture is to the Lord, not to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Of all the dispensational moves, the man-child is the greatest because it removes man's power and the devil's power, and it brings in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>We live in the most privileged time; we can do the most for God.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Light will show us the way, but strength and power will enable us to walk the road.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>A great price must be paid in order to be used now.</S>
