<h1 class="title">THE KNOWLEDGE AND EXPERIENCE<br />
OF THE CROSS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gal. 2:20; Rom. 8:13</h1>
<p>Christ and the cross are the center of God&rsquo;s eternal plan. God&rsquo;s plan depends on Christ and is for Christ. God&rsquo;s plan was accomplished on the cross and through the cross. We cannot be in God&rsquo;s plan without Christ, and we cannot obtain Christ without knowing and contacting the cross. In the preceding chapters we said that Christ is God&rsquo;s purpose and that the cross is God&rsquo;s procedure. We can obtain Christ only through the cross. Christ as God&rsquo;s purpose is all-inclusive, and the cross as God&rsquo;s procedure is universal. God&rsquo;s purpose depends on Christ, and God&rsquo;s procedure depends on the cross. We must pass through the cross in order to gain what God has planned in Christ.</p>
<p>Christ is our life, and the cross is our living. As our life, Christ leads us to live the life of the cross. If we want to obtain Christ, we must contact the cross and go through the cross. We obtain Christ through the cross, and we live out Christ through the cross. The cross gives us Christ, and Christ gives us the cross. Therefore, we must know and experience the cross in order to experience Christ. The cross is indispensable to our experience of Christ.</p>
<p>Every spiritual experience is obtained through the cross. Without the cross as the means, that is, without going through the cross, it is difficult to have genuine spiritual experiences. This indicates the importance and necessity of knowing and experiencing the cross. We must pursue and obtain the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEQUENCE OF KNOWING AND<br />
EXPERIENCING THE CROSS</h2>
<p>Although the knowledge and experience of the cross are the same for all God&rsquo;s children, there are two ways, in terms of sequence, for knowing and experiencing the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The First Way of Knowing and<br />
Experiencing the Cross</h2>
<p>The first way of knowing and experiencing the cross occurs when a new believer receives intense light to know that the cross has terminated everything. Such believers, from the beginning of their Christian life, see that the Lord wants to be their life and everything and that they have been dealt with and terminated on the cross. This light is intense, penetrating, and all-pervasive. These believers see that all things&mdash;Satan, the demons, the world, sin, the flesh, man, everything of the old creation, and everything fallen&mdash;have been dealt with and terminated on the cross. They see that Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross is all-inclusive. Their view of Christ&rsquo;s death on the cross is so thorough and clear that they recognize that they themselves have been terminated. Under this intense light, they acknowledge the termination of their flesh, temper, naturalness, and self. The light they see concerning the cross is so great and intense that it seems to terminate all that they are. As a result, the things in their being, such as their temper and their flesh, lack their former strength.</p>
<p>As a result of this shining, everything of the old creation in these believers is terminated. Although they are still living in their body of flesh, they can sense the flesh, temper, and naturalness in their living and service. Nevertheless, their flesh, temper, and natural man are not active or prevailing, nor do these things have any ground in these believers. It is hard for the flesh to rise up, because it is under the killing of such great light. The intensity of the light that these believers received makes it hard for Satan to stir up their flesh in their living and work. The flesh, temper, naturalness, and self of these believers are under their feet, and they follow the Lord to walk the way of the cross. They walk on the pathway of the Lord with these things under their feet. These things are only under their feet because they have received the knowledge that everything in the old creation was terminated on the cross.</p>
<p>These believers see that God&rsquo;s evaluation of man&rsquo;s condition calls for death. Having received this clear vision, they no longer give opportunity or ground to their flesh, temper, naturalness, or self. The flesh, temper, naturalness, and self are under their feet because of the intensity of the shining of the light.</p>
<p>This is the superior way to know and experience the cross. In the past two thousand years of church history, at least one believer, the apostle Paul, gained the knowledge and experience of the cross in this manner. When he was on the way to Damascus, he saw an intense and penetrating light (Acts 9:3-9), which revealed to him that he had been terminated on the cross and that the whole old creation had been terminated as well.</p>
<p>The content of Paul&rsquo;s Epistles shows that he saw Christ&rsquo;s all-inclusive and all-terminating death on the cross in the light from heaven that shined upon him that day. His knowledge of the cross was due to this intense shining, and he realized that his flesh, old creation, self, and naturalness had been terminated on the cross. Thus, in his Epistles he subsequently writes that all things belonging to Satan and the old creation have been crucified and terminated on the cross (1 Cor. 15:3; Heb. 2:14; Gal. 6:14; Rom. 6:6; Gal. 2:20; 5:24).</p>
<p>Although other believers may not have seen such an intense light, some have seen that everything of themselves was dealt with on the cross and that all things were terminated in the death of Christ. The light that these believers have seen concerning the cross is great. This way of knowing and experiencing the cross is superior.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_052.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_054.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Christ and the Cross &nbsp; pg 53</div><br></body></html>
