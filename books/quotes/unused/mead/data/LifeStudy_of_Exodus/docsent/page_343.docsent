   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWO THE CURTAIN FOR THE DOOR OF THE TENT 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 26:36-37; 36:37-38; 40:5, 28</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that in the tabernacle there were two curtains, one called the veil and the other called the screen.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to pray for spiritual understanding concerning the veil and the screen, for they imply some very important things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They indicate that through His all-inclusive death Christ has become the entrance for God s chosen people to come into the enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A PLACE FOR ENJOYMENT</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The tabernacle signifies God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But if we see only that the tabernacle is the dwelling place for God, our understanding will be superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must go on to realize that a dwelling place is a place for enjoyment, not only for living.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Your home is not simply the place where you live; it is also a place for enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To live without enjoyment is actually to suffer the killing of death.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The reason people commit suicide is that they feel their living is meaningless, without any enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s dwelling place is the place for Him to be the enjoyment for His people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may also say that it is the place where God s chosen people participate in the full enjoyment of God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is crucial to see this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE ENTRANCE INTO THE ENJOYMENT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The two curtains, the veil and the screen, signify Christ in two aspects of His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through His all-inclusive death, this Christ has become the entrance for God s people to come into the enjoyment of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The two curtains signify the unique Christ and also Christ s all-inclusive death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Christ died to take away our sins through the judgment of God He suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This judgment is indicated by the brass sockets under the pillars supporting the screen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ was fully judged by God on our behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Of course, in Himself Christ had no reason to suffer God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In every way He was right with God and with man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He never did anything to deserve God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But He was judged by God because of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The judgment through which He passed has become the brass sockets as the base on which we stand.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that we stand on the judgment Christ suffered for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul preached this as the first aspect of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1 Corinthians 15:3 he says, For I delivered to you, among the first things, that which also I received, that Christ died for our sins according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Thus, in the gospel preached by Paul we see, as the first item, that Christ died for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the book of 2 Corinthians Paul goes deeper.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We may say that 1 Corinthians is partially in the outer court and partially in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second Corinthians, however, is in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In 2 Corinthians 5:14 Paul says that Christ died for all.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Not only did He die for our sins He died for us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In His death we also were crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>His crucifixion thus included all His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For this reason, Paul concludes that because One has died for all, then all are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is not the first item of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is more of an inward matter than the outward matter of Christ dying for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This outward matter brings us into the Holy Place, but the inward matter brings us into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In contrast to 1 Corinthians, the book of 2 Corinthians does not reveal a life partly in the outer court and partly in the Holy Place; it reveals a life in the Holy of Holies, a life which has passed through the riven veil.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Second Corinthians is a book of a life in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This life is a life of resurrection through crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As ministers of the New Testament, the apostles lived a crucified life for the manifestation of the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, they could enter the Holy of Holies, for they had passed through the two curtains; they had passed through the screen and the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that they had passed through the judgment of God upon Christ for their sins and also through the crucifixion of the flesh by the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In 2 Corinthians 4:11 and 12 Paul says, For we who live are always being delivered unto death for Jesus sake, that the life also of Jesus might be manifested in our mortal flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>So then death operates in us, but life in you.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Paul was daily delivered to death so that the resurrection life might be manifested in him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This indicates that he had passed through the riven veil in order to live in the Holy of Holies.</S>
