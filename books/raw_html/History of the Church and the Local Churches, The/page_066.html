<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Revival concerning<br>the Overcoming Life of Christ</H2><P>The second revival among us happened twelve years later in 1935. By that time many churches had been raised up, but we had become somewhat cold. Brother Nee himself also had the feeling that he needed some burning. Thus, he made the decision in the spring of 1935 to go to England. He also decided that before going, he would come to my hometown of Chefoo.</P><P>Brother Nee and his wife stayed in my home. While he was staying there, we had a conference for one week. In that conference he ministered day after day on the overcoming life of Christ. Through this prevailing conference, we were all revived. We were all on fire again. He canceled his trip to Europe and returned to Shanghai to hold another conference. The fire of that revival burned the church in Shanghai in 1935.</P><P>This was the second revival among us which helped us to experience the overcoming life of Christ. Before that time we came to know the life of Christ, and we had some experience of the death of Christ, but what we had come to know and experience was not that prevailing. Through that revival we were brought into a full realization and a rich experience of the overcoming life of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Revival concerning<br>the Practicality of the Church Life</H2><P>The third revival among us was in 1942 and 1943. First, we were revived with the truth concerning the assurance of salvation. Second, we were set on fire with the overcoming life of Christ. The third revival was with the practicality of the church life. That revival transpired again in my hometown of Chefoo.</P><P>Before that revival, Brother Nee had a big turn in 1939. In that year he saw the Body of Christ and the practicality of the local church. I went in 1939 to attend his conference on the Body of Christ. Then I went to his training in 1940. At that time I received much help from him, mainly from the private talks he had with me. Through those talks I saw what he called the blueprint of the practicality of the local church.</P><P>Later I returned to Chefoo in northern China. Once I returned, I did not have the liberty to move anymore because of the war. I realized that it was the Lord's will for me not to travel but to stay in Chefoo to practice the church life in a practical way. From January 1941 we practiced everything that I had seen in Shanghai from Brother Nee. We had the proper eldership, the deacons, the service office, and the service groups. We practiced the church life for two years according to the blueprint Brother Nee had seen. At the end of 1942 the church in Chefoo experienced a great revival. This revival came through the practicality of the church life with all the service groups. The practicality of the church life brought all the saints into the building. The church in Chefoo had about eight hundred saints at that time.</P>
