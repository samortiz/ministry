   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR NEED TO BE UNVEILED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, "But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I like the term unveiled.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I am concerned that we might still be veiled.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 2 Corinthians 3 to be veiled means to be covered by old religious concepts, thoughts, teaching, and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Simply put, to be veiled is to be covered by your own religion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have the concept from Christianity that when we come to a so-called church service, we have to come in a nice, polite, religious, and pious way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the result of this is emptiness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, suppose I come into the meeting saying, "Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Amen!</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I love Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You may say I am crazy, but what is wrong with this?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should care not for being pious but for being nourished with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Christianity we were taught to be quiet, but we gain nothing from this.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, I found out that when I say, "Lord Jesus," I get nourished within.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We all need to care for being nourished with Christ, not for any religious forms.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Coming to the meeting in a silent way is to come void of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I am doing something, by His mercy, to help His people be rescued from the falsehood of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Many are still under the veil of old religion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They are still under the covering of their old religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul said in 2 Corinthians 3:15 concerning the Israelites, "Indeed unto this day, whenever Moses is read, a veil lies on their heart."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When they read the Old Testament, they were still under the covering, the veiling, of their old concept.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But Paul said in verse 14 that "the veil is being done away with in Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Christ, the veil is removed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As long as we are in Christ, everything we do is right.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If I shout in Christ, this is right.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Jewish people were so much for keeping the Sabbath that they sent out some Sabbath-day policemen to arrest all the Sabbath-breakers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Matthew 12 tells us that Jesus went on the Sabbath day through the grainfields.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His disciples became hungry and began to pick the ears of grain and eat them v. 1 . They ate in a "wild way" without cooking, without a dining table, and without dining utensils.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But in the fields they were fully fed.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then the Sabbath-day policemen, the Pharisees, came to tell Jesus that His disciples were breaking the Sabbath v. 2 . Those Sabbath-day policemen thought they were very scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But the Lord Jesus said, "Have you not read...?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We could paraphrase what the Lord Jesus said to the Pharisees in this way: "You are supposed to know the Bible and do everything according to the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Have you not read in the Scriptures that David and his followers went into the house of God and ate something illegally?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How about that?"</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God does not care for the keeping of certain regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God wants people to be satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>You may come to a so-called church service nicely, quietly, and piously, but how do you feel within?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Are you satisfied and filled up, or empty?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we come in a silent and dead way to the meetings, we have to admit that we are empty.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should forget about the religious regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Forget about "the Sabbath."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You have to take care of your hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Get yourself satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is better to eat something raw in a wild way than to go hungry.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should care only for the satisfaction of God's people, not for religious forms and regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is somewhat easy for the young ones to say that they hate religion, because religion is a kind of bondage.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I hope that all the older ones among us would forget about being religious.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The most religious person was Saul of Tarsus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But on the way to Damascus, a light from the heavens shone upon him and he fell down.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He said, "Who are You, Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At that time the Lord came into him, and there was no more religion with him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The veil was removed in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I hope that all of us would have unveiled faces.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some of the saints have many questions concerning certain doctrinal things.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But if you were invited to a dinner and served chicken, would you ask about its bones or its tail?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We do not care for the bones or the tail.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We care for taking the rich meat of the chicken into us.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You need to be simplified.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There are many things that we cannot understand.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I do not understand what air is, but I have been breathing it for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I have never graduated from breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To graduate from breathing is to die.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Although I do not understand the air, I enjoy it every day by breathing it.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Air is good for breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I know this and I do know I can breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>God made me this way.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the same way, we need to breathe in Christ moment by moment by calling on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need to return to the simplicity which is toward Christ 2 Cor 11:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to pray, "O Lord, be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Remove all the veils.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Take away all the coverings.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Lord, grant us a clear sky."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We do not realize how much we have been veiled by the so-called Christian religion, by the religious concept we received from Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We are stumbled because we are under the covering of religion, the veil of our religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We should not care for anything religious.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We should care only for Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We need to have all the veils taken away so that we can behold and reflect Jesus 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>As we are beholding and reflecting Jesus, the image of Jesus will be impressed upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Then we will not be regulated, corrected, or improved, but transformed from within with the element of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>The living Jesus, who is full of organic energy, will transform us.</S>
