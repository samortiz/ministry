IN THE TOWNS AND VILLAGES</h2>
<p>We need to promote every person preaching the gospel and every home preaching the gospel. We also need to promote preaching the gospel to children and in the community. Moreover, in order to evangelize Taiwan, we still need people to go out to the towns and villages. There are presently seventy-seven cities and towns in Taiwan that have a church. Every church should be concerned with more than just their own place. This means that the church in Taipei should care not only for Taipei, and the church in Tainan should care not only for Tainan. Every church must be a center for the increase and spread of the gospel. In other words, in order to evangelize the entire island of Taiwan, we must see that each local church is a center to evangelize Taiwan.</p>
<p>However, according to what we have seen and learned from the Lord, we do not want any aspect of the work to have a centralization of power. To centralize authority in one place is not according to the principle in the Bible. Therefore, we will not promote the evangelization of Taiwan in a central way. Every local church is a center for the work. There is a proverb which says that many hands make light work. For this reason, we will never carry out the evangelization of Taiwan centrally.</p>
<p>There is also a need to produce full-timers and to support their material needs. According to the basic principle in the Bible, in the Old Testament God asked His people to give one-tenth of all their produce (Deut. 14:22). We should not think that God was asking the children of Israel for only one kind of tithe. According to my own calculation from reading the Bible, there were five to six kinds of tithes. The first kind of tithe was general (Exo. 30:11-16). There was also a tithe when there was a feast and when there was a special occasion. Not only so, there were twelve tribes among the Israelites, and the one tribe, the tribe of Levi, was supported by the other tribes (Num. 18:21, 24). This means that for every twelve Israelites one was a full-timer. In the Old Testament the Levites were separated to do nothing but serve God. They had no portion in the land; they relied on the other tribes.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the Lord personally selected twelve disciples when He was on the earth. Without a doubt these ones were full-timers. According to Acts, there were about one hundred twenty people who prayed in the upper room in a house in Jerusalem. These one hundred twenty people were in one accord and had a definite part in God&rsquo;s economy. Among them twelve were full-timers. This means that one hundred eight people supported twelve full-timers, or one full-timer was supported by nine believers.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Every Twenty Saints Producing One Full-timer</h2>
<p>In 1957 I visited Toronto, Canada, where there was a large group that was rather spiritual. The characteristic of that group was that it sent out many missionaries. On the average, for every twenty persons one missionary was sent out to preach the gospel. When we went to visit their chapel, we noticed that it was very clean, but the furniture and the windows and doors were rather old. The doors and windows had not been painted for at least ten years. The believers there said that they allocated most of their money to sending out missionaries. As a result, in 1958 this group sent out more missionaries than any other group in North America. We have been on the small island of Taiwan for over thirty-five years, and we still have not spread the gospel through all of Taiwan, but the Western missionaries took only two hundred years to spread the gospel from Europe and America to Africa and Asia. During the days of the Western missionaries, transportation was not as convenient as it is today. They had to cross the ocean to preach the gospel. Every time I consider this, I feel we are still so short.</p>
<p>Concerning the practice of producing full-timers, we can learn from church history. In all of Taiwan there are at least nine thousand brothers and sisters who meet regularly. According to the principle in the Old Testament, every eleven persons should support one full-timer. According to the principle in the New Testament, every nine persons should support one full-timer. According to church history, every twenty saints should produce a full-timer. After much consideration, we decided that we will follow the pattern of church history, which is that for every twenty persons there should be one full-timer. This means that nine thousand saints should produce four hundred fifty full-timers; however, we have a little under two hundred full-timers. In order to evangelize Taiwan in five years, we have to clear this debt. If we do not have one full-timer for every twenty saints, we cannot give an account to the Lord, and the Lord will not have a way among us. If we desire to advance, we must climb over this high hill.</p>
<p>I hope that during the next two years, 1985 and 1986, the number of the saints will double. We should never say that this is idealistic. This goal can be reached. One of the small groups has been established for a little over two months, and yet it has brought in forty newly saved ones. If there is a will, there is a way. If we are all willing to do our best, by the end of this year the total number of believers in Taiwan will double. It all depends on our way and our willingness to practice this new way. When our total number doubles, the percentage of full-timers should also double. We cannot be relaxed. If we want to evangelize Taiwan in five years, every year we should produce five hundred full-timers. Then in five years there will be twenty-five hundred full-timers.</p>
<p>The full-timers produced by a locality should be supported by that locality. The full-timers produced in Taipei should be supported by the church in Taipei. Those full-time brothers and sisters should take Taipei as their center and preach the gospel in the nearby areas. The full-timers produced by Taichung should take Taichung as their center and spread the gospel in the nearby towns and villages. There should be saints going out from all seventy-seven local churches to preach the gospel. In this way all seventy-seven localities will be stirred up.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_049.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_051.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Crucial Words of Leading in the Lord's Recovery, Book 5: Concerning Various Aspects of Church Service &nbsp; pg 50</div><br></body></html>
