<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. The Spirit of God Coming upon Balaam,<br>and Balaam Prophesying in a Parable</H2><P>The Spirit of God came upon Balaam, and he took up his parable and said, "The word of Balaam the son of Beor,/The word of the man whose eye is opened,/The word of him who hears the speaking of God,/Who sees the vision of the Almighty,/Falling down, but having his eyes uncovered" (vv. 3b-4). The phrases "whose eye is opened" and "who hears the speaking of God" indicate that the prophet was on the alert. His falling down with his eyes uncovered indicates that he cooperated with God.</P><P>In verse 5 Balaam says, "How fair are your tents, O Jacob,/Your dwelling places, O Israel!" This reminds us of Balaam's word concerning Israel in his first two parables. In the first parable he said, "Behold, a people that will dwell alone,/And will not reckon themselves among the nations" (23:9b). This word indicates that Israel is a holy people, a people separated, or sanctified, unto God. In the sight of God, Israel stands alone. According to God's view, Israel, even today, is not reckoned among the nations. If we have God's view, we will regard Israel as a particular and separate people, as a sanctified and holy nation. In his second parable Balaam said, "He has not beheld iniquity in Jacob;/Nor has He seen trouble in Israel" (23:21a). This means that, in the sight of God, Israel is without fault.</P><P>The first parable reveals that Israel is holy, and the second, that Israel is perfect. Now we need to see that, according to the third parable, Israel is beautiful. Israel's beauty is indicated by the word "fair." In the sight of God, Israel is holy, sinless, and beautiful. In standing she is holy, in kind she is perfect, and in appearance she is beautiful. This reveals that God has chosen, redeemed, saved, separated, uplifted, perfected, and beautified this people.</P><P>According to the Bible, this will be the actual situation of Israel during the millennium. The Jews are not welcomed by the nations in this age, but they will be welcomed by the nations after the Lord Jesus comes back. God promised that the descendants of Abraham would be a blessing to all the nations (Gen. 12:2-3). Eventually the Jews will be fully blessed by God, and they will be a blessing to the entire human race.</P><P>In Numbers 24:6 Balaam continues his description of Israel: "Like valleys that stretch afar,/Like gardens beside a river;/Like aloes that Jehovah has planted,/Like cedar trees beside the waters." Here Israel is likened to valleys, which usually are green, and to gardens beside a river. Aloe is a plant known for its healing effect. (The Lord Jesus was buried with aloes&#151;John 19:39.) After the coming back of the Lord Jesus, Israel will be a healing to the nations, and that healing will be a great blessing.</P><P>Numbers 24:7a says, "Water shall flow from his buckets, /And his seed shall be in many waters." This indicates that Israel will have an abundant supply of water. The water of a country is related to the riches of that country. The more water a nation has, the more riches it will have. Without water, the land would be a desert.</P><P>In verse 7b Balaam goes on to say, "His king shall be higher than Agag,/And his kingdom shall be exalted." Agag was the king of the Amalekites. Balaam's word here is a prophecy that eventually has its fulfillment in Christ.</P><P>Verses 8 and 9 are somewhat a repetition of 23:22 and 24. Both portions say that God brings Israel out of Egypt and that Israel has "as it were the horns of the wild ox." Furthermore, in both portions Israel is likened to a lion and a lioness.</P>
