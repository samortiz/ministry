   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>XI.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ON COMMITTING SIN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Bible God acknowledges the validity of sex.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is nothing wrong with the consciousness of sex or sex itself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The consciousness of sex is not sin; in fact, it is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, this is true only within the context of a marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In a marriage, sex is good and holy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But any sexual consciousness or sexual act outside the bounds of oneness is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Have you seen the difference?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is sex outside of marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because sex outside of marriage is a breach of the oneness of a marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, sex is a sin only when it destroys the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Sex has nothing to do with sin when it is sex alone.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Sex itself is not sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must see this clearly before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Matthew 5:28 the Lord Jesus said, "But I say to you that every one who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The word looks here involves the will.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not just seeing a woman but looking at her.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Seeing is passive, while looking is active.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This looking is followed by the phrase in order to lust after her.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not a passing lustful thought that comes to one's mind when he sees a woman, but a look at a woman that is for the purpose of lusting after her.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Lusting comes first, and then looking.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This look is the second look, not the first look.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first look is a random look at a woman on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The second look is to actually look at her.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Between the first look and the second look, a lustful thought has come in. The second look is therefore for the purpose of lusting after a woman.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The second look is the third step in the process.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus is not talking about the first look, but the look which is the third step.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When some see a woman on the street, they do not control themselves and lust after her.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Satan injects lustful thoughts into men, and they turn and look the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The second look is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Sin is having lustful thoughts and looking at someone the second time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Matthew 5 says that everyone who looks at a woman in order to lust after her has already committed adultery with her in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord Jesus is not referring to the first look.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is wrong to involve the first look in this discussion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Suppose I see a woman on the street by accident.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Satan may inject lustful thoughts into me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If I reject them, that is the end of it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But if I turn and look at her again, that is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Please bear in mind that the consciousness of sex is not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It becomes sin only when there is the consent of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When such a consent of the will happens outside the context of marriage, the oneness is destroyed by the will.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is sin to destroy the oneness in one's conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In God's eyes, it is sin also to destroy the oneness in one's will.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the Old Testament, only adultery is spoken of as sin; fornication is not mentioned as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Old Testament forbids only adultery, because man did not have enough knowledge of himself yet.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is adultery?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Adultery is sin committed by those who are married.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What is fornication?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Fornication is sin committed by those who are not married.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The act is the same, but the sin is not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can say that a prostitute commits only fornication, but not adultery, because she is not married.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have to realize that God does not want man to commit fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Old Testament speaks only of the sin of those who are married; it does not speak of those who are not married.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It does not mean that there is no such thing in the Old Testament, but the term is not there.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Here we see that the act that destroys oneness adultery is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But the act that does not destroy oneness fornication is sin as well.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We need to see that adultery is sin and that fornication is also sin.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To destroy the oneness of the married ones is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Fornication, which happens to those who are not married and which seemingly does not destroy oneness is also sin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Christians should not commit adultery; neither should they commit fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We must see that sex is holy; sex consciousness is not a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sex within marriage is holy and is not a sin.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>But if you are married and have sex outside of marriage, that is adultery.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If you are not married but have sex, that is fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As believers we must not commit adultery, and we must not commit fornication.</S>
