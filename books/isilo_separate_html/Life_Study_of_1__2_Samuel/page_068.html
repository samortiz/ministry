DAVID GOING UP FROM THE WILDERNESS OF ZIPH<br>AND REMAINING IN THE STRONGHOLDS OF EN-GEDI</H2><P>David went up from the wilderness of Ziph and remained in the strongholds of En-gedi (v. 29). When Saul returned from following the Philistines, he was told where David was, and Saul took three thousand choice men and went to seek David (24:1-2).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>XV. SAUL FALLING INTO THE HAND OF DAVID,<br>BUT DAVID NOT KILLING HIM</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. This Being God's Discipline on Saul<br>in His Pursuing of David</H2><P>When David and his men were hiding in a deep cave, Saul fell into David's hand (vv. 3-4a). This was God's discipline on Saul in his pursuing of David.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. David Not Killing Saul<br>but Only Cutting Off a Corner of Saul's Cloak</H2><P>David would not kill Saul but only cut off a corner of Saul's cloak. However, even for this David's heart smote him, because of his fear of God in that Saul was God's anointed (vv. 4b-7). In God's kingdom there is a divine order of authority. Saul was not a self-appointed king; he was the king appointed and anointed by God. Saul was therefore the divine authority, and David feared God in this. David kept the God-ordained order of authority among God's elect. By so doing, David laid a good foundation for himself to be the king of God's elect in the coming days. If he had rebelled against Saul, then he would have been to the people an example of rebellion against the God-ordained, appointed king.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. David Pleading with Saul</H2><P>David pleaded with Saul, and Saul was somewhat influenced by David's appeal (vv. 8-15). What David did here was exactly what the New Testament teaches concerning not repaying evil for evil but overcoming evil with good (Rom. 12:17, 21).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. David's God-fearing and God-honoring Life<br>Subduing the Reckless Saul</H2><P>Finally, David's God-fearing and God-honoring life subdued the reckless Saul and stopped Saul from pursuing him (1 Sam. 24:16-22). In his relationship with Saul, David is a very good pattern for us in the church life today.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_067.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_069.html">Next</a> </body></html>
