   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many readers of the Bible feel that in studying the four Gospels, the easiest thing to study is Christ s prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This concept is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The prayers in Matthew, as we have seen, are hard to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They show us how to pray according to God s will for the accomplishment of God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In this message we will conclude our fellowship concerning the God-man living, specifically concerning Christ as a man of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Among other things, we want to consider the Lord s prayer on the cross in which He said, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Matt 27:46 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is difficult to reconcile this portion of the Word with what the Lord said in John concerning God the Father s always being with Him as God s sent One 16:32; 8:16, 29 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God the Father was with Him all the time, but when He was dying on the cross, He cried, My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to see how to reconcile these two portions of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We want to emphasize that we are still fellowshipping concerning the divine facts in the mystical human life of the first God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The significance of the loaf on the Lord s table has two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One is the physical aspect, and the other is the mystical aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The loaf, on the one hand, signifies the Lord s physical human body of blood and flesh, which He gave for us on the cross in dying for us and for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At the same time, that loaf signifies Christ s mystical Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The physical body is judicial.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The mystical Body is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are the mystical Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have been baptized in one Spirit into this one Body 1 Cor 12:13 , and God has placed us and blended us together in this one mystical Body vv.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>18, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Such a mystical view can be possessed only by the seeking Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Like the Lord Jesus, we need to be those who are apparently physical, yet invisibly mystical.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All the genuine prayers, real prayers, prayers that can be counted by God, are divine facts in the mystical human life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have seen that before the Lord fed the five thousand, He prayed by looking unto His Father Matt 14:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is something divine, performed in a mystical human life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>6.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Teaching His Disciples How to Watch and Pray</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Now we want to conclude our fellowship from the previous message concerning the Lord s prayer in Gethsemane, where He taught His disciples to learn from Him how to pray Matt 26:20-30, 36-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>a. The Spirit Being Willing but the Flesh Being Weak</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Gethsemane the Lord came to His disciples and found them sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He said to Peter, So were you not able to watch with Me for one hour?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Watch and pray that you may not enter into temptation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>40-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Watching and praying is a very strong principle in our Christian life because the tempter, Satan, is always around us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The more we love the Lord, the more the tempter pays attention to us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once we turn to the Lord to love Him, Satan would not stop trying to trouble us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is a battle and a struggle in this universe between God and Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I believe that the Lord s telling His disciples to watch and pray was also His warning to Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, Peter entered into Satan s temptation in the same night.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He denied the Lord to the Lord s face three times.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Surely he was not watching and praying at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the same night, Peter entered into temptation due to his not watching and praying.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There is another principle of the seeking believers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This principle is that all the time their spirit is willing, but their flesh is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a principle not only in prayer but also in the entirety of the Christ-seeking life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our spirit desires to be an overcomer, but our flesh is weak.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have the desire in our spirit, but we do not have the strength in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why we should not trust in the flesh but take care of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>b.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Finding the Disciples Sleeping</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When the Lord came again to the disciples, He found them sleeping, for their eyes were heavy v. 43 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Reason We Do Not Watch with the Lord in Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord came to the disciples the third time and said to them, Are you still sleeping and resting?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Behold, the hour has drawn near, and the Son of Man is being delivered up into the hands of sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Arise, let us be going.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Behold, the one who is betraying Me has drawn near vv.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>45-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>While the disciples were sleeping, the Lord was fighting in His prayer, even to the extent of sweating with drops like blood Luke 22:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord took Peter, John, and James, who were more close and intimate to Him see Matt 17:1 , apart from the rest of the disciples particularly and charged them to watch with Him 26:37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They did not keep the Lord s word, because they were weak in their flesh even though they were willing in their spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>40-41 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This shows us the reason that we do not watch with the Lord in our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our spirit is willing, but we have a problem with our flesh, which includes our self.</S>
