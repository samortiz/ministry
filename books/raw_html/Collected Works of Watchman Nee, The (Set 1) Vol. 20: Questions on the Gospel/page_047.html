<H1 CLASS=MSG>QUESTION THIRTY-EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>CONCERNING LUKE 16</H1><P>In the story of the rich man and Lazarus in Luke 16, was the rich man's perdition a result of enjoying good things in his lifetime? Was Lazarus' salvation a result of suffering evil things in his lifetime, or were there other reasons?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANSWER</H2><P>Some say that the rich man's perdition was a result of enjoying good things in his lifetime and that Lazarus' salvation was a result of suffering in his lifetime. They say this because of the words which were spoken by Abraham to the rich man (Luke 16:25). But is this really the case? In verse 25 Abraham was comparing the differences between these two before and after their death. Abraham did not come to the basic reason for their perdition and salvation until verse 29, which says, "But Abraham said, They have Moses and the prophets; let them hear them." From this we can see that the rich man's perdition was due to not obeying the words of Moses and the prophets, whereas Lazarus' salvation was a result of heeding the words of Moses and the prophets.</P><P>What are the words of Moses and the prophets? After the Lord Jesus resurrected, He was walking with the two disciples who were on their way to Emmaus. "And beginning from Moses and from all the prophets, He explained to them clearly in all the Scriptures the things concerning Himself" (Luke 24:27). Verses 44-46 also say, "And He said to them, These are My words which I spoke to you while I was still with you, that all the things written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me must be fulfilled. Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures; and He said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ would suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day." The words of Moses and the prophets were the words spoken by the Lord Jesus. In other words, the rich man perished because he had rejected the Savior who died and rose for him. Lazarus was saved because he received the Savior who died and rose for him.</P><P>God has given us the Bible. Since we can believe the words of the Scripture, He will not send a man from the dead to preach the gospel. God has been hiding Himself. He does it most marvelously. God has been hiding Himself to the extent that man thinks that there is no God. Even though man commits sin and evil, God does not punish him by instantly striking him to death with thunder and lightning. Even if man blasphemes God, He still does not instantly punish him. God does not arrange all the stars in the heavens into words that explicitly tell man that he has sinned, thereby proving that there is a God in this universe. Today God does not use spectacular ways to express Himself. He simply wants man to believe His Word.</P><P>"But he [Abraham] said to him, If they do not hear Moses and the prophets, neither will they be persuaded if someone rises from the dead" (Luke 16:31). This is a revelation from God. This revelation tells us that if people do not believe the words of Moses and the prophets, it would be futile even if someone were raised from the dead. Therefore, if people do not accept the testimony of the Bible, they will not believe even if someone rises from the dead.</P>
