   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Job cried to the earth not to cover his blood and not to frustrate his crying out v. 18 . Then he said, "Even now, behold, my Witness is in heaven,/And He who vouches for me is in the heights./My friends deride me;/My eye pours out tears to God,/That He would adjudicate for a man in his case with God/And for a son of man in his case with his neighbor" vv.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>2-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In verse 9 Job declared, "Yet the righteous man will hold fast to his way,/And he whose hands are clean will wax yet stronger."</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Bildad declared, "Indeed the light of the wicked goes out,/And the flame of his fire does not shine./The light is darkness in his tent,/And his lamp above him goes out" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Regarding the wicked, Bildad went on to say that terrors frighten him all around, that his strength is famished, that calamity is prepared at his side, that he is rooted out of his tent, that brimstone is scattered upon his habitation, that the memory of him perishes from the earth, that he is thrust out from the light to the darkness and is driven from the world, and that he has no posterity and no progeny among his people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then Bildad concluded, "Surely these are the dwellings of the unjust,/And this is the place of him who does not know God" v. 21 . Bildad tried to give advice, but his words were words of waste.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His logic and his warning were based on the principle of good and evil.</S>
