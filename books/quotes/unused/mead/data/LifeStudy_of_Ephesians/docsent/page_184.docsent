   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE SIXTY-FOUR THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message and in the message following we shall consider the items that make up the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first three items the girdle, the breastplate, and the shoes form a group.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By means of these three things we are able to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Along with these three items, we need to take up the shield of faith and receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit 6:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Soldiers in ancient times fought with a shield in one hand and a sword in the other.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>A shield is a defensive weapon, whereas a sword is an offensive weapon.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Actually, of the six items of the whole armor of God, only the sword is an offensive weapon.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All the other aspects of the armor are for defense.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us first consider the girdle, the breastplate, and the shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I. THE GIRDLE OF TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The first part of 6:14 says, Stand therefore, having girded your loins with truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For us to gird our loins is to strengthen our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Our whole being needs to be strengthened with truth.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This strengthening is not for sitting, but for standing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>According to the way the word truth is used in chapter four vv.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>15, 21, 24, 25 , truth here refers to God in Christ as reality in our living, that is, God realized and experienced by us as our living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is actually Christ Himself lived out by us John 14:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such truth, such reality, is the girdle that strengthens our whole being for spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our living must have a principle and a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is nothing less than God Himself expressed in our living in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When such a truth girds our loins, we are made strong for the purpose of standing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Suppose, however, that your daily living is far below the standard of the truth as it is in Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Instead of being able to stand and to withstand in the evil day, you will flee.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because in your daily walk there is no testimony and no expression of God, you do not have the strength to stand against the stratagems of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If our daily living is loose, we are not able to stand against the powers of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order for us to stand, our daily living must be according to the principle of the truth and up to the standard of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As we have pointed out, this truth is God Himself expressed as the principle of our daily walk, as the standard of our daily living, and as the pattern of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who have such a living certainly have their loins girded with truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These are the ones who are able to face attack and opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because they are girded with truth, they can stand before the opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if God is not expressed in our daily life and walk, we shall not have a girdle about our loins, and we shall have no strength to stand against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We shall not have the power to face opposition or controversy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The truth with which we are girded for spiritual warfare is actually the very Christ we experience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Philippians 1:21 Paul says, To me to live is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This Christ whom Paul lived was his girdle of truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This Christ was God expressed and revealed in Paul s daily walk.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because Paul s daily living was conformed to the pattern of Christ, he had the strength to face all opposition and adverse circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because Paul had been girded about with truth, he had the strength to stand.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE BREASTPLATE OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In verse 14 Paul goes on to say, Having put on the breastplate of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The breastplate of righteousness covers our conscience, signified by the breast.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Satan is our accuser.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In fighting against him we need a conscience void of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But no matter how good we may feel our conscience is, we need to have it covered with the breastplate of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Righteousness is to be right with both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we have just a little problem with either God or man, Satan will accuse us, and there will be holes in our conscience through which all of our faith and boldness will leak out.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, we need the covering of righteousness to protect us from the enemy s accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such righteousness is Christ 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If in any thing we are not righteous, our conscience will be a conscience with offense.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But if we are to engage in spiritual warfare, we must have a conscience void of offense, a conscience without holes.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When our conscience has holes in it, our faith will leak out through the holes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If accusations and offenses remain on our conscience, faith will disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, we need to deal with our conscience in order to have a good conscience, a conscience void of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In addition, we need to put on the breastplate of righteousness to cover our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever we are about to fight the spiritual warfare, Satan, the accuser, attacks our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He does not trouble us so much in this way at other times, Satan knows when there are offenses on our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When he accuses us with respect to these offenses, we are immediately weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Revelation 12:11 says, They overcame him because of the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>To be covered by the blood of the Lamb is mainly to have upon us the breastplate of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Righteousness is in the blood, and the covering of the blood is the breastplate.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Although this may be difficult to explain doctrinally, we can understand it experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whenever we intend to fight against the powers of darkness, Satan, through his accusations, causes our conscience to become very sensitive.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>These feelings actually are not the sensitivity of the conscience, but the result of Satan s accusations.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Immediately our response should be, I overcome Satan, the accuser, not by my perfection and not even by a conscience void of offense, but by the blood of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am defended against his accusations by the breastplate of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The righteousness that covers our conscience and that guards us from Satan s accusations is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Thus, Christ is the truth that girds our loins and also the breastplate of righteousness that covers our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are covered not by our own righteousness, but by Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some may wonder how the breastplate of righteousness can be related both to Christ and to the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In experience we cannot separate the blood from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Apart from His blood, Christ could not cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Under the cleansing of His blood, He becomes our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Whenever we are about to take part in the spiritual warfare, we need to pray, Lord, cover me with Yourself as my righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Lord, I hide under Your blood.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Furthermore, we must tell the accuser, Satan, I overcome you, not by my merit, but by the prevailing blood of the Lamb.</S>
