   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Opening the Door 5:4-5</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 4 says, "My beloved put in his hand by the hole of the door, and my bowels were moved for him.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I rose up to open to my beloved; and my hands dropped with myrrh, and my fingers with sweet smelling myrrh, upon the handles of the lock."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the bowels to be moved means that her deepest feelings are touched.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Her questions are not a rejection, but an indication of the weakness of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Her will has fully been subjected to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The expression of delay is caused by her natural constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Inwardly, she has no problem at all, but she is somewhat feeble outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, the Lord encourages her with new invitations.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If her heart were indeed hardened, the Lord would not have pursued her.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, He "put in his hand by the hole of the door."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is a calling, not a chastisement.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This hand is the hand that once embraced her, the hand that was once under her head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This hand is the nail-pierced hand.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord beckons her once again with such a hand.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Putting the hand through the hole of the door means that the Lord is doing all that He can to reveal a part of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Through the revelation of His hand, the Lord hopes that she will begin to think about Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His hand represents His heart, and it reveals Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All spiritual experiences are the result of the attraction of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Men must see the Lord's revelation before they will rise above their present condition of ease to advance further with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Those who truly see the Lord cannot fail to be moved in their bowels.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But how few are those who are moved by the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>How many are there who can tell the difference between being touched by the teaching and being touched by the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The maiden rises to open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because of the Lord's attraction, she is willing to accept the cross of shame, just as she was once willing to accept the cross of power.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The hands that open the door, the hands that signify faith and obedience, surely drop with myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here we see not only the power of the Lord's death, but the smell of His death.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord's life, which has passed through death, is in her hands and it is rising up as a tide, enabling her hands to open the door.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even the lock of her will cannot help but be permeated with the smell of the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>D. Withdrawal 5:6</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Verse 6 says, "I opened to my beloved; but my beloved had withdrawn himself, and was gone: my soul failed when he spake: I sought him, but I could not find him; I called him, but he gave me no answer."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A person who is experienced in the Lord's dealing does not experience discipline from God when he is disobedient.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's discipline comes to him only after he is obedient.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When a person is obedient, the Lord will show him the evil of disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With a beginner, the discipline comes before obedience, and discipline brings him into obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>With an experienced person, discipline comes after obedience and gives the person the taste of the bitterness of disobedience.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the maiden's feeling, her beloved is gone once again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Formerly, she lost the Lord's presence because of her foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now the pain she experiences is in her spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Her spirit seems to be bound in darkness, and there is no light.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>She recalls how she was beside herself when the Lord first called, and how her soul was raptured away to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When He spoke, her heart was ravished.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now she hates herself and does not know why she cannot have the outward strength to match her inward desires.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>She hates the fact that she gave a false excuse which caused Him to hide His glorious face.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She can only look and call; she cannot find Him, and He will not answer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This search is different from the one she had before.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This search is not on the streets or in the broad places, but before God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Even prayer seems to be useless.</S>
