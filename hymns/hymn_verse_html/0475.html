<div style='padding-left:10px'><span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12225' href='#ref_12225'>1 Cor 6:17</a></span> But he who is joined to the Lord is one spirit.<br><b>fn 1 </b>This refers to the believers' organic union with the Lord through believing into Him (John 3:15-16). This union is illustrated by that of the branches with the vine (John 15:4-5). It is a matter not only of life but in life (the divine life). Such a union with the resurrected Lord can only be in our spirit.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12227' href='#ref_12227'>1 Cor 12:13</a></span> For also in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body, whether Jews or Greeks, whether slaves or free, and were all given to drink one Spirit.<br><b>fn 2 </b>The believers of Christ are baptized through water and in the Spirit into (1) Christ, (2) the death of Christ (Rom. 6:3), (3) the name-the person-of the Triune God (Matt. 28:19), and (4) the Body of Christ. Baptism ushers the believers into an organic union with Christ and the Triune God, making them living members of the Body of Christ. All the gifts, as the manifestation of the Spirit distributed to the individual believers by the Spirit, are for the profit, the building up, of this Body. The apostle was very conscious of this. He was Body-conscious, Body-centered, unlike the Corinthians and so many other believers through the centuries who are self-centered concerning spiritual gifts. Hence, after this verse he gave the Corinthians a long discourse concerning the Body. His intention was to rescue them from self-seeking back to a concern for the Body, that they might no longer be for their individual profit but for the building up of the Body.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12228' href='#ref_12228'>Rom 6:4-8</a></span> We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death, in order that just as Christ was raised from the dead through the glory of the Father, so also we might walk in newness of life. For if we have grown together with Him in the likeness of His death, indeed we will also be in the likeness of His resurrection, Knowing this, that our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves; For he who has died is justified from sin. Now if we have died with Christ, we believe that we will also live with Him,<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12229' href='#ref_12229'>Eph 2:6</a></span> And raised us up together with Him and seated us together with Him in the heavenlies in Christ Jesus,<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
<span style='white-space:nowrap; font-weight:bold'><a name='verse_12230' href='#ref_12230'>2 Thes 1:10</a></span> When He comes to be glorified in His saints and to be marveled at in all those who have believed (because our testimony to you was believed) in that day.<br><b>fn 1 </b>The Lord is the Lord of glory (1 Cor. 2:8); He was glorified in His resurrection and ascension (John 17:1; Luke 24:26; Heb. 2:9). Now He is in us as the hope of glory (Col. 1:27) to bring us into glory (Heb. 2:10). At His coming back, on the one hand He will come from the heavens with glory (Rev. 10:1; Matt. 25:31), and on the other hand He will be glorified in His saints; that is, His glory will be manifested from within His members, causing their body of humiliation to be transfigured into His glory, conforming it to the body of His glory (Phil. 3:21). Thus, the unbelievers will marvel at Him, admire Him, wonder at Him, in us, His believers.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
