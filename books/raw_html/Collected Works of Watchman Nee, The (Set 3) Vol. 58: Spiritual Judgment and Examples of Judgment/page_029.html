<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT</h1><h1 class="title">(14)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date:July 9, 1948</h1><h2 class="head1">TESTIMONY BY SISTER H. F.</h2><p>I was saved in 1924. After I became a Christian my parents began to persecute me. My father said that I could not remain in the house because my whole family was in turmoil because of me. I was sent to a seminary in Nanking and studied there for over three years. After I returned home, my father would not allow me to go out again. Instead, he told me to do my preaching at home. Between 1927 and 1936 I was mostly at home. That time was foolishly spent. The only lesson I learned was submission to family authority. Later I went to Shanghai and lived at Hardoon Road for a year, fellowshipping with the brothers and sisters. Later I felt to have a little house of my own in order to forget everyone else and live by myself. I avoided the brothers and sisters and would not fellowship with them. In 1947 the church in Shanghai began to preach on handing oneself over to the Lord and to the church. I handed myself over at that time. Since then I have lost the freedom to go wherever I want. The church decided that I should move to Customs Lane in Foochow, and I obeyed. After I listened to Brother Nee's messages, I received the supply and was enlivened. When I was in Shanghai, others criticized me for being a closed person. I kept what I knew and would not ask others about what I did not know. Others have told me that I was proud. But this is the way I am. What can I do?</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><p>A cold person always wants to hide himself and shy away from others. Some people live by the outer man. While their outward activities still continue, their inner man sinks. This is our sister. Her inner man has sunk. Your spirit has sunk, but still you are trying to live by the outer man, that is, by the emotion, thoughts, and ideas. But they are not enough to support you. Your spirit is not strong enough. This is the reason you have become what you are. When you see yourself under God's light, your spirit sinks, and many spiritual things become tasteless to you. This is like a sick man who knows that he should eat but does not have an appetite for any food. Our sister only has spiritual knowledge but does not have spiritual reality. She does not have any spiritual interest and has lost her appetite for spiritual things. You can go on being a Christian, but you will live according to cold knowledge. Fortunately, you have not found a good house. If you had, you would have moved in and hidden yourself. But even if you were able to do that, such solitude would be boring after a while. When your spirit is down, you try to run away from any environment. When your spirit has lost touch with God and you are void of light, you are in darkness and sorrow, and you cannot touch God.</p><h2 class="head2">The Breaking of the Outer Man</h2><p>If we do not have God's light, all outward things become meaningless and tasteless, and all outward circumstances become boring to us. Then God has to do two things. First, He has to deal with our outer man, for the outer man can never replace the inner man. God does not want us to sustain the inner life with anything outward. He does not want us to live by a strong emotion. Nor does He want us to live by a strong will. The Lord will take this opportunity to break and dry up our outer man. We will become discouraged, pessimistic, and negative, and we will realize that there is less and less of a chance for the outer man to reassert itself. Outwardly speaking, this seems discouraging, but by then our outward abnormal activities will have ceased. In other words, the disobedient acts of the outer man will have stopped. This is the benefit on the negative side&mdash;the improper activities are stopped. If the inner man has sunk but the outer man is still active, you will have a problem. It is a good thing that the outer man will not support the inner man when it is down, because this will save some time in the breaking work.</p>
