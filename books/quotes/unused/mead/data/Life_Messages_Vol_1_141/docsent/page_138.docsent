   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IN OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Where is this One who is the resurrection and the all-inclusive Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Jesus Christ today is in our spirit 2 Tim 4:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 8:16 says "The Spirit with our spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit is not with our mind nor with our heart but with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This very One, who is endless, indestructible life, is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>How can you identify your spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is the part of you that is still there after you deduct your mind, your emotions, and your will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Suppose, for example, you are deciding whether to go to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Your mind says no; it is tired of meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Your emotions are not in favor of going either; they choose to go along with the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Your will is also in agreement with the mind and emotions that you should not go.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even your heart declares that it wants to rest and joins the others in voting to stay home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now, if you deduct the feelings in your mind, emotions, will, and heart, you will sense that there is yet another part of you, welling up to say that it would like to go and asking you to disregard the opinions of your mind, emotions, will, and heart.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is your spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here is another illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose there is a brother whose ways do not appeal to you.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Your emotions say, "I can't stand him."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Your will says, "His manner is obnoxious."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Your mind says, "I have no use for such an illogical person."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Your heart says, "The less I see of him, the better."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But after you subtract all these negative reactions, there is still a part within which says, "There is something about him I like.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I cannot despise and disregard him."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do you see how your spirit is distinct from your emotions, will, mind, and heart?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit with our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here is the Christian life victory, sanctification, the Lord's presence, and all that He is.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Romans 8:4 tells us that we are not to walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The mind set on the spirit is life and peace v. 6 . When we walk according to this Spirit with our spirit, God is pleased.</S>
