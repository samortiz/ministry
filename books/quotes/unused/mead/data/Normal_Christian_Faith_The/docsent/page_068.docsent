   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SAVED ACCORDING TO THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is true that God is full of grace, but you do not have to be saved by His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You can be saved by His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The grace of God is based upon His love towards us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It makes Him willing to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But His righteousness is based upon His Son's death for us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It makes Him unable not to save us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Before Jesus died, God was free either to save or not save us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But once Jesus died, God was bound!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is absolutely obligated to save whoever comes to God by the blood of Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Have we read this?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is impossible for Him not to forgive us!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is salvation according to His righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Before the death of Christ, if He had forgiven any of our sins or had acquitted us from the punishment for sin, He would have made Himself a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now He has caused His Son to be crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The judgment of sins has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The problem of sin is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God can no longer reject anyone who comes to Him by the blood of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Now He will make Himself a sinner and an unrighteous one if He does not forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>IMPOSSIBLE FOR GOD NOT TO SAVE US</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some may think, "Is it that easy to be saved?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am afraid that I need to pray more.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have to pray to an extent that God softens His heart and has favor upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Only then will I be saved!"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today, even if God would not soften His heart, He still has to forgive your sins!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even if God is absolutely disgusted with you, He still has to grant you this forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It does not matter whether you pray for a long time or not.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, it depends on the fact that redemption has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even if God does not want to save you, it is too late for Him to change His mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It would be all right if it were two thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, God has accepted the sacrifice of Christ; now it is impossible for Him not to save you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A sinner can suffer judgment only once!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He cannot be judged twice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In order to forgive our sins, God has taken all the trouble to accomplish the salvation in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now He has commissioned us to go to the whole world to show others that God has accomplished this work of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He can now forgive sins without placing Himself in an improper standing.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>GOD FORGIVES UPRIGHTLY</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Others may say, "Why don't I feel saved?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Why is it that after I believed, nothing special seemed to happen?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I don't feel the peace inside."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Please remember that it is not a matter of whether you have the peace or not.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whether or not you have the peace is immaterial.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The important thing is for God to have the peace.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He has to grant a forgiveness that is just and honest.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When God forgives you in Christ, He does so righteously, uprightly, and openly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All you need to do is receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A passage that is quite familiar to many people is Mark 10:45: "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Unfortunately, many only read up to this part.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They cut off the remaining half.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The word "and" following this phrase should be translated as "even to the extent that."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To what extent did the Lord Jesus come to serve?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He came to serve to the extent that He gave His life as a ransom for many.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In Matthew 26:28 the Lord Jesus said, "For this is My blood of the covenant, which is being poured out for many for the forgiveness of sins."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, the shedding of His blood is for the forgiveness of our sins and for our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can only obtain forgiveness in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Outside of Him, whatever kind of forgiveness you have is not just.</S>
