How did the Lord Jesus come as another Comforter? He came first by becoming the life-giving Spirit through death and resurrection; this was the first step of His coming. Then, on the day of His resurrection, in the evening, the Son who became the Spirit came to breathe Himself into the disciples; this was the second step of His coming. Similarly, verse 16 says that the Father would give the Comforter to the disciples. Verse 16 says, &#8220;And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.&#8221; How did the Father give the disciples another Comforter? The first step was by resurrecting the Son, who passed through death (Acts 2:24, 32; Rom. 8:11), and then by sending the Son who had become the Spirit to breathe into them (John 14:26). When the Son breathed into them, the Father&#8217;s giving was accomplished. The Lord&#8217;s breathing of the Holy Spirit into the disciples was the fulfillment of His promise that the Father would give them the Spirit of reality as another Comforter. Hence, the Lord&#8217;s breathing accomplished not only His coming as another Comforter but also the giving of the Comforter by the Father. In other words, the Lord&#8217;s breathing is the Spirit&#8217;s coming and the Father&#8217;s giving. Therefore, John 20:22, where the Lord breathed into the disciples, is the fulfillment of 14:16-17, 26, and 15:26.<h2 class=head3>Another Comforter, the Spirit of Reality, Being the Consummation of the Triune God</h2><p>John 14:19 says, &#8220;Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me.&#8221; This word was spoken by the Lord to His disciples on the night of His betrayal. Then on the third day He was resurrected from death, and in the evening of that day He went to the disciples and breathed into them, saying, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit,&#8221; who is the Spirit of reality. The Lord&#8217;s word of promise to His disciples was fulfilled in just three days and was therefore &#8220;a little while.&#8221; At that time, the Lord became the Spirit and breathed Himself into the disciples. Hence, the world beheld Him no longer, but the disciples beheld Him. The Lord&#8217;s breathing was the Father&#8217;s giving and the Spirit&#8217;s coming. This is the reaching of the Triune God. Hence, the Spirit of reality, the Holy Spirit who was breathed into the disciples, is not only the third of the Triune God but the Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God. In this Spirit are the Son and the Father. For this reason, for Christ to come into us to become our experience, He must be the Spirit. Christ is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God.<p>Hence, the Triune God is not for theological doctrines but for our experience. If we do not understand this, in our experience it may seem that we have only the Son without the Father and the Spirit. Actually, when we experience Christ, this Christ is the Spirit, and this Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God. Therefore, when we experience Christ, we also experience the Father with the Spirit. We may say even more plainly that the Christ whom we experience is the Spirit. For this reason, many of the great Christian teachers throughout the ages eventually acknowledged that Christ is the Spirit in the Christians&#8217; experience. Because of this, we have created the term the pneumatic Christ. Paul was clear about this matter and therefore said, &#8220;The Lord is the Spirit&#8221; (2 Cor. 3:17). This kind of speaking is not doctrinal but experiential because he went on to say, &#8220;Where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom.&#8221; Furthermore, he said, &#8220;But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit&#8221; (v. 18). This means that in our experience the Lord is the Spirit, the consummation of the Triune God. The Lord Spirit, who is transforming us within, is with the Father and in the Son.<br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> </body></html>
