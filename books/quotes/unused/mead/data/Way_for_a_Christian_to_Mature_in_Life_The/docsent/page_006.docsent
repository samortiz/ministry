   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT OF STEPHEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING IN PARADISE UNDER THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At the end of Acts 7 Stephen was martyred, and while he was being stoned, he said, Lord Jesus, receive my spirit! v. 59 . Some use this to say that Stephen s spirit went to a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They think that since the Lord is in heaven, when He received Stephen s spirit He must have received it into heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Again, this is an inference.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose I give something to someone.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After he receives it, he may not necessarily put it beside him or bring it to his room.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He could put it in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord Jesus undoubtedly received the spirit of Stephen, but we cannot arbitrarily say that He received it in the third heaven where He is.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Ecclesiastes 3:21 says, Who knows the breath of the children of men, that it goes upward; or the breath of the beasts, that it goes downward to the earth?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some translate the word breath in this verse as spirit in the first instance and soul in the second.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Based upon this, some conclude that this verse states that the spirits of the saved ones go upward and the souls of the beasts go downward to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, this is again a problem in translation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Hebrew word used in this verse should be translated spirit or breath.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ecclesiastes talks about everything being vanity of vanities 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then in chapter three it goes on to say that there is not much difference between men and beasts vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is what the writer of Ecclesiastes meant.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, when he comes to verse 21 he asks, Who knows the breath of the children of men? meaning, Who understands the breath of men?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a question.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can also put another question mark after the next phrase that it goes upward.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Furthermore, the verse ends with the phrase the breath of the beasts, that it goes downward.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The question mark at the end of this phrase indicates that this is a question as well, meaning, Does the breath of the beasts go downward?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This verse does not conclude that the spirits of men go upward and that the souls of beasts go downward.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It merely shows us that no one can understand where the breath of man goes upward or otherwise.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether it is upward or otherwise, it is vanity of vanities and is not worth considering.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many people also refer to Ecclesiastes 12:7, which says, And the dust returns to the earth as it was, and the breath returns to God who gave it.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They say that the body dies and returns to the earth and that the spirit returns to God who gave it.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since God is in heaven, they conclude that the spirit must go to a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This again is an inference.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have already said that although the Lord Jesus receives the spirits and souls of the believers, He does not necessarily place them in a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For example, when I return money to you and you receive it, instead of putting it in your pocket, you may deposit it in the bank.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ecclesiastes 12:7 indicates that the body comes out of the earth and naturally returns to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, since the spirit and soul are given by God, when the believers die, their spirits and souls cannot remain in the material world and must therefore return to God s spiritual world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although they return to God, there are particular details in regard to how He arranges for them and where He puts them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The passages quoted above are all from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can also use the Old Testament saints as examples to illustrate that the spirits and souls of the dead believers went to Sheol.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The spirits and souls of people like Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob indeed returned to God, but Genesis clearly tells us that their spirits and souls are in Sheol.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>BEING CLOTHED WITH THE GLORIFIED BODY</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The spirit and soul of a person are the person himself, and a person s body is like his clothing, which is clearly shown in 2 Corinthians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man s spirit and soul are clothed with the body, without which man is naked.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If someone today came into our midst unclothed, I believe we would not even dare to look at him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may even wonder if this person had become insane and abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We all love the apostle Paul, but if Paul s spirit and soul were here without his body, would we dare to shake hands with him?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I am afraid we would all be scared away.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We would be scared because he would be in an abnormal condition.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When a believer dies, his spirit and soul are separated from his body, and death is written all over him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Death is even filthier than sin.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nothing of death can be brought before God because God is the God of the living, not of the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Every dead person must wait until resurrection when his spirit and soul will be properly clothed with the body before he can come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Old Testament explicitly says that when a person came to serve God in the Holy Place, he had to be properly dressed.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He could not be naked or have any condition of death upon him cf.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Exo 28:40-43 , because death could not be brought into God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When those who have been saved die, they also cannot go to God s dwelling place in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God therefore puts their spirits and souls in the Paradise in Hades so that they may rest and wait there.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What are they waiting for?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They are waiting for the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Once they are resurrected, their spirits and souls will be clothed with their bodies, and death will be swallowed up.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thus, their naked condition will also be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At that time they will be clothed with glorified bodies to enter properly and appropriately into God s dwelling place, that is, God s eternal kingdom.</S>
