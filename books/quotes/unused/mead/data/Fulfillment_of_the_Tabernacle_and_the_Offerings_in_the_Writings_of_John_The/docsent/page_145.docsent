   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that Christ not only comes to us He enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ can come into us because He is pneumatic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We simply need to breathe Him in as the divine pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We know from experience that even when we are not aware of it, the heavenly air enters into us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To Impart the Divine Life into the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In resurrection Christ imparts the divine life into the believers John 3:15-16; 10:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through His death the divine life was released.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now this life is imparted to our being by the pneumatic Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The redeeming Christ is now the pneumatic Christ in resurrection, and this pneumatic Christ enters into us to impart the divine life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By this we see that the divine life has been imparted to our being not only through the Lord's death but also through His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To Live in and with the Believers</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the Spirit in resurrection, Christ lives in and with the believers John 14:19; 6:57; Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This means that He becomes one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He and we have one life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Because of His resurrection, we and the Lord have one life, and we live together with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To Bring the Believers into the Father, That Where He Is They Also May Be</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In resurrection Christ brings the believers into the Father so that where He is they also may be John 14:10a, 11a, 3, 20; 17:21, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is to be in the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Through Christ's death and resurrection, through His going and coming, we have entered into the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have not only entered into the Father's house, but we have even become part of the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>John 14:23 says, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The abode here is one of the many abodes mentioned in verse 2, where the Lord says, "In my Father's house are many abodes."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord's word here indicates that the believers become abodes in the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today we all are part of the church life, part of the Father's house, through Christ's death and resurrection and in the pneumatic Christ, who now lives within us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The pneumatic Christ makes us one with the Triune God, and this oneness is the Father's house.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the Body of Christ, which is an organism of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This marvelous organism is infinitely better than a so-called heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Such a mansion would not be pneumatic.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But today's church is pneumatic.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church is an organism full of pneuma.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead of looking forward to a heavenly mansion, I prefer to remain in the church enjoying the pneumatic Christ.</S>
