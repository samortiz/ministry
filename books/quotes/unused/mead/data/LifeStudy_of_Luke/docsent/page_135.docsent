   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EXAMINED BY THE CHIEF PRIESTS,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SCRIBES, AND ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 20:1 we see that as the Lord was teaching in the temple and preaching the good news, the chief priests, scribes, and the elders came to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The priests were the serving ones in the temple, the scribes were those with a thorough knowledge in the Mosaic law, and the elders were administrators among the Jewish people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These three categories of people were the outstanding leaders in the Jewish community.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They came prepared to carry out a thorough examination of the Lord as the Passover Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Luke presents the examination of the Lord Jesus from a different angle from that found in Matthew and Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Luke s presentation is from the angle of the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In chapter twenty of the Gospel of Luke we have a picture of the Man-Savior behaving Himself in the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of course, in all the foregoing chapters we have seen the Lord s high standard of morality produced by His divine essence with the divine attributes and His human essence with the human virtues.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Now in chapter twenty we have a more detailed portrait of the Man-Savior s highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The chief priests, scribes, and elders said to the Lord, Tell us by what authority you are doing these things, or who is the one who gave you this authority?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>20:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They thought that they could catch the Lord by asking Him about the source of His authority.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the One who was being examined, the God-man was frank, genuine, wise, and dignified.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But those who were questioning Him were base, subtle, insidious, and dishonest.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They did not come either with a proper attitude or in a proper spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In answering the question raised by the chief priests, scribes, and elders, the Man-Savior was wise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When asked who gave Him authority, He did not say, My Father gave Me this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To answer the question in such a way would not be wrong, but it would be lacking in wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In His wisdom the Lord said to them, I also will ask you one thing, and you tell Me: the baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This question put them into a dilemma, and they debated among themselves about it, saying, If we say, From heaven, he will say, Why did you not believe him?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But if we say, From men, all the people will stone us to death, for they are persuaded that John was a prophet vv.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Eventually, not having the wisdom to handle the situation, they could do nothing except lie by answering, We do not know where it was from v. 7 . Knowing that they were lying, the Lord said to them, Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things v. 8 . This indicates that the Lord knew the Jewish leaders would not tell Him what they knew.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, neither would He tell them what they asked.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They lied in saying, We do not know.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the Lord spoke the truth wisely to them, exposing their lie and avoiding their question.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In this incident we can see how base and insidious were the chief priests, scribes, and elders.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>At the same time we see how pure, wise, and dignified the Man-Savior is.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>What a sharp contrast!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>EXAMINED BY THE PHARISEES AND HERODIANS</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the chief priests, scribes, and elders were defeated by the Man-Savior, the Pharisees and the Herodians tested Him 20:20-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Pharisees, a religious party, were patriotic and faithful to the Jewish community.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Herodians took sides with King Herod s regime and took part with him in infiltrating the Jews with Grecian and Roman manners of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They sided with the Sadducees, but were opposed to the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But here they joined with the Pharisees to ensnare the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They worked together in the attempt to carry out a plot to trap the Man-Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>According to verse 21, the Herodians and the Pharisees questioned the Lord, saying, Teacher, we know that you speak and teach correctly, and do not accept man s person, but teach the way of God in truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Is it lawful for us to pay taxes to Caesar, or not?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This was truly an ensnaring question.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paying taxes to Caesar was opposed by the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the Lord Jesus said that it was lawful to do this, He would offend the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if He said that it was not lawful, He would give the Herodians, who stood with the Roman government, ground to accuse Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>By asking the Lord such a question they exposed themselves as being base, dishonest, and insidious.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In handling this dilemma the Lord was again honest, pure, and wise.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Considering their craftiness, He said to them, Show Me a denarius.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Whose image and inscription does it have?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>And they said, Caesar s. And He said to them, Therefore pay the things of Caesar to Caesar and the things of God to God vv.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>24-25 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>To pay the things of Caesar to Caesar is to pay tribute to Caesar according to his governmental regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To pay the things of God to God is to pay the half shekel to God according to Exodus 30:11-16 and to offer all the tithes to God according to the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In 20:20-26 we see two completely different standards of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Pharisees and Herodians were base, dishonest, and insidious.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But the Man-Savior was genuine, frank, honest, and wise.</S>
