   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GAINING STABLE HOUSEHOLDS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In our labor in the new localities, we need to gain households, because it is difficult for a church with only single saints to be stable.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to the Bible the practical church life is built up in the homes; hence, we must keep this principle in our work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We must do our best to gain two households with four people in each household.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is better than eight single people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to pay attention to this and spend the time necessary to gain families.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After a household is baptized, we must spend more time to nourish the family members.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must spend time to perfect every household, just as we perfect and teach individual new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even though a local church with a total of twelve people in six stable households may be small, it will be stable.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, it is more difficult for an entire household to move than it is for a single person to move.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, there is a need for us to stabilize the households.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In every town and village that we go to, we must gain households and maintain a sweet relationship with every family.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We will gain many benefits from such a practice.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we go out to the different places to establish churches, we need to remember that the households are the greatest support to the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>SPENDING MORE TIME TO NOURISH THE NEW ONES</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We spent three terms in the full-time training, one and a half years, to research and experiment how to knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>During that time we spent much time and money, and many people went out every day to knock on doors so that we could know the type of results to expect.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In one and a half years we baptized a total of thirty-eight thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is a large number of people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These people heard the gospel, confessed their sins, called on the Lord s name, prayed, and received salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, only the Lord knows whether they will enter the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we baptize people, we do not have the full assurance that they will enter into the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Nevertheless, in one and a half years we baptized thirty-eight thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have now left the experimental stage, and we are in the stage of practicing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Consequently, our plans for spreading the gospel must be based on how long it takes us to baptize people.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that a team of twenty people should spend fifteen days to knock on doors and preach the gospel and ten days to set up home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not be excited when we baptize many people, because there is still the problem of how to nourish these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is easy to beget, but it is difficult to nourish.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the past we baptized people within three minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We cannot say that this is wrong, but we must consider the consequences.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we continue begetting new ones, who will nourish them?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the teams go to their first town, there are twenty full-timers on the team.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, only two full-timers remain in the new locality when the team goes to the next town.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This means that the many new ones become a heavy burden to the two full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If they are unable to care for all the new ones, some of the new ones will be left to die.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Up to this point we have only considered baptizing people quickly; we have not considered what will happen to them after they are baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is a problem for the ones we baptize to be left with no one to nourish them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, we should not be quick to baptize too many people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In every town the teams should have at least ten days to lead home meetings and not knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This will enable us to stabilize the newly baptized saints.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must labor to preach the gospel and baptize people during the first fifteen days, but we should not baptize too many people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is best if we baptize only forty to fifty people.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>For this reason, we should not be too quick to baptize people.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Instead, we should speak with them to touch their spirit, and we should listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If a person is a son of peace, we should baptize him immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A person who is baptized too quickly can deny his baptism when we visit him a few days later.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In order to avoid this situation, we must learn not to baptize people too quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we baptize only twenty people after laboring for two weeks, we will need to spend more days to gain another twenty people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This may require us to go back to some of the people we have already contacted in order to baptize forty to fifty new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, there must be enough serving ones on every team.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This way of laboring is solid.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some people should be baptized quickly; however, if we are not clear whether we should baptize certain people, we should wait before we baptize them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As the full-timers go out in their teams, we will continue to learn, and we will also adjust our method based on their experience.</S>
