   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE ALL-INCLUSIVE SPIRIT OF CHRIST I. WHAT IS CHRIST?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In order for us to properly understand the all- inclusive Spirit of Christ, we must first see what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do not say "who" Christ is, but "what" Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are many different names given to Christ in the Scriptures; however, we are not going to consider the names of Christ, but the substance of Christ, His very essence.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A wooden table may be called a table, but its essence or substance is wood.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What is the substance of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is what I mean by asking "What is Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He Is God</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I think we all will agree that first of all Christ is God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Let us read Isaiah 9:6.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is a wonderful verse.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"For unto us a child is born and his name shall be called The mighty God."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How strange that a child could be called "The mighty God"!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet these two are one!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A little child is the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Can we believe it?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the difference between the God in whom we believe and the God whom the Hebrew people believe.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>They believe that God is the only God, the mighty God, but they do not believe that this God has ever been a child.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, here in Isaiah 9:6, the Scripture says a child is called the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We know this child was Jesus who was born in the manger at Bethlehem.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>So, Jesus Christ is the very God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>John 1:1 tells us clearly and definitely that Christ is God from eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Romans 9:5 says that Christ is the God who is over all and blessed forever.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>With many other verses, the Scripture assures us that the Christ whom we have received as our Savior is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"In him dwelleth all the fullness of the Godhead bodily" Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He Is the Father</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Isaiah 9:6 there is a parallel line: that is, "unto us a son is given and his name shall be called The everlasting Father."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is abundantly clear that the Son mentioned here is Christ; yet the Son is called, "The everlasting Father."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This statement cannot be easily comprehended; yet it is written.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Son is called the Father; so the Son must be the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must realize this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are some who say that He is called the Father, but He is not really the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But how could He be called the Father and yet not be the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If I am called a brother, I must be a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Son is called the Father; therefore, He must be the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Can we drop Isaiah 9:6 from the Scriptures?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It clearly tells not only that a child, the very one born at Bethlehem, is called "The mighty God," but also that a son given to us is called "The everlasting Father."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the place where no man can approach Him 1 Tim 6:16 , God is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When He comes forth to manifest Himself, He is the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>So, a Son is given, yet His name is called "The everlasting Father."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This very Son who has been given to us is the very Father.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In John 10:30, the Lord Jesus says, "I and my Father are one."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Please notice that in the King James Version, the word "my" is in italics.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This means that it is not in the Greek text.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It must be rendered: "I and the Father are one."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They are not two, but one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then in John 14:8-11 we read: "Philip saith unto him, Lord, shew us the Father, and it sufficeth us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Shew us the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Believe me that I am in the Father, and the Father in me."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We cannot make the Son and the Father two separate beings, for they are one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Perhaps you may ask how the Son could pray to the Father if the Son is the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is really not much of a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Andrew Murray has said that the best prayer is the Christ in us praying to the Christ in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Zechariah 2:8-11, "the Lord of hosts" is both the Sender and the One sent by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Scripture tells us clearly that the Son is called the Father, and the Son Himself tells us that He and the Father are one.</S>
