   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF SECOND CORINTHIANS MESSAGE FORTY-THREE THE MINISTERS OF THE NEW COVENANT 12 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 6:14 7:1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that to be fully reconciled to God is to have the full experience of God s salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have also seen that to be fully reconciled and saved is to have our hearts enlarged.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now let us go on to consider 6:14 7:1, a frank exhortation of the reconciling ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>NOT TO BE UNEQUALLY YOKED</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Verse 14 says, Do not become unequally yoked with unbelievers; for what partnership have righteousness and lawlessness, or what fellowship has light with darkness?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This word about not being unequally yoked was spoken by the apostle based upon his mouth being opened and his heart being enlarged to the believers in verse 11.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Having established the fact that full reconciliation is full salvation resulting in the enlargement of the heart, Paul exhorts the Corinthian believers not to become unequally yoked with unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word unequally in verse 14 means diversely; it denotes a difference in kind.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This refers to Deuteronomy 22:10, which forbids yoking two different animals together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Believers and unbelievers are diverse peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They should not be yoked together, because of the believers divine nature and holy standing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This should be applied to all manner of intimate relationships between believers and unbelievers, not only to their marriages and businesses.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This word indicates that the Corinthian believers were unequally yoked with unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were not separated unto God from worldly people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This indicates that they were not fully reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, the apostle exhorted them not to be diversely yoked with unbelievers, but to be separated that they might be fully reconciled, brought back, to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the Old Testament, cattle were of two categories: the clean and the unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Those that were clean chewed the cud and had cloven hooves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sheep and oxen were clean animals, but donkeys, horses, mules, and pigs were not clean.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, Deuteronomy 22:10 says, Thou shalt not plow with an ox and an ass together.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here we see that the law commanded the children of Israel not to yoke together a clean animal with an unclean one, not to put the clean and the unclean under the same yoke.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A clean animal, such as an ox, could be offered to God, but an unclean animal could not be offered to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, the clean and the unclean were unequal.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 6:14 Paul does not care for the teaching of the law; he cares for the spiritual significance of this requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Today we, the believers, are the clean ones.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We are the oxen and the lambs to be offered to God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Unbelievers, however, are unclean, and we should not be yoked together with them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be yoked together with unbelievers is to be distracted from God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To rid ourselves of such an unequal yoke is to come back to God and to be reconciled into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For example, a brother should not marry an unbeliever.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For him to marry an unbeliever is to be unequally yoked.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>That kind of unequal yoke would distract him from God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Likewise, to form a partnership in business with an unbeliever is also to be unequally yoked.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Suppose a believer and an unbeliever are partners together in a business and have the same interest and goal.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They are actually an unequally yoked pair.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This kind of pairing, yoking, needs to be terminated.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Anyone who engages in a business partnership in this way will be distracted by his business from God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>His business will take him farther and farther away from God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Any brother in that situation needs to cast off that unequal yoke in business and be reconciled, brought back, into God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Furthermore, friendships with unbelievers can cause us to be unequally yoked.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The young people especially like to make friends.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Young brothers and sisters, if you have close friendships with unbelievers, that will cause you to become an unequally yoked pair.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>That kind of yoking will distract you from God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Your unbelieving friend will not help you to come closer to God; rather, an unbelieving friend will take you away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As long as you maintain such an unequal friendship, you will be distracted from God more and more and taken gradually farther away from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, Paul charges us not to be unequally yoked together with unbelievers for the purpose that we may be kept in God and may be brought back fully into Him.</S>
