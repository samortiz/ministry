The Servant of Jehovah</h2><p>In Matthew 12:18-21 we see Christ as the Servant of Jehovah. Exodus 3 reveals that Christ is Jehovah Himself, but in these verses He is the Servant of Jehovah. As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ is the One sent by Jehovah to serve Jehovah&#8217;s purpose.<h2 class=head4>a. Chosen and Beloved of Jehovah, the One in Whom Jehovah Delights</h2><p>Matthew 12:18a says, &#8220;Behold, My Servant whom I have chosen, My Beloved in whom My soul has found delight.&#8221; Christ is the One chosen and beloved by Jehovah; He is the One in whom Jehovah delights.<h2 class=head4>b. With Jehovah&#8217;s Spirit upon Him, Announcing Justice to the Gentiles</h2><p>Matthew 12:18b goes on to say, &#8220;I will put My Spirit upon Him, and He will announce justice to the Gentiles.&#8221; As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ had Jehovah&#8217;s Spirit upon Him. When Christ was baptized, the Holy Spirit descended upon Him and abode upon Him as the economical power for His ministry. With Jehovah&#8217;s Spirit upon Him, He announced justice to the nations. The word justice here means &#8220;righteousness&#8221; or &#8220;righteous judgment.&#8221; A righteous judgment is a decision for the right things. The Lord Jesus proclaimed all the right decisions for the Gentiles.<h2 class=head4>c. Not Striving nor Crying Out</h2><p>Matthew 12:19 says, &#8220;He will not strive nor cry out, nor will anyone hear His voice in the streets.&#8221; This means that the Lord did not shout or make noise. Instead of crying out to make His voice known in the streets, He was calm and quiet.<p>Verse 19 indicates that, as the Servant of Jehovah, Christ was no longer free to minister openly. On the contrary, because He had been rejected, He had to hide Himself. As the context of Matthew 12 makes clear, the reason for the rejection and the cause of the Lord&#8217;s hiding Himself was His breaking of the religious regulations. This was due to the Lord&#8217;s caring for His headship and for the members of His Body.<h2 class=head4>d. Not Breaking the Bruised Reed nor Quenching the Smoking Flax</h2><p>Matthew 12:20 continues, &#8220;A bruised reed He will not break, and smoking flax He will not quench until He brings forth justice unto victory.&#8221; As the Servant of Jehovah, Christ will not break a bruised reed nor quench smoking flax. This indicates that while He was being rejected and opposed, He was still full of mercy. Those who were opposing Him were like bruised reeds and smoking flax, but the Lord Jesus was still merciful toward them.<p>The Jews used to make flutes of reeds. When a reed was bruised, they broke it. They also made torches with flax to burn oil. When the oil ran out, the flax smoked, and they quenched it. Some of the Lord&#8217;s people are like the bruised reed that cannot give a musical sound. Others are like the smoking flax that cannot give a shining light. Yet the Lord will not break the bruised ones nor quench the smoking ones. Although the Lord was rejected, He was still merciful. Even those who had become bruised reeds He would not break, and those who had become smoking flax He would not quench. Rather, He kept open to them the door of mercy and grace.<p>Among those who believe in the Lord Jesus today, many have become bruised reeds that can no longer give a musical sound. As a rule, the bruised reeds should be broken and thrown away. But Christ will not do this. Moreover, many of His believers no longer burn as a bright light. As a rule, He should quench them all and cast them away. But He will not do this either. Instead, as the merciful Servant of Jehovah, He would use some of those who are as bruised reeds and smoking flax to bring forth justice unto victory. If we think that no one is useful except ourselves, we cannot carry out the Lord&#8217;s work. The Lord would select some bruised reeds and smoking flax. He would perfect them so that they could become useful in His hand to bring forth justice unto victory. No matter how much He is opposed, He, the Servant of Jehovah, is still merciful.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_021.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_023.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Conclusion of the New Testament, The (Msgs. 265-275) &nbsp; pg 22</div><br></body></html>
