<h1 class="msg">PREFACE</h1><p>Volume 26 of The Collected Works contains the final three issues of Collection of Newsletters which was published from late 1933 until July 1935 in order to facilitate fellowship between the churches and communication among the saints in various localities.</p><p>In addition, we have included in this volume the three testimony messages given by Watchman Nee in a co-workers' meeting held at Kulangsu, an island off the southeastern coast of Fukien province, China, in October 1936. This section of Volume 26 has been published previously by Living Stream Ministry as Watchman Nee's Testimony (1991 Edition).</p>
