 <h2 class="head1">THE BEGINNING OF THE CHURCH&rsquo;S<br />
PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</h2>
<p>Out of my desire for the truth and my study and pursuit of the truth, I came into contact with Brother Nee&rsquo;s books and eventually joined Brother Nee in Shanghai. When the Sino-Japanese war began, I went north to bring my family out, but I fell into the hands of the Japanese and was not able to come out. In the meantime, Brother Nee withdrew with the national government to Chungking, which was far from the war front. Since we had no way to contact one another, I stayed in Chefoo. The church in Chefoo was gradually revived. In 1940 we began to speak of one matter&mdash;the church&rsquo;s preaching of the gospel. This was a new thing. The expression <em>the church&rsquo;s preaching of the gospel</em> had never been heard before. From 1932 to 1940, we had never seen more than fifteen people baptized at one time, and we considered it wonderful if ten people were baptized at the same time. However, if I remember correctly, thirty-seven were baptized the first time we, as the church, preached the gospel. Not only so, we later baptized one hundred on the same day.</p>
<p>Our gospel meetings during the Chinese New Year were called &ldquo;the church&rsquo;s preaching of the gospel.&rdquo; At this time, the whole church was energized to preach the gospel. The Chinese New Year, also known as the Lunar New Year Festival, is the celebration that the Chinese enjoy the most; it is the greatest feast of the year and lasts for almost a week. People did not have to work for a week; instead, they ate, drank, played, made merry, and watched operas all day long. The food they ate during the celebration was not freshly prepared but had all been prepared a month in advance, and there were all varieties of food. In northern China there was no need to use refrigerators because many families had cellars, in which they stored and froze the food that they had prepared. Whenever they needed food, they would take it from the cellars. This festival was a great opportunity to preach the gospel extensively because people were not occupied with anything else. At that time all the saints, whether brothers or sisters, whether young or old, were mobilized and went out in groups to preach the gospel.</p>
<p>To preach the gospel, we asked the brothers and sisters to first invite their relatives, such as their uncles and aunts, to their house for a few days during the New Year&rsquo;s celebration. Furthermore, in the homes of the saints there was a slogan: &ldquo;Not celebrating the New Year, only preaching the gospel.&rdquo; Celebrating the new year was a great thing; the preparation of food alone required a tremendous amount of time. Since our purpose was not to celebrate the New Year, we did not have to purchase anything pertaining to the festival; this saved us a great deal of time and money. For New Year&rsquo;s Eve, which was supposed to be a time of great merriment to the northern Chinese, we announced that it would be a night for fasting and praying. The whole church fasted and prayed specifically for the gospel. Although we ourselves fasted, we still prepared food for our friends and relatives who stayed with us. Then on New Year&rsquo;s Day, we had a gospel meeting in the morning and a second gospel meeting in the afternoon; there was no meeting in the evening. We met in this way for four consecutive days. After each meeting, the adults would contact the newcomers, and the children handed them prayer mats. Whenever the children saw that someone was ready to kneel down and pray, they would immediately pass a prayer mat to that person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEGLECTING THE GOSPEL RESULTING IN<br />
NO CONTINUATION OF SPIRITUAL DESCENDANTS</h2>
<p>The church preached the gospel in this way for a year, and as a result, people were baptized continually over a period of about six months. Approximately one hundred people were baptized in each of the first three to four months, and about twenty to thirty were baptized in each of the last three to four months. This had never happened before. This kind of gospel preaching resulted in a breakthrough in the number of people baptized. Hence, according to our observation, regardless of how much people pay attention to truth and life, if they neglect the gospel, they will not have any spiritual descendants. History also confirms this point. For example, the Brethren paid much attention to the truth, but because they did not pay attention to the gospel, they have few spiritual descendants today. In my youth I pursued and loved the truth and appreciated the Brethren&rsquo;s teaching of the truth; they were especially good at expounding the types and prophecies. To this day I am still grateful to the Brethren teachers because their expositions have been a great help to me. When I was with them, however, I did not see their weak point. It was not until I saw the matter of the gospel that I realized that the way the Brethren take does not work and is not right.</p>
<p>The Brethren assembly in my hometown of Chefoo had a history of over sixty years. The leading brother was an elderly brother from England, by the name of Mr. Burnet. He taught and preached personally because he was the only one who had been taught directly by Benjamin Newton. At that time I was twenty, and he was over sixty; he did all the preaching. He expounded the truth clearly and thoroughly in Chinese, and everyone who heard him was impressed. Brother Wang Ming-tao, who was raised up by the Lord in Beijing, was also helped by him. Brother Wang originally was not clear regarding several matters of the truth. For example, he believed in observing the Sabbath, not the Lord&rsquo;s Day. He later came to Chefoo and met Mr. Burnet. After having some fellowship with this elderly brother for a period of time, his concept concerning the Sabbath was adjusted.</p>
<p>This indicates that Mr. Burnet was a lighthouse of the truth in northern China. Although the denominations did not like him, all those who pursued the truth appreciated him. The Brethren, however, emphasized the truth too much and neglected all other matters. Even though they had been in Chefoo for several decades, they did not raise up another local assembly. In terms of numbers, they had at most two hundred people on the Lord&rsquo;s Day and less than one hundred on other days. I later realized that this is not the right way. No matter how strong their truth was, there was still a great lack because they did not preach the gospel. At that time they strongly condemned the Presbyterian Church; nevertheless, the Presbyterian Church had many more gospel activities than the Brethren. The Presbyterian Church was always active in the gospel, whether by visiting the villages or spreading the gospel within the community. This was the situation at that time.</p>
<p>At that time the Pentecostal movement also came to China and became prevailing in the north. After this &ldquo;wind&rdquo; blew into China, it was difficult not to be influenced by it. Hence, a few of our brothers had contact with them and observed their situation. The first to contact them was Brother Philip Luan. He was originally a member of the Far East Missionary Society, which was founded by the husband of the sister who wrote <em>Streams in the Dessert.</em> Brother Luan was from the northeast; it was there that he contacted the Far East Missionary Society and became a member. Later he came into our midst. He was the first to have contact with the Pentecostal movement. Later, more of us began to have personal contact with the people in that movement; we can say that it is from them that we learned of the Pentecostal movement.</p>
<p>I was born into organized Christianity, and I was edified by the Brethren in the aspect of the truth. I was helped the most by the inner life believers in regard to the aspect of life. In addition, I had contact with the Pentecostal movement. All three groups were unable to agree with one another. The Brethren did not agree with Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis; hence, although they appreciated Brother Nee&rsquo;s writings, when they discovered that he quoted part of Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis&rsquo;s writings in <em>TheSpiritual Man,</em> they were no longer interested in his books. From this we see that those who focus on the truth tend to ignore life, whereas those who focus on life tend to despise the truth, saying that the truth is merely dead letters.</p>
<p>One of the famous brothers among the inner-life believers was Andrew Murray. He could be considered one of its founders. Sometimes he would quote the wrong verses or expound the verses inaccurately. Although his experience was correct and his facts were also correct, he often quoted wrong verse references. Based on this, the Brethren said that Andrew Murray knew neither the Bible nor the truth. Those who study the truth always accuse one another and cannot tolerate one another. This incompatible situation often exists between those who emphasize truth and those who emphasize life.</p>
<p>If we pay attention only to truth but neglect to preach the gospel, we will not have offspring; similarly, if we pay attention only to life but do not preach the gospel, we will not have a continuation. Later evangelicals, including the charismatic movement, appeared. A Chinese evangelist called John Sung was quite famous among the Western missionaries. When he preached the gospel, there were often several thousand people listening to him, and people were saved by the hundreds. However, his gospel had neither truth nor life. For instance, to illustrate the effectiveness of &ldquo;the precious blood washing one&rsquo;s heart,&rdquo; he would cite the story of the woman with a flow of blood; this is altogether unscriptural. Hence, not much was left after his passing. This demonstrates that without truth and life our gospel preaching does not last. Truth, life, and the gospel must be twined together as a threefold cord; only then will our gospel preaching produce lasting results.</p>
