   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS CONCERNING CHRIST AND THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this chapter we will speak concerning Christ and the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE EXPERIENCE OF ROMANS 7</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Question: How does the experience portrayed in Romans 7 relate to the way of the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Answer: Among those who study the Bible and pursue spirituality, there has been much controversy concerning Romans 7 during the past few centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In his exposition of Romans, W. H. Griffith Thomas said that Romans 7 was not the experience of Paul after his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Griffith Thomas based his statement on the following points.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, Romans 7 was Paul s experience as a Jew under the law; it was his experience of the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is a strong point.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If chapter 7 was Paul s experience after his salvation, he would not have used the word now in 8:1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His saying now then...to those who are in Christ Jesus indicates that formerly he was not in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second, in his concluding word in Romans 7, Paul declared that he was a person corrupted in the flesh and, as such a one, cried out, Who will deliver me from the body of this death? v. 24 . He later found the answer; he found that he could be delivered through the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This shows that his experiences in chapter 7 were not in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Third, all who have studied the Bible in depth acknowledge that even though Romans 7 follows chapter 6, it does not connect the thought in chapter 6 to the thought in chapter 8.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some people say that chapter 7 is Paul s experience after his salvation, and others say that it is his experience prior to his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Everyone acknowledges that chapter 7 is a big parenthesis according to its content.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In other words, we can read chapter 8 immediately following chapter 6, because chapter 8 is the continuation of chapter 6.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In chapter 6, when speaking of being delivered from sin, Paul intended to show that because we are not under law but under grace, we have been delivered from sin, and sin has no power over us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He then inserted a parenthesis to explain the function of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, when speaking of those under the law, Paul says that the law lords it over a man as long as he lives 7:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since we have died in Christ, the law can no longer lord it over us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even if we wanted to live under the law, this would be futile.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, Paul used his past experience as an example, saying that even though he willed and strived, eventually all he had was a heart to will but not the power to do what he willed; he prostrated himself before the law.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It seemed as if the law was helping him, but in reality it was doing him harm; there was nothing he could do to fulfill the law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a result, he felt so wretched that he cried out, Who will deliver me from the body of this death? v. 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who assume that Romans 7 was Paul s experience after his salvation base their consideration on Paul s use of the expression the inner man in verse 22: For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They think that if Paul were not saved, he could not refer to the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since Paul was not yet regenerated as a Jew under the law, how could he have an inner man?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is true that in the New Testament the inner man refers to a regenerated being, but in the context of Romans 7, the inner man does not refer to a regenerated new man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verse 22, Paul said that he delighted in the law of God according to the inner man; then in verse 23, he referred to the law of his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Moreover, in verse 25, he said, With the mind I myself serve the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The mind in verses 23 and 25 is rendered heart in the Chinese Union Version.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Greek word is nous, which refers to the mind, a part in the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We consider that we have a body outwardly, which is called the outer man, and that we have two parts inwardly, the soul and the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the soul are the mind, emotion, and will, and in the spirit are the conscience, intuition, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The spirit is in man s innermost part, but the soul is also in man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, does the inner man in Romans 7 refer to the spirit or to the soul?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to the context, we know that it refers to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 7:25 Paul said that with the mind he himself served the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In verse 22 he said that he delighted in the law of God according to the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This shows that here the inner man refers to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We cannot say that the inner man in Romans 7 refers to the person in our spirit simply because 2 Corinthians 4:16 mentions the inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Romans 7 the inner man refers to the soul, not to the spirit as the regenerated inner man.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul willed to please God, but there was a different law in his members warring against the law of his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is a war between reason and lust vv.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This picture shows that even though a person may not be saved, he has outer members and an inner mind.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>His mind wants to do good, but the lust in his members prevents him from fulfilling his desire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, the inner man in Romans 7 must refer to one s mind.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although Romans 7 speaks of Paul s experience prior to his salvation, for many of us it is our experience after salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE EXPERIENCES OF ROMANS 7 AND GALATIANS 5</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Question: How do we experience Romans 8:6: For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace ?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Answer: Even though Romans 7 was Paul s experience prior to his salvation, it has become the experience of many Christians after their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul, as a Jew, strictly kept the law under the teaching of the Jews before he was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Philippians 3:6 he said that as to the law, he was blameless.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In contrast, we, the Gentiles, were living in dissoluteness before our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After repenting and believing into the Lord Jesus, we immediately have the concept that we must no longer live dissolutely but conduct ourselves properly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This concept makes us those who live under the law, that is, it makes us Sauls living under the law, just as Paul was Saul when he was living under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should live under the cross of Christ after our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, because of the influence of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, we think that since we did many wrong things in the past and now have repented and believed in the Lord, we should change our conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This places us in the same position as Paul before his salvation, when he was Saul in Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Moreover, many of the believers at the time when Paul wrote the book of Romans were like the Christians of today; they were Judaistic believers, even though they had believed in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They did not know God s salvation; rather, according to their natural concept, they tried to do good and keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This unknowingly brought them back into the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Before their salvation some Chinese have also had the experience of Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They paid much attention to virtue and morality and tried their best to do good, but later found out that even though they wanted to do good in their mind, there was a different law warring against them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>So they wrote books that portray the same situation that Paul depicted in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This shows that they had these experiences before they were saved and became Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some gospel friends might ask, You say that when the Lord Jesus enters into people, He gives them a sense of right and wrong in different matters.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Many of us who have never heard the gospel already know that certain matters are wrong, and we also have a sense within us.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>For example, we know it is not right for a couple to quarrel.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>How does this differ from the Lord Jesus being against the flesh of a person after their salvation?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must see that the struggle in Romans 7 is different from the war between the Holy Spirit and the flesh in Galatians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The struggle in Romans 7 is not spiritual; it is a struggle between the mind with its reason and the flesh with its lust.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This struggle is not a recent discovery; it has been here for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>It has nothing to do with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Today, however, our experience is more complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After we are saved and consecrated, we have the life that is described in Galatians 5, but it is intermixed with the life that is illustrated in Romans 7.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have the experience of the Holy Spirit warring against the flesh as well as the struggle between the law of good in our mind and the law of death in our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We can have the experience of Romans 7 as well as the experience of Galatians 5.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>What is spoken of in Romans 7 can still be our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>However, after experiencing the failure in Romans 7, we can enter into the glorious reality in Romans 8.</S>
