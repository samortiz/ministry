<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. In the New Testament, God Intending<br>the Church to Be the Kingdom of Priests</H2><P>What the Israelites had lost is today regained by the church. God desires that the church today be the kingdom of priests. Peter said that we are a royal priesthood and a spiritual house (1 Pet. 2:5). In Revelation, the apostle John said that we are all priests (Rev. 1:6). All the gold and silver are for the temple and the tabernacle; they are not for the golden calf. No one should worship a calf, not even the golden calf. A man has to learn to execute God's judgment and to deal with the golden calf. Only by this dealing will the real service be produced, and only then will the "Levites" rise up.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Church Today<br>Not Having Arrived at God's Goal Yet</H2><P>What the churches are practicing today in all the localities is a big failure. The co-workers do not have the adequate understanding. In the bread-breaking meeting, we can say that everyone can open their mouth and can pray now. But in the matter of service, we have not seen everyone serving. We do not have every brother and sister becoming a priest yet. In the meetings, the only thing that everyone can do is to sing. It is true that in the holy place the priests sang, but that was not the only service. Today not everyone is serving yet. Only when the priests and the people become one entity is there the church. Our service today is only the service of three or five people; it is not the service of the whole Body. We have become the Jewish nation of today, with only one tribe serving, while the other eleven tribes rely on the service of the Levites. Other than the "Levites," no one else is qualified to serve any longer. Yet God's desire is that the whole Body would serve.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Way Today Being for the Whole Body to Serve</H2><P>My co-worker brothers, no matter how prevailing your ministry is, how many gifts you have, and how useful and strong you are, as long as you replace others' service, you are a Nicolaitan! Not only do you have nothing to boast of; you have to confess your sin instead. Personal godliness not only does nothing to build up the church; it actually tears down the church. The way of the work, the proper way, is to help every brother and sister to do the work himself or herself. It is not a question of much service or little service. It is a question of everyone serving. Unless we are all serving together, we are not the church. This is our way today. It has to be the church that is working. It has to be the church that is preaching the gospel. It has to be the church that is saving the souls. No matter how well you work, as long as you are replacing others, you are one of the Nicolaitans. With you there is only the ministry; there is no church. Even if you are a so-called spiritual giant or a revival evangelist, if you do not bring in the service of the whole Body, whatever you do, you are a failure.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Whole Body Taking the Gospel as Our Center</H2><P>The gospel is our occupation. Everything else is done on the side only. We have to take the gospel as our center. Our occupation is only to keep ourselves alive and to sustain our body to live on this earth; the purpose of our occupation is for the gospel. The real preaching of the gospel is done by the whole Body. The preaching of the gospel by three or five cannot be considered the real preaching. What we need today is for the whole Body, that is, everyone, to preach the gospel. If the brothers and sisters see that the church is a Body, they will not be individualistic any longer. The most blessed and happy thing is to give oneself to the gospel. Only when our money is with God will we be joyful. Many people may have too many material riches with them. This is why they are not happy. If they would lose some of what they have, their joy will increase. This is a great matter. The question is not whether one's occupation is high or low. The question is: "What are we here for?" Some work in their jobs, while others take care of their families at home. But everyone has to give his all for the gospel.</P><P>I heard what Brother Witness Lee has done in Chefoo. I also heard what he has done in Shanghai. All these works are good. But I would add one thing: In the matter of consecration, everyone must have a part. Everyone has to hand himself over. If every brother and sister hands himself or herself over, the next generation will not need such a word any longer. By that time, the minute a person is saved, he will hand himself over and will be consecrated.</P><P>Why do we baptize people? What is the meaning of baptism? Baptism means that we come under the name of the Lord. When a person comes out of the water, he should know that henceforth he does not belong to the world any longer. Rather, he belongs to the Lord. Baptism separates a person from the world. It is because the baptism of many people was not up to standard at the beginning and the job was not done properly, that we need the "handing over," the make-up lesson.</P><P>In the future, when we preach the gospel, there will be no need to put up big advertisements or propaganda. Men will hear and will see the gospel. They will see that everyone is serving. If there are three thousand people, all three thousand will be coordinated together. Everyone will be working, and everyone will be serving, but no one will be murmuring.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Realizing the Glory and Grace of Serving God</H2><P>Brothers, how should we answer God's call? In the old days, men tried to usurp the priesthood. Today, the priesthood is in our hands already. Are we going to cast it aside? What the Israelites had lost was lost; they could not recover it any longer. Are we going to make the service of God something cheap in our hands? For some, service to God is a matter of granting God a favor. But we have to see that for God to allow us to serve Him is His grace and favor on us. When a man does not see the glory of serving the Lord, he calculates everything. But when he sees the glory of serving Him, he would kneel before God to beg for this service. Recently the newspaper said that China Textile Corporation is issuing new shares. When the stock market is up, everyone wants to buy. As long as they have money, they would put it into the market. Do we see the glory of serving God today? Those who see it will surely give their all for it.</P><P>Those who are standing far off do not know God's grace. All those who know God's grace and who know themselves do not count the cost...</P><P>[Note: At this juncture, before the above words were finished, some brothers broke down in tears. Sister Pearl Wang also broke down in tears.]</P><P>Brother Witness Lee's concluding prayer: It is not that we can give the Lord much. It is what the Lord wants of us. May the Lord grant us a more absolute, thorough, and serious service. Amen.</P>
