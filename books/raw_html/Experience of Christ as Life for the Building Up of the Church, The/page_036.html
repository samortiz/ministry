<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRUTHFULNESS OF CHRIST</H2><P>In 11:10 Paul said that the truthfulness of Christ was in him. Because Paul lived by Christ, whatever Christ is became his virtue in his behavior. This virtue of truthfulness has to be wrought into us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GRACE OF CHRIST</H2><P>In 12:9 the Lord told Paul, "My grace is sufficient for you." At that time Paul had a thorn which was piercing him, troubling him, hurting him, and giving him pain all the time (v. 7). He asked the Lord three times to remove this thorn (v. 8), but the Lord left the thorn with him so that he might experience the Lord's sufficient grace. If the Lord had taken away the thorn, Paul could not have experienced His sufficient grace.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST SPEAKING IN ME</H2><P>In chapter thirteen Paul said that Christ was speaking in him (v. 3). This is not a doctrine. Have you experienced Christ speaking within you?</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BEING WEAK IN CHRIST THAT<br>HE MIGHT BE POWERFUL WITHIN US</H2><P>This speaking Christ within us is powerful, not weak. But if we are to experience Christ as power, we have to learn how to be weak in Him (v. 4). We are always taught to be strong, but we have to learn how to be weak. We are too strong in ourselves, in our natural man. We need to learn to be weak that Christ might be powerful within us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GRACE OF CHRIST,<br>THE LOVE OF GOD, AND THE FELLOWSHIP<br>OF THE HOLY SPIRIT BEING WITH US ALL</H2><P>Paul concluded 2 Corinthians by saying, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." The grace of Christ is the full enjoyment of Christ. Paul wanted this enjoyment along with the love of God and the fellowship of the Spirit to be with us in our experience.</P>
