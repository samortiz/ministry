<h1 class=series>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS</h1><h1 class=msg>MESSAGE SIXTY-ONE</h1><h1 class=title>THE WORD OF WARNING</h1><h1 class=msg>(3)</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Lev. 26:21-46</h1><p>According to the word of warning in Leviticus 26, the obeying ones will be blessed (vv. 3-13), but the disobeying ones will be chastised that they may repent (vv. 14-39). This chastisement is on five levels. As we have seen, the first level is the appointing of sudden terror (vv. 14-17). This terror comprises both a consuming disease and a fever and also being defeated by the enemies. The chastisement on the second level is a matter of being disciplined sevenfold, with the heavens being made like iron, giving no rain, and the earth being made like brass, yielding no produce (vv. 18-20). In this message we shall go on to see the chastisement on the other three levels (vv. 21-39) and then the repentance of the people and the remembrance of God (vv. 40-45).<h2 class=head2>C. On the Third Level— Bringing Plagues Sevenfold</h2><p>The chastisement on the third level brings in plagues sevenfold (vv. 21-22).<h2 class=head3>1. Plagues</h2><p>“Then if you walk contrary to Me and are not willing to listen to Me, I will bring even more plagues upon you, sevenfold according to your sins” (v. 21). These plagues signify troubles among the believers in the church (1 Cor. 1:11; 2 Cor. 12:20).<h2 class=head3>2. Beasts Bereaving People of Their Children and Destroying Their Cattle, Reducing the Number of People and Making Their Roads Desolate</h2><p>“And I will send against you the beasts of the field, and they shall bereave you of your children, and destroy your cattle, and make you few in number, so that your roads become desolate” (v. 22). This signifies that in the church fierce people (Acts 20:29) will rise up to bereave the believers of their life produce, to destroy their spiritual possessions, to reduce their number, and to desolate their communications.<h2 class=head2>D. On the Fourth Level— Striking Sevenfold</h2><p>The chastisement on the fourth level is a matter of striking sevenfold.
