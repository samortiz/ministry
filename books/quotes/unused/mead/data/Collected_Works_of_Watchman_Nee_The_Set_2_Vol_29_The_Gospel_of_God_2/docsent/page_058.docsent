   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Numbers 19:4 tells us what happens after the heifer is slaughtered.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"And Eleazar the priest shall take some of her blood with his finger, and shall sprinkle some of her blood toward the front of the tent of meeting seven times."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The priest did not do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He only sprinkled some blood before God in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This shows us that the death of the Lord Jesus has satisfied the requirements of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The blood was not sprinkled on the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was sprinkled directly before the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The tabernacle is the place where God met with the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is a type of the fellowship between God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Where God's tabernacle is, there God is also.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Christ is the tabernacle; He is God living among men.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is full of God's grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He tabernacled among us John 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>How can we have fellowship?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There must be the blood, that is, sin must be judged.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If there is no blood, man cannot come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There are only two ways for man to come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Either he comes without sin, or he comes with the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you are without sin, you can come to God in bold strides, and He can do nothing to you.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But if you have sin, there must be the shedding of the blood Heb 9:22 , because God must judge sin.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If sin is not judged, man cannot have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God cannot overlook man's sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God cannot let man's sins go by.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If man has sin, he must come to God with the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is a judging God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Without passing through judgment, sin cannot be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Judgment demands the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, there must be the shedding of the blood before fellowship can be recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The blood was sprinkled seven times.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Seven signifies perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The death of the Lord Jesus has satisfied God; His blood is sufficient to wash away our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here all the problems are completely solved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's righteous requirements are met.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God said that the work is done.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the work of the Lord Jesus on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It has been done once and is forever finished.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There is no need for another red heifer to die.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is good enough for one red heifer to die.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the first part of this offering we see that the sprinkling of the blood signifies that the problem of the sinner is solved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This part of the offering is the same as all the other offerings in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They are all just the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now we have to consider the second part of the offering, which shows us what is to be done for the sins of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Numbers 19:5 says, "And the heifer shall be burned in his sight."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is most unique, for the heifer was not simply burned, but "her skin, her flesh, and her blood, with her dung, shall be burned; and the priest shall take cedar wood and hyssop and scarlet, and cast them into the midst of the burning of the heifer."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God judged sin.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After a little of the blood was sprinkled, the rest of the blood was poured into the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then the whole heifer was also cast into the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The priest burned the whole heifer skin, flesh, blood, dung, and all.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In addition, cedar wood, hyssop, and scarlet were all cast into the midst of the burning.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In verse 9 we are told what happened after the heifer was burned: "A man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and place them outside the camp in a clean place; and they shall be kept for the assembly of the sons of Israel for the water for impurity; it is a purification of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After the heifer was slaughtered, the blood was applied.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But after the heifer was burned and became ashes, the ashes were to be applied.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What are ashes?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Ashes are the final state of everything in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am not referring to the facts of chemistry, but to our everyday experience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Ashes are the last state of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a table undergoes corruption again and again, its last state will be ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, ashes represent the final state.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When something has reached its very end, and cannot be changed to something else anymore, it is ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Everything of the heifer is burned.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Note particularly the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In these ashes are the skin, the flesh, and the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This means that in these ashes are the redemption of Christ and the eternal efficacy of His redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Christ is eternally efficacious before God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He has become the ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The shedding of His blood is eternally efficacious.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even the blood has become ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The work of redemption is finished.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The red heifer portrays the Lord's redemptive work, and this work has now become ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There are three other things added to the offering: the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In the Bible, when cedar wood and hyssop are put together, it denotes the whole created universe.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>First Kings 4:33 says that Solomon had great wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He spoke of all the trees, from the cedar tree to the hyssop.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He went from alpha to omega.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He exhausted the whole subject.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Bible uses the cedar tree and the hyssop to represent the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Putting the cedar wood and the hyssop into the fire means that when the Lord Jesus was judged for sin, not only was He burned, but all of us were burned as well.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God has judged all men in the person of Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>When the fire passed over Him, you and I, the cedar wood and the hyssop, all, passed through the same fire.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Everything in the world, whether great or small, sweet or bitter, rich or poor, was laid on Him and judged by God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Here scarlet was also put in the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Isaiah 1:18 says that our sins are as scarlet.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Hence, scarlet denotes sin.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Not only has God judged us, but He has judged our sins as well.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>All sins were included with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When He was judged by God, our sins were judged as well.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>All the problems related to sin were also judged.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Hence, the casting of the cedar wood, the hyssop, and the scarlet into the fire indicates that the whole world and all the sins of the world have passed through the fire with the Lord Jesus and have become ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The ashes include all the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>They also include us and our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>These ashes are eternally efficacious.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Hence, this work has an efficaciousness that meets all of God's demands before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>These ashes were kept outside the camp in a clean place.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>From Numbers 19:11 on we are told about the function of the ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>"He who touches the dead body of any man shall be unclean seven days.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>He shall purify himself with the water on the third day..."</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Verse 9 tells us about this water for impurity.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>"And a man who is clean shall gather up the ashes of the heifer, and place them outside the camp in a clean place; and they shall be kept for the assembly of the sons of Israel for the water for impurity; it is a purification of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The impurity spoken of refers to the impurity of touching a dead body.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Why is touching a dead body considered an impurity?</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>It is because death is the evidence of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Without sin there would be no death.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Therefore, where there is death, there is also sin.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>A dead body means that sin has done its work.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The result of the work of sin is death.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>For this reason, the Old Testament uses leprosy as a symbol of curable sin and a dead body as a symbol of incurable sin.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>When a man is dead in sin and trespasses and therefore dead in his flesh, he is a dead body.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>The Lord Jesus talked about these dead ones.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>He said to let the dead bury the dead Matt 8:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>If you touch these dead ones, if you have intercourse with the world, if you build up a friendship with it, and if you have your living among it, you are touching dead bodies.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If you touch dead bodies, you will surely be infected and defiled with impurities.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>When Christians sin and fail through touching the world, the ashes are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>The ashes are the work of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>They are put into the living water Num 19:17 and become the water for impurity.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The living water typifies the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Once while the children of Israel journeyed, they struck the rock and out came living water Exo 17:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>First Corinthians 10:4 says that the rock was Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Hence, the living water refers to what flows forth from Christ, which is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>Taking the living water and making it the water for impurity means that there is the need for the power of the Holy Spirit to be upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Without the work of the Holy Spirit, the work of the Lord will be in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>If there are only the ashes of the red heifer without the living water, they will not be of much use.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>With the work of the Lord Jesus, there is still the need of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Only by the mixing together of the two will we be purified and cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The Lord Jesus does not have to die again.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>We merely apply the efficacy of the one-time work of the Lord for our cleansing.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>The ashes of the red heifer represent the eternal and immutable efficacy of the Lord's work on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>It is this efficacy that is cleansing us.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Because the Lord Jesus has died, the efficacy of His ashes becomes eternal, and by the Holy Spirit He is now applying this efficacy to us.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Every time we sin, we do not have to bring a bull to God again.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>The efficacy of the Lord's work two thousand years ago continues until today.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>By those ashes we are cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>What happens if a man is not cleansed?</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Numbers 19:12 says, "He shall purify himself with the water on the third day and on the seventh day, and so be clean; but if he does not purify himself the third day and on the seventh day, he will not be clean."</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Why is such a one not clean until the seventh day?</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>The man cleanses himself on the third day, but he is not clean until the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>He is not clean until the seventh day because the goal is the seventh day, not the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>The third day is the day the Lord Jesus resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>After the Lord resurrected, He gave to us the word of the forgiveness of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>What then is the seventh day?</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>In the Bible the seventh day is the Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Hebrews 4:9 says that there is another Sabbath.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>This is the universal, great Sabbath, which will take place in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>This means that a person who is not cleansed in the age of the Lord's resurrection will not be clean in the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>If he is cleansed today in the age of the Lord's resurrection, he will be clean on the seventh day, the age of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>The third day is for the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>The problem is with the seventh day.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>The problem of eternity is settled.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>The problem of being God's children in this age is also settled.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>All other problems are settled.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>The only problem today is whether we will be clean in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>At the end of this portion, Numbers 19:13 says, "Whoever touches a dead person, the body of any man who has died, and does not purify himself, defiles the tabernacle of Jehovah."</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>What is the tabernacle of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>The tabernacle of the Lord today is not a meeting hall or some chapel.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>The tabernacle of the Lord today is our body.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>If a man destroys his body, God will destroy him 1 Cor 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>If a man defiles his body, God will say, "That person shall be cut off from Israel" Num 19:13b .</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>Such a person will be rejected from Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>It does not say he will be rejected from Egypt, but from Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>This means that at the time the children of God reign in the kingdom, such a one will be kept outside.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>If a person is not clean today, he will be kept outside the kingdom in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>Following this we read: "Because the water for impurity was not sprinkled upon him, he shall be unclean; his uncleanness is still on him."</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>All the unconfessed sins and all the sins that have not passed through the blood of the Lord Jesus leave their uncleanness on the person.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>This uncleanness will cause one to lose his share in the coming kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>Conversely, those who have been cleansed by the water for impurity will be clean in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>Let me tell you one thing: No sin that has been repented of, that has been confessed and put under the blood of the Lord Jesus, and that has had the ashes applied to it, can ever raise its head at the judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>The water for impurity is able to remove uncleanness because of the power of the blood in it.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>It is the power of redemption in this water that enables it to remove the uncleanness.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>Every sin that does not have the effectiveness of the Lord's redemption applied to it will leave uncleanness on the person until the "seventh day."</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>Hence, do not let your sins remain on you.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>You must remove the uncleanness with the ashes of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>I thank the Lord that the Son of God does not have to die for me anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>By His ashes I am clean.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>But it is foolish as well as dangerous to allow any uncleanness to remain.</S>
