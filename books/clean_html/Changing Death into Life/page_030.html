<h2 class="head2">The First Step Being to Thirst</h2>
<p>In order to receive the living water of life, man must first sense his thirst. This inward thirst compels man to come to the Lord Jesus. If you do not feel the thirst of human life, you will not come to the Lord Jesus and drink. If you do not feel thirsty after drinking worldly things, if the feast of your human life has not come to the last day, and if the joy of your human life has not come to an end, you will not come to the Lord Jesus and drink. Some people are prudent; while they are still enjoying human life, they foresee the end in the future and sense their coming thirst. Therefore, they receive the Lord Jesus. It is a sense of thirst that brings them to the Lord Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Second Step Being to Come</h2>
<p>When you feel thirsty, you need to come to the Lord Jesus in a simple way. You should come without hesitation or reservation. Where is the Lord Jesus? How can you draw near to Him? According to the Bible, after the Lord Jesus was crucified on the cross, He was placed in the tomb. Three days later, however, He resurrected from the dead and became the life-giving Spirit. Now He transcends all the limitations of space and time. He is now the Spirit, and He is everywhere. Just as you can contact radio waves everywhere, you can contact the Lord Jesus everywhere. Whether you are in the office or at home, walking on the street or lying in bed, you can contact the Lord Jesus. Even while you are reading this gospel message, you can contact the resurrected Savior with your spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Third Step Being to Drink</h2>
<p>After coming to the Lord Jesus, you need to drink. To drink is to believe. After the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Come to Me and drink,&rdquo; He said, &ldquo;He who believes into Me.&rdquo; This shows that drinking refers to believing. Furthermore, to believe is to receive. To come to the Lord Jesus and drink means to believe into Him and to receive Him. To believe into the Lord Jesus is to believe that He died and resurrected and that the living water flowed out of Him. He is the living Savior with living water. This living water is in the Spirit and is the Spirit. The life-giving Spirit is flowing everywhere. If He touches you, His living water will flow into you. If you are willing to receive Him, the living water will flow into you. It is very easy to receive Him. We do not receive Him with our eyes or with our mouth but with our spirit. We cannot use our hands to breathe; we must breathe with our nostrils. Similarly, we cannot use our physical body to receive the Spirit of life; we must use our spirit in our innermost being. When we receive the Lord Jesus with our spirit, we are drinking Him and believing into Him.</p>
<p>To believe into the Lord Jesus is simply to open to breathe in the Lord Jesus, just as one breathes in air. You simply need to pray to the Lord Jesus from your heart. Then you will receive the Lord Jesus with your spirit. Although you cannot see Him with your eyes, touch Him with your hands, or feel Him in an outward way, you can receive Him with your spirit. All you need to do is to pray and tell Him what you feel. There is no need to pretend or to compose something in your mind. As long as you draw near to Him and receive Him, you will drink Him, that is, believe into Him. Therefore, drinking is believing, and believing is drinking. Drinking and believing both mean to receive.</p>
<p>You may have contacted Christianity many years ago and heard many doctrines; you may even praise Christ for being great, but you do not have a relationship with Him if you have not received Him. He is separate from you and cannot enter into you to quench your thirst. Merely hearing messages cannot save you. Receiving the Lord Jesus is the only thing that can save you. You may hear thousands of messages, but they are all useless if you are not willing to receive the Lord Jesus. If you are willing to receive the Lord Jesus, it is sufficient to hear a few sentences. It is sufficient to know that you are a desolate sinner and a thirsty person and that the Lord Jesus is the living Savior with the living water. Just come to the Lord Jesus and open up your heart, saying, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus! I am thirsty. I need You.&rdquo; If you feel that you have sins, you need to confess your sins to Him. Tell Him what you feel. This is the way to contact Him and receive Him into you. This is the way to drink the living water into you. This is the way to believe into the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>It is wonderful that simply by believing in the Lord Jesus, He will enter into you. He is the Spirit of life. As soon as He enters into you, He will quench your thirst, and you will feel joy and satisfaction. Furthermore, the living water will flow out from you as rivers of living water to quench the thirst of many. The key to salvation is to drink the Lord Jesus. You may have heard the gospel in the past but did not receive salvation, because you did not receive the Lord into your being by drinking Him.</p>
<p>If someone gives you a cup of water, you may receive the cup with your hands and appreciate it with praise. However, the cup of water is useless if you do not drink it. Likewise, your need today is to receive the Lord Jesus in a simple way. He is the omnipresent Spirit. If you open your heart to pray and contact Him, you will receive Him, and the living water will flow into you. This is simple, easy, and wonderful. May now be the time that you drink Him and receive Him. Let us sing a short hymn:</p>
<p class="hymn-verse">If anyone thirsts, let him come and drink.<br />
