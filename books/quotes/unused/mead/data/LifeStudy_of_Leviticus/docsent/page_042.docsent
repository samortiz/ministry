   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Put upon the Fine Flour</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The frankincense was put upon the fine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This signifies that Christ's humanity bears the aroma of His resurrection manifested out from His sufferings cf.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Matt 11:20-30; Luke 10:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During the course of His human life, Christ suffered a great deal, but the aroma of His resurrection was manifested out from His sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although He suffered very much, He exuded a sweet fragrance, the aroma of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the meal offering there are three elements: the fine flour, the oil, and the frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we study the four Gospels, we will see that Christ's life consisted mainly of these three elements.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord Jesus continually lived and walked in these three things in His humanity mingled with His divinity and expressing His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even before Christ was actually crucified He continually expressed His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Concerning this, we need to realize that the Lord Jesus was crucified not only at the very end of His life but that He was crucified daily.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His entire life was a life under the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He was always being slaughtered, skinned, and cut into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His crucifixion, which lasted six hours, was the totality of His being slaughtered, skinned, and cut into pieces.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because the Lord Jesus lived daily under the cross, He always expressed resurrection from His humanity mingled with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we keep this in mind as we read the Gospels, we will see what kind of person Christ was while He lived on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He was a person with the highest and best humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This humanity was "oiled," for it was mingled with His divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In His human living He expressed not His sufferings but resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This resurrection is the frankincense, the fragrant aroma, the sweet savor, in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nothing is as sweet, as fragrant, as this aroma of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This was Christ's human living on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even when the Lord Jesus was arrested and crucified, He lived a life of humanity mingled with divinity and expressing resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A band of soldiers and deputies from the chief priests and Pharisees came to the garden seeking Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Twice He asked them, "Whom are you seeking?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John 18:4, 7 , and each time they answered, "Jesus the Nazarene" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>5, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord Jesus then said to them, "If therefore you are seeking Me, let these go away" v. 8 . "These" refers to His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Under the suffering of the betrayal of His false disciple and the arrest of the soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He still took good care of His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here we can sense the fragrance of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, He took care of His mother.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"Jesus, seeing His mother and the disciple whom He loved standing by, said to His mother, Woman, behold, your son.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then He said to the disciple, Behold, your mother" John 19:26-27a .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here we again see resurrection expressed out from the Lord's sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No matter what the circumstances were, the Lord Jesus lived a life of suffering but expressing the fragrance of His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In every place and at every time, Christ lived a life in His humanity mingled with His divinity and expressing His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The burnt offering is for God's satisfaction to fulfill His desire.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The burnt offering is God's food, and only He is allowed to eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The fact that the entire offering is burned on the altar indicates that it is received by God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may say that the fire which consumes the burnt offering is God's "mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whereas the burnt offering is God's food, the meal offering is our food for our satisfaction, with a little portion shared with God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Proper worship involves the burnt offering and the meal offering.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To offer the burnt offering for God's satisfaction and to offer the meal offering for our satisfaction and for sharing our satisfaction with God this is real worship.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Proper worship is a matter of satisfying God with Christ as the burnt offering, and of being satisfied with Christ as the meal offering and sharing this satisfaction with God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In real worship Christ as the burnt offering ascends to God, and Christ as the meal offering enters our being.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In such worship we satisfy God with Christ, and we share with Him our enjoyment of Christ.</S>
