   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MYSTERY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We must then ask, what is God's mystery?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Where is God?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Jews and Moslems all believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Upon this earth, no one dares to declare that other things are God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They know that all those things are not God, but idols.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There is only one God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Jews believe in the Old Testament, and the Moslems believe in the Koran.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Koran is an imitation of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>They all believe in the unique God, but they do not know that this God is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Neither do they know that this mystery of God is Christ Col 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The divine mystery is first the mystery of God and second the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We need to read, study, and pray over Colossians and Ephesians, for they unveil to us the mystery of God, Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Jews have God in name, but they do not have God in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They have God in a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They do not have God in reality because they do not know the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The mystery of God is Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you do not know God, and if you have not met God, just come to Christ, because God is embodied in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily in this Christ Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you do not believe in Christ, you miss God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Without Christ, although you may say you believe in God, you believe only in terms.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You believe God as a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You could never realize God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You could never touch God, get God, or get into God except through Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Moslems and Jews have God without Christ, but eventually they have nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The very God is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you do not have Christ, you do not have God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is wonderful because He is the mystery, the answer, the definition, the embodiment, and the reality of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He is nothing less than God, but He is God with something more.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is God-plus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is hard for us to explain.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He was a little man who came from a despised region called Galilee, yet this man is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Outside of Him and without Him you could never see God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whether you believe it or not, He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is just God!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the whole universe, God is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Where Christ is, there is God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Apart from Christ, you could never find God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ is the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Where then is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In history there has never been a name so wonderful as Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whether they are for Him or not for Him, today all the nations use the calendar of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is the year of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Every year is the year of the chronicle of Christ, of that little man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Is not this Christ wonderful?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no man so big.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is no name bigger than the name of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Yet where is He?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some say that He is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He is not only in the heavens but right on this earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is right here in this room.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The mystery of the universe is God, the mystery of God is Christ, and the mystery of Christ is the church Eph 3:4-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>For years and years I have been ministering Christ and the church, and the more I minister, the more I have to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Over fifty years ago I learned that the church is not a Western bungalow with a belltower.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I learned that the church is the gathering of God's called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, even to say that the church is the gathering of God's called people is too superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The church is an organism, not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not consider the church as an organization, but an organism.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For so many years I never saw that the church is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The church is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In other words, the church is just Christ in a mysterious way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The church is Christ 1 Cor 12:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>So, when we say that we are the Christ, this is not too much.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hallelujah, we are the Christ here!</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On one hand, we are wonderful persons, and on the other, we are Christ in a mysterious way.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Within us we have a mysterious part, and that part is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Christ today is right here.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>THE ECONOMY OF THE MYSTERY</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This mystery has an economy.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>To us today the mystery is no longer mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The mystery is no longer hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is an open mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We do know that the whole universe is the mystery of God, this mystery of God is just Christ, and this mystery of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We are the mystery of Christ, Christ is the mystery of God, and God is the mystery of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Surely we are a mysterious and universal people!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Dispensation</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The word economy in the English language is an anglicized word borrowed from the Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>It contains the matter of dispensing, as in today's modern economy.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In modern economy, a kind of dispensing is implied.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we have billions of dollars worth of capital, we have to dispense it.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Hence, in God's economy, the first aspect is to dispense Himself into His chosen ones.</S>
