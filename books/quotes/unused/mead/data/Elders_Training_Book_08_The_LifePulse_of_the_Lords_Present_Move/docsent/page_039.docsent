   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MARK 16:15-20</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Translators generally agree that the best manuscripts do not have Mark 16:9-20, but they also agree to leave this portion here.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Verse 15 reads, And He said to them, Go into all the world and preach the gospel to all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Chinese version renders to all the creation as to all the people.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, all the creation includes the people, but to all the people does not include all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have to realize when we go out to preach the gospel of the New Testament economy of God concerning this all-inclusive Person, the heaven and all the demons will be listening.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, we are not only preaching to human beings, but we are also preaching to all the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ s redemption not only comprises human beings but the entire creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Colossians 1:20 we are told Christ s redemption comprises everything.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hebrews 2:9 tells us He died to taste death on behalf of everything, not only for everyone but for everything of God s creation because God s entire creation was lost see note 9 2 in Hebrews 2 Recovery Version .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, it has to be redeemed, brought back through Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we preach such a gospel to human beings, we actually preach this gospel to all the creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verses 16-18 say, He who believes and is baptized shall be saved, but he who does not believe shall be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>And these signs will accompany those who believe: in My name they will cast out demons; they will speak with new tongues; they will pick up serpents; and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means harm them; they will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Verse 17 says that these signs, the following signs, will accompany those who believe, not those who preach.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The one who believes will cast out demons, speak with new tongues, pick up serpents, and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means harm them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Of course, the last they refers to the sick the sick will be well.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This should be a part of our preaching, telling the ones who believe that they can do these few things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Lord s name they can cast out demons, in the Lord s name they will speak with new tongues, in the Lord s name they will pick up serpents, and if they drink anything deadly, it shall by no means harm them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Lord s name, they will lay hands on the sick, and they will be well.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must exercise our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These are small and minor things compared with putting people into the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Tell them that after they believe signs will follow them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As a new beginner, they need to exercise their faith to lay hands on the sick.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Most Christians think that the preachers, the evangelists, do all these miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord does not say this.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He says, Those who believe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to train the full-timers to go out this way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Tell the new believers that they are given the right to lay hands on the sick.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This shows us that we should not take any portion of the Word for granted.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You have to read and re-read it, reconsidering it word by word; then you will get something new.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>LUKE 24:44-49</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Luke 24:44, the Lord Jesus, as the One who was in resurrection and who had been given all the authority in heaven and on earth, said to His disciples, These are My words which I spoke to you while I was yet with you, that all the things must be fulfilled which have been written in the Law of Moses and the Prophets and Psalms concerning Me. The law, the prophets, and the psalms are the three sections of the entire Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Savior s word here unveils that the entire Old Testament was a revelation of Him, the all-inclusive Christ, who is the center of God s New Testament economy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Luke 24:45 says, Then He opened their mind to understand the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is why I charged those young full-timers to spend a half a day to dwell in the Recovery Version, to study all the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we go out to preach the all-inclusive gospel, we must be equipped and qualified.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Otherwise, we will be like many isolated Christian preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to understand the Scriptures and also we need to pray, Lord, open our understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Open our mind that we may be able to understand the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Luke 24:46 says, And He said to them, Thus it is written, that the Christ should suffer and rise up from the dead on the third day.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to teach others the death of Christ and the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This portion of the Word implies all the main things of God s New Testament revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 47 continues the Lord s word to the disciples, And that repentance for forgiveness of sins should be proclaimed in His name...</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>His name implies a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You should tell people whose name this is.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The name denotes a Person.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Who is the person?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This requires you to tell all the aspects concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You have to preach the all-inclusive Christ that they may receive the forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is not forgiveness of sins alone, but it is the forgiveness of sins in His name.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is like baptizing into the name Matt 28:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The name denotes the Triune God, and this name here denotes the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Get yourself so familiar with all the aspects of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Otherwise, you can never preach an adequate gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, I insist on training the young full-timers for at least a half year, so they will have an adequate revelation concerning God s New Testament economy and concerning the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord spoke further, You are witnesses of these things.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>And behold, I am sending forth the promise of My Father upon you; but you, stay in the city until you are clothed with power from on high vv.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>48-49 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have to claim the experience of being clothed with power from on high.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This being clothed with power from on high transpired on the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today we do not need to wait for this because the baptism in the Spirit has transpired.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We even do not need to pray for this, however, we surely have to pray for our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is why I stress so much that all the young full-timers going out must experience the baptism in the Spirit.</S>
