   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE WORK OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>These three steps of our experience of the Spirit show us that the work of the Spirit has two aspects the inward aspect and the outward aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The inward aspect consists of two steps being regenerated and being filled.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we received the Lord Jesus as our Savior, the Spirit came into us to regenerate us, and since the day of our regeneration, He has been filling us with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we give Him the room and the ground in our being, He will fill every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then we will be filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These two steps are the inward aspect of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, there is also the outward aspect of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the outward aspect the Holy Spirit comes upon us to clothe us, cover us, and baptize us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the first aspect the Spirit is put into us, and in the second aspect the Spirit is put on or upon us Acts 1:8; 2:17; 8:15-16; 10:44; 19:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As Christians we have already experienced the first step of being born of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may even have had some experience of being inwardly filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, have we experienced being baptized in the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We may have had some experience of the working of the Spirit within us, but have we had any experience of the working of the Spirit upon us?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>On one hand, the Spirit is the living water that we can drink John 7:37-39; 1 Cor 12:13b ; on the other hand, the Spirit is like clothing that we can put on.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Luke 24:49 likens the power from on high, which is the Holy Spirit, to a piece of clothing with which we should be clothed.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Inwardly, we must drink the Spirit; outwardly, we must be clothed with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not confuse these two aspects of the Spirit s work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many Christians today are confused regarding the experience of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some say that being inwardly filled with the Spirit is the same as being baptized in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the Scriptures clearly reveal that being filled with the Spirit and being baptized in the Spirit are two different aspects of the Spirit s work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>First Corinthians 12:13 tells us that in one Spirit we were all baptized into one Body and that we were also given to drink one Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The drinking and the being baptized both involve the Spirit but in two different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To be baptized in the Spirit is to be put into the Spirit, just as to be baptized in water is to be put into water.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, to drink the Spirit is to take Him into us, just as to drink water is to take it into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>One cannot say that to be baptized in water is to drink water; similarly, we should not think that being baptized in the Spirit is the same as being inwardly filled with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These are two different aspects of the Spirit s work.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE APOSTLES EXPERIENCE OF THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Scriptures present to us not only the doctrine of the Holy Spirit but also several pictures of those who had the full experience of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus was the first one to be born of the Holy Spirit, filled with the Holy Spirit, and baptized in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Later, His disciples followed His example in experiencing the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the evening of the day on which the Lord resurrected from the dead, the Lord came to His disciples and breathed into them, saying, Receive the Holy Spirit John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, on the day of resurrection Peter and the other disciples received the Spirit inwardly and were reborn with the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Later, the book of Acts tells us that the disciples were inwardly filled with the Spirit 13:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although the Scriptures are clear regarding this matter, some Christians say that the disciples did not receive the Holy Spirit on the day of resurrection, but instead received Him on the day of Pentecost when the Holy Spirit came upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, we must believe that when the Lord breathed the Spirit of the resurrection life into His disciples, they received the Spirit and were filled with the Spirit inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can prove this by comparing the disciples condition before and after the Lord s death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Before the Lord was crucified, the disciples, because of their pride, argued with one another about who was greater Mark 9:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, after the Lord s resurrection and before the day of Pentecost, one hundred and twenty of them prayed together for ten days with one accord Acts 1:14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Does this not prove that they were filled with the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Without the inward filling of the Holy Spirit, it would have been impossible for one hundred and twenty of them to pray together for ten days without quarreling.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The one hundred and twenty disciples gave up their countries, homes, and relatives and prayed together with one accord for ten days under the threatening of the Jewish authorities in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Surely this is proof that they had been filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Then Peter stood up and explained and expounded some of the prophecies in the Old Testament vv.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is another proof that he had been filled with the Holy Spirit before the day of Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, we can see that the disciples were born of the Holy Spirit, filled with the Holy Spirit, and then baptized in the Holy Spirit 2:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are several other examples in the Scriptures of people who experienced the Holy Spirit in the same way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One example is the believers in Samaria in Acts 8, who were born of the Holy Spirit when they believed the gospel preached by Philip vv.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>5-8, 12 and were later baptized in the Holy Spirit when Peter and John laid their hands on them to bring them into identification with the Body of Christ vv.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>14-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Additional examples are the apostle Paul in Acts 9 vv.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>5, 11, 17-18 and the believers in Ephesus in Acts 19 vv.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>1-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>All these people went through the three steps of being born of the Holy Spirit, being filled with the Holy Spirit, and being baptized in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must also experience these three steps.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we have not been born again, we have not yet been saved and are not yet children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If this is our case, we are Christians in name only; we have not been born of God and of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we have been born of the Spirit, we may not have experienced drinking of the Spirit and being filled with the Spirit in such a rich and full way that the Spirit flows out of us as rivers of living water John 7:37-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We also may not have experienced being baptized in the Holy Spirit to be clothed with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should not merely listen to these words as we would listen to some doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We must go to the Lord and check whether or not we have had all these experiences of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>By the Lord s mercy and grace, I can say that I have had all these experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>One day in 1935 while I was ministering on the platform, I had a special experience of being clothed with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>According to my sensation, it was as if I had been immersed in a cloud and was in the cloud speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I could not see the cloud with my physical eyes, but I could sense it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>While I was in that cloud, I was able to speak freely, and the whole atmosphere of the meeting changed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I had had the experience of being clothed with the Holy Spirit before, but that experience was the most impressive one.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>There is an urgent need for us to experience the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Without experiencing the Spirit, we cannot experience Christ in a full and real way, because Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Holy Spirit today is the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of life, and the Spirit of reality Rom 8:9, 2; John 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Apart from the Holy Spirit, Christ is merely a doctrine or knowledge in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We must pray, ask, and seek that the Lord would grant us to experience the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that You are the Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We thank You that You are no longer far away from us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Rather, You are so close and near to us because You are the Spirit in us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>O Lord, we thank You that we can be filled with the Spirit and baptized in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Thank You that we can be saturated and mingled with You as one.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Lord, we look to You to cause us to seek all these experiences, and we ask You to grant us all the necessary experiences of the work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>We commit ourselves into Your hand that You may move and prompt our spirit and heart to seek, to pray, and to receive what You have given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We ask this in Your name.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Amen.</S>
