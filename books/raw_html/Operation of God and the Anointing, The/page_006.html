        <h2 class="head2">By the Spirit</h2>
<p>Some people say that it is not possible for us to touch the incarnated God, because He became flesh two thousand years ago in the land of Judah. His incarnation is far away from us in both time and space.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation is wonderful because it includes not only God, who is the Word becoming flesh, but also Christ, the incarnated God, who passed through death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). God is in Christ, and Christ is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). This Spirit is omnipresent, just as electromagnetic waves are everywhere. Regardless of his location, a person who receives Christ will contact the Spirit. For example, there are electromagnetic waves in the air; hence, any radio that is turned on, regardless of when or where, will receive electromagnetic waves. Likewise, the life-giving Spirit is omnipresent and will enter into any person who believes in the Lord Jesus and receives Him. When the Spirit enters into a person, Christ enters into that person because the Lord is the Spirit. That person also receives God, because God is in Christ.</p>
<p>We need to remember these three <em>in</em>s: God is in Christ, Christ is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in us. The center and the secret of our Christian faith depend on these three <em>in</em>s. God is in Christ, Christ is in the Spirit, and the Spirit is in us. This is our Christian faith.</p>
<p>The life-giving Spirit being in us is Christ being in us, and Christ being in us is God being in us. A believer who has the Spirit abiding in him also has Christ and God abiding in him. Hence, the Bible says, &ldquo;In this we know that He abides in us, by the Spirit whom He gave to us&rdquo; (1 John 3:24). Some people say that the Bible does not have much content, because it only says, &ldquo;And you in Me,&rdquo; and &ldquo;I in you&rdquo; (John 14:20). However, we must realize that the secret of our salvation lies in these <em>in</em>s.</p>
<p>God was incarnated and is embodied in Jesus Christ, who died and resurrected from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit. The life-giving Spirit now abides in all those who believe in the Lord. The Spirit&rsquo;s abiding in the believers means that Christ and God abide in the believers. The Triune God&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;abides in every believer. God the Father abides in every believer, because He is embodied in Christ who is now the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OPERATION OF GOD IN MAN</h2>
<p>It is not enough for God to enter into us. He wants to operate in us so that He can daily gain more ground in our being. This means that we should gain more of God daily. Formerly, we were human beings without God; our thoughts, concepts, preferences, and inclinations were merely human. However, even though God has entered into us, we still may not have the element of God in our thoughts, concepts, preferences, and inclinations. We have received the Triune God into us, but it is possible that we have not allowed Him to enter into our thoughts, concepts, preferences, and inclinations. This means that we have not allowed Him into our being. As a result, our considerations and our views are still the same as they were before we were saved; they do not have the element of God. Hence, our emotions have not changed.</p>
<p>Some believers do not change much after their salvation. Some are a little different, because they no longer engage in the sinful activities of their past. Nevertheless, their thoughts, concepts, preferences, and inclinations have not changed. Before they were saved, their thoughts, concepts, preferences, and inclinations did not have the element of God, but they still do not have the element of God, even after they are saved. God is in these believers, but He has not entered into every part of their thoughts, concepts, preferences, or inclinations. Such believers can be likened to a person who eats a meal, but the food stays in his stomach and is not digested or absorbed into his body. Although that person may eat a good meal, he is emaciated and malnourished.</p>
<p>This is the situation of many brothers and sisters. They are saved and God is in them, but He is restricted in them and does not have the freedom or the way to spread. They do not let Him enter into their thoughts, concepts, preferences, or inclinations; that is, they do not let God enter into their whole being. As a result, although they are saved, they have not changed. God is in them, but He cannot become their supply or power. Merely eating food does not benefit a person. The food that we eat needs to be digested and absorbed into our body in order for it to become our supply and power.</p>
<p>Believing in the Lord and receiving Him can be likened to eating a meal. We still need to give God the opportunity to be digested into our being. If the food we eat is not digested, we will have a big problem. Similarly, if we receive God but do not let Him operate in us, it is a big problem. After we receive God, we must give Him the opportunity to operate in us so that He can enter into every part of our being to become our element.</p>
<p>The word <em>operate</em> is in the Bible. Philippians 2:13 says, &ldquo;It is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure.&rdquo; When God operates within us, we are &ldquo;digesting&rdquo; Him. Hence, we must always let Him operate in us and gain more ground in us. If He cannot operate in us, we cannot gain more of Him, nor can we be filled with Him.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
