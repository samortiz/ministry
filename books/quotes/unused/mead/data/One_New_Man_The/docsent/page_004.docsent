   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HAVING NO CHOICE IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the beginning level, the church is an assembly, a gathering of God's called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The household is a higher aspect of the church than the assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do you prefer the assembly or the household?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>An assembly may be a group of people having different lives, but a household is a number of persons having the same life of one father.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The household is much better than the assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To say that the church is an assembly is good, but not that sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the United Nations, there is an assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Every session in the United Nations is an assembly an assembly of debaters and opposers.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do not care for this kind of assembly.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, in the New Testament the assembly means the gathering of the called out ones.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is wonderful to be called out.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But simply to be called out, without having the Father's life, is not so wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>To be called out does not indicate that you have the life of the calling one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The assembly does not indicate any life, but the household does.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Body is a higher aspect of the church than the household.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the household are the "folks," but in the Body are the members.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the members of a family are happy, they stay together, but when they are unhappy they may fight and depart from one another.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, in the body the arm cannot say to the shoulder, "I do not feel so good about you; I would like to leave you."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The arm cannot leave because it is under the shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whether it likes the shoulder or not, its destiny is to be with this shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In my early days I was under the "shoulder."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Many times I did not feel so good being there, but I realized that as an "arm" I could do nothing about it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It was neither the shoulder's mistake nor my mistake; it was the Head's arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It was the Creator's arrangement to put me, the arm, under that big shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Not only was I put under a big shoulder, but I was also arranged to be above so many "small fingers."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You do not know how much trouble all these little ones gave me.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I wanted to go one way, but they liked to do things in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I liked to be quiet, they would talk all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But if I cut off all the fingers, what could I do?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I would be an arm without a hand.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Body of Christ is more binding to us than the household.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you have seen that the church is the Body, you could never turn away from the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you have only seen that the church is an assembly, when you are happy you will stay but when you do not feel happy, you will leave.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Even in the household it is the same; once you are unhappy with another member of the family, you may decide to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you have only seen that the church is God's household, you will not be so steadfast.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you feel happy with the brothers, you will stay, but when you do not feel happy, you will stay away.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, if you have seen that you are a member of the Body, you have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today many Christians are talking about the Body, but what they are speaking may not be real in their practice.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Today they are in one "body," but after two weeks they will be in another "body."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then after two months they will be in a third "body."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They have many "bodies."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When you have many "bodies," none of these is the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Body is uniquely one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Ephesians 4:4 says, "One Body and one Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There are not many "bodies."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If you are a member in the Body, you could never leave.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If you would say that you cannot be here because this is not the Body, either you are wrong or the group with which you meet is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I am not fellowshipping with you something that I have never experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I have been experiencing and am still experiencing the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whether the people here love me or whether they mistreat me, my destiny is to be a member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord Jesus told us that He gave us a new commandment, that we all love one another John 13:34 , but we may talk about loving one another in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In our natural mind we all understand how we need to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To love one another could be applied both to the assembly and to the household.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In a family the parents always charge the children to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You may also say that the members of the Body need to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But in the Body to love one another is a little different from loving one another in the assembly and in the household.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As I mentioned already, in an assembly if I feel happy with you I will stay with you, but if I do not feel happy with you, I may simply leave.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even in a household, if I feel happy with you, I will talk to you, but if I do not feel happy with you, I may stay in my room and close the door.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But you can never stay away from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Many times my eyes were filled with tears, but I was happy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the one hand, we should be happy because we are in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the other hand, do not think the Body life is so happy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many times I have considered in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>First, I am a man because God created me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I have to be a man; I had no choice regarding my being born.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Being a man, I also have no choice but to be a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Third, being a Christian, I have to be in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If I am not in the church, it is meaningless for me to be a Christian, and if I am not a Christian, it is meaningless for me to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I have to be a man, I have to be a Christian, and I have to be in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Eventually, I am a member in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Throughout the years I have realized that a number of the saints are ambitious, desiring to have a position.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Once a brother becomes an elder, it is very difficult for him not to be an elder.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once he loses the eldership he may be troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Although others do not trouble him, he may be troubled by his ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>A number were troubled because they did not have a chance to be a leader.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If they could not be an elder in the church, at least they wanted to be a leader of a service group.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>However, if you do have the burden to serve and you do see what the church is, you will have the desire to participate in the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Whether there is a service group or no service group, you will simply come to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The problem here is the impure motive.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>My point is that, in the Body, such ambitious persons who choose to be somebody cannot have any peace.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>As a man I have to be a Christian, as a Christian I have to be in the proper church life, and as one in the proper church life, I have to submit myself to the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Do you have the choice?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If you feel that you do, then you do not know what the Body is.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the Body to love one another means that we have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>You may not care to be a member of the Body, a Christian, or even a man.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If so, you will be a very miserable person.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We should simply behave ourselves in the Body.</S>
