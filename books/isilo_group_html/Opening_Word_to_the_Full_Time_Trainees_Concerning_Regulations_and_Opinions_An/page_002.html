We know that it is good for us to be trained to have a proper character. In 1953 I taught thirty items of a proper character to a group of one hundred twenty trainees in Taipei, Taiwan (see the book entitled Character published by Living Stream Ministry). These thirty items of human character did not come from my imagination. They came up in my teaching from my own personal living and personal practice. By the Lord&#8217;s mercy I have learned that these items of a proper character are very crucial in our humanity. But in this message we want to focus our attention on a basic factor, that is, the matter of life. The life we are concerned with is the divine life mingled with our human life.<p>We are wonderful persons because we were created with the highest life in God&#8217;s creation. In God&#8217;s creation there are the plant life, the animal life, and the human life. In Genesis 1 you can see these three different levels of life. The human life is the highest among the created lives, yet it is not the top life in the universe. The top life in the universe is the divine life. Chapter two of Genesis shows the life which is signified by the tree of life. That life is a great mystery, yet we know that it is the life of the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus&#8217; life is the life of the Triune God, the divine life. Thus, we can see that in the universe there are three lives in God&#8217;s creation, and there is one life which is the uncreated life, the divine life.<p>The Bible shows that the plant life is for the animal life; both of these lives are for the human life, and the human life is for the divine life. Many animals live on plants, which indicates that the plant life is for the animal life. At the beginning God also intended to have just the plant life for the human life. But the human life became fallen. Since the fall, God added something to support the human life, that is, the animal life. Thus, after the fall, both the plant life and the animal life are for the human life. This is why man eats meat in addition to vegetables and fruit, the things of the plant life. Day by day we are nourished and supplied with the plant life plus the animal life.<p>The plant and animal lives are for the human life, and our human life is for the divine life. Not only is the human life for the divine life but also the divine life is for the human life. The human life is only for God. That means it is for the divine life. Also, the divine life is mainly for man. That means it is for the human life. Thus, we see that in the whole universe there are four kinds of lives. We do not count the angelic life, because it is a subsidiary life. We Christians have the human life mingled with the divine life. These two lives are for one another. When we use the simple word life, we are referring to this mingled life. Life denotes the human life for the divine life and the divine life for the human life.<p>Now we need to see that in the Greek language of the New Testament, there are three words for life. The word for the physical life of our being is bios, from which the word biology comes. Psuche, from which the word psychology comes, is used to denote our soulish life, our psychological life. Zoe  denotes our spiritual life. Our being is constituted with three parts: body, soul, and spirit. In each of these parts there is a definite life: the life in our body is bios; the life in our soul is psuche; and the life in our regenerated spirit is zoe. One is our physical life; the second, in the middle, is the psychological life; and the last one, which is the deepest one in our being, is the spiritual life because it is in our spirit. We are wonderful persons of three parts with three lives. God&#8217;s intention is for Himself, the divine life, to be mingled with such a wonderful human life.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>An Opening Word to the Full-Time Trainees Concerning Regulations and Opinions &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
