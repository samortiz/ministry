   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Breastplate of Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 6:14 also speaks of the putting on of the breastplate of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The breastplate of righteousness covers our conscience, signified by the breast.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Satan is our accuser.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, in fighting against him we need a conscience void of offense.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No matter how good we may feel our conscience is, we still need to have it covered with the breastplate of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Righteousness is a matter of being right with both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we have a little problem with either God or man, Satan will accuse us, and there will be holes in our conscience through which all of our faith and boldness will leak out.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, we need the covering of righteousness to protect us from the enemy's accusation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such righteousness is Christ 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is the breastplate of righteousness that covers our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, we are covered not by our own righteousness but by Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, the breastplate of righteousness is related to the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In experience we cannot separate the blood from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Apart from His blood, Christ cannot cover us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Under the cleansing of His blood, He becomes our righteousness as our breastplate of righteousness to cover our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>c.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Firm Foundation of the Gospel of Peace</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ephesians 6:15 says, "And having shod your feet with the firm foundation of the gospel of peace."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our feet must be shod in order to strengthen our stand in the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The firm foundation of the gospel of peace means the establishment of the gospel of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ made peace for us on the cross both with God and with man, and this peace has become our gospel Eph 2:13-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This gospel of peace has been established as a firm foundation, as a readiness with which our feet may be shod.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, we will have a firm footing that we may stand to fight the spiritual warfare.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The peace for such a firm foundation also is Christ v. 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we fight against the evil powers, the peace which Christ has accomplished is a firm foundation for our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we would take part in the spiritual warfare, our feet must be shod with this firm foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We fight in peace and with peace.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ is the peace for us to be one with God and with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This peace is the firm foundation that enables us to stand against the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>d.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Shield of Faith</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ephesians 6:16 continues, "Besides all these, having taken up the shield of faith, with which you will be able to quench all the flaming darts of the evil one."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need truth to gird our loins, righteousness to cover our conscience, peace as shoes to cover our feet, and faith as a shield to protect our entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If we live by God as reality truth , we have righteousness 4:24 , and righteousness issues in peace Heb 12:11; Isa 32:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Having all these, we can easily have faith as a shield against the flaming darts of the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is the Author and Perfecter of such faith Heb 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The shield of faith is not something that we put on, but something that we take up in order to protect ourselves against the attacks of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Faith comes after truth, righteousness, and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If we have truth in our living, righteousness as our covering, and peace as our standing, we will spontaneously have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This faith is a safeguard against the fiery darts, the attacks, of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>e. The Helmet of Salvation</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Ephesians 6:17 Paul said, "And receive the helmet of salvation."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is for covering our mind against the negative thoughts directed at us by the evil one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such a helmet, such a covering, is God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Satan injects into our mind threats, worries, anxieties, and other weakening thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God's salvation is the shield that we put on to cover our mentality against all these.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Such a salvation is the saving Christ whom we experience in our daily life John 16:33 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Satan's darts come to us through our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, just as our conscience needs the breastplate of righteousness and our will needs the shield of faith, so our mind needs the helmet of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We need truth, righteousness, peace, faith, and salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Righteousness issues in peace, and peace gives us the ground to have faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Then faith brings in salvation.</S>
