   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Suicide terminates any hope of salvation for a person.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Consequently, such a person will surely go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As long as this person is still alive on the earth, he may still be able to hear the gospel of the Lord Jesus' substitutional death; he may still believe and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But if he kills himself, he will destroy, cut off, and annul all chances to hear the gospel and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Listen, salvation and perdition are determined in this life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When it is time for you to die, if you do not believe in the Lord Jesus, you will not have another chance to hear the gospel and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When one commits suicide, his life is terminated; when life is terminated, there is no other chance for him to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Therefore, those who commit suicide will perish.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The blood of the one who commits suicide is the seal on his entrance ticket to hell!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once I was conducting a meeting in Changchow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I was speaking on the same subject as I am today.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>That evening there were over fourteen hundred people, including quite a number of male and female high school students.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When I came to this point, I thought, "It is useless for me to say this word to them, because I am afraid that none of them have ever had the thought of committing suicide."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the Spirit of the Lord was working in me, and I could not help but speak.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I told them very frankly, "If you want to go to hell, you should kill yourselves, and if you kill yourselves, you will surely go to hell."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After I finished my speaking that night, a teacher came to me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He had graduated from a university and was an intelligent, educated man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He told me that he thought man's life was very meaningless and that man's living was monotonous.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Many times he had thought of killing himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He was afraid to do so only because of the darkness before him!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He said that he now knew that if he killed himself, he would lose all hope of being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>So he would not dare to do it anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After a few days, another high school student came to see me.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He told me about his pessimism toward human life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Many times he thought about killing himself but he did not have an opportunity to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After he heard the message that day, he dared not harbor that thought any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Another time while I was conducting a meeting in Amoy, I spoke on the same subject.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I said again that if a man commits suicide, he will go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Later on, a woman doctor told me that she had a nurse who was always trying to kill herself.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The doctor tried every time to stop her.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That evening, after hearing my message, the nurse dared not to have such a thought anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now these people have all believed in the Lord Jesus Christ as their Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They have received Christ; they are saved; Christ has comforted their hearts and changed their lives, so that now they not only dare not, but need not commit suicide.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I do not know how many sitting here today have this kind of motive.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Christ will also satisfy your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Why try to kill yourself?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Why perish and go to hell?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once I was working for a few days at a certain college in Nanking.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the last evening during the after-meeting counseling, a college student who was from my native town came and talked with me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He had no difficulty with his tuition.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He came from a good family.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In class he was in no danger of receiving poor grades on his examinations.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But he was very pessimistic toward the human life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Where did man come from?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Where was man going?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From the time he was in high school, he had lost interest in human life and was very disenchanted.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He felt that there was nothing in the world that could satisfy his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He felt that there was a need, a craving, and a lack in his heart that nothing in the world could satisfy or console.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He was very negative.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He was negative toward everything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Life to him was a heavy burden, and it was absolutely meaningless to live on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The more he lived, the more he suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>There was no other attraction to human life except monotony and pain.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was always lonely, self-contemplative, and melancholy.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The more he contemplated, the more he became confused and disillusioned.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>While he was groping in darkness, he could not see any ray of light.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To him, it was better to terminate his burdensome life as soon as possible!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He did not want to bear the vexation anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He planned to throw his body into the ocean when he returned home to Ninpo by boat during winter vacation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In this way he would part with the world forever and free himself of this troubled life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But after hearing the gospel for a few days, he learned that Jesus Christ has died for all and is living to be our Friend.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There was no need for him to die.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>While we were talking, he received the Lord Jesus as his Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>After he had made up his mind to receive the Lord, I invited him to tell all these things to God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I then prayed with him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>After prayer, he asked me what was the first thing he should do in the morning.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I told him that he should find a chance to read the Bible by meditation and prayer, and nourish his spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I then left him.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>After a few days, I asked his friend how he was doing.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The friend told me that he was different, that he was now a happy person.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>After another few days, I met his friend again, and I asked about him again.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I received the same answer.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This man had received the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He did not want to commit suicide anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Friends, why do you seek death?</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I know that you are not satisfied with human life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I know that you are always lonely and bored.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I know that your life is monotonous.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I know that you sigh all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>You feel that human life is painful, and tears always fill your eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Although you may possess many things of the world, none of them can satisfy your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>You feel that there is a need and craving in the deepest part of your heart; you want to grasp hold of something that you do not even know to fill up your lack.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Indeed, our life is filled with sorrow and pain.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There is no taste to anything.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is why many want to kill themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But is suicide necessary?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Jesus Christ came to save those who are in sorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He has comforted the hearts of many people.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He has satisfied the cravings of many.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He has changed the lives of many people and has wiped away the tears of many.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>He will help you in the same way, changing your life of sorrow to a life of joy.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>He is the sun amidst our dark days.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>He is the song in the midst of the dark night.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>With Him, your heart can be comforted and cheered.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Why should you die?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Why do you have to commit suicide and go to hell?</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>O sorrowful and suffering ones, hear the gospel today: the Lord Jesus can and will save you.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Receive Him as your Savior and Lord, and all the problems of your human life will be solved.</S>
