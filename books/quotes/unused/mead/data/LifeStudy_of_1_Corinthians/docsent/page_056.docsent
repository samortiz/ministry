   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST CORINTHIANS MESSAGE NINETEEN THE SPIRIT OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>KNOWING THE THINGS OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE SPIRIT OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>KNOWING THE THINGS OF GOD 1 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 1:9-12, 17-31; 2:1-16</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the arrangement of the books in the New Testament, Romans comes immediately before 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although both Epistles were written by Paul, they are different in their style of composition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Romans is composed according to doctrine and reveals the truth in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>At the beginning of Romans there are sinners, but at the end of this book there are local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Romans 1:18-32 we have a description of sinners under God s condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But in Romans 16 we read of churches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For example, in verse 1 Paul says, I commend to you our sister Phoebe, who is a deaconess of the church which is at Cenchrea.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is marvelous that those who were sinners can be justified, sanctified, and eventually go on to have the full experience and enjoyment of the Spirit as the firstfruit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a result, they become the Body of Christ expressed in a practical way as local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Romans 16 speaks not only of the church at Cenchrea, but also the church in the house of Prisca and Aquila v. 5 . The church in Rome met in the house of this couple.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It certainly is interesting that such a doctrinal book as Romans begins with sinners and concludes with local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A BOOK OF COMPLICATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Romans and 1 Corinthians are composed of sixteen chapters each.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In contrast to Romans, the book of 1 Corinthians is not a book of doctrines, but a book of practices.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nevertheless, this Epistle is quite complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Usually doctrinal matters are complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It seems that whenever and wherever we discuss doctrines, we face complications.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, it is strange that in a doctrinal book such as Romans there are no complications.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For this reason, from the time I was a young Christian, I enjoyed the book of Romans because it did not have any complications.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But I did not care very much for 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Sometimes in my reading of the Bible I skipped over this book, wanting to avoid all the complications and problems it contains.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Examples of the complications in 1 Corinthians are found in chapters one, five, and fifteen.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1:10 Paul beseeches the believers at Corinth that there be no divisions among them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then in verses 11 and 12 he proceeds to speak of strifes and divisions: For it was made clear to me concerning you, my brothers, by those of the household of Chloe, that there are strifes among you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Now I mean this, that each of you says, I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To be sure, the report received by Paul concerned a complicated situation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In chapter five Paul deals with the gross sin of fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This matter is so terrible that I do not even like to talk about it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then in chapter fifteen we learn that some of the believers claimed that there was no resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>By considering these three chapters we see what serious complications there were among the believers at Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Because 1 Corinthians involves the complications in the practice of the church life, there is a sense in which I do not like this book.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But in a very different sense, I love this Epistle very much.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This may appear contradictory, but it is actually a way of viewing two different aspects of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many things in the Bible appear contradictory.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, God is one, yet He is triune.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit of God is one; nevertheless the book of Revelation speaks of the seven Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It also seems contradictory to say that Christ is both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In keeping with the principle of seeing both sides of the truth in the Bible, I can say that, when I view 1 Corinthians from one angle, I do not like this book, but when I view it from a different angle, I like it very much.</S>
