   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF PHILIPPIANS MESSAGE FORTY-NINE THE DIVINE AND RICH PROVISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR OUR CONSTANT SALVATION Scripture Reading: Phil 2:5-16</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 2:5-16 Paul not only speaks of constant salvation and its source, but also shows us the divine and rich provision for this salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the working out of our own salvation we need this provision.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 2:5-11 we have a record of Christ s incarnation, death, resurrection, and exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, here nothing is said about Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It seems that in these verses Paul purposely does not refer to the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His purpose is to present the Lord Jesus and His incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, and exaltation in such a way as to give us a pattern for our daily salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ alone was qualified to accomplish redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot share in this work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It would be blasphemy to say that we participate in the accomplishing of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We enjoy Christ s redemption, but we cannot participate in Christ s work of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE PATTERN AND THE STANDARD</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although we cannot share in Christ s redemption, we need to be partners with Him in His human living, especially in His emptying Himself, humbling Himself, and in His not grasping equality with God as a treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although the Lord subsisted in the form of God and was equal to God, He did not consider this equality a treasure to be grasped and retained.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He did not insist on holding onto the form of God, but was willing to empty Himself by laying aside the form of God and putting on the form of a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We all should be partners with Christ in this self-emptying.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This means that instead of grasping what we have, we should lay these things aside and empty ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After Christ emptied Himself, becoming in the likeness of men and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself to such an extent that He was obedient even unto the death of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Then God raised Him from among the dead and highly exalted Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Here we have not only a pattern for our constant salvation, but also the standard for this salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The pattern includes Christ s experience from incarnation through crucifixion; the standard includes His experience from resurrection to exaltation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Daily we need to enjoy a salvation which has such a pattern and standard.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose the wife of a certain brother gives him a difficult time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The way for him to be saved in this situation is not to insist on his headship or on her subordination.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He should not regard himself as a king and her as a subject.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Neither should he use Ephesians 5:22 to insist that she submit to him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To do this would be to grasp his headship, his husbandship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This would not be in keeping with the principle that the Lord did not regard equality with God a thing to be grasped.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although it is difficult for one who has the headship to lay it aside, this is just what the brother must do in order to experience the Lord s constant salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Of course, the brother can be saved by the inward operation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, 2:5-8 comes before God s operation, which is in verse 13.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Surely God will operate in the brother to save him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, he must be willing to empty himself and lay aside his headship according to the pattern in 2:5-8.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, in most cases, a married brother grasps his headship and refuses to lay it aside.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This may give rise to murmurings, reasonings, and bitter exchange of words.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The brother here should contact the Lord Jesus and say, Lord, You did not grasp equality with God, and I do not grasp my headship.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Neither do I insist on my position as a husband.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By Your gracious mercy, I lay aside my headship.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Simply by doing this, he experiences the first step of God s constant salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Now he must go on to experience the rest by humbling himself, even unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Instead of feeling resentment toward his wife for having to lay aside his headship, he should humble himself before her.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is to experience the pattern of constant salvation from incarnation to the death of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If the brother experiences this, God will come in to raise him and exalt him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then the brother will also experience the standard of God s instant salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As a result, his wife may be humbled, troubled by the fact that she has been giving him a difficult time.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Instead of reacting to her in a negative way, her husband emptied himself and humbled himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now she realizes that in his experience of Christ he is exalted and enthroned.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He has experienced constant salvation with its pattern and standard.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In 2:5-16 we see how to work out our own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We also see the source and the power for a constant salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As we consider the pattern and the standard found here, we see that we need to be partners with Christ in His pattern and standard.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the first aspect of the divine and rich provision for our constant salvation.</S>
