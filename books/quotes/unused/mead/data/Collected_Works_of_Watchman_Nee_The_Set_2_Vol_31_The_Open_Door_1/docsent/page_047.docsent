   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Yuchung, Kansu Province</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To all my dear elder brothers in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I was overjoyed to receive The Open Door second issue !</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The only problem was that my issue came so late.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I was late in learning about the travels of the brothers and late in my rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Please do not forget me, this weak little brother in the Lord, because I think of you always.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When I read The Open Door, I saw that all the brothers and sisters were very busy with the work and that you were laboring physically and in heart.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I was moved to tears!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although we are living in difficult times, you do not cease to labor, but joyfully preach the gospel in all places.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You also care for the brothers and sisters in each locality who have troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This sweet love has really encouraged my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The area in which I live witnesses no suffering and no work either.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How long will I be in this useless state?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I really want to go where you brothers are.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I would be happy to do even the smallest task, although I do not know when the Lord will allow it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When I was meeting in my home in 1935 Yih-Shi, Shansi , I wanted to go with Brother Yang Shao-tang.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, there is much red tape in leaving Kansu, and my environment did not permit it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At that time I vowed that I would serve the Lord four years later.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It has already been three years, but I have not seen any sign from the Lord of using me.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I do believe I am still the Lord's. As long as what I do is for the Lord, I trust that I am working for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please pray for my weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I would like to continue to order three copies of The Open Door.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I am sending X dollars with this letter to meet the needs of the brothers and sisters who lack.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Peace to you in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Your little brother in the Lord,</S>

   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A Letter from Brother Chu Wen-yao</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>on a Journey</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sister X in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have received your letter.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I really thank you for your care in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A few days ago I was hindered by the Lord from going to Chungking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At that time I was very puzzled and did not know what God wanted.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even though we can be wrong, God is never wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I returned to the meeting hall, I suddenly received a telegram telling me to go home to Shanghai with the travel money enclosed.</S>

   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In my heart I do not want to waste too much time in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I want to go to Yunnan or the surrounding countryside.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I am praying about it now.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I do not mean to say that I can do anything, because I know I am not worthy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, I ask the gracious Lord to have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Please pray for me.</S>
