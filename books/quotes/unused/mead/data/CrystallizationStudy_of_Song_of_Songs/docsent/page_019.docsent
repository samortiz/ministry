   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORK OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The cross is precious to the uttermost because the cross terminated all the enemies of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God has four main enemies: Satan, sin, the flesh the fallen man , and the world the satanic cosmos .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By one crucifixion Christ terminated these four enemies of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Satan was crucified Heb 2:14; John 12:31 , sin was condemned Rom 8:3 , the old fallen man was crucified Rom 6:6; Gal 2:20 , and the world was crucified and judged Gal 6:14; John 12:31 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At the same time the cross of Christ released the divine life John 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ crucified all the negative things and then released something positive to supply God s eternally chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The divine life released by the cross of Christ is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 19:34 says that when Christ was crucified two substances flowed out from Him: blood and water.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The blood is for the judicial need, and the water, the flowing divine life, is for the organic need.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The released divine life was then dispensed in Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is why the cross is so precious in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God loves the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE ACCOMPLISHMENTS OF THE RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Following the cross is the resurrection of Christ, in which three great things took place.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>First, in the resurrection of Christ, Christ in His humanity was begotten to be God s firstborn Son Rom 1:4; 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In that resurrection His humanity, which He inherited from the seed of David 1:3 , was designated the Son of God by the Spirit of holiness, which was Christ s divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>His divine essence in the resurrection uplifted His humanity from the human level to the divine level.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God came in to beget Him on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Acts 13:33 says that on the day of resurrection Christ was begotten by God: You are My Son; today I have begotten You.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Today is the day of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The second great thing that was accomplished in Christ s resurrection was that He, as the last Adam, became the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before that becoming, Christ was physical.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Wherever He was, people saw Him as a man in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even He was hanging on the cross as a man in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But after not more than three days, He was transformed into the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ s physical body was buried in a tomb, but in resurrection His physical body was transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When Peter and John entered into the tomb, they saw the grave clothes, but they did not see Christ s body.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The physical Jesus had been transformed into the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the evening of the day of resurrection, He came back to His disciples as the physical Jesus who had been transformed to be the life-giving Spirit John 20:19-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The transformed Christ is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The twenty-two Epistles of the New Testament do not teach a physical Christ but a pneumatic Christ, a Christ who is the totality of the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The third great thing which took place on the day of resurrection was that God regenerated all His chosen people 1 Pet 1:3 when He begot Christ to be His firstborn Son.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We have been regenerated, but many of us do not know our birthday.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We were regenerated, born again, about two thousand years ago on the day of Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is according to the biblical calendar.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Christ is the firstborn Son of God, and we are His many twins.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, the resurrection produced the firstborn Son of God, the life-giving Spirit, and the many sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The firstborn Son of God is the Head, and His many brothers, the sons of God, are the members of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Head with all the members is a complete organism, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is what the Bible unveils concerning the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST S</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>DEATH AND RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord wants us to experience His cross that we may enter into His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The calling for the cross and the resurrection figured by the springtime is in Song of Songs 2.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Beloved calls His lover by saying, Rise up, my love, / My beauty, and come away v. 10 . He calls her into the springtime.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The winter is a time of dormancy but now there is budding and blossoming to replace dormancy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The flowers, the fruit, the time of singing, and the voice of the turtledove are a picture of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord s seeker is disappointed by her introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When she looks into herself, it is the wintertime of dormancy.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But when she looks away to the resurrected Christ, she enters into the stage of spring, signifying the stage of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Let us consider how to apply this fellowship with an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Suppose that a brother would not take the cross in dealing with his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then he would have no spring, no time of praising and singing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if he accepts the cross in dealing with his wife to be conformed to the death of Christ, he will enjoy the springtime of Christ s resurrection with everything budding and blossoming.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When he stays in the cross, he enjoys Christ s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If a brother does not have such an experience of the cross, his speaking in the meeting will be without the content of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In his speaking we would sense no power, no blossoming, no bearing of fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But when he has the experience of the cross, we can sense the springtime in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Do we spend our days sighing instead of singing?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our sighing is the sign of our rejection of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we receive the cross, right away the resurrection comes.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Resurrection always follows the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The reality of the resurrection is the pneumatic Christ who is the consummated Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This consummated Spirit is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our spirit has become His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our spirit is the Holy of Holies for the Triune God as the consummated Spirit living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is why we say, Turn to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>About thirty years ago when we were in Elden Hall in Los Angeles, everyone was singing this.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>That was the springtime.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But why has the spring gradually ceased among us?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is because we do not accept the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The rejection of the cross causes us to suffer the winter, the dormant stage.</S>
