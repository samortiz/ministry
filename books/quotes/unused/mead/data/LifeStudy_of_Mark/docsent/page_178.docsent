   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A BIOGRAPHY OF THE BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>When we study the Gospel of Mark, we are actually studying our own biography.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This means that the biography of Jesus is also our biography.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the words of a hymn, He is my history, and His life is my experience Hymns, #949 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, the biography narrated in Mark is not only a biography of the individual Jesus but also a biography of the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In particular, the Gospel of Mark is a biography of Peter, our representative.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Peter is present in the first chapter of Mark, and his name is specifically mentioned in the last chapter: But go, tell His disciples and Peter that He is going before you into Galilee 16:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, the cases in this book are a composite portrait of us as represented by Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, on the Mount of Transfiguration Peter said, Rabbi, it is good for us to be here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And let us make three tabernacles one for You, and one for Moses, and one for Elijah 9:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because Peter is our representative, his speaking here is also our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Likewise, when Peter denied the Lord three times, that was also our threefold denial of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The angel s word concerning Peter in 16:7 is also a word concerning us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we read this verse, it is correct to insert our name in the place of Peter s name, since we are represented by him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>From the time Peter was called by the Lord Jesus in 1:16 and 17, he was captured by Him and was always with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Along with James and John, he was with the Lord on the Mount of Transfiguration.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This indicates that wherever the Lord Jesus went, Peter went with Him, for the Lord brought Peter with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Do you believe that when the Lord Jesus was crucified, He left Peter and the other disciples?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No, when the Lord Jesus was crucified and buried, Peter, the representative of us all, was crucified with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Moreover, the Lord Jesus was not resurrected alone.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to God s point of view, which is beyond the elements of space and time, we all were included in Christ s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>PUT INTO CHRIST BY GOD</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>First Corinthians 1:30 says that it is of God that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When were we put into Christ by God?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ephesians 1:4 says that God chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that in eternity God chose us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>That must have been the starting point of God s putting us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we were put into Christ by God when He chose us in Christ before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One day the Christ in whom we were chosen by God in eternity came to us and called us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In chapter one of the Gospel of Mark Christ called Peter 1:16-18 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Here the Lord seems to be saying, Peter, I am the Christ in whom you were chosen by God the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now I come to you to carry out the Father s choice.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>He has already put you into Me. Why do you remain here fishing? Come, follow Me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Father had selected Peter in Christ before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, from God s view in eternity, Peter was already in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But in Mark 1 the Lord came to Peter in order to carry out the Father s choice.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>From the time the Lord called Peter, He brought him with Him wherever He went.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Lord was arrested and judged, Peter also was arrested and judged.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord was crucified, resurrected, and exalted, Peter also was crucified, resurrected, and exalted.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we had only the Gospel of Mark, it would not be possible for us to have such an understanding of Peter s relationship to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But in the Epistles we see that Christ died on the cross as an all-inclusive One, as the One who included in Himself all whom God had chosen.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, God s chosen ones were included in Christ s death, burial, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We all need to see this.</S>
