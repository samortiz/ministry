<p>We need to see more details concerning God&rsquo;s obtaining a wife. Genesis 1 reveals that in the beginning God was alone. Therefore, He created the heavens and the earth, and in the heavens and the earth He created man in His image in order that man would match Him (v. 26). After God said that it was not good for the man whom He had created in His image to be alone, He brought every animal of the field and every bird of heaven to the man to see what he would call them (2:18-19). Genesis 2:20 says, &ldquo;The man gave names to all cattle and to the birds of heaven and to every animal of the field, but for Adam there was not found a helper as his counterpart.&rdquo; Adam did not find one to match him. Therefore, verses 21 and 22 say, &ldquo;Jehovah God caused a deep sleep to fall upon the man, and he slept; and He took one of his ribs and closed up the flesh in its place. And Jehovah God built the rib, which He had taken from the man, into a woman and brought her to the man.&rdquo; When Adam woke up and saw the woman, he said, &ldquo;This time this is bone of my bones / And flesh of my flesh&rdquo; (v. 23). Adam realized that the woman was his counterpart because she matched him. This indicates that God created man in His image in order to have someone to match Him.</p>

<h2 class="head3">God Mingling with Man</h2>
<p>In order to see the complete revelation of the pure Word, we go on from Genesis 1 and 2 to Isaiah 7:14, which prophesies, &ldquo;Behold, the virgin will conceive and will bear a son, and she will call his name Immanuel.&rdquo; <em>Immanuel</em> means &ldquo;God with us.&rdquo; Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;A child is born to us, / A Son is given to us;... / And His name will be called... / Mighty God, / Eternal Father.&rdquo; When this prophecy was fulfilled in Jesus, God was no longer only God but God with man, God incarnated (Matt. 1:23). God was mingled with man&mdash;divinity was mingled with humanity.</p>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Verse 14 says, &ldquo;The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father), full of grace and reality.&rdquo; The Word, who was God, became flesh as a man named Jesus to dwell among us, full of grace and reality. Therefore, verse 16 says, &ldquo;For of His fullness we have all received, and grace upon grace.&rdquo; Grace is not doctrine, commandments, regulations, or gifts but God Himself with all that He is.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Eating and Drinking the Lord<br />
to Become One with Him</h2>
<p>In His economy God is no longer only God but God mingled with humanity, and He is ready for man to take Him in. For this reason, later in John we are told that Jesus, the wonderful Word who became flesh to dwell among us, full of grace and reality, is eatable and drinkable. The Lord said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life...He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (6:48, 57). John 7:37-38 says, &ldquo;Now on the last day, the great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried out, saying, If anyone thirsts, let him come to Me and drink. He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; To eat and to drink is the best and highest way to receive anything. If someone gives us a pen, we can receive it but only outwardly. However, if someone gives us a piece of bread, we can chew it and swallow it to receive it into us. Eating is the real receiving. Our receiving of Christ mentioned in John 1:16 is by our eating and drinking of Him.</p>
<p>Not only do we eat and drink Christ to receive Him into us, but we also become a part of Him. In chapter 15 of the same Gospel the Lord said that He is the vine and that we are the branches (v. 5). The branches are one with the vine by the life within. When we call on the Lord, He comes into us, and we are immediately connected to Him. We are grafted to Christ, made one with Him in life. Because Christ is the vine and we are the branches of the vine, He and we are one entity.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
