<h1 class="title">PRAYING AND BLENDING IN SPIRIT<br />
TO FLOW OUT THE LIVING WATER</h1>

<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT COMING TO MAN IN TWO WAYS</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, the Spirit comes to man in two ways. On one hand, the Spirit enters into man to become a living spring within him; on the other hand, the Spirit comes as rain and is poured upon man outwardly. These two ways are spoken of in the New Testament. In the Old Testament God spoke of bestowing His grace on man according to these two ways. Psalm 84:6 says, &ldquo;Passing through the valley of Baca, / They make it a spring; / Indeed the early rain covers it with blessings.&rdquo; In this verse God promised those on the highway to Zion that even though they would pass through the valley of Baca, He would turn the dry land into a spring. God also promised the early rain. God&rsquo;s full blessing is a flowing spring and also rain.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the Lord Jesus spoke of the Spirit entering into the believers. He spoke of the Spirit entering into the believers to become a fountain within them (John 4:14) and also of the Spirit flowing out of the believers to become rivers of living water (7:38). When the Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost, the apostle Peter quoted the prophet Joel, who said that God would pour out His Spirit upon all flesh. This pouring out of the Spirit is likened to rain (Acts 2:16-18; Joel 2:28-29, 23). The Spirit comes to us in these two ways. Sometimes the Spirit is like a fountain within us flowing out to become rivers of living water, and sometimes the Spirit is poured out upon us as rain.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD ENTERING INTO MAN TO BECOME A FOUNTAIN BEING THE NORMAL EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>The outpouring of the Spirit upon the believers is seen in the Old Testament and also in the New Testament. However, the Spirit entering into the believers to become a fountain flowing out as rivers of living water is spoken of only prophetically in the Old Testament. The actual experience of the Spirit entering into the believers can be found only in the New Testament. The last book of the Bible, Revelation, says that in the New Jerusalem there will be a river of water of life flowing out from the throne of God (22:1), but there is no mention of rain. This shows that God enters into man in order to be a fountain and to flow out as rivers of living water. He descends upon man outwardly as rain for instantaneous watering, but this is not God&rsquo;s normal relationship with man in the New Testament. God&rsquo;s normal way is to enter into man in order to become a fountain flowing out as rivers of living water.</p>
<p>In Tsinan, China, there is a spring called Baotu Spring. Water gushes forth from this spring all year round. Hence, there is no shortage of water in Tsinan.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament the fountain in Jericho had bad water, but Elisha healed the water (2 Kings 2:19-22). Today the ancient city of Jericho is buried under the earth, but the fountain is still there, and the people who live nearby drink of its water. The water that flows from this fountain is stored in a cistern. Regardless of how many people draw water, the amount of water in the cistern is never reduced. This fountain also supplies drinking water to the people in the surrounding areas.</p>
<p>The plain of Jericho is approximately three hundred meters below sea level, and its climate is dry and hot. It is a barren land, but wherever the water from the fountain flows, there are palm trees, banana trees, and other fruit trees. These plants do not depend on the rain but on the water from the fountain. The supply from the fountain is more dependable than the supply from rain.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s way of entering into man in order to be a regular supply is more important than His coming upon man outwardly as power. Since we have God in us as the living water of life, we do not have a great need for Him to come to us as rain. The fountain that is flowing within us is sufficient to meet our every need.</p>
<p>Thirty years ago the Pentecostal movement was prevailing in northern China. At that time, I was still young. I attended their meetings and saw their situation. The work of the Holy Spirit was as strong as a thunderstorm. A thunderstorm can be violent with extreme force, but it may not provide us with drinking water. In contrast, when it rains lightly all day long, a large amount of water is absorbed into the soil. The outpouring of the Holy Spirit that we saw in the Pentecostal movement thirty years ago in northern China was like a thunderstorm. After a short period of time, the rainwater dried up, and there was very little result.</p>
