   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SOURCE OF OUR LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Frankly, this passage in Ephesians 5 troubled me for years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From my experience it seemed to me that this word did not work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It says to love, or to submit, but this is beyond our power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If this is what God requires of us, why does He not enable us to do so?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I kept studying this passage, trying to find the answer.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I saw that I was taking the verses out of context.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Earlier it tells us to "be filled in spirit" Eph 5:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The love or the submission comes from the filled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is no sense ordering the light bulbs to give light if we do not turn on the switch.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Unless the electricity goes into the light bulbs, they cannot give light.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Light is not a matter of their behaving; it is the expression of the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Loving your wife is not a matter of your proper behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It should be Christ expressed, His life flowing out.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Submitting to your husband is not within your capacity; there is no sense looking within to find the submission.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ Himself is the real submission.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you are filled with Him, what will come out toward your husband is submission.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The same is true of other virtues, like gentleness and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Consider how quickly your patience is exhausted.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Notice how soon your gentleness disappears.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Meekness is beyond your best efforts.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How are you going to measure up to all these standards?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>TOUCHING HIM BY CALLING ON HIS NAME</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The answer to all your shortcomings is to live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You must cease trying to love or to submit, to be gentle or to be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Admit that you are unable and stop trying.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Simply live out Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is not something for just the young people to do.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The older sisters need to say, "O Lord Jesus!" too.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The brothers, whatever their position in society, must also say "O Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You need Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If your situation does not allow you to call on Him loudly, you can say His name softly over and over.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You will feel different inside.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because He is the true and living God, when you call on His name, you touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit contains the Person of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jesus is the name, and the Spirit is the Person.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Keep breathing Him in in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not think you have heard such a message before.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You still need to breathe!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Do not feel it is embarrassing and uncultured to call on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is not by being in an impressive-looking church building and acting in a dignified, solemn way that you will touch the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In such places it is hard to say, "O Lord Jesus!"</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Whoever you are and whatever your position, be assured that you need Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You need Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Call on His name!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The effect this will have on you is not merely psychological.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If it were, then whatever name you say should give the same effect.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Try saying, "O Socrates," and you will see how vain it is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is only when you call, "O Lord Jesus," that you touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>STUDYING VERSUS EATING</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For too many years we have exercised our mind to understand spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have searched the Scriptures, but we have not come to the Lord for life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Jews had only thirty-nine books to study, but we have the additional twenty-seven in the New Testament!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then, since the time of the Reformation, countless books have been written.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have been inspired by the life of Madame Guyon and tried to be like her.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have read the writings of Zinzendorf about the Moravian brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We have studied the writings of the Brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Brother Nee's writings are available to us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have hundreds of Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What has been the result of studying all these writings?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Because we have not come to the Lord for life, the result has been differing opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We measure the church by what we have studied and conclude that things are not the way they should be.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Let me tell you that you are the first one who is not the way you should be.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You are not breathing freely.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Your spirit is plugged up.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The problem is not whether things are being done correctly.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is not a matter of knowing who is doing well and who is not.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The problem is a lack of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You will not gain any life from merely understanding the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Life is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Life is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You must come to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I do not mean for you not to study the Bible, not to read spiritual books, and not to read the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>But you must come to such reading the way you come to a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When you read a Life-study Message, you should eat and drink it!</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The food may not always suit your taste.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You may tire of the same cooking after many years.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But whether you enjoy it or not, you need the nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you do not eat and sleep properly, you will not have any energy.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Sometimes you may be given too much to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Overeating is not good for your health either, but this is not the problem with most of you.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Most of you are undernourished.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>You approach things in an analytical way, trying to look into this and check out that.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If you go on in this way, you will end up in a coffin.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Whenever you are trying to figure out who is right and who is wrong, you are eating from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Sometimes I do not enjoy the food I am served.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>But whether it tastes good or not, I eat it because I know it is nourishing.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I am like a car with a long way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If it does not have a full tank of gasoline, how can it get to its destination?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If you really love the Lord and are seeking after Him, turn away from your studying and your efforts to figure out what is right and wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Eat and drink!</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Praise the Lord that the Triune God has passed through this lengthy process and is now in the realm of ascension, waiting for us to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Look away from doctrines and praise Him that you also have a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Your spirit is as important as the heavens and the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>God formed your spirit so that you could contact His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>These two spirits mingle as one.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Live out this spirit that comes from the two spirits joined as one.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Let nothing else bother you.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>THE SPIRIT, NOT DOCTRINE</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The matters of right and wrong cannot be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Some day they will pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Nor do arguments over doctrine lead anywhere except to death.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We may talk about the ground of the church, but if we do not live in the Spirit, while we are preaching about oneness, we shall not be one.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>When we live in the Spirit, instead of the doctrine we shall have the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We know there is one God, one Lord, one Spirit, and one Body.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>By living in this Spirit, we are living in the Body and standing on the ground of oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>But we do not hold this as our doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>We simply live in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I have seen too much.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>As soon as doctrinal matters come up, everyone is divided.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Whenever we are in the realm of doctrine, there are problems.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>A SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>God is Spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>He has passed through a process and is now ready for us to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Praise the Lord that we have done so!</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>His Spirit and ours are joined as one.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Every moment we live in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>His divine life makes our spirit life.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Then our soul becomes life by the spreading of His life, until finally our body is also life by His saturating of us.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Here is what God wants: the Spirit saturating our whole being until every part is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>Morality and ethics cannot compare with this.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>When man lives himself, even the best of his living is only copper.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>When we live Christ, our living is gold, shining bright.</S>
