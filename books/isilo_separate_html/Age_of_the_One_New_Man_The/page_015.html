<p>The second thing that negatively affects the fruit of our work is our inability to work with others. We must be able to use others and raise them up. Some co-workers have not manifested their usefulness because they do not know how to work with others or are unwilling to work with others. In the church, as the Body of Christ, there is the need for coordination. Even in the world, individualistic people are not successful. If someone wants to open a shop, he must hire employees. In northern China people say, &ldquo;It is easy to sell things; it is hard to manage employees.&rdquo; If one does not know how to manage his employees, his business will not be successful. In every occupation we need to know how to work with others. All the successful Chinese emperors knew how to work with people. They even knew how to work with those who opposed them. Working with others does not mean that we are encouraging political maneuverings. If we cannot work with others, we will not be useful. Some saints have not manifested their function because they do not work with others. Some are unwilling to work with others, and some do not know how to work with others. It is not a matter of the saints lacking talent. Everyone has a talent, but some are greater and some are lesser in measure. It is possible to make a table with top-quality wood or lower-quality wood. If top-quality wood is not available, we should use the wood that is available. It is better to have wood than to have nothing, because even lower-quality wood can be made into a table. We must be able to work with others. Otherwise, we will be useless.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Unable to Work under Others</h2>
<p>The third thing that negatively affects the fruit of our work is that we are unable to work under others, to coordinate with others. This problem will also cause us to lose our function. There is only one universal administration. This is a great principle. Hence, there can be only one head in any situation. There is only one leader in a country. There can be only one emperor or one president. This principle applies to every government agency. There can be only one head, not two. As long as someone is not the head, he should follow the directions from the head, even if he is much more capable than the head. It does not matter how capable a person is; what matters is the time and the situation.</p>
<p>When the Lord brought me to work with Brother Nee, I was clear that Brother Nee was taking the lead. He may not have been more capable than I in every area, but he was taking the lead; therefore, I gave myself to follow him in everything. If he wanted me to go somewhere, I would go because he was taking the lead. I became very useful because I was used by him in this way. If I had thought that I was wiser and was unwilling to go where he sent me, he would not have asked me to go to the places where it was proper for me to go. We must know how to work with others and how to work under others so that we may be useful. Disposition, working with others, and working under others are not spiritual doctrines, but they are related to our usefulness.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Playing Politics</h2>
<p>The fourth thing that negatively affects the fruit of our work is playing politics. Although we do not have as much politics among us as other groups, we still have the residual influence of politics. We should never play politics in the Lord&rsquo;s work. When I went to Shanghai, some people thought that I was a foolish countryman because I never played politics. It was later proved that this foolish countryman was victorious. When I was young, I worked in a foreign company where, in addition to Chinese, there were seven other nationalities: British, American, French, German, Russian, Greek, and Norwegian. I worked with them for six and a half years; I was not foolish. The difference between the northerners and the southerners is that the southerners tend to play more politics. However, those who play politics will eventually be harmed by their own politics. I can testify before the Lord that playing politics is like digging a hole for one&rsquo;s own burial. Brother Nee fully trusted me because I did not play politics. Therefore, my advice is that even if someone has a history in the work, he should not play politics or manipulate things. Let our word be yes, yes, and no, no. If we do not agree, we do not need to oppose others, but neither should we play politics. This matter also has much to do with our usefulness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING USED BY THE LORD AND<br />
PRODUCING FRUIT</h2>
<p>Our disposition, working with others, working under others, and not playing politics are crucial to our being used by the Lord. I have my disposition. However, when I came into the work, I had to go against my disposition. Sometimes I failed. It is difficult to go against our disposition. However, even if we fail, we still need to go against our disposition. Beginning in 1934 I stayed in Shanghai for a long period of time. During this time Brother Nee put me at the center of the work. I can testify that I did not have any problem with anyone. I gave myself to be under others. I listened not only to Brother Nee but also to Sister Ruth Lee and Sister Peace Wang because both of them were older than I. Sister Peace Wang brought me to salvation and was six years older than I. Sister Ruth Lee was at least nine years older than I. They both knew the Lord and were useful to the Lord; they helped me greatly. Hence, I gave myself to be under them. I did whatever they said. I also learned from them how to work with others.</p>
<p>Coordination involves working with others and working under others. Two brothers in a family know who is older and who is younger. If you are older and I am younger, I will listen to you without complaint. This is coordination. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace there are no arguments or conflicts among us, nor is there anger. Nevertheless, there is still the need to accomplish things. In order to accomplish things, we need to know how to work with others. We learn how to work with others by being under others. If we know how to be under others, we will know how to work with others. Whether in the church or in the world, we cannot do a work by ourselves; we need colleagues or helpers. Recently, the church in Taipei has been flourishing. Although this is the result of many factors, we must admit that knowing how to work properly with others is one of the factors. If we do not work properly with others, we will quench their function before they begin to &ldquo;burn.&rdquo; Hence, we must learn how to work with others.</p>
<p>May the Lord deliver us from these negative items by His mercy. If the co-workers are willing to go against their disposition and learn how to work with others and how to work under others without playing politics, our work will bear fruit. We all have been in the work for many years. We cannot say that we do not know how to work. We may not have a thorough knowledge of the Bible, but at least we have a general knowledge of the Bible. We may not have arrived at spiritual maturity, but we have a certain amount of growth. However, because of these four points, our function is still not manifested. We lack those who know how to work with others. We can do things by ourselves, but we do not know how to do things with others. Hence, not many of us are used by others. As a result, our work does not yield much fruit.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_014.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_016.html">Next</a> </body></html>
