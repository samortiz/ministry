   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT THE COORDINATION OF THE ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the chapter regarding authority we have mentioned that the authority of the elders requires coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus, the coordination of the elders is closely related to their being the authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If there is no coordination among the elders in a local church, regardless how strong an individual elder may be, his strength is of no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, when the coordination of the elders exists, though the elders are weak, they can still stand and go on.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Strength without coordination is useless, whereas weakness with coordination is tolerable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We can see that the coordination of the elders is of utmost importance.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I. THE ELDERS BEING PLURAL IN NUMBER</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Bible shows us that in every church the elders should be plural in number.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A church cannot have one elder only.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If there is only one elder in a local church, the condition is abnormal and absolutely unscriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Regardless how young a church is, there should be at least two or three elders.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For the sake of coordination, the elders must be plural in number.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If an individual handles everything, bears everything, and deals with everything, it is as if he is but singing solos.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, the administration of the church is not a solo, but rather a chorus in a play.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, the elders must coordinate together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Whenever the coordination is missing among the elders, they will become worthless.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The worth of the elders depends upon their coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For this reason, the elders must be plural in number.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A MINIATURE OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A local church is the expression of the Body of Christ in a locality, whereas the elders in a local church are the miniature of that expressed body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When the elders are together in coordination, they constitute the smallest form of this body, and as such they are the miniature of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this age, God's greatest need is to have the church built up.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Where there is no building, there is nearly no church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>From the way the Israelites were arrayed according to their fathers' houses in the book of Numbers, we have seen how the church needs to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this building, the elders occupy a most important and distinctive position.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If a church does not have any elders, not only will there be no building, but it will be extremely difficult to have a church at all.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without the elders, there is no way to talk about the building.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order for a church to be built up, there is first the need for the elders to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How can a church be built up if its elders are not built up?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The building of the church is a matter of the coordination of the saints, but if the elders within a church cannot coordinate together, how can they help the brothers and sisters to coordinate?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, the building and the coordination in the church are entirely in the hands of its elders, and they are dependent upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Moreover, the elders must be the initiators and the examples in the building of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If there is no real building and coordination among the elders, there will be no initiators of the building up and the coordination of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In other words, there cannot be a beginning, and there is no way for the matter to be realized.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, for the sake of the building of the church, the elders must be the model and example of coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This model and example is the initiator in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only by this way can the few elders in a practical way build up and coordinate the saints together.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They can do this because there is a model seen in them already.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Spontaneously, they can take the saints on in this way of coordination and building.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, we see that God's will depends on the church, and the church is fully a matter of coordination and building, while the coordination and building of the church hinges fully on the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The elders are the smallest miniature of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If there is no coordination and building with the elders, there will be no way to talk about the coordination and building up of the church.</S>
