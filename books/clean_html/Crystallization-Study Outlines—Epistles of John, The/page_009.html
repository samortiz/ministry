<h1 class="title">The Practice of the Divine Righteousness</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:28&mdash;3:10a</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>The fellowship of the divine life and the teaching of the divine anointing should have an issue&mdash;the expression of the righteous God&mdash;1 John 2:29; 3:7.</li>
<li>The word <em>righteous</em> in 2:29 refers to the righteous God in 1:9 and to Jesus Christ the Righteous in 2:1:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The righteousness of God is what God is in His actions with respect to justice and righteousness&mdash;Rom. 1:17; 3:21-22; 10:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>Righteousness is related to God&rsquo;s actions and activities&mdash;Rev. 16:7; 19:2.</li>
		<li>God is righteous in His ways&mdash;His governing principles by which He does things; righteousness is the nature of God&rsquo;s acts&mdash;15:3; Psa. 103:7.</li>
		<li>God is righteous in the blood of Jesus His Son, which has fulfilled God&rsquo;s righteous requirements so that He may forgive us our sins&mdash;1 John 1:9.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>In ascension Jesus Christ is the Righteous&mdash;2:1:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the ascended One in the heavens, Christ is working and ministering righteously.</li>
		<li>As our Representative, or Attorney, in the heavenly court, Christ is the righteous One&mdash;v. 1.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>There are two aspects of Christ being righteousness from God to the believers&mdash;1 Cor. 1:30; Matt. 5:20:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The first aspect is that Christ is the believers&rsquo; righteousness for them to be justified before God objectively at the time of their repenting unto God and believing into Christ&mdash;Rom. 3:24-26; Acts 13:39; Gal. 3:24b, 27.</li>
	<li>The second aspect is that Christ is the believers&rsquo; righteousness lived out of them as the manifestation of God, who is the righteousness in Christ given to the believers for them to be justified by God subjectively&mdash;Rom. 4:25; 1 Pet. 2:24a; James 2:24; Matt. 5:20; Rev. 19:8.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to do righteousness habitually, continually, and unintentionally as a way of life in our daily living&mdash;1 John 2:29; 3:7:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>With the divine birth as the basis and the divine life as the means, we can live a life that practices the divine righteousness&mdash;2:25, 29; 3:9.</li>
	<li>The practice of the divine righteousness is a spontaneous living that issues from the divine life within us, with which we have been begotten of the righteous God&mdash;1:1-2; 2:29; 5:1.</li>
	<li>The practice of the divine righteousness is a living expression of God, who is righteous in all His deeds and acts&mdash;Rev. 15:3.</li>
	<li>The practice of the divine righteousness is not merely outward behavior but the manifestation of the inward life; it is not merely an act of purpose but the flow of life from within the divine nature, of which we partake&mdash;2 Pet. 1:4; Rev. 22:1-2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>We have a righteous nature within us, a nature that is of our new man&mdash;Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10.</li>
		<li>As we obey the inner anointing, the moving of the Triune God within us, we will live habitually according to this righteous nature&mdash;1 John 2:27.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>As the result of being saturated with the Triune God, we become His expression; in particular, because God is righteous, when we express Him, we express His righteousness&mdash;3:7.</li>
	<li>Because we abide in the righteous God and He is saturating us with what He is, we express His righteousness by living a righteous life habitually and unintentionally&mdash;2:29.</li>
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness&mdash;to live a righteous life that is the expression of the righteous God&mdash;is to purify ourselves&mdash;3:3:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li><em>Righteous</em> in verse 7 equals <em>pure</em> in verse 3.</li>
		<li>To be righteous is to be pure, without any stain of sin, lawlessness, and unrighteousness, even as Christ is.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>To practice sin (lawlessness) is to live a life which is not under the ruling principle of God over man; to practice righteousness is to live rightly under the principle of God&rsquo;s ruling&mdash;vv. 4, 7.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to live out and express the righteousness of God in a full and complete way&mdash;Matt. 5:20; Rom. 8:4; 2 Cor. 3:9; 5:21; Phil. 3:9; Psa. 89:14; Rev. 19:7-8; 2 Pet. 3:13:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to live a life that is right with God, persons, things, and matters before God according to His righteous and strict requirements&mdash;Matt. 5:20.</li>
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to live out the subjective righteousness of God, which is actually God Himself in Christ lived out through us to become a daily living that is right with God and man&mdash;Phil. 3:9.</li>
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to live Christ; if we live Christ, we will be the most righteous persons, for the Christ who lives within us will make us right in everything and with everyone&mdash;1:20-21a.</li>
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to have the righteousness that is the outward expression of the Christ who lives within us as the life-giving Spirit; as Christ lives in us as the life-giving Spirit and we live Him out, our living will express the divine righteousness&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 6:17; 2 Cor. 3:6, 9, 17-18.</li>
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to express the image of God; the Spirit is the essence of God living, moving, and acting within us, and righteousness is the essence of God manifested outwardly as God&rsquo;s image&mdash;Eph. 4:24; Col. 3:10.</li>
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to be right with God in our being; this is to have an inner being that is transparent and crystal clear, that is in the mind and will of God, and that is the righteousness of God&mdash;2 Cor. 5:21.</li>
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to live in the reality of the kingdom of God and under the throne of God, which is established with righteousness as the foundation&mdash;Rom. 14:17; Psa. 89:14.</li>
	<li>To practice the divine righteousness is to be clothed with righteousnesses to be the bride of Christ adorned with bright, shining righteousness&mdash;Rev. 19:7-8.</li>
	</ol></li>
