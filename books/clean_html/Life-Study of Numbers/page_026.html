<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. The Priest Writing the Curses<br>in a Book, Washing Off What He Writes<br>into the Water of Bitterness,<br>and Making the Woman Drink the Water<br>That Brings the Curse</H2><P>"Then the priest shall write these curses in a book, and wash them off into the water of bitterness; and he shall make the woman drink the water of bitterness that brings the curse" (vv. 23-24a). The curses here refer to the word of God's judgment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>6. The Priest Taking the Meal Offering of Jealousy Out of the Woman's Hand, Waving the Meal Offering before Jehovah, and Burning a Handful of It as a Memorial upon the Altar</H2><P>"The priest shall take the meal offering of jealousy out of the woman's hand, and shall wave the meal offering before Jehovah and bring it to the altar. And the priest shall take a handful of the meal offering, as its memorial portion, and offer it up in smoke upon the altar" (vv. 25-26a). The waving of the meal offering signifies resurrection. The handful of the meal offering that was offered up in smoke was burned to God as a memorial portion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. The Womb of the Woman<br>Who Had Defiled Herself Swelling,<br>Her Thigh Wasting Away, and<br>the Woman Becoming a Curse among Her People</H2><P>"When he has made her drink the water, if she has defiled herself and has acted unfaithfully against her husband, then the water that brings the curse shall enter into her to cause bitter pain, and her womb shall swell, and her thigh shall waste away, and the woman shall become a curse among her people" (v. 27). For the womb (abdomen) to swell meant that it became abnormal. For the thigh to waste away meant that the woman's strength was decreasing. This dealing involved creation, redemption, resurrection, the Holy Spirit, and God's habitation. Such a dealing was surely miraculous.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. The Woman Who Had Not Defiled Herself<br>Being Clear and Conceiving Seed</H2><P>"If the woman has not defiled herself and she is clean, then she shall be clear and shall conceive children" (v. 28). Literally, the Hebrew word translated "children" means seed. The woman who had not defiled herself would conceive seed.</P><P>The dealing in 5:11-31 indicates that God's test of His people's chastity is very severe. Our character must be high in chastity. Then we can fight for God and serve God.</P>
