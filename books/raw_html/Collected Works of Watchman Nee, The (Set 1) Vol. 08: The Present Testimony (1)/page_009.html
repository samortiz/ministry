<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DAWN OF REVIVAL</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 2</H2><P>After the February conference, we naturally were praying and waiting for God's further leading. Thank the Lord that through paying a price, some brothers and sisters have advanced further. Although they have lost their position, fame, and benefits, they feel that they are released from a heavy burden. This does not mean that they have been brought to an easier environment. On the contrary, they feel more lonely and experience more hardship. Nevertheless, they experienced the struggle at least once, and then declared that they will not yield to the flesh and to Satan, but will yield to God alone.</P><P>Other than what God has revealed to us and the things with which He has burdened us, we dare not trust in any of our work, and we dare not do anything. The Lord has wonderful provisions for the need in the work. We could never imagine that one believer in South Africa would send in money to help us in the printing of the Little Flock Hymnal! We could never imagine that the printing cost of other written testimonies would be covered by the offerings of believers who are not so wealthy!</P><P>Since such a testimony is new, it is bound to arouse misunderstanding. Yet we are comforted in the realization that those who are truly seeking have been released through the Lord's truth.</P><P>Some sisters among us are going to testify for the truth that the Lord commissioned us with in the Amoy area. Those who sojourn in Shanghai are continuing with the written testimony, and they are also waiting for God's further leading.</P><P>One cannot exhaust speaking about the peril of this age and let down his guard against it. We are striving onward by the one dawning ray of revival. We do not intend to have any great work. However, we would dread to give up and turn back through the weakness of the flesh! We maintain that if a person walks in God's will, God will never fail. All we ask from ourselves is faithfulness!</P><P>We thank God that He has opened up many doors for preaching the Word. Although we cannot accept all of the invitations, we know that when God's time comes, He will direct us to cast the net in the deep waters. May we lose track because of the calls from all around.</P><P>Watchman Nee<br>May, 1928</P>
