   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LOSS OF THE ONE ACCORD In Taiwan</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to realize that if the one accord is absent, everything is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There was a time when the real one accord was among the eight hundred saints in my hometown of Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This issued in a revival there.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This revival was brought over not in full but partially to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When I went to Taiwan I had learned from our past what was useful and what was not prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I dropped what was not useful or prevailing, and we had a marvelous beginning in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Anyone who was there in those first six years can testify of the one accord, the morale, and the impact.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Within this period of time our number increased from about four hundred to forty thousand, a hundredfold increase.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ninety percent of the new believers among us did not turn this way from Christianity but were typical Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The impact was with us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then the thought and the seeking after so-called spirituality came in among the leading ones.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As a result, Brother Austin-Sparks was invited to come, and that brought in the beginning of the dissension.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since that time, the one accord never came back to Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The intrinsic reason that I left Taiwan and came to this country was this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>About ten young co-workers, some of whom were brought to the Lord and trained by me, were influenced by Austin-Sparks concept to tear down, to overthrow, the church ground.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They became dissenting to my teaching, and this made the situation in Taiwan no longer pleasant to me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once a wife commits fornication, the marriage can be recovered, but the pleasant feeling is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no sweetness in the marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>That was my feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the United States</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After I came to the United States, in the first ten years in Los Angeles there was the morale.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>About 1970, though, some came in with ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This brought in a real damage.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because of this, the one accord was lost among us in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even up to today, the one accord has not come back.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A NEW START BY RECOVERING THE ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By October of 1984 I was clear about the situation of the Lord s recovery in the United States and even more clear about the situation on the island of Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I felt led by the Lord to go back to the source of the Lord s recovery outside of the mainland of China and to clear up that sulphur source.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When I went there, I made it clear that we had to drop all our old practices and that we had to have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord did something in Taiwan and the news came to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While I was doing something in Taiwan for the Lord s recovery, I had no intention to spread or push it in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>My thought was to first raise up a model in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Then we would have something as a base and as a pattern to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because today the globe is so small, some brothers went to Taiwan and the news came back to the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Many of the churches, especially in Orange County, California, began to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>According to my observation that was merely a kind of copying.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I knew that to merely copy something would not work, so this caused me great concern.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The source of the Lord s blessing in His move is the matter of being in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>THE NEW WAY TO CARRY ON THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I hope that you would take care of the following fellowship because it is very, very crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I feel led to practice the Lord s up-to-date move by dropping all our practices in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have to reconsider our way to go on in the Lord s recovery, and we must have a new start.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We could not have any new vision, new revelation, new teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The earth was made by God and no one can change it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But the way to travel around the globe should be improved again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Man has improved from walking to the use of wheels, from the mule wagon to the train and automobile, and from the single engine airplane to the 747.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In like manner, we have to improve the way to carry out the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The way we had was too old.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It was like traveling from the east coast to the west coast by mule wagon.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This old practice should not be here today.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What we need first in this new practice is to recover the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Your being a local church does not depend upon whether or not you take this new way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is not a movement and this is not a term or condition for a church to be recognized as a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whether or not you take this way, as long as you are standing on the church ground, recognizing not only your church but also all the other churches in the recovery as local churches, you are a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If a local church did not take this new way and we stopped recognizing it as a local church, this would be sectarian.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This is not the practice of the Lord s recovery with the all-inclusive church life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In the Lord s recovery, as the all-inclusive church, we do not cut off anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When I was in the church in Los Angeles, we never cut off anyone who spoke in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We do not cut off any believers in the practice of the all-inclusive church life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>However, for the Lord s move to have an impact, we need the recovery of the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To be citizens of the United States is one thing, but for these citizens to be formed into an army to fight the battle for the United States is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This does not mean that if you are not in the army, you are no longer a United States citizen.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You are still citizens, but you are not fighting for the country.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the Old Testament there was a judge whose name was Gideon, and he took only three hundred to form an army to fight the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Lord even told him not to have too many Judg.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>7:3-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We are not burdened to stir up a kind of movement.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>What we are burdened to do is to sound a trumpet, letting the children of God know what the Lord is doing today.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord is calling His dear saints, who would be willing to be brought back to the one accord, to fight the battle.</S>
