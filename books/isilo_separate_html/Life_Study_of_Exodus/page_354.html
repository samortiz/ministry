THE LEDGE OF THE ALTAR<br />UNDER WHICH THE GRATING OF BRONZE IS HUNG</h2><p>Concerning the ledge, we may also say that the ledge signifies the strengthening power upholding Christ under God&rsquo;s judgment. Christ was upheld by this strengthening power while He was on the cross suffering the judgment of God. The acacia wood overlaid with bronze signifies Christ in His humanity under God&rsquo;s judgment. No doubt, at the time of the crucifixion, the Lord Jesus needed strengthening, upholding, covering, and protection. I believe that the ledge in the altar served this purpose.</p><p>We have seen that the ledge probably protected the acacia wood inside the bronze covering from the heat of the fire. Without some kind of protection, the acacia wood certainly would have been charred by the heat transmitted through the bronze. The fire in the altar was burning continually, week after week and month after month. It would be impossible for the heat not to damage the acacia wood unless the wood was protected in some way. Therefore, I believe that the ledge also served the purpose of protecting the acacia wood. This may be the reason that in Exodus 27 we are told that the grating was under the ledge of the altar. The fact that the acacia wood could withstand the burning indicates that it was possible for Christ in His humanity to bear the judgment of God.</p><h2 class="head1">XIII. THE POLES OF THE ALTAR</h2><p>Exodus 27:6 and 7 say, &ldquo;And you shall make poles for the altar, poles of acacia wood; and you shall overlay them with bronze. And its poles shall be put into the rings, and the poles shall be upon the two sides of the altar when it is carried.&rdquo; The poles were for the move of the altar. They were made of acacia wood overlaid with bronze, signifying Christ as a man under God&rsquo;s judgment. These poles were put into the rings, signifying the move of the cross by the power of the Spirit. Moreover, the poles upon the two sides of the altar were to be carried by men. This signifies the move of the cross by the coordination of the believers as a testimony.</p><p>The poles in the rings are a strong evidence that the altar was to be carried by men. It was not to be placed on a wagon or carried by animals. The altar was to be borne on men&rsquo;s shoulders. Today the preaching of the cross must be done by human beings. But those who preach the cross must do so in coordination as a testimony. This was the reason the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples to preach two by two. Two is the number of testimony. In coordination and as a testimony, the believers are to carry the redemption of Christ by the power of the Spirit to the four corners of the earth.</p><h2 class="head1">XIV. MADE WITH PLANKS TO BE HOLLOW: ITS SIZE<br />SUFFICIENT TO CONTAIN<br />ALL THE UTENSILS OF THE TABERNACLE</h2><p>Verse 8 says, &ldquo;You shall make it hollow with planks; as it was shown to you in the mountain, so they shall make it.&rdquo; The altar was made with planks to be hollow and of a size sufficient to contain all the utensils of the tabernacle. This signifies that the cross of Christ contains all our experiences of Christ. The initial experience of the cross of Christ at the time we were regenerated is the base of all our subsequent experiences of Christ. All our experiences of Christ are based upon the principle of the cross of Christ.</p><p>The burden in this message is related to the Spirit for both burning and moving. It is very meaningful and significant that Christ bore God&rsquo;s judgment inwardly even more than outwardly. Furthermore, the eternal Spirit is linked to Christ&rsquo;s full redemption. This Spirit is for the burning within and also for the moving without. Today the cross must be preached in the way of burning and moving through the eternal Spirit. We who preach the cross must be living persons in coordination bearing a testimony. Then we shall be qualified to carry the altar in its journey on earth.</p><p>The altar is still being carried today. It has the burning inwardly, and it is moving outwardly. Praise the Lord for the grating, signifying the inner content of Christ&rsquo;s redemption! Praise Him also that we have the grating and the rings! We have the eternal Spirit for burning and moving.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_353.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_355.html">Next</a> </body></html>
