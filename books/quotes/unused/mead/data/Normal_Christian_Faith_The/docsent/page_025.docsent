   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Who is Jesus of Nazareth?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What would you say?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Is He merely the founder of the Christian religion?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Is He merely an example of self-sacrifice and humanitarianism?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Is He a social reformer?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Is He an advocate for universal love, peace, and freedom?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Listen to what He said about Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He said that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is your conclusion?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Is He a lunatic or a liar?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Is He a hoax, or is He God?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a vital question.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Can He be a madman?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you read His biographies in the Gospels and observe His life and manner, you will realize that not only was He sane and sound, He was very sober and firm.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there is a perfectly sound person in this world, He has to be the One.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>His mind was clear, and His mentality was alert.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you study His deeds and words carefully, you have to confess that His thoughts are very logical and consistent, and His manners are most comely and appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To opposing ones He only needed to reply a few sentences, and their arguments against Him were defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He did not have a trace of madness in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A madman could never have done what He did.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then is He a liar?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A liar always lies for a profit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there is no profit to be gained, what is the purpose of lying?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Why was Jesus crucified?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For no other reason than that He claimed to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the last judgment, the hour when His release or crucifixion was to be deliberated, He was examined as to who He was.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What was His answer?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He said that the Son of Man would be seen sitting on the right hand of the Majesty on high, descending on the clouds in glory Matt 26:64 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Even then He claimed to be God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, He was crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Is there a liar who would sacrifice his life for his lie?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>HIS WORD BEING TRUE</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Once I met a person who wanted to talk with me about our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He read some books about Jesus and admitted that Jesus had a high standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He could consider Jesus as a perfect man, a model for humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But he could not believe that Jesus is God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I said, "If you admit that He has a high standard of morality, then He at least is not a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you agree that He is not a liar, then you have to accept His claim of divinity as truth.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He repeatedly asserted that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you admire His morality, you have to recognize His divinity as well.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Jesus of Nazareth is God!"</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE WORD BECAME FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Please read John 1:1: "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 14 says, "And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us and we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father , full of grace and reality."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>What is the "Word" mentioned in verses 1 and 14?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 1 speaks of the relationship the Word has with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In reference to when, the Word was there from the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In reference to where, the Word was with God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In reference to what, the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today the Word has become flesh; He has taken on a human body and dwelt among men.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As to how He dwells, it says that He is "full of grace and reality," and "we beheld His glory, glory as of the only Begotten from the Father."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Who is this One?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He is Jesus of Nazareth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Here we have only seen one of the five qualifications mentioned earlier.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Only Jesus of Nazareth meets this first condition.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This proves that He is God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We shall go on to see the four other conditions or qualifications.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Jesus of Nazareth must meet all the other four qualifications before we can conclude that He is God.</S>
