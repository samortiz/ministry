   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Tabernacle and Temple Being Built through the Growth of the Produce of the Good Land</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The people of God are also typified by the temple as God s dwelling, His house, in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The tabernacle and the temple were the issue of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The people brought the surplus of their growth and offered it to God as materials to build up His house.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Both the tabernacle and the temple were built with the offerings of the Lord s people, and these offerings came from the growth of their produce.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the main thought of the Old Testament is that God s people are a tree and a crop to grow, and by this growth they are built up together as a dwelling place for God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The children of Israel also defeated the Lord s enemies, the pagan tribes, who occupied the good land Josh 23:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Defeating the enemy is for the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we do not defeat the enemy, we cannot come into the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then after coming into the good land, we grow the produce of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This growth of life is for the offerings, and the offerings are for the building up of the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Growth and Building</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>in the Parables of Matthew 13</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The parables in Matthew 13 are in two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first group are the parables of the sower and the seed, the wheat and tares, the mustard seed with its growth, and the flour and the leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The basic thought of this first group of parables is growth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The sower sowed the seed with the hope that wheat would grow vv.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>1-23 , but the enemy came in to sow tares to frustrate the growth of the wheat vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>24-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Next, the mustard seed should have grown to be an herb to feed people, but the enemy came in again to change its nature and form a great tree from this little herb vv.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>31-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This also changed the purpose of the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The purpose of a mustard herb is to feed people, but the purpose of a tree is to lodge the birds as the evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Nevertheless, the Lord is sovereign, and some of the wheat produced genuine flour.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, the enemy came in once again to add leaven to corrupt and ruin the pure, fine flour v. 33 . The seed, the wheat, the herb, and the flour all convey the thought of growth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The second group of parables in Matthew 13 comprise the parable of the treasure hidden in the field, which must be gold or precious stones, and the parable of the pearl of great value vv.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>44-46 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once more, both precious stones and pearls are the materials for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Growing as God s Cultivated Land</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>to Be Built Up as His Building</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First Corinthians 3:9 says, For we are God s fellow workers; you are God s cultivated land, God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are two aspects in this verse expressed by two clauses.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the one hand, we are God s cultivated land to grow, and on the other hand, we are God s building to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>These two thoughts always go together.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Tree of Life and the Holy City</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>at the End of the Scriptures</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the end of the entire Scripture there is the tree of life once again, and there is a city Rev 22:2; 21:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The line of growth and building go together throughout the entire Bible, from the very beginning to the very end. On the one hand, we are something of the vegetable life to grow, and on the other hand, we are the building, the house, the dwelling place, to be built up by the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more we grow in life, the more we are built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Building with the Precious Materials</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>of the Triune God</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First Corinthians 3:10-12a says, According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder I have laid a foundation, and another builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But let each man take heed how he builds upon it.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>For another foundation no one is able to lay besides that which is laid, which is Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here again there is the thought of the proper materials for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Precious stones, like pearls, are transformed materials.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There are three items in this category, not two items or four.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>According to spiritual insight, the three precious materials signify the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Gold signifies the nature of God the Father, silver signifies the redemptive work of Christ the Son, and precious stones signify the transforming work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We were born of God the Father to receive the gold, that is, His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We have been redeemed by the redemption of God the Son, and now we are under the process of transformation by the work of God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 12 also speaks of another category of materials: wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Wood is versus gold, grass is versus silver, and stubble is versus precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Wood signifies humanity, grass signifies the flesh, and stubble signifies earthly and worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, these three materials indicate the natural man with the natural life, the flesh, and the worldly things.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The above verses show us that the building up of the church is by the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The two lines in the Scriptures of growth and building always go together.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The church is a tree or a crop to grow, and out of this growth of life comes the building.</S>
