   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Bible clearly describes this conflict between the new nature and the old.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In Romans 7, Paul vividly portrayed this kind of life of conflict through his own experience.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He said, "For what I work out, I do not acknowledge; for what I will, this I do not practice; but what I hate, this I do" v. 15 . This is the conflict of the new and the old natures.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The description here is that of the experience of a newborn believer.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At such times, he is still a babe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is in the infancy of his spiritual life, and he is still childish and powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The "I" in the "what I will" and "what I hate" refers to the new nature.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the new nature desires God's will and hates sin, the other nature, the old nature, is too strong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This, together with the weakness of a person's will, compels that one to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, the new nature does not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"Now then it is no longer I that work it out, but sin that dwells in me" v. 17 . The first "I" is the "I" of the new nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"Sin" is another name for the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, this verse means that the one who sins is not the new "I," but the sinful nature.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Of course, this does not remove man's responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Paul went on to describe the positive contradiction between the old and the new natures, that is, the contradiction between the sinful nature and the spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"For I know that in me, that is, in my flesh, nothing good dwells; for to will is present with me, but to work out the good is not.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For I do not do the good which I will; but the evil which I do not will, this I practice...I find then the law with me who wills to do the good, that is, the evil is present with me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For I delight in the law of God according to the inner man, but I see a different law in my members, warring against the law of my mind and making me a captive to the law of sin which is in my members" Rom 7:18-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is indeed the common experience of all believers: to will to do good, yet be unable to do it, and to will to oppose evil, yet be unable to reject it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When temptation comes, a power the "law" suppresses our desire for holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As a result, we speak what we ought not speak and do what we ought not do.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Despite many resolutions and vows, we are unable to stop this power from working.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In Galatians Paul described again the conflict between these two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>"For the flesh lusts against the Spirit, and the Spirit against the flesh; for these oppose each other that you would not do the things that you desire" 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The old nature and the new nature are enemies of each other.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Both strive to gain absolute supremacy over us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The old nature has its desires and its power, and the new nature has its also.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The two natures exist in us simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, there is the constant conflict.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They are like Esau and Jacob in the womb of Rebekah; the two were diametrically opposed to each other, and at times they fought with each other in the womb.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Son of God was on earth, all the powers on earth plotted to kill Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the same way, while the Son of God lives in our heart as our new life, all the lusts in our flesh strive to remove Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Before we go on, we should first understand the characteristics of the two natures.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The old nature was born of our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In it, "nothing good dwells" Rom 7:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The new nature is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It "cannot sin" 1 John 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The new and the old natures are completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Not only do they come from different sources; even their functions are different.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, both exist in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The old nature is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"And those who are in the flesh cannot please God" Rom 8:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The new nature is the new spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without comparison with the new nature, the old nature, humanly speaking, is not too bad, despite some self-excusing inclinations and lusts.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet, when a person is regenerated, the new nature comes in with the new life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When both the new and the old natures are put side by side, the true characteristics of the old nature are exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>With the new nature as a contrast, the old nature is exposed to be evil, worldly, and devilish.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The new nature is holy, heavenly, and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Because the old nature, with the passing of time, has become so deeply intertwined with the person himself, it takes quite a period of time to remove this old nature in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The new nature has just come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Since man's flesh and sinful nature have become too strong, the growth and function of the new nature are suppressed.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Of course, we are only speaking from man's point of view.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is like the thorns choking the growth of the seed of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because the two natures are opposite one to another, when temptation comes, a person experiences fierce conflicts.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Since the old nature is strong and the new nature weak, a person often ends up doing what he does not desire to do and not doing what he does desire to do.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Since the new nature is holy, when a person fails, he feels repentant and condemns himself, and he pleads for the sin-cleansing blood.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Brothers, by now, you should understand the reason for your conflicting experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This kind of conflict shows most assuredly that you are regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The most crucial question now is: how can we overcome?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In other words, how can we reject the power and work of the old nature, and walk according to the aspirations of the new nature, and thus please the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Let us read three verses:</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>"But they who are of Christ Jesus have crucified the flesh with its passions and its lusts" Gal 5:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>"If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit"; "But I say, Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>25, 16 .</S>
