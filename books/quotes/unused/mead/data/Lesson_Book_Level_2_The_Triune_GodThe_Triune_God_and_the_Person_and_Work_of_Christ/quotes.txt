[2]  2 Cor 3:17; Heb 1:8-9; Rev 1:4; 4:5; 5:6.
[3]  First, we must be clear that there is only one God.
[4]  The Triune God Father, Son, and Spirit is a mystery in fact a mystery of mysteries!
[5]  Small and finite as human beings are, we can neither understand it thoroughly nor define it in a full way.
[6]  By the clause "the Word was with God," we understand that the Word and God are two, for the Word was with God.
[7]  In Lesson One we saw that there is only one God, yet mysteriously this God is Triune three-one the Father, Son, and Holy Spirit.
[8]  In Matthew 3:16-17 we see that the Father, Son, and Spirit all exist at the same time; that is, They coexist.
[9]  In this wonderful picture of the divine Trinity, Jesus the Son went up from the water after being baptized; at the same time the Spirit descended upon Him; and also at the same time the Father spoke from the heavens concerning the Son.
[10]  Matthew 1:18 says, "Mary...was found to be with child of the Holy Spirit."
[11]  Lesson Four THE SPIRIT BEING THE ULTIMATE CONSUMMATION OF THE TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading Jn.
[12]  Outline God being Spirit The Spirit being sent by the Father and the Son and coming "from-with" the Father The Spirit coming in the name of the Son The Spirit being the ultimate consummation final expression of the Triune God Text
[13]  Now we need to see that the Spirit is also the Triune God.
[14]  THE SPIRIT COMING IN THE NAME OF THE SON
[15]  In John 14:26, the Holy Spirit comes in the Son's name to be the reality of His name.
[16]  Lesson Five THE ESSENTIAL AND ECONOMICAL TRINITY Scripture Reading Eph 1:3-13; Jn.
[17]  We have seen that He is one, yet He is the Father, Son, and Spirit.
[18]  "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ...according as He chose us in Him before the foundation of the world...having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will...in Whom we have redemption through His blood, the forgiveness of offenses, according to the riches of His grace...having made known to us the mystery of His will, according to His good pleasure which He purposed in Himself...in Whom also we were made an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One Who operates all things according to the counsel of His will...in Whom you also, hearing the word of the truth, the gospel of your salvation, in Whom also believing, you were sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise."
[19]  Did you notice that all three of the Godhead are mentioned here?
[20]  If you study these verses more carefully you will see something marvelous about the Triune God.
[21]  These verses tell us that it was God the Father who planned in eternity past how everything would work together to produce the church.
[22]  He chose and predestinated many people to be His sons.
[23]  In Matthew 28:19, the Lord commanded His disciples to baptize new believers into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.
[24]  So when we were baptized through believing in the Lord, not only did the Triune God come into us, but we were also put into the Triune God.
[25]  IN THE OLD TESTAMENT Scripture Reading Gen 1:1, 26; 11:7; Exo 3:6; 1 Cor 1:9; Eph 1:3-5; Col 2:9; Rev 4:5; 1 Cor 10:4; Jn.
[26]  In the last six lessons we have covered the basic truth concerning the Triune God.
[27]  Often in the Old Testament the one God refers to Himself as "Us."
[28]  This lampstand is a marvelous picture of the Triune God.
[29]  Lesson Eight THE TRIUNE GOD AS REVEALED IN THE GOSPELS AND IN ACTS Scripture Reading Luke 15:4-32; Acts 2:21; 9:14; 22:16; 8:16; 19:5.
[30]  Although we see a lot about the Trinity in the Old Testament, it is not enough for our understanding.
[31]  The Gospels record the ministry of the incarnated Jesus on the earth.
[32]  Acts then records the work of the resurrected and ascended Christ in the heavens.
[33]  Lesson Nine THE TRIUNE GOD AS REVEALED IN THE EPISTLES 1 Scripture Reading Rom 8:9-11; 2 Cor 13:14.
[34]  The Epistles were letters written by apostles to various people.
[35]  The main thought of the Epistles is that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit who indwells our spirit.
[36]  The Father is the source of our salvation, so Paul said, "the love of God."
[37]  Christ the Son's coming is for the accomplishment of salvation and our full enjoyment of God, so he said, "the grace of the Lord."
[38]  The Spirit whom Christ became is the transmission into us of all that the Father is and all that Christ has accomplished; thus Paul called this "the fellowship of the Holy Spirit."
[39]  In this lesson we will look at Ephesians chapters two and three.
[40]  Ephesians 2 shows us a wonderful two-way traffic.
[41]  It shows God coming to us, then us going back to God.
[42]  Ephesians 3:14-17 says, "I bow my knees unto the Father...that He would grant you...to be strengthened with power through His Spirit into the inner man, that Christ may make His home in your hearts through faith."
[43]  Here we see again the Triune God the Father, His Spirit, and Christ.
[44]  Lesson Eleven THE TRIUNE GOD AS REVEALED IN REVELATION Scripture Reading Rev 1:1, 4-5, 7; 21:12-13; 22:1; Jn.
[45]  The New Jerusalem in chapters twenty-one and twenty-two unveils the Triune God to us in an ultimate way.
[46]  All the features of the holy city that John describes are wonderful signs showing us the Triune God and His economy.
[47]  Outline Seven golden lampstands The vine and the branches The Triune God The believers Bearing fruit The New Jerusalem A mutual habitation Possessing God's life and nature Our eternal destination Text
[48]  Although we cannot understand how our God can be three-one, we have seen that He is three-one in order to dispense Himself into us.
[49]  In John 15 the Lord Jesus describes God's economy as a vine tree.
[50]  In 15:1 Jesus says: "I am the true vine, and My Father is the husbandman."
[51]  The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the dispensing of the Triune God into His chosen and redeemed people.
[52]  Many people think that the New Jerusalem is a physical city or is "heaven."
[53]  Lesson Thirteen CHRIST'S PERSON AND WORK Scripture Reading Col 1:17; Isa 9:6; Rom 9:5; Matt 4:4a; Acts 2:22; 1 Tim 2:5; Heb 1:2, 10; Jn.
[54]  Outline Christ being God Christ being man Christ being the Creator Christ being a creature Christ's work Text
[55]  Throughout the four Gospels, Christ called Himself "the Son of Man."
[56]  Lesson Fourteen CHRIST'S INCARNATION Scripture Reading Matt 1:20-23; Luke 1:32, 35; 2:21-24; Matt 1:1; 9:6;
[57]  Rom 8:3; 2 Cor 5:21; Heb 4:15; Col 2:9; Jn.
[58]  In this passage there are three main points which strongly prove that our Lord Jesus is God Himself:
[59]  1 He was born through the impregnation of the Holy Spirit.
[60]  Hence, because Jesus was born through the impregnation of the Holy Spirit, it means that He was God incarnated.
[61]  The Holy Spirit went into Mary and Jesus the Son came out.
[62]  Although the Lord became flesh, He was without sin.
[63]  Christ was made in "the likeness of the flesh of sin" Rom 8:3 , but He did not participate in the sin of the flesh.
[64]  All of Adam's descendants have inherited Adam's sinful nature Rom 5:12,19 ; everyone is born in sin in Adam.
[65]  4:6-7; 11:33, 35; Luke 2:51; Mark 10:45; Matt 11:29; Jn.
[66]  Outline Christ being a genuine man Christ being the perfect and finest man Obedient Serving Having no appearance of evil Having the finest personality Divinity expressed through humanity Living by the Father and by the Holy Spirit The proper humanity for the church Text
[67]  On one hand He was ordinary, but on the other hand He was unique.
[68]  We would need many lessons to consider every aspect of Jesus' life.
[69]  The more we read about Him the more attracted to Him we should be.
[70]  God wants a group of people who are filled with Him and express Him just like the Lord Jesus.
[71]  For this we must have the proper humanity, which is the basic structure and strength of the church.
[72]  When Adam ate of the forbidden tree in Genesis 3, Satan, the old serpent, injected his evil nature into man.
[73]  Our nature was poisoned with Satan's nature and we became sinful, serpentine.
[74]  Lesson Seventeen CHRIST'S CRUCIFIXION 2 Scripture Reading 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 6:6; Eph 2:14-16; Jn.
[75]  Outline The last Adam The peacemaker The grain of wheat An all-inclusive death Text III.
[76]  All of the first four aspects of Christ's death dealt with the negative problems such as sins and Satan.
[77]  Now we must see that Christ also died as the grain of wheat.
[78]  In John 12:24, Christ described Himself as a grain of wheat: "Unless a grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit."
[79]  Lesson Eighteen CHRIST'S DEATH AS A GOD-MAN Scripture Reading Rom 3:23; 6:23; Heb 9:22; 2:14; 4:15; 1 Pet 1:19;
[80]  Outline Died as a man Acquired man's blood Was without sin Died as God For an eternal redemption To give eternal life Heresies concerning Christ Christ being God essentially and having the Spirit economically Text
[81]  Yet if Jesus were only a sinless man, we would still have a great problem.
[82]  His death would be good for only one man; in fact, it would be good for only one sin.
[83]  Heretical teachings about Christ come from having an inadequate understanding of the Bible's description of Him.
[84]  Next to God, death is the most powerful thing in the universe.
[85]  Next we would like to see that in His resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b .
[86]  Although the Lord Jesus was resurrected with a physical body, a body with flesh and bones Luke 24:39 , He was also resurrected spiritually.
[87]  This means that in His resurrection He was transfigured into the Spirit John 7:37-39; 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17 .
[88]  Outline Being made Lord Being made the Christ The Lord's inauguration Christ's heavenly ministry Christ as Ruler Christ as Head Christ as our High Priest Our cooperation Text
[89]  This was the last major step of the process He went through.
[90]  A good way to understand the Lord's ascension is to think of it as His inauguration.
[91]  The ascended Christ is also ministering to our inward need.
[92]  In Old Testament times the high priest ministered to God on behalf of His people.
[93]  Hebrews tells us that Christ is our great High Priest who can sympathize with our weaknesses 4:14-15 .
[94]  6:63; Luke 24:49; Acts 1:4-5, 8; Mark 16:15; 1 Cor 12:13.
[95]  Outline The inward content and the outward equipment The essential inward aspect Christ in us Christ as our life The content of the church The economical outward aspect The baptism of the Holy Spirit The propagation of Christ Our experience of both aspects of the Spirit Text
[96]  He can live in us because He is the Spirit.
[97]  The authority and power of the Spirit were to equip the disciples for the Lord's work.
[98]  The Lord had told them to "go into all the world and preach the gospel to all the creation" Mark 16:15 , and to be His witnesses unto the remotest part of the earth.
[99]  Christ had gotten into some people in Jerusalem, but desired to get into thousands, even millions more.
[100]  Lesson Twenty-Three CHRIST'S SECOND COMING Scripture Reading Rev 22:12, 20; Matt 24:36; Rev 10:1; 14:4; Matt 24:21-22; 2 Cor 5:10; Matt 25:10; Rev 2:26; 1:7; 14:14.
[101]  Outline The secret coming The judgment seat of Christ The open coming A warning Text
[102]  The church has existed on the earth for nearly two thousand years.
[103]  Christ now lives in millions of believers as the life-giving Spirit.
[104]  Lesson Twenty-Four CHRIST IN ETERNITY Scripture Reading Rev 20:11-12, 15; 2 Pet 3:10; Rev 21:1-2; Jn.
[105]  Outline The New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth The redeeming God The river of water of life The tree of life The Spirit and the bride Text
[106]  Do not think that in eternity God merely sits on His throne.
[107]  Out of the throne proceeds a river of water of life.
[108]  By this river, God will continue to dispense Himself into us for our eternal enjoyment.
[109]  The water of life is a symbol of God in Christ as the Spirit flowing Himself into His redeemed people to be their life and life supply.
