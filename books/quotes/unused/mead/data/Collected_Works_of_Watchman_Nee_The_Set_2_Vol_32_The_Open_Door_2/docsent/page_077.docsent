   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Lin-Zi, Shantung Province</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Since the capitulation of Shu County in April, I have been living in the countryside and learning the lesson of prayer with the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Although we passed through the valley of the shadow of death, we feared no evil because the Lord was with us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord brought me through the past year almost exclusively through the word in John 17:2a and Isaiah 54:16.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As far as the work goes, it is difficult to preach the gospel or to gather any meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But we still engage ourselves in visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The brothers agreed that I should return home from Shu County on November 21.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I stayed in Tsinan for five days, fellowshipping and breaking bread with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On the twenty-eighth, I returned home.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Through the Lord's dealing and stripping, I have come to realize my emptiness, uselessness, and the need to prostrate myself before the Lord and to look to His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since returning home I have been waiting for the Lord's revelation and guidance, seeking to walk in His will and to glorify His name.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Brother Yuan Lin-shu, December 3</S>

   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Miss Fu-en:</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Someone is leaving for Hungchow tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, I am jotting a few lines and asking my friend to relate the rest to you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This will save me another letter.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>May the almighty God be with all the saints, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1 We are happy to hear that Brother Tang Shou-ling has returned to Shanghai.</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2 Miss Yeh Chui- chung had asked for prayer for Miss Kao.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now she is saved and is diligently studying the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>She also has a good understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We ask that God heal her sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Perhaps this one is a chosen vessel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord has been doing all the work in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>May He continue to grant us grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Please do not cease your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>3 Thank the Lord for bringing Miss Ruth Lee and the other sisters back to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Our two families, Sun and Yu, are safe in the mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There is also an opportunity for us to do some work here.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Indeed, we have been in the experience of 1 Corinthians 2:9.</S>

   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I read about two sums of money in Brother Chao Jing-hwai's letter from Chefoo in Issue No. 13 of The Open Door.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>On October 1 Brother Lan Tsi-yi wrote to me concerning the same two amounts.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Brother Chang Hwei-zhi wrote on October 7 that the wire transfer fee was too high and that he could transfer the amount to us through his account.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After further investigation I learned of the circumstances of the intended recipients: Brother Wang Fu-tang's family moved to Yi-Yang and Mr. Yu Teh-hwa was killed by Japanese soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I wrote back to Brother Lan on the twentieth and told him everything.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is no way to forward these two sums.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I have not taken out the money from Brother Chang Hwei-zhi's account because I am unable to do a transfer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Please let Brother Lan know about this.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the fourteenth of last month, Lan-Si was bombed for the seventh time.</S>

   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The flesh suffered some shock, but inwardly we were still at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thank and praise the Father!</S>

   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Brother Yueh-chiao in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Most of the brothers and sisters in Ning-Po are still hiding in the countryside.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A few saints have been added to the ones in the city.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A few of them would even like to gather together for meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>They have discussed the matter with me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I also feel quite lonely, especially on the Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Presently, however, I only see the need of the members and have not yet discerned the need of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Hence, I dare not act rashly according to my zeal and set up meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>May the Lord's mercy and timing come quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>May He gather His saved children to build up His own Body so that all the members can function according to each one's part.</S>
