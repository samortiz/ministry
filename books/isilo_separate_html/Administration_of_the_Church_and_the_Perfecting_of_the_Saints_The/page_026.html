<p><em>Question: Should the local churches have a children&rsquo;s work? We lack suitable children&rsquo;s materials.</em></p>
<p>Answer: The children&rsquo;s meeting is a very important service, but we must admit that we have not done enough in our localities. The responsible brothers in the various localities should pay attention to the children&rsquo;s work and endeavor to bring younger brothers and sisters into the children&rsquo;s service. It is not easy to prepare materials. Some of what we have written is not fitting. Other things that were written are good, but not enough copies were printed. The ones teaching the children in the various localities need to pray much. They must not use Sunday-school material from Christianity and must not give the children premature knowledge. Premature knowledge is damaging, not beneficial.</p>
<p>I hope that the churches in the various localities will pay attention to the children&rsquo;s work. This work is worthwhile and necessary. If we can work with the children and those in elementary school, junior high, and high school, we will have a good foundation in the young people&rsquo;s work. Time flies; a decade goes by fast. The children who are seven years old this year will be seventeen years old in a decade, and the children who are ten years old now will be twenty years old in a decade. The young people who are seventeen to twenty years old are very useful in the church. The children&rsquo;s work is more effective than bringing people in from the streets to hear the gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THINGS TO AVOID IN COORDINATION</h2>
<p>Although there are troubles and sufferings in coordination, genuine coordination is very sweet. The key is with how we coordinate. The work of the ministry officially began in Taipei on August 1, 1949. On the one hand, we endeavored to help the church in Taipei; on the other hand, we helped build all the churches in Taiwan. From the beginning of the work we have avoided four things in our coordination. First, we avoided opinions. When the work began, I told the brothers who attended the service meetings and the elders&rsquo; meetings that in the administration of the church and the coordination in the work we must avoid opinions. We should not have opinions.</p>
<p>Second, we avoided the flesh. The flesh must never be involved in our coordination. As elders and co-workers, we must avoid and reject the flesh in any situation. Third, we avoided arguments. We should never argue. Fourth, we avoided strife. At that time I was taking the lead in the work, and by the Lord&rsquo;s grace we endeavored not to involve the flesh, not to argue, and not to be in strife. As a result, the Lord&rsquo;s testimony in Taiwan, including the administration of the church and the coordination in the work, began with a good foundation.</p>
<p>The first step in whatever we do is crucial. If the first step is right, the next steps will be easy. If the first step is wrong, it will be difficult to correct it afterward. If the abovementioned seven brothers understand their responsibility and are willing to be bound together, they must guard against the involvement of the flesh. By the Lord&rsquo;s grace they must by all means avoid ever involving the flesh. They must lay a good foundation. While ministering in the different localities, I have discovered that many elders do not have a good foundation in their bearing of responsibility and coordinating together, because the foundation that they laid involved arguments, contentions, and the flesh. Hence, it is difficult for their local church to go on.</p>
<p>After much prayer, I sense that the Lord wants us to give up our former ways and lay a new foundation. The change of responsible brothers in that locality is a special case. If all the localities imitate that locality, their imitation will be a dead ordinance. I hope that the brothers in the various localities will have a new beginning in bearing responsibility and coordinating.</p>
<p>In our coordination we should deal sincerely with one another, not with mere civility, and we should not involve opinions, the flesh, and contentions. The most beautiful thing in coordination is to love one another. We should have genuine love for one another, not an emotional, excited, superficial, fleshly, or factious love but love that is in Christ and in the Spirit.</p>
<p>I hope that every locality will have a basic, clear, clean, and pure foundation. Laying a good foundation is more valuable than anything else. Even going out to gain thousands of people is not as precious as a good foundation. The younger generation must remember this word and not lay a mixed foundation in their coordination. They must lay a pure and solid foundation without opinions, diplomacy, civility, the flesh, and strife. When a solid foundation is laid, proper persons will come to meet with us. If the foundation is improper, only improper persons will come. Birds of a feather flock together. A person will find and meet in a place that matches him. Therefore, we must lay a simple, pure, upright, and noble foundation in order to gain weighty and upright persons.</p>
<p>We thank the Lord that He has brought in some upright persons on this proper foundation. Those who are not upright cannot stay on this foundation, for they will be exposed if they stay. On a proper foundation without mixture, the flesh cannot rise up, no one can respond to the flesh, and gimmicks do not earn profit. Hence, the ones who come this way want life and the truth. If we have more life and truth and a firm foundation, the ones who come will be weighty.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_025.html">Prev</a> | Next </body></html>
