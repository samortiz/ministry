   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The problem with the believers in Colosse was not with the spirit, nor with the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because they had accepted various philosophies, their problem was in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They were in error not with respect to the new creation, but with respect to the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, they were in need of the renewing unto full knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 3:10 Paul says that the new man is being renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The image here refers to Christ, God s Beloved, as the expression of God 1:15; Heb 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It was God the Creator who created the new man in Christ Eph 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In Ephesians 4:24 Paul says that the new man according to God was created in righteousness and holiness of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here there is no mention of the image.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are only told that the new man was created according to God Himself, whereas in Colossians 3:10 we see that the new man is being renewed according to the image of the One who created him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Ephesians 4:24 the new man is created according to God, but in Colossians 3:10 the new man is being renewed according to the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The renewing of the new man results in full knowledge, and this full knowledge is according to the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In some of the foregoing messages we pointed out that the image in 1:15 refers to the expression of God and to the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The image of God is His fullness and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This, of course, is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I do not have the assurance that very many of us have been renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Concerning this, we need much more growth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are like the Colossians in that the new man has been created in our spirit, but our mind has not yet been renewed unto full knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to be renewed in our mind unto full knowledge according to the expression of God, that is, according to Christ as God s image.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that we need a renewal in our mind according to what Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This can take place only as we are renewed unto full knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In Colossians Paul uses the phrase full knowledge three times 1:10; 2:2; 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The problem with the Colossians was that they had the wrong kind of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They had taken in philosophies that were not according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 2:8 Paul speaks of philosophies that are according to the tradition of men and according to the elements of the world, but not according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now in 3:10 he speaks of full knowledge according to the image, the expression, the fullness, of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Concerning the new man, our mind needs to be renewed unto such a full knowledge according to the Christ who is the expression of the invisible God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our mind needs to be renewed to such an extent that we have a clear view of Christ as the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Few Christians have a proper understanding of the Christ unveiled in the book of Colossians.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Their minds have not been renewed unto such a full knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a result, many Christians today have been misled, deluded, and defrauded, just as the Colossians were.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Colossians could be deluded because in their minds they did not have the full knowledge according to God s expression.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The same is true of Christians today.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some have been carried away because in their minds they were not renewed unto full knowledge according to the all-inclusive Christ as the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In Ephesians we see that the new man was created in our spirit with the elements of the divine life and the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These elements have been added into our being to produce a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In Colossians, however, the new man is being renewed in our minds unto full knowledge according to Christ as the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When our mind is filled with the knowledge of the all-inclusive Christ, our emotion will be influenced.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This will cause us to have a greater appreciation of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, a child may have a greater appreciation for a velvet box than for the diamond ring in the box.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the child s mind there is no knowledge of the value of the diamond ring.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But as the child grows, he will have a greater appreciation for the ring.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Eventually, he will want to keep the ring and throw the box away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Love is a matter of the emotion, and the emotion is related to the understanding we have in the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we have little understanding of a certain thing, we shall not have much appreciation of it.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This will make it impossible for us to love that thing.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when our mind concerning that thing is renewed, our emotion with its love will be renewed also.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the mind is renewed, the emotion is spontaneously renewed as well.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our experience confirms this.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Both in spiritual experience and in human experience, the mind affects the emotion, and the emotion affects the will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to be renewed in our mind in order to have a proper love for the Lord in our emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Many saints are cold toward the Lord because in their minds they do not have much knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The more we have the knowledge of the all-inclusive Christ, the more we shall appreciate Him and love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although we still need a great deal more renewing, we nevertheless have a certain amount of knowledge of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This knowledge of Him causes us to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Out of our love and appreciation for the Lord, we exercise our will to decide to be for Him, to follow Him, and to live Him, grow Him, and produce Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We decide to live for Him and for His testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This decision comes out of the emotion, and the emotion is in turn influenced by the proper knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The central point of Paul s word to the Colossians concerns the renewing of the mind unto the full knowledge of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Colossians needed a full knowledge, not according to philosophy, Gnosticism, Judaistic observances, or heathen ordinances, but a full knowledge according to the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As we have pointed out, this image is the wonderful, glorious, all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need a renewing that results in full knowledge according to such a Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When I was a young man, I was captured by the dear Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The more my mind is renewed unto the proper knowledge of Him, the more I love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I can testify that, even though I am an elderly person, my love for Him is fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In fact, I love Him more today than ever before.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>As I speak of Him, a fire is burning within me.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The renewing that has taken place in my mind unto full knowledge according to the image of God has created appreciation within me for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This causes me to love Him.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When we have such a love for the Lord, we shall say, Lord Jesus, I want to follow You at any cost.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I am willing to pay any price, even the price of my life, to be one with You and be for You.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Lord, I want to take You as my life and as my person.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I want to live You, grow You, and produce You.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Lord Jesus, I am here for You and for You alone.</S>
