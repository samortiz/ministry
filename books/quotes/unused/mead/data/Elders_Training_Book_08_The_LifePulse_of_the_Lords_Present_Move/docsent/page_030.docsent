   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUPPORT FOR THE FULL-TIME ELDERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another verse concerning full-time is 1 Timothy 5:17: Let the elders who take the lead well be counted worthy of double honor, especially those who labor in word and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Double honor means they need double support.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You have to support them, but it does not mean you have to pay them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no word even as a hint in the New Testament telling us that the church paid somebody to be their preacher or to be their elder.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Yet Paul did tell us there were elders who went full-time and needed others to support them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The last part of this verse says especially those who labor in word and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To prepare the messages for all the meetings surely needs an elder s full time.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you still have a job, you will not be able to labor so well in your leisure time, after office hours, or on weekends.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You need to be full-time to labor in the word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul says the ones who labor in the word and in teaching are worth even more than double honor.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The ones who take the lead well are worthy of double honor, and the ones who are laboring in the word and teaching are worthy of more than double honor.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not consider being full-time as a profession.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Do not consider yourself as a preacher that the church has to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Just consider going this way by being led of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>ALL THE BELIEVERS NEEDING TO BE FULL-TIME</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In principle, we have to realize that every saved one should be a full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is why Paul has the ground to charge us to present our bodies to God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Every saved one must be a full-timer, presenting his body to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To present your body actually means to present yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes you may say that your body is here but your being is somewhere else.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Actually, your being always goes with your body.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Where your body goes, your being goes also.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But you cannot say that where your being goes, your body also comes.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Thus, to present your body is just to present yourself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As a saved one, you have to present yourself to God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Having presented yourself to God, you will be led by the Lord to either do a job to make money or to preach the gospel without making any money.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whether you do a job or preach the gospel depends upon the Lord s leading.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today, however, due to our human concept, we call the full-timers the ones who have given up their jobs to preach the gospel, but we do not consider those who do a job as full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Actually, all those who do a job should also be full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some brothers doing a job are really not full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are full-timers for themselves; they are not full-timers for God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Sometimes when such a one who makes a lot of money is happy with God, with the church, and with the elders, he would decide to write a check.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, he has the thought to write a check for ten thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then he says to himself, Wait a minute.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How could the church need ten thousand dollars?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It s too much.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It s foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is not the way to manage the finances, so I d better write a check for five thousand dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When his wife finds out that he is giving the church five thousand dollars, she says, The church doesn t need that much.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One thousand is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then the check is written and they begin to eat their lunch.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>During lunch they have a further talk.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The wife asks how much they have in the checking account.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the husband tells her that they have a lot in savings bonds, she will not agree with his selling the savings bonds.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the husband tells her there is only twelve hundred dollars in the checking account, she says, Could you write a check for one thousand out of twelve hundred?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Don t you know that Mark, our second boy, needs five hundred dollars to pay for his tuition tomorrow?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then the husband replies, If that is the case, we d better write a check for five hundred and cancel the other one.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Finally, they both agree to give the church five hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such a money maker surely is not a full-timer for God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Through church history and even among us we have seen some, although not too many, real full-timers who made money for God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They make ten thousand, yet they only spend two thousand for their living and give the rest to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Thus, they also are full-timers.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Every saint should be a full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every sister who is a housewife should also be a full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We have a reputation with most Christians that we are people who love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many married sisters pretend and even declare that they love the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Eventually it becomes manifest that what they really love is their children.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They do not even love their husbands so much as their children.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Such a sister who declares that she loves the Lord yet who really loves her children more is not a full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If a sister is really a full-timer, whether her children live or are taken away by the Lord, it is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hence, to be a full-timer is not an easy thing.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You need to say, I can do all things in Him who empowers me.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whether I have my husband and my children or I lose everyone, I can bear it in Him who empowers me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>I am a full-timer.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>NO SLOPPY OR IDLE ONES</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>TO BE SUPPORTED BY THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>As the one who proposed to have five hundred full-timers per year in Taiwan, I am quite concerned that by this practice a lot will come in who are sloppy ones, idle ones, ones who just know how to eat, but do not know how to work.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I have seen some like this already.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When you encourage all the saints to go full-time, these ones will take the lead to say, I will be a full-timer; wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I don t need to work.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I don t need to go to the office during certain hours.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I can sleep as long as I want.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>No one bothers me and no one fires me, since no one hires me.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Once I declare that I am full-time and the church consents, then that is for my whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Do not assure these ones that the church will take care of them, otherwise you will spoil them.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A FULL-TIMER BEING ONE WHO IS</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>ABSOLUTE FOR THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To be a full-timer means to be one who is absolute for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Your income may be five times what you need, yet you would only spend that one-fifth for your living and give the other four-fifths to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>To talk about tithing as the Seventh-Day Adventists practice is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>That is something from the Old Testament, something in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the New Testament it is not to present one tenth but to present your body, to present your entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This includes everything you are, everything you have, everything you can do, and everything you earn.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is not just one tenth but ten tenths.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must teach this and promote this to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Paul was such a person, and Aquila and Priscilla were such persons.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>They were for nothing else.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>They were just for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Even whatever they had for their living, that was also for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If they did not take care of their living, they would die.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If they died, they could not live for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Whatever they did, even making a living to keep themselves alive, was also for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>They did nothing for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We must uplift the standard of the biblical truth concerning the matter of being full-time.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I hope that we all would be recovered in the understanding of such a truth.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Do not think that this is a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Bible reveals some truths by plain words and other truths just by cases.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>None of the verses in the Scripture reading use the word full-time, but all of the cases are there.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>In all these cases is the truth of all the saved ones needing to be absolute for God, to be full-timers, regardless of what they do.</S>
