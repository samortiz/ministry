   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There are two great communities in this world: one is the world community, and the other is the community of those who are saved in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Being saved is being delivered out of the world community which opposes God, which is sinful and unclean, and entering into the community of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is why we have to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By baptism we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, we must first believe in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who do not believe in the Lord cannot be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Mark 16:16 says, "He who believes and is baptized shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Baptism signals a deliverance; it is a great deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It delivers us from the world and everything that is of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But baptism is not only a deliverance out of something; it is also an entry into something.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Baptism is a grand entry.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is to enter into Christ and enter into His death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Everyone who believes will have eternal life because of the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot deny this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, we are saved from the world because of our entry into the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Baptism signifies that we are delivered from the world community.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Suppose someone asks if you have believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You have to say yes; your sins have been forgiven because of the blood of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Bible says that he who has the Son of God has life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You may know that you have life, and you may be very clear that you have believed in the Son of God as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But suppose you lose your temper, argue, and even fight with two or three brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After the fight, if you check with yourself, you will realize that you are still a believer and that you are still saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You will not have any doubt about this.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But the other brothers will doubt that you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I can tell you that many people are qualified to go to heaven, but they are not qualified to live on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many people are qualified to live before God, but are not qualified to live before their family.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many people are good enough to live in heaven, but are not good enough to live on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is why you cannot allow others to baptize you into the water or sprinkle water on your forehead based on what you have believed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You must know yourself what baptism is, before you can be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You must know that you have been delivered from the world already.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Baptism is a declaration and an announcement to the world that you are no longer joined to the world and that you are no longer standing on its side.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are delivered from the world, and baptism is your declaration that you are standing on the side of Christ from now on.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am not trying to persuade you to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I am showing you that before you are baptized, you have to realize that there are two opposing camps, the camp of Adam and the camp of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is no middle ground between these two camps.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At the time of Noah, God declared that the world was His enemy and that the world was at enmity with God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He appointed a way of salvation everyone who entered the ark stood on God's side and obeyed God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is interesting to see that the Bible refers to the entry into the ark and the deliverance from the flood as a type of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, we have to speak this word to all the ones who are about to be baptized, as well as to all the other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Many people are baptized already, and a good number are also baptized among us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Why were you baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Was it because it was a church practice, a church ritual, a commandment of the Bible, a sign of seriousness in being a Christian, or because other Christians were doing it?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Baptism is turning one's back to the world and facing Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is being delivered from the world community and entering into the community of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is no middle ground between the world and Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There was a door on the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This door signifies that everything within the door was in the realm of Christ, and everything outside this door was in the realm of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we see this, we will not need anyone to come and tell us at the time of baptism that we need to change ourselves in certain matters.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We will know what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We will not have to deal with the world like pulling out hairs, plucking them out one by one; instead we can shave them off all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It is a pity that many among us do not see this.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We try to change the world, but God is giving us a new world.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No human method, such as religious dogmas, literature, science, philosophy, or moral teachings, can change this world.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God shows us that even though the world is lovable and enjoyable, it is God's enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Living in the world means that you cherish the hope that it will change.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Yet God has no hope of changing the world.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He has no other way of dealing with the world than to judge it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>For the world to improve and be reformed through human methods would take many many years.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thank God that He needs only to wash the world with water and it will become the new earth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the days of Noah, God washed the world with water.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the future He will burn it with fire.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Are we like Lot, tarrying in Sodom and Gomorrah, waiting to be burned by fire?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Or are we untouched by the world?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Unfortunately, many are like Lot's wife; they live in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Are we living in the world, or are we letting all these things go and looking forward to the new heaven and new earth, where righteousness dwells?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On top of the ark was a window or a "light-inlet."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This word is used in the Old Testament twenty-four times.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The word is translated as noon twenty-three times.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the only place where it is translated as window or "light-inlet."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The light that passed through this window was not a weak light, but a bright light.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is living in the light of God.</S>
