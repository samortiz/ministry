Not Brought under the Power of Anything</h2><p>In verse 12 Paul twice says, &ldquo;All things are lawful to me.&rdquo; The first use of these words is somewhat objective; the second use is very subjective. Paul says, &ldquo;All things are lawful to me, but I will not be brought under the power of anything.&rdquo; Literally the Greek words rendered &ldquo;be brought under the power of&rdquo; mean to be brought under the authority of. All things are under my power, but I will not be brought under the power (authority) of anything. All things are permissible, allowable, lawful, to me, but I will not be ruled (enslaved) or brought under the authority, the control, of any. Verse 12 may be considered a proverb that governs the apostle&rsquo;s dealings with some problems in the following section, from 6:13 through 11:1.</p><p>When you consider whether or not to do a certain thing, you should ask if you are under the power or control of that thing. If a particular thing controls you or has power over you, you should not do it. For example, you may wonder if you should eat certain foods. It may be all right to eat those foods, but they should not have any power over you. We must fully deal with anything that has power over us.</p><h2 class="head1">II. OUR BODY FOR THE LORD</h2><h2 class="head2">A. Foods for the Belly, and the Belly for Foods</h2><p>In verse 13 Paul goes on to say, &ldquo;Foods are for the belly and the belly for foods; but God will bring to nothing both it and them.&rdquo; Foods and the belly are for the existence of the body. By themselves they do not mean anything; God will bring them to nothing.</p><p>Paul&rsquo;s composition here may seem awkward. He says, &ldquo;God will bring to nothing both it and them.&rdquo; If we were writing this verse, we might say, &ldquo;God will bring both to nothing.&rdquo; However, if the verse were written in this way, the meaning and significance would be lost. By referring to &ldquo;both it and them,&rdquo; Paul means both the belly and the foods. He refers to the belly first because God will bring it to nothing before He brings foods to nothing. The reason for this is that the abuse of freedom in the matter of eating is not caused by the food; it is caused by the belly. The problem comes not from the food itself, but from the belly. After a person&rsquo;s belly has been brought to nothing, food will no longer be a problem. Food is for the belly, and the belly is for food. God uses these things so that we may exist for the fulfillment of His purpose. But one day God will bring both the belly and the foods to nothing.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Body Not for Fornication but for the Lord,<br />and the Lord for the Body</h2><p>In verse 13 Paul also says, &ldquo;But the body is not for fornication but for the Lord, and the Lord for the body.&rdquo; Our body was created for the Lord, and the Lord within us is for our body. He feeds it with material food (Psa. 103:5) and gives it His resurrection life (Rom. 8:11), which swallows its death element with its weakness and sickness. Eventually He will transfigure it, conforming it to His glorious body. We should not abuse it by fornication.</p><p>On the one hand, Paul says that the belly is for food; on the other hand, he tells us that the body is not for fornication. We are free to eat what we choose, but we may not commit fornication. However, if we eat excessively, we shall cause damage to our body. Thus, although we are free to eat, we should be careful to eat in a healthy way. Our appetite easily runs wild. Thus, it needs to be bridled, restricted.</p><p>Although Paul says that the body is for the Lord and the Lord for the body, he does not say that God is either for the belly or for foods. God will bring both the belly and the foods to nothing, but the Lord will not bring our body to nothing. Our body is for the Lord, and the Lord is for our body.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_109.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_111.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 Corinthians &nbsp; pg 110</div><br></body></html>
