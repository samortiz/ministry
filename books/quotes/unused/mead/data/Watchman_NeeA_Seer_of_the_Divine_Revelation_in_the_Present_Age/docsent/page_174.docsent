   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Before I went to meet Watchman in Hong Kong, while still in Taiwan, I finished the compiling and composing work on the second Chinese hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I presented him with the manuscript, and he polished the hymn on the life of the grapevine, adding a few stanzas to it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It now appears as Hymn #635 in our English hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>At that time I related to him that I had also composed sixty lessons on the basic truths of the Scriptures and that there was the need to reprint the first Chinese hymnal and some others of his publications.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At this time he made the following arrangements regarding the bookroom and literature work:</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1 The Gospel Bookroom should be set up in three places: Shanghai, Taipei, and Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Watchman would personally manage the one in Shanghai; I would be responsible for the one in Taipei; and Brother Weigh would be responsible for the one in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Further, I was asked to assist the bookroom in Hong Kong regarding literary and editorial responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>2 All three bookrooms would share the same copyrights.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In 1975, Brother K.H. Weigh and I with other related brothers rearranged, due to the situation at that time, the matter of copyright as follows: All the Chinese books would be published by the Gospel Bookroom in Taipei; all the English books would be published by the Living Stream in the U.S.A.; the Hong Kong Church Bookroom would be used only for the distribution of our publications in Hong Kong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>While in Hong Kong I shared with Watchman Nee how the Lord had blessed the work in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He therefore encouraged me to return and remain there for the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since I was much concerned for his return to the mainland, I had long fellowship with him one day regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I said to him, "What the Lord's will is I dare not say.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The matter is too great and serious."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He said to me, "What shall we do with so many churches on the mainland?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I must return to take care of them and stand with them for the Lord's testimony."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Concerning this matter, Brother Hsu Jin-chin testified to the following:</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Before Brother Nee left Hong Kong, Brother Lee advised him many times not to return to the mainland.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But Brother Nee said, "If a mother discovered that her house was on fire, and she herself was outside the house doing the laundry, what would she do?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although she realized the danger, would she not rush into the house?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although I know that my return is fraught with dangers, I know that many brothers and sisters are still inside.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>How can I not return?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Brother Lee escorted him three times back from the bus stop to his home in Diamond Hill....</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>________________________________________________________________________________________________________</S>
