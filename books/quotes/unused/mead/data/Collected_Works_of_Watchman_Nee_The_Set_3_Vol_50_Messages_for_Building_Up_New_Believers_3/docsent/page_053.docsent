   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ENDURING FOR GOD'S DISCIPLINE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The apostle quoted Proverbs when he wrote to the Hebrew believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 7 the apostle explains the quotation from Proverbs in verses 5 and 6, saying, "It is for discipline that you endure."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is the first New Testament explanation of the subject; it is a crucial word.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here the apostle shows us that endurance, suffering, and discipline are the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God is disciplining us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The apostle shows us that this disciplining is the same as our endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is for discipline that we endure.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A. Suffering Being God's Discipline</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Perhaps some will ask, "What is God's discipline?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Why is He disciplining us?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verses 2 through 4 speak of enduring the cross, despising the shame, and resisting sin, whereas verses 5 and 6 speak of discipline and scourging.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is the relation between these two things?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What are the discipline and scourging in verses 5 and 6, and what are the shame, affliction, and resistance against sin in verses 2 through 4?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 7 is a conclusion of verses 2 through 6.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It shows us that what we endure is God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus, suffering, shame, and affliction are God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Although our resistance against sin is not unto blood, the pain and tribulation are nevertheless part of God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How does God discipline us?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>His discipline has to do with whatever He is bringing us through and whatever He is charging us to endure.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Do not consider God's discipline as anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's discipline is what we endure every day, things such as harsh words, an unkind face, a sharp tongue, an impolite retort, an unreasonable criticism, unexpected troubles, various kinds of shame, irresponsibility, infractions, and other more serious problems arising in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Sometimes it may be sickness, poverty, affliction, or difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We encounter many things and endure many things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The apostle said that all these are God's discipline!</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is for discipline that we endure.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>B. No Experience Coming to Us by Accident</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The question today is: What kind of response do we have when others give us an ugly look?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If their look is God's discipline, how should we react?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If our business fails because others have forgotten to do something for us, how should we react?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If the poor memory of another person is God's discipline to us, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we become sick through another's infection, how should we deal with it?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If things turn sour through various misfortunes, what do we say?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If things do not go our way because God's discipline is behind them, what should we say?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers and sisters, the response to all these things makes a great difference in us!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can consider everything in our environment as being a mere encounter; this is one kind of attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We can also consider it to be God's discipline; this is another kind of attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The words of the apostle here are very clear.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He says that it is for discipline that we endure.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Please do not consider all these things to be unendurable.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They are God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not conclude foolishly that they are mere coincidence.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must realize that God daily arranges these things and measures them for our discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>C. Discipline Being God's Dealing</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>with Us as with Sons</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Verse 7 continues, "God deals with you as with sons."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God deals with us as with sons.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"For what son is there whom the father does not discipline?"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What we experience is God's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Today all discipline comes to us because He deals with us as with sons.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Please bear in mind that discipline is God's way of honoring us, not afflicting us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many hold the wrong concept that they are disciplined by God because God wants to torture them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We are disciplined by God because God is honoring us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He deals with us as with sons.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For what son is there whom the father does not discipline?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Discipline is God's honoring of us!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We have become God's sons; therefore, we must be disciplined.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God disciplines us in order to bring us to the place of blessing and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We should never think that we are tormented by God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>For what son is there whom the father does not discipline?</S>
