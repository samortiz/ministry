<p>For the God-ordained way, the biblical way, the new way, we all need, first of all, to love the Lord. In John 21 the Lord asked Peter if he loved Him. Peter told the Lord, &ldquo;You know that I love You.&rdquo; Then the Lord answered, &ldquo;Feed My lambs,&rdquo; and &ldquo;Feed My sheep&rdquo; (vv. 15, 17). To speak is not only to edify or to teach but also to feed the lambs and to feed the sheep. If we are going to feed the Lord&rsquo;s sheep, we have to speak. Without speaking, how could we feed any Christian? For us to feed the Lord&rsquo;s sheep, we must love Him. We should tell the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, I love You, so I like to speak You forth to others.&rdquo; The more that we love Him, the more we are qualified, equipped, and even perfected to speak.</p>
<p>According to the Scriptures, the sisters are weaker vessels according to their nature by birth (1 Pet. 3:7). This is according to God&rsquo;s creation. But as long as the sisters love Him, they will speak. I was born in Christianity, and I was raised there for nineteen years without receiving the Lord as my Savior. But one day a young lady came to my hometown. I was nineteen years old, and she was twenty-five. That was over sixty years ago in conservative mainland China. For a young lady to speak to a thousand people was a very unique and unusual event. Although I had been to Christian meetings quite often, I went to this meeting full of curiosity to see this young lady speak. In my whole life, even up to today, I never heard a person speaking with that much authority. She was a young girl standing on the platform in a meeting place that was filled with about one thousand people. As I listened to her, all my curiosity was taken away. Every word that she spoke caught me, and I was fully convinced. I was a young man raised up in Christianity, but that day I was convinced and caught by the Lord. After the meeting as I was walking home, I prayed and gave my entire life to the Lord.</p>
<p>That young lady, who was only twenty-five years old, loved the Lord to the uttermost. That was her motive. Her love for the Lord was the factor, the element, and the very basic essence of her being powerful. The message she released was from the book of Exodus. She told the audience that Egypt typified the world and that all the worldly people were under the tyranny of Satan just as the children of Israel were under the tyranny of Pharaoh. She said that we had to be delivered out of this tyranny and that this was our exodus. When I heard this near the beginning of her message, I said to myself that I would not be under Satan&rsquo;s tyranny any more. Because this young sister loved the Lord to the uttermost, she had the Lord&rsquo;s authority, and the impact was in her gospel preaching.</p>
<p>If we love the Lord, we surely will be filled with Him. Whatever fills us within will come out of us. The overflow comes from the infilling. When we love the Lord, He will fill us. From that day in 1925 when I gave my life to the Lord, I loved to study the Bible and to talk to people about Jesus. Because I was filled with the Lord Jesus, I wanted to speak the Lord Jesus. If we are filled with the Lord Jesus, we surely will have something to pour out. If the sisters love the Lord, they will not be able to restrain themselves from speaking forth the Lord. When we love the Lord to the uttermost, we must speak. We must release the One who has filled us within.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING REVIVED</h2>
<p>As we are loving the Lord, we will be revived. According to the book of Revelation, both the church in Sardis and the church in Laodicea were backsliding churches (3:1-2, 15-17). The Lord Jesus said to Sardis, &ldquo;You have a name that you are living, and you are dead.&rdquo; Whatever the church in Sardis had was not growing but dying. They needed to repent. They needed a revival. Laodicea had become lukewarm. Because the saints of Laodicea were neither hot nor cold but lukewarm, the Lord was about to vomit them out of His mouth. They needed to repent. They needed a revival. The churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery need a revival to be brought out of such a lukewarm and dying situation.</p>
<p>Before we began to visit people for the gospel, the churches did not baptize that many. But since we began to take the Lord&rsquo;s way of visiting people to bring the gospel to them, we have baptized thirty-eight thousand people in less than two years in Taipei alone. By 1984 our situation was not encouraging. We hardly had any sensation that we were so dormant, so lukewarm, so dying, and even so deadening toward others. The number of churches was increasing through the publications of the ministry, but in general the membership in each local church was at a standstill. Most of the churches had very little increase. Why should we remain in such a dormant situation without any sensation that we have to wake up, to rise up, and to be revived? We all need a revival. Once we are revived, we will not be able to stay at home and be silent. We will have a desire to go fishing for men and to go to the homes where the fish are (Matt. 4:19). If we are going to set up a denomination, we do not need a revival. But to have a local church in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery that is living and prevailing with everyone speaking, we all need to be revived.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Speaking Christ for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
