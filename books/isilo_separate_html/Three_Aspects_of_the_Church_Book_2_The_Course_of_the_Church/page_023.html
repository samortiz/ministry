<p>We need to see what the Lord says concerning the church&rsquo;s overcoming in the seven epistles in Revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head4">Recovering the First Love for the Lord</h2>
<p>In the first epistle the Lord asks the overcomers to recover or keep their first love for the Lord (2:4-5). According to the order of the seven epistles, the desolation of the church began with losing the first love for the Lord. Initially, the church&rsquo;s love toward the Lord was fresh. Out of this fresh love, the church followed and served the Lord. However, at a certain point in time, the church lost its first love for the Lord, although it was still zealous in works and labor. Because the first love was lost, there was a problem in life. In the first epistle to Ephesus, we see the tree of life (v. 7) and the lampstand (v. 5). Because the church lost its first love, it had a problem in life, and the light of its testimony was no longer clear. Thus, the lampstand was removed. The church was in a condition of desolation. Since this is the first epistle, it is a record of the beginning and cause of the desolation. This beginning, this cause, was the losing of the first love for the Lord. Therefore, the overcomers must constantly maintain their love for the Lord in the desolation of the church.</p>
<p>The world, fame, and position are not the only things that can cause us to lose our love for the Lord; even the blessings God gives us or the work in our hands can cause us to lose our love for the Lord. This is the result when a work is not done out of love for the Lord or if the fellowship in love with the Lord is lost during the course of the work. If we are like this, we are defeated. All our work should be a matter of love between the Lord and us.</p>
<p>We preach the gospel because we love the Lord. Because we have a fresh love for Him, our gospel work does not replace the Lord. We build up the church because of our fellowship of love with the Lord; we administrate the church in a proper way because there is a story of love between us and the Lord. In our love to the Lord we administrate His church and preach the truth to the saints for their edification. Our work and service should issue out of our love for the Lord.</p>
<p>Many among us have experienced working for the Lord without loving Him. We should not make our service a profession. We make our service a profession when we lose our first love toward the Lord. A nanny feeds children in the course of her profession, but a mother feeds her children out of love instead of professional duty. If our preaching of the gospel is just a duty, we have fallen. It should not be a matter of duty but of love.</p>
<p>Every morning we should fellowship with the Lord in love, with a feeling of love, the love of the bridal days (Jer. 2:2). We must turn afresh to the Lord and renew our consecration to Him. We should say, &ldquo;Lord, I love You in the same way that I loved You on the day I first met You. Our relationship is as it was in the bridal days.&rdquo; This is what the book of Jeremiah says about the love of the bridal days. The losing of the first love in the epistle to Ephesus is the same as the Israelites&rsquo; losing the love of their bridal days for the Lord. In order to be overcomers in the desolation of the church, we must maintain our fresh love for the Lord. Every day we must say, &ldquo;O Lord, our relationship is like that of a newly married couple. Lord, I have a fresh heart for You, a fresh hope in You, and a fresh turn to You. Lord, I also have a fresh enjoyment of You and a fresh knowledge of You.&rdquo; Then such a love will motivate us to do His work; this is to be constrained by the love of Christ (2 Cor. 5:14).</p>
<p>When the elders administrate the church, they should pour themselves out for the saints because they are constrained by the Lord&rsquo;s love. If we do not pour ourselves out for His church, God&rsquo;s heart will not be happy. What makes God&rsquo;s heart the happiest is the building up of His church; God loves and treasures the church more than anything else. Because we love Him and care for His heart&rsquo;s desire, we are willing to sacrifice everything for the church. This is the first requirement for being an overcomer.</p>
<p>We should search our hearts to see whether our work has become a profession. When we administrate the church, are we doing something merely out of duty? When we serve the church, are we doing it merely out of diligence? If this is the case, we are finished. When others contact us, they should sense that we have a fresh love toward the Lord and that we have freshly tasted the Lord&rsquo;s love. The only motivation behind our daily living should be our love for the Lord. We should be for the church, for sinners, and for the Lord&rsquo;s way because we have a strong love for the Lord. Because Lord&rsquo;s loveliness has deeply touched and attracted us, we have no murmurings or other motives. All our labor and actions come out of this love.</p>
<p>Others can sense when we are in such a loving condition, and we ourselves know it even more. When such a person gives a message, he will sense not so much that Jesus is the Lord but that He is the lovely One. The relationship of such a person with the Lord is not one of servant and master but one of mutual love. We should have prayers before the Lord that are not begging prayers but more like a loving consultation. We may say to Him, &ldquo;Lord, I like this; how do You feel? I want to know if You like it too. I do not want Your commandment; I want to know Your heart, and I want to live in the feeling of Your heart. I do not want You to give me a command; I want to know Your heart. Lord, I love You.&rdquo; Every servant of the Lord should be a lover of the Lord. If a servant of the Lord is not like the Shulammite in the Song of Songs, he has a problem. Therefore, the first requirement for overcoming is to have a fresh love for the Lord and to maintain the first love for the Lord.</p>
<p>If our work is blessed or if we become a famous preacher in Christianity, we are in danger of losing our love for the Lord without having any feeling about it. That is a dangerous situation. If we treasure our position or the blessing on our work more than we treasure the Lord Himself, we will lose our fellowship in love with the Lord. Many famous preachers today have fallen into this trap.</p>
<p>We should not care to be a person who works for the Lord, a person of great renown, or a person whose work is effective; rather, we should care to be a person who loves the Lord. Everything we do in our service, work, and meetings should have the flavor of the loving virgins in Song of Songs 1:3. This flavor indicates a proper condition. A church without this flavor is in the desolate condition of Ephesus. The service of the deacons in the church office should give people a sense of love for Christ. If the deacons give people only the sense that everything is orderly and that the work is carried out diligently and thoroughly, the office is merely a place of business. The office should manifest love; it should be filled with love. The serving ones should cause others to touch the love of Christ, and they should touch the saints&rsquo; love for Christ. Our service should cause others to touch love, and we should have a fresh love for the Lord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
