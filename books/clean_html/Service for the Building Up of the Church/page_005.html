<h2 class="head2">Serving in Love</h2>
<p>We must also serve in love. This love is important and significant. Ephesians 1:4 and 5 say that before the foundation of the world God predestinated us in love to be His sons. Hence, the divine love was in eternity past, before the foundation of the world. This love is God Himself (1 John 4:8), and it is His heart.</p>
<p>In order to participate in the service that builds up the church, we must first touch the authority of the Head, and then we must touch love. This love has also been poured out in the church through the Holy Spirit. In the Body of Christ there is the element of love. When we touch this love, we cannot but love God and the brothers and sisters, our fellow members. Furthermore, when we see the believers in pain or in weakness, we spontaneously feel their pain. Their pain becomes our pain, and their weakness becomes our weakness because we are related to them and cannot be separated (2 Cor. 11:29).</p>
<p>We may not be able to feel the various parts of our body loving one another, but they do. If my finger is cut by a knife, I would feel the pain immediately. If I bruise my foot, my whole body will suffer. Physiologically, you might say that this is a function of the nerves, but spiritually, this is a matter of love.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:26 says that in the church, the Body of Christ, when one member suffers, all the members suffer with it; and when one member is glorified, all the members rejoice with it. This shows a relationship of love. We can have such intimate relationships in the church because we all have the divine love.</p>
<p>The service that builds up the Body comes out of our love of the Body. In order to help others in the church, we do not necessarily need to preach, nor do we need power, but we must have love. Some believers seek the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, but the true experience of the outpouring of the Holy Spirit is to be filled with love. The more we receive God&rsquo;s love, the more we will be filled with the Holy Spirit. Love is the expression of the Holy Spirit (Gal. 5:22). The Holy Spirit in us is a matter of love.</p>
<p>The divine love motivates and empowers us for our service. We need such love in order to preach the gospel with power. We need to love the souls of sinners so that we would weep within when we see one who is not saved. Then our gospel preaching will be powerful. Similarly, we help the saints because we love them; we should feel sad when we do not pray for them and be bothered when we do not care for them. The care and service that issue from this love will be powerful, effective, and long lasting. The service of some of the believers in the church is not long lasting, because they lack the love of God.</p>
<p>We must not merely talk about serving in coordination. Without love, there is no service, and all our activities will be empty and rigid. True and living service comes out of love. The serving power, the helping power, and the edifying power are in this love. Thus, the Lord Jesus commanded His disciples to love one another (John 15:12). Without loving one another, we cannot bear fruit (v. 16). The Lord also said that by this love men will know that we are His disciples (13:34-35). If the saints would love one another, the world will believe that Christ was sent by God (17:21).Of the seven churches in Asia, only the church in Philadelphia was approved by the Lord (Rev. 3:7-13). The word <em>Philadelphia</em> is composed of two Greek words, one based on <em>phileo,</em> which means &ldquo;love,&rdquo; and the other on <em>adelphos,</em> which means &ldquo;brother.&rdquo; Therefore, <em>Philadelphia</em> means &ldquo;brotherly love.&rdquo; The church in Philadelphia was full of brotherly love and was therefore approved by the Lord.</p>
<p>We need to see the authority of the Head, and we must have the love of the Body in order to build up the church. If we do not have the love of God, we will have problems. We often say that the Lord is taking the way of recovery in the church. However, if we do not have love among us, our work of recovery is empty and without spiritual value.</p>
<p>We should pray for the Lord to have mercy on us so that we would not only have the authority of the Head but also love the Body. Then we will hold to truth in love and grow up into Christ the Head in all things. This will cause the growth of the Lord&rsquo;s Body unto the building up of itself in love.</p>
