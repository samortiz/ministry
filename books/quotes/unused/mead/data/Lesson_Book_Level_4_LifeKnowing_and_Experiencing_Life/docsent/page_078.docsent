   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>PRAYING TO CONTACT, TO ENJOY, AND TO FELLOWSHIP WITH GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Praying will make our spirit strong because through prayer we contact God, we enjoy God, and we have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The real significance of prayer is to contact God in our spirit and to absorb God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Prayer is the contact of the human spirit with the Spirit of God, during which man inhales God into himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, the emphasis of prayer lies not in asking God for things but in contacting and absorbing God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>First Thessalonians 5:17 says, "Unceasingly pray.''</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Prayer is like breathing heavenly air.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When a man stops breathing, he dies physically.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, when we stop breathing the spiritual air, our spirit becomes deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We need to breathe the Spirit to keep our spirit alive and healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Calling is a form of short prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should always mingle our prayer with calling.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Most of the time we prefer to talk or do something else rather than pray; therefore, our spirit is usually not so strong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We need to pray to contact our living God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because He is living and He is the life-giving Spirit, whenever we pray we receive life and our spirit is strengthened from within.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This will dispel any feeling of death in us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we feel dark, depressed, oppressed, and confused, we need to pray.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sometimes, while we are praying to enjoy the Lord, He may expose our past sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We must confess these sins to maintain our fellowship with Him 1 John 1:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, we must pray all the time to live the proper Christian life, to experience the divine, eternal, and indestructible life in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now is a good time to pray for five minutes to enjoy the Lord and to absorb God into our being.</S>

   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>PRAYING TO EXERCISE GOD'S AUTHORITY FOR GOD'S ETERNAL PURPOSE</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our prayer to contact God, to enjoy God, and to fellowship with God will issue in prayers for God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As you are enjoying God in prayer, the Lord may remind you that a friend of yours is still not saved and his eternal destiny is the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You should pray for his salvation by asking the Lord to prepare his heart to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You also may pray that the Lord will bind the enemy so that your friend may be freed to receive God's salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After your prayer, you need to go and preach the gospel to him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You need to continue to pray for him on the way to visit him and while you are preaching to him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If he is not open, then pray for him again and go visit him again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is to exercise the authority the Lord gave the church to bind and to loose Matt 18:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Sometimes it is better to pray with your partners in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord likes to answer this type of prayer John 15:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Many of us may have experience concerning this type of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We still need more practice.</S>
