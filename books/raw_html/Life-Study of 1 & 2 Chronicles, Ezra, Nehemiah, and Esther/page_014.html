<h2 class="head2">C. The Divisions of the Services of the Levites</h2>
<p>David also arranged the divisions of the services of the Levites (23:2-32; 24:20&mdash;26:32).</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. The Services of the Descendants<br />
of the Three Sons of Levi</h2>
<p>The services of the descendants of the three sons of Levi&mdash; Gershon, Kohath, and Merari&mdash;are described in 23:2-23. The total number of the Levites was thirty-eight thousand males from thirty years old and upward (vv. 2-3). Of these, twenty-four thousand were to oversee the work of the house of Jehovah; six thousand were to be officers and judges; four thousand were to be gatekeepers; and four thousand were to praise Jehovah with the instruments made by David (vv. 4-5). The genealogies of Gershon, Kohath, and Merari are given in verses 6 through 23.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. All the Serving Levites<br />
Serving alongside the Priests</h2>
<p>All the serving Levites from twenty years old and upward were to serve alongside the priests to take care of all the business affairs for the temple of God (vv. 24-32). In today&rsquo;s church life some of the younger ones should bear some service for the older ones.</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. The Rest of the Levites<br />
Casting Lots for Their Duty</h2>
<p>The rest of the Levites, both old and young, cast lots for their duty even as their brothers the sons of Aaron (24:20-31). This is a further indication that every serving one had to be in the proper order.</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. David and the Leaders of the Army<br />
Setting Apart Some of the Sons<br />
of Asaph, Heman, and Jeduthun</h2>
<p>David and the leaders of the army set apart some of the sons of Asaph, Heman (a descendant of the great rebel Korah&mdash;Num. 16&mdash;and a grandson of Samuel&mdash;1 Chron. 6:33), and Jeduthun, appointed by King David as the leaders, to prophesy (to sing) with lyres, harps, and cymbals, and divided them into twenty-four divisions (ch. 25). To sing praises to God was the main part of Israel&rsquo;s worship to God (cf. Eph. 5:19). Today we need to have more singing of praises to God.</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. The Doorkeepers<br />
Being Divided into Divisions</h2>
<p>The doorkeepers, some of whom were the descendants of Korah the great rebel, were divided into divisions to keep the gates of the temple on the east, north, south, and west, and the gate of the storehouse (1 Chron. 26:1-19).</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Of the Levites, Some Being Assigned<br />
to Keep the Treasures of the House of God</h2>
<p>Of the Levites, some were assigned to keep the treasures of the house of God and the treasures of the dedicated gifts dedicated by David the king and the heads and the captains out of the spoil won in battles, for the repair of the house of Jehovah, and all that Samuel, Saul, Abner, and Joab had dedicated (vv. 20-28). This shows that whereas David prepared the materials for the building of the temple, others gained spoil through their victory over the enemies and then offered this spoil to God for the maintenance of the house of God. This can be compared to the situation with the church today. In a sense the church has already been built by Christ through His apostles, and now we are simply maintaining, or repairing, what has been built.</p>
<h2 class="head3">7. Of the Levites, Some Being Appointed<br />
to Outward Duties</h2>
<p>Of the Levites, some were appointed to the outward duties over Israel, as officers and judges (vv. 29-32).</p>
<h2 class="head3">8. David&rsquo;s Arrangement<br />
Typifying the Spirit&rsquo;s Arrangement</h2>
<p>David&rsquo;s arrangement in order of Israel&rsquo;s services to God related to the temple of God typifies the Spirit&rsquo;s arrangement in order of the church services in the New Testament (1 Cor. 12:4-11; 14:40).</p>
