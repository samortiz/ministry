<H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(3) Pouring Oil upon the Pillar</H2><P>As we have pointed out in chapter twenty-eight, pouring oil upon the pillar signifies the outpouring of the Spirit of God upon God's chosen people for the building of God's house. But here the pouring of the oil upon the pillar follows the pouring out of the drink offering upon the pillar. This indicates that our pouring ourselves out as a drink offering to God brings in the outpouring of the Spirit of God for His building. The more we pour out ourselves with Christ as an offering to God for His house, the more the outpouring of the Spirit of God will be brought in. The building of God's house needs this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>(4) Calling the Place Bethel</H2><P>Verse 15 says, "And Jacob called the name of the place where God spake with him, Beth-el." In Genesis 28 Jacob called the place Bethel, but in Genesis 35, being convinced that it was Bethel, he again called that place by this name. The longer we remain in the church and the more we experience Christ in the church, the more we shall be assured that this is Bethel, and the more bold we shall be to say, "This is the church and I am in it." This is not simply a term, much less a designation or a denomination; it is our conviction and our declaration of the fact. We are fully assured that this is Bethel. Praise the Lord that we all can say, "I am now in Bethel. This is the church."</P>
