These crucial truths, originally presented as forty-two topics, were studied by Witness Lee with the brothers and sisters in Chefoo
They lay a foundation in the various aspects of fundamental biblical truths for believers who are clear about their salvation
The notes on these crucial truths contain much light that is precious and urgently needed by the children of God
We believe this will enable them not only to receive a foundation in the Word of God but also to receive manifold help in knowing the Bible
At the beginning of the New Testament age, the first thing God did was to send John the Baptist to proclaim baptism
Although He was the Son of God who came to be our Savior, He still kept God's ordination for men because He was a man
The Pharisees and the lawyers rejected the counsel of God for themselves since they had not been baptized by him'
The Pharisees and lawyers who rejected and opposed the Lord Jesus did this how can we who receive the Lord today be like them in this matter
John the Baptist was not the only one who came out to preach and baptize people; the Lord Jesus also baptized people when He began to preach
Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit'
To merely preach the gospel to people without baptizing them is not sufficient and does not completely keep the Lord's last command
The Lord says that baptism is a necessary step in a person's full salvation, proving that baptism is important
On the day of Pentecost many heard Peter's word and were pricked in their hearts, so they asked Peter what they should do
He was not like today's preachers who mostly emphasize repentance and believing on the name of the Lord but neglect baptism
According to this principle, the baptism of the first group of people who believed is a pattern for all subsequent believers
If he had not preached baptism, how could a Gentile, who was from a faraway place and had never heard the gospel, know about baptism?
Philip was carried away by the Holy Spirit only after he had baptized the eunuch and the eunuch had come up out of the water
He waited until after Philip had baptized the eunuch before He acknowledged Philip's work as complete by carrying him away
If baptism is not important, and if the disciples did not emphasize baptism, why did Ananias hasten Paul to be baptized?
Can anyone forbid the water so that these would not be baptized, who have received the Holy Spirit even as we?
He did not do what many today advocate when they speak of only needing a spiritual baptism, not a water baptism
When the Philippian jailer and his household received the Lord, Paul and Silas, still wounded from being beaten, immediately baptized them
Paul did not merely find out with what baptism they had been baptized, but he also told them with what baptism they should be baptized
Although they had received the baptism of John, they were immediately baptized again when they heard about baptism into the Lord's name
The Bible solemnly, definitely, and clearly says that baptism is related to salvation and that the relationship is a direct one
Our Lord said that in order to be regenerated into the kingdom of God, one must be born not only of the Spirit but also of water
Baptism causes a person to enter into the kingdom of God; it is a requirement for one's entrance into the kingdom of God
Baptism, repentance, and believing on the Lord's name are also related to receiving the Holy Spirit and are requirements for receiving Him
He who believes and is baptized shall be saved'; 'Which water, as the antitype, also now saves you, that is, baptism
According to the Lord's word, if a person wants to be saved, he needs to believe and he also needs to be baptized
Many change the Lords word which says He who believes and is baptized shall be saved into he who believes and is saved shall be baptized
There are different parts to the Lord's salvation; some parts are obtained by our faith and some are participated in through our baptism
If we want to participate in all aspects of the Lord's salvation, if we want to be fully saved, we must believe and be baptized
Just as we believe into Christ, so also we are baptized into Christ; both cause us to enter into Christ and to be joined to Him
Just as we are joined to Christ through believing to partake of Him, so we are joined to Him through baptism to partake of Him
Buried therefore with Him through baptism into His death Buried together with Him in baptism in which also you were raised together with Him
We, who are baptized into Christ, enter into His death, are buried with Him, and are raised with Him, being completely joined to Him
Only a person who is buried can completely leave the world; the world leaves no shadow or trace on a buried one
Our sins are forgiven in Him because of His redemption, and we are justified in Him because of His resurrection
Baptism gives us a good conscience through our entering into Christ and our entering into His death, burial, and resurrection
Baptism is not a ceremony or ritual for becoming a church member; rather, it is a practical procedure, a definite step in faith
Baptizo is the Greek word used here and in other places in the New Testament; it means 'to dip in or under, to immerse, or to sink'
People can explain the clear meaning of the word differently, but the pattern of the example eliminates differing human views
The flood caused the people in the ark to be separated from the old world in which they had lived freeing them from their corrupt generation
All our fathers were under the cloud, and all passed through the sea; and all were baptized unto Moses in the cloud and in the sea'
The second event in the Old Testament that God used to typify baptism is the Israelites' crossing of the Red Sea
They crossed the Red Sea in the cloud and in the sea, signifying that our baptism should be in the Holy Spirit and in water
Baptism frees us from Satan and the world just as crossing the Red Sea freed the Israelites from Pharaoh and Egypt
The Red Sea is a type of our being saved through water and escaping the world and its power to enter into a new realm
Those who have not believed are absolutely not qualified to be baptized; only those who believe can be baptized
That they believed in the name of the Lord means they believed in the Lord Himself and received the Lord Himself
As soon as he believes in this way he can be baptized he does not need to wait until he understands many doctrines or wait for anything else
The saved criminal on the cross is an example of a believer who died without being baptized; his case is an example and proof of this point
Of course, among the disciples there were apostles, but they did not baptize in their office as apostles but in their position as disciples
Baptism is not based on one's office in the church; rather, any saved believer can baptize someone in his status as a believer
Of course, anyone baptizing another person should carefully consider all sides of the matter and seek the Lord's leading
The Lord's command to preach the gospel to the nations and to baptize the nations was given to the disciples, not to the apostles
When the Lord chose Paul to be an apostle, He did not send an apostle to baptize him; He sent a disciple named Ananias
Of course, this is speaking in principle; we must follow the Lord's leading for the details, just as Ananias did
Philip was not an apostle but an evangelist , yet he not only preached the gospel to the Ethiopian eunuch but also baptized him
Some who serve the Lord baptize many people, but this is not appropriate or according to the pattern left by the apostles
Some, however, based upon 1 Corinthians 1:17, only preach the gospel and never baptize others; this is not right either
When it was necessary, he baptized people; however, in places where there were brothers, he did not baptize many
There is no passage in the Bible which says that a person waited a long time between believing in the Lord and being baptized
The acts of believing and being baptized should be close together; they should not be separated by a long period of time
In a normal situation, the beginning step in receiving the Lord's salvation is to believe, and the completing step is to be baptized
It is no wonder that among us some say that baptism is only a representation of our death, burial, and resurrection together with the Lord
When a person believes and is immediately baptized, his baptism puts him into the Lord's death, burial, and resurrection
The Philippian jailer and his household believed in the Lord in the middle of the night and were immediately baptized in that very hour
To be baptized in the middle of the night is extremely inconvenient, so they should at least wait for daylight
The way that baptism often is practiced today does not benefit a person's spiritual life in the way that an immediate baptism would
Ananias spoke these words to Saul, who had been enlightened by the Lord and had believed in Him on the road to Damascus
Saul had only believed in the Lord for three days without being baptized , but the Holy Spirit rebuked him for delaying
Since the Lord wants people to be baptized immediately after believing, there should not be even one moment's delay
If we lack these two things, we are only imitating the black and white letters of the Bible and do not have the spiritual reality
John also was baptizing in Aenon near Salim, because there was much water there; and people came and were baptized'
When John baptized people, he must have put them into the water, so there was a need for a place with much water
When they learned this, they immediately corrected the problem and were baptized into the name of the Lord Jesus
According to the pattern recorded in the Bible, if a person is not baptized properly, his baptism can be corrected
In those days the baptism of repentance had ceased and was inadequate, so anyone baptized in that way needed a correction
When it is corrected, it should be carried out by faith in order to receive all the spiritual realities of baptism
The Holy Spirit speaks here of six foundational teachings: repentance, faith, baptisms, the laying on of hands, resurrection, and judgment
These are divided into three pairs first repentance and faith second baptisms and the laying on of hands and third resurrection and judgment
The first teaching in each pair emphasizes escape on the negative side, and the second teaching emphasizes entrance on the positive side
Resurrection enables us to be delivered from death and the realm of death, and judgment enables us to enter into a new world
In the Bible there are two important meanings related to the laying on of hands, which show that it exceeds the status of a rite or ritual
The redeemed one must be joined to the Substitute, or Redeemer, in order to be redeemed and for the redemption to be effective
If a sinner wanted to put his sins onto a sacrifice in order for them to be expiated, he had to join himself to the sacrifice
Consequently, the person offering a sin offering had to place his hand on the head of the sacrifice in order to be joined to the sacrifice
The one presenting a burnt offering had to be joined to the animal being sacrificed for him in order to be acceptable to God
Fellowship is similar to a battery that gives some of its electricity to a loudspeaker through its connection to it
Because there was no one to baptize him when he believed, Saul of Tarsus first received the laying on of hands and then was baptized
The laying on of hands is also for receiving one who has been baptized into Christ in order to bring him into the church, the Body of Christ
Later, when the apostles laid hands on them, it seems as if they merely received the Holy Spirit, but there is a deeper implication as well
The anointing on the Body, which is the Holy Spirit, flows to the ones brought in through the laying on of hands
Baptism stresses individual salvation, and the laying on of hands stresses the building up of the Body of Christ
If we have only baptism without the laying on of hands, we will pay attention only to individual salvation but neglect the Body of Christ
We should not only lead people to believe and be baptized into Christ but also lay hands on them to receive them into the Body of Christ
We must pay attention to getting many people saved, and we must also pay attention to building up the Body of Christ
The Ephesian believers, like the Samaritans, did not receive the Holy Spirit until the apostle laid his hands upon them
These representatives of the Body of Christ were living in the Body and had the Holy Spirit, who is on the Body, on themselves
Simultaneously they were joined to them participating in their service and bearing the responsibility for this ministry with them in spirit
The fifth kind of laying on of hands is the laying on of hands to send some out for the work so it is the laying on of hands for sending out
The three who laid their hands on the two indicated that they were one with the two as they went out to do the work for God
Although the three could not go out with them physically, they went with them in spirit through the laying on of hands
The entire church, through its representatives, lays its hands on those going out in order to be joined to them and to go out with them
The sixth kind of laying on of hands is for blessing, which causes people to be blessed through the laying on of hands
There is yet another kind of laying on of hands, which causes people to be healed, so it is the laying on of hands for healing
When we lay hands on people, we must be cautious and not act too quickly lest we participate in the sins of others
He did not even require the churches to keep the ordinance of circumcision which was established by God in the Old Testament
The way the high priest and the other priests approached God was absolutely the opposite of what Paul teaches concerning head covering
Some say that Paul's teaching concerning head covering was only for the church in Corinth because there was some confusion among them
According to the apostle, the early churches of God did not have contentions concerning the teaching of head covering
According to God's ordination, a woman, even though she has her own head, should not be the head but should submit to authority
She should cover her head as a confession and declaration that even though she has her own head she is not the head and does not act as head
Head covering declares that she is under authority and confesses and receives another as her head, allowing him to be the head
In 1 Corinthians 11 the apostle clearly says that he taught head covering based on the fact that God is the head
He was the Lord and He had authority, yet He always allowed God to be His head and to cover His head in every matter
Oh, during His life on earth, there was such an expression with Him of God's authority and glory in the headship!
He was not like this only while on earth, but even now He is like this in the heavens, and He will be like this for eternity
On the one hand, God is the head of Christ, and on the other hand, He established Christ as the head of every one of us
He expresses God's authority and glory in God's headship over Him, and we must express Christ's authority and glory in His headship over us
When we submit to the Lord and allow Him to be Head in all things, God is glorified greatly in us, and God's heart is satisfied in us
All of God's work in us is to cause us to be unto the obedience of Christ and to confess and allow Christ to be the head of every man
He also established the man as the head of the woman, and He wants the woman to take the man as her head and to obey the man
God has an arrangement in which He wants two groups, men and women, to portray how He and Christ are the head and how humans should obey
When they act on the stage, there is a sense that they are different in function, but there is no thought of inequality
We have to see that the difference between men and women is a difference only in function; there is no thought of inequality
Simply because our eyes are below the eyebrows and there is a difference in function between them, are they unequal?
Other than acknowledging that this is a great honor, is there any basis for brothers to be proud or to set themselves over others?
Oh, may God show the sisters that their submission can cause people to sense the authority and glory of God and Christ!
In the universe the sisters have this function with respect to God and Christ; it is an extremely glorious matter
God wants men and women to acknowledge this order by having men not cover their head and by having women cover theirs
When the apostle Paul speaks about the teaching of head covering, he uses the headship of God as the first basis
A man ought not to have his head covered, since he is God's image and glory; but the woman is the glory of the man'
Since the manifestation of men and women is different, He differentiates between men and women in the matter of head covering
Man is not out of woman, but woman out of man; for also man was not created for the sake of the woman, but woman for the sake of the man
Although men are born through women, they are only 'through' the woman, not 'out from' the woman as the woman is 'out from' the man
No matter how much people argue, they cannot make women into men, and no matter how the fashion changes, they cannot make men into women
Since God's creation and purpose for men and women are different, the nature and function of men and women are also different
Our practice of head covering glorifies God and, at the same time, shames Satan and the angels who followed him
We would be invisibly overthrowing God's arrangement for us, denying His authority, and making Satan with his angels happy
Our inward human nature tells us that males and females are different; males should bare their heads, and females should hide theirs
Since their natures are different their functions are also different since their functions are different their positions are also different
In the spiritual realm she needs to portray her role in our confession that God is the head and in our submission to His authority
Praying and prophesying are matters that touch the spiritual realm, so when the sisters pray or prophesy, they should cover their heads
The more they pray, or the more thoroughly they pray, the more they will feel that they need to cover their heads
When sisters follow their inward feeling and enter into genuine prayer, they will come to a point at which they must cover their heads
A woman who prays or prophesies with her head uncovered, even if she has long hair, is 'one and the same as' a woman with her head shaved
If a woman does not cover her head, she should cut her hair, but if it is shameful for a woman to cut her hair, she should be covered
When Rebekah and Isaac were going to be married, she immediately covered herself when she saw Isaac; that is, she covered her head
It is a wonderful matter that almost every woman covers her head when she is married, regardless of whether she is cultured or barbaric
Although she and her husband were once two, they are now one flesh, so there cannot be two heads; there can only be one head
If a wedding does not cause a woman to take a man as her head, the spouses will sow bitter seeds and plant a root of disaster
In the first half of 1 Corinthians 11 he teaches head covering, and in the second half he teaches the breaking of bread
When he teaches about head covering, he emphasizes the Head , and when he teaches about the breaking of bread, he emphasized the Body
If we only emphasize the breaking of bread but neglect head covering, we emphasize the Body and neglect the Head
We see people everywhere eating the Lord's supper, breaking the bread, but we rarely see the covering of the head
Authority causes people to receive life, and life gives people authority and causes them to submit to authority
In the Old Testament the Israelites kept the Feast of the Passover to remember how God saved them in Egypt through the Passover lamb
Just as He and His death fulfilled the type of the Passover, His breaking of bread replaced the remembrance of the Passover
Jesus took bread and blessed it and He broke it and gave it to the disciples and said Take eat this is My body Which is given for you
When the Lord established the breaking of bread, He first broke the bread and gave it to His disciples, telling them to take and eat
The Lord broke His body for us and distributed it to us like bread; this means that He gave up His body so that we could receive His life
The Bible shows that God's eternal purpose is to dispense the life in His Son, our Lord Jesus Christ, into people
Through incarnation His life was embodied in the Lord Jesus, and He came to earth so that men could receive His life
The breaking of the bread speaks of this, and we should manifest this to the entire universe each time we break bread
He said that the cup was the new covenant established in His blood, which was being poured out for many for forgiveness of sins
Because the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption for us, all that God is and has have become the portion of our cup in God's salvation
Our sins constituted us as sin and sons of wrath before God and kept us far away from Him; we lost God and all that He is and has
In this new covenant, God must forgive our sins and dispense Himself and all that He is and has to us because of the blood of Jesus
The cup not only symbolizes the new covenant established for us by the Lord's blood but also the blood that He shed for us
The cup is the new covenant established by His blood, and it is also the blood He used to establish this covenant
Other meetings, which have prayer, messages, exhortation, and testimonies as their center, are for us to obtain something
In contrast, our remembrance of the Lord is the center of the bread-breaking meeting, and it is for the Lord to obtain something
As we drink the cup, we should consider how the grapes went through the process of being crushed in order for their juice to flow out
When people in the world remember someone, they can only think about a person, including his kindness, good deeds, and notable achievements
During the bread-breaking meeting our hearts remember the Lord, our spirits enjoy the Lord, and our eyes should look upon His death
With respect to our remembrance, He is not visibly with us; with respect to our expectation, He will visibly come again to be with us
When we break bread, we can touch His inward, invisible presence, but we hope even more for His outward, visible presence
In this aspect, we remember the Lord by eating the bread and drinking the cup, we display His death, and we await His coming
The second aspect of bread breaking is to partake of the Lord's table and to have fellowship with all the saints
When we partake of the Lord's table together with all the saints, we receive the Lord's body and blood, and through them we have fellowship
In this aspect the Lord's body and blood become our enjoyment with all the saints, and they are our fellowship with all the saints
When we break bread, we eat the Lord's supper on the one hand, and we partake of the Lord's table on the other hand
The Lord's supper is our remembrance of the Lord; it is a matter between the Lord and us, and it speaks of the love between the Lord and us
He gives the bread and the cup to us; that is, He gives us His body and His blood, which means He gives Himself to us in fellowship
Even though He is God, He has the human life and nature; even though we are men, we have God's divine life and nature
In this same life and nature, we and He, He and we, can have fellowship and intimate communication with each other
We fellowship with Him through His body and His blood, and in this fellowship with Him, we enjoy His body and blood
We have fellowship with the Lord when we enjoy the Lord's blood and body by drinking the cup and eating the bread
We do not drink the cup and eat the bread individually, and we do not enjoy the Lord's blood and body by ourselves
The cup that we drink testifies that we are worthy to be joined to Him because His blood was poured out to expunge our sins
He is the grain of wheat who produced many grains through death and resurrection to form the many grains into one loaf which is the one Body
All the saved ones, whether in the past, in the present, or in the future, are in this one bread, and all partake of this one bread
The bread that we break signifies not only the Lord's own body but all the saints in every time and every place
Although we are all in different times and different places when we break the bread, we all still break this one bread
Some bread-breaking meetings were not for the better but for the worse because divisions existed among those attending the meeting
Every time we attend a meeting to break bread, we must discern its ground to determine whether it is a meeting in division or in oneness
We must discern whether the meeting has a divisive element or a sectarian factor lest we come together for the worse and suffer a loss
The bread broken in the Lord's supper symbolizes the entire Body of Christ and testifies to the oneness of the Body of Christ, the church
It is no wonder that through the apostle the Holy Spirit declares that this kind of bread breaking is not the Lord's supper
Another reason that some bread breaking is not the Lord's supper is that some mix this matter with their own supper and make it common
In doing this, they confused the special characteristic of the Lord's supper and lost the significance of bread breaking
We cannot eat the Lord's supper as if it were an ordinary meal or consider the breaking of bread to be a common thing
Whoever eats the bread or drinks the cup of the Lord in an unworthy manner will be guilty of the body and of the blood of the Lord'
To prove is to examine the bread to see whether it is a bread of division, of a sectarian nature, or with a divisive element
To discern is to test the bread to see whether it refers both to the Lord's body given for us and to His mystical Body
If we are not in such a clear condition, we are guilty of the body of the Lord and of His blood, and we eat and drink judgment to ourselves
Since some did not eat the bread and drink the cup in an approved manner, the Lord caused them to become physically weak as a warning
In the four Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and John all tell us that Judas, who betrayed the Lord, left before the Lord established His supper
How could the Lord require one to remember Him who had not received Him as Savior who did not have a relationship with Him in His salvation
The believers are those who have received the Lord's salvation through faith, partake of His life, and belong to Him
The early believers continued steadfastly in breaking bread to such an extent that they broke bread day by day
Since breaking bread is to eat the Lord's supper, it is best that it is held in the evening in order to fit the name
You cannot drink the Lord's cup and the demons' cup; you cannot partake of the Lord's table and of the demons' table'
After partaking of the Lord's table, we cannot partake of the demons' table; after drinking the Lord's cup, we cannot drink the demons' cup
According to the preceding verses, the demons' table and the demons' cup refer to the things sacrificed to idols
When we break bread, we fellowship with the Lord, just as when Gentiles worship idols, they fellowship with the demons
After we fellowship with the Lord, how can we return to partake of something related to fellowship with demons?
Since we have enjoyed the Lord Himself and all that He is and has at His table, how can we go back to desire worldly pleasures?
Let us keep the feast not with old leaven neither with the leaven of malice and evil but with the unleavened bread of sincerity and truth
We should truly be those who keep the Feast of Unleavened Bread so that we can be those who are entirely according to the breaking of bread
When we receive the Son of God as our Savior, we have the Son of God, and we also have the life because this life is in the Son of God
With this life we do not need to seek outward light because we have a marvelous light within us, which is the Lord as the glorious life
Since we did not have the Lord's life and our inner being was dark, we even felt happy about losing our temper
With the light of life now shining in us, we do not feel happy when we lose our temper; instead, we feel uncomfortable
They are worthless because a dead tree no longer has the power of life to carry out the requirements of our commandments
The life that God puts into a tree has a law for sprouting branches, growing leaves, bearing flowers, and producing fruit
The law of life within us spontaneously prevents us from committing adultery, stealing, lying, or doing things that are not pleasing to Him
God does not need to command us outwardly because the laws in His life cause us to know Him and His ordinances inwardly
These are laws involving spontaneous powers and functions; they do not require an effort of our will or our strength to activate them
Bearing fruit is included in the law of the life of a fruit tree; it is a spontaneous power of life in fruit trees
Perfect you in every good work for the doing of His will, doing in us that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ'
God is operating in us, doing that which is well pleasing in His sight through Jesus Christ, causing us to carry out His will
These senses are anointed into them by the teaching of the anointing, which causes them to know the Lord's will and the Lord's desire
The preceding six items all refer to matters related to God's life within us, and they speak of how God lives in us according to His life
Since the light of life is the enlightening of the Lord's life within us, this enlightening causes us to have an inward sense of life
Our sense that a certain matter does not please the Lord is also our inward seeing that this matter does not please the Lord
When the digestion in our stomach is normal we do not have much sense of it but when something upsets our stomach we have a strong feeling
When we disobey God, we disobey the sense of life in our actions, and the sense of life within us becomes especially strong
When we come to the meetings, we are following the sense of life, so we may not have much feeling related to it
If we would be willing to quiet ourselves, God's operation within us would arise in our sensation, and we would feel God operating within us
With respect to God, His operation in us is a kind of work, and with respect to us, it produces a sense of life in us
Because this sense comes from the activity of His life within us, it must belong to life and should be considered as a sense of life
The teaching of the anointing is the Holy Spirit speaking within us; it is the inward light of the revelation of the Holy Spirit
Since this operation is the moving of the Holy Spirit within our spirit, we certainly have a sense of life in our spirit
Our first responsibility with regard to the sense of life is to walk according to the spirit and to set our mind on the spirit in all things
Regardless of the matter, as soon as we have an inner sense of life related to it, we should obey the sense of life immediately
The Gentiles have a conscience that is defiled and on the brink of death; they are darkened in their understanding
The precious blood has cleansed our conscience, and because we are regenerated, our conscience has been revived
We have the life of God and the Spirit of God in our spirit strengthening the feelings within us that are of life and consistent with light
We have a living, keen, rich, proper, strong, and powerful feeling that enables us to sense whether or not any matter is pleasing to God
When we sense God's operation in us, whether it is His willing or His working, we should obey with fear and trembling
Although our sense of life sometimes becomes dull because we ignore or disobey it, it never dies out entirely or disappears completely
If a believer continues to obey everything that he feels, his sense of life will become even stronger and keener
Obeying the sense of life is the only way for our life to be nourished and for our hearts and spirits to obtain rest
If we desire this, we must act according to the anointing within, and we must obey the sense of life from the Holy Spirit
When we obey the sense of life, we spontaneously obey the will of God and do that which is well pleasing to Him
Obeying the will of God and accomplishing His good pleasure are also certain results of obeying the sense of life
Every spiritual matter between God and us is entered into properly and carried out through this one matter-obeying the sense of life
Living in the fellowship of life, like obeying the sense of life, is a very important and practical matter in the Christian life
That you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ'
Since both the nature and content of this fellowship belong to God's life, it is called the fellowship of life
In it we can share our innermost feelings and are mingled into one with God, the Lord, and all those who have the life of God
The life of God is the highest life, so it has the greatest capacity to fellowship and the deepest need for fellowship
When the life of God comes into us, it spontaneously causes us to have fellowship with those who have the life of God
When we meet a brother or sister in the Lord, there is an inward response and fellowship if there are no barriers in us
If we have fellowship in God's life with the children of God, we feel inwardly satisfied, comfortable, proper, and natural
If we respond to the requirement of God's life in us, we will live in God's life; that is, we will live in the fellowship of God's life
At the time of Pentecost everyone who heard and believed continued in the fellowship of the apostles after being baptized
They share a common fellowship in the one life of the Lord and should continue to have fellowship in the unchanging life of the Lord
That you also may have fellowship with us, and indeed our fellowship is with the Father and with His Son Jesus Christ'
If the light breaks its fellowship with the electric power plant, its fellowship with the other lights in the city is also broken
Even though two believers have the Lord's life, they will not have the fellowship of life if either breaks his fellowship with the Lord
We have the Lord's life in us, and this life causes us to have fellowship with the Lord and to have fellowship with one another
Our fellowship in the Lord's life is through the Holy Spirit; therefore, it is also called the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
Since the fellowship of life is in and through the Holy Spirit, it comes out of the Holy Spirit's operation in us
To abide in the Lord means to not have any barriers between the Lord and us, which is just to fellowship with the Lord
As the branch cannot bear fruit of itself unless it abides in the vine, so neither can you unless you abide in Me
If we want to continue in the fellowship of the Lord's life, we must abide in the Lord, according to the teaching of the anointing
We must live and walk in the Lord's light in order to maintain the fellowship of life with the Lord and the saints
Once we see our sins, that is, once we are conscious of them in the fellowship of the light of life, we must confess our sins to God
If we walk in the light as He is in the light we have fellowship with one another and the blood of Jesus His Son cleanses us from every sin
If our confession lacks the conviction that comes from the Lord's light, we will not receive the cleansing of the Lord's blood
If we want to receive the cleansing of the Lords blood we must be enlightened by the Lords light of life in the fellowship of the Lords life
If we sin after we are saved, those sins must be confessed to God in order for us to be cleansed by the Lord's blood
The sins that we commit after we are saved are cleansed away by the Lord's blood through the fellowship of life
If we live in the fellowship of the Lord's life, we abide in the Lord, and when we abide in the Lord, we have the Lord abiding in us
When a branch abides in the vine without any barriers between itself and the vine, it receives a rich supply of sap and bears much fruit
Similarly, when we abide in the Lord and fellowship with Him, we receive the supply of His life and bear much fruit
According to the Lord's promise, if we abide in Him and His words abide in us, whatever we ask will be done for us
When we abide in Him, we know His heart's desire and purpose and can pray according to His heart's desire and purpose
Since our asking will be according to the Lord's heart's desire and one with His purpose, the Lord will accomplish it
The life relationship between a child and his mother can never be broken, but it is very easy for their fellowship to be broken
Normally when he obeys his mother he is happy to see her but when his mother returns he will run away from her if he has eaten some candy
When she comes into the living room, he will run into the kitchen, and when she comes into the kitchen, he will run into the living room
As soon as we stop living in the Lord's light, being disobedient or sinful, our fellowship in the Lord's life is broken
We will not be able to fellowship with the Lord, and we will not want to fellowship with the brothers and sisters
If we confess our sins, He is faithful and righteous to forgive us our sins and cleanse us from all unrighteousness'
As soon as we confess our sins to God, He immediately forgives and cleanses us so that our conscience has peace and does not condemn us
The fellowship of life is maintained in the sense of life, so once we neglect the sense of life, the fellowship of life is broken and lost
The fellowship of life is maintained through the sense of life, and the sense of life is sharpened by the fellowship of life
If one does not abide in Me he is cast out as a branch and is dried up and they gather them and cast them into the fire and they are burned
It says that we will lose the function of life and not be able to bear fruit to glorify God if we do not fellowship with the Lord
Abide in Him, so that if He is manifested, we may have boldness and not be put to shame from Him at His coming'
If we abide in the Lord and fellowship with Him, we most certainly will walk before the Lord and live in His heart's desire
The Holy Spirit within often begs us through the compassions of God, through God's love, to consecrate ourselves to God
The Lord's love caused Peter to follow the Lord for his whole life until he was martyred for the Lord and glorified God by his death
Through His Spirit with His compassions, God's requirement in love for each of us is that we would present our bodies to Him
Without consecration, we are ungrateful with respect to His salvation and we are also negligent with respect to His legal rights over us
None of us lives to himself, and none dies to himself; for whether we live, we live to the Lord, and whether we die, we die to the Lord
Only those who are consecrated, who do not care about life or death, can glorify the Lord in their life or their death
Consecration is the proper expression of love for the Lord, and it is also the highest expression of love for the Lord
God said to the children of Israel Bring the whole tithe to the storehouseto offer up what should be consecratedand prove Me if you will
God meant that we could use our consecration to test Him, to prove how He will bless us because of our consecration
Throughout the ages many lovers of the Lord have tested and proven that God's blessing is practical and rich through their consecration
Many like this name, but we must realize that the reality of this name is revealed on the mountain of consecration
When the man begged him for help, he had only one coin in his pocket, which he was planning to use for food the next day
If only there was a way to give half of the coin's value to him while keeping the other half to buy food, but this is not possible'
The man continued to beg for help, and at the same time the Holy Spirit spoke within him to give the coin to the poor man
The next morning he received a packet containing a pair of gloves wrapped in a sheet of blank paper, and there was a coin in the gloves
Through this he enjoyed God's special provision; he later made Jehovah-jireh the motto for the China Inland Mission
If we honor God with our consecration, God will cause us to be 'filled with plenty' and to 'burst open' with blessings
We do not count how much we gain in order to see how much we can spend; we count how much we have given out to measure our gain
A person who is not consecrated cannot see Gods riches but praise the Lord a truly consecrated person cannot help but express Gods riches
Although he is not as rich as many worldly people, he is always a channel of transmission flowing out God's riches and enriching many
We often think that consecration is giving something to God but according to the apostles word consecration is the grace of God given to us
The churches in Macedonia gave themselves first to the Lord and then offered up everything that they had according to God's will
Christianity has misrepresented God in the matter of consecration, placing more emphasis on money than on the person
We must first offer ourselves to the Lord and let the Lord gain us before our things will be acceptable to Him
In our standing in resurrection, we should present ourselves to God so that God can gain us in His resurrected new creation
George Muller once stayed in a brother's home, and he noticed that this brother rose up very early every morning to touch the Lord
If a person truly loves the Lord, he must love Him to such an extent that he puts forth everything for the Lord
Each one as he has purposed in his heart, not out of sorrow or out of necessity, for God loves a cheerful giver'
It means that, according to the Lord's purpose and arrangement, we testify of the Lord and glorify Him in all that we do
Although he may not be able to give a message he will be able to live the Lord so that others can see the Lord in him and sense His presence
Today, however, we present our bodies to God as living sacrifices so that they may be used by God and work for God
Once we present ourselves to God as a living sacrifice, we should act according to God rather than our own ideas
According to the context of Romans 12:1, this refers to our coordination in the service of the Body of Christ, the church
We are His masterpiece, created in Christ Jesus for good works, which God prepared beforehand in order that we would walk in them'
If we consecrate ourselves to the Lord from our heart, if we are turned toward the Lord, we will obtain His enlightening
After repenting, he should go to his wife and confess his wrongdoing in arguing and his sin of fighting with her
The children of Israel kept the Feast of Unleavened Bread for seven days, which represents a complete period of time
From the time that we are saved until we meet the Lord, we must purge out any leaven and live an unleavened life
We must purge out every evil action and deal with every unclean thing so that we may become and continue to be a new lump of dough
If we want to richly taste the Lord's joy of salvation, we must come before the Lord and thoroughly confess our sins
If we also want to have spiritual hunger, thirst, pursuit, and growth, we must come before God and confess our sins one by one
When we confess our sins to God in this way, we cannot be general; we cannot confess, in principle only, that we have sinned greatly
We must open the bag of sins before God and mention each sin; we must open the bag and thoroughly confess each sin one by one
We must ask God to search us, enlighten us, and expose all our sins so that we might see them and confess them to Him one by one
When we pray to God in this way, He will enlighten us through the Holy Spirit and expose our previous sins one by one
He who covers his transgressions will not prosper, / But whoever confesses and forsakes them will obtain mercy'
If we sin against and offend our neighbor, we need not only the forgiveness of God but also that of our neighbor
Otherwise, even with God's forgiveness, we will still be condemned before our neighbor and our heart will be bound
If we want to be released and forgiven by our neighbor so that we can act freely before him, we must confess our sin to him
As children of God, we should completely confess our sins before God and completely deal with our sins before man
Later he realized that confessing sins to others not only enables a Christian to grow but is also a basic requirement for Christian growth
Oh, brothers and sisters, a Christian who has never confessed sins to others is almost certainly a Christian who has never grown in life!
If we want to know whether or not we have grown, we need only to look at whether or not we have confessed our sins to others
Confessing sins to others not only causes us to grow, but our growth requires and causes us to confess our sins to others
If we want our spirit to be released and strong before others, we must confess our sins to man to remove the offense in our conscience
We should not confess an offense to someone whom we have not offended, because it makes them aware of our sin unnecessarily
If our confessing instead causes someone with no knowledge of our sin to gain an impression of it, such a confession is improper
If our confession of sin to others does not glorify God or benefit others, even if it may cause us to receive blessing, we should not do it
Brothers and sisters, whether we owe something to the government or to individual persons, we should restore it all
Although this has no relationship to our salvation, it is very much related to our spiritual life following our salvation
Everything gained by unrighteous, improper means is like an unremoved corpse; it hinders us from living a comfortable spiritual life
Without warning, he pointed to the audience and said, 'Look, here is a young man who stole three pounds eighteen shillings from his master
If we owe restitution for unrighteous things to a person who has died, we must make restitution to the relatives
He removed the foreign altars and the high places and smashed the pillars and hewed down the Asherahs'; 'Purge
Those who were saved brought many demonic and filthy things to the meeting place and burned them in front of everyone
Regrettably, many brothers and sisters still have evil things and keep evil things on their person and in their homes
If we truly turn to God and desire to please Him, we must eliminate every evil and unrighteous thing from our person and homes
In chapter 21 we saw that the anointing spoken of in 1 John 2:27 refers to the moving of the Holy Spirit within us
We can fellowship with the Lord at any time and in any place, and no matter what we are doing, we will sense the teaching of the anointing
The phrases forbidden by the Holy Spirit and the Spirit of Jesus did not allow them are like the two rails of a railroad track
When we follow the two rails of the forbidding and restricting of the Holy Spirit within us, we feel very normal
Brothers and sisters, whenever we feel that something is wrong, we need to be sensitive to the Holy Spirit's forbidding and restricting
The Lord instructs those who come near to Him and teaches them the way that they should go by guiding them with His eye
If we do not walk in God's way with our feet, and instead only use our mind to read God's Word, we will not gain light
A person once opened the Bible and pointed to the words in Matthew 27:5 about Judas, which said, 'He went away and hanged himself'
Once there was a brother in Fukien who did not know whether he should go to Southeast Asia to work for the Lord
God speaks in one way, / Indeed in two ways, without any perceiving it- / In a dream, a night vision, / When deep sleep falls upon men
If God speaks to men in one way indeed in two ways and they still do not perceive God is forced to use dreams and visions to instruct them
Of course, we do acknowledge that the Lord does give dreams and visions to direct and lead us or to comfort and strengthen us when necessary
By looking at a map, we can see that the Holy Spirit wanted him to cross the Aegean Sea and go to Macedonia on the opposite side
If we have a dream or vision and believe it without any discernment or consideration, we can be easily cheated
If we want to be led by the Lord, we must also understand our situation and pay attention to the meaning of its direction
We must consider how to be led by the Lord because it is more important than only knowing about the Lord's leading
If we do not see the Lord's leading, it is because our heart is away from the Lord, and this becomes a veil covering our eyes
If we want God and something other than God, loving both God and the world, our heart will not be single, simple, and pure toward Him
The Lord said If therefore your eye is single your whole body will be full of light but if your eye is evil your whole body will be dark
It is to be afraid of bringing anything of ourselves into the things of Godany element of ourselves our likes our opinions and our choices
If we fear God in this way and reject ourselves, God will instruct us in the way that we should choose, and we will receive His leading
If we fear God, we will be afraid of offending Him, so we will reject ourselves and all that is offensive to God in everything that we do
If we want to abide in the Lord, receive the teaching of the anointing, and gain the Lord's leading, we must be quiet in our spirit
If there is a barrier between Him and us, we cannot see what He is saying with His eye, no matter how close we are
Prayer is needed in order to make it fresh and living so that He can give us His direction and leading each day
When the magi from the east first saw Christs star they obtained a revelation of His birth but they did not know where Christ would be born
In being led by the Lord in various matters, we must absolutely take the Lord's Word-the Bible-as our standard
If it is not according to the Bible it will not be reliable it will lack the Lords light and it will not be something that we should receive
And your ears will hear a word behind you, saying, / This is the way, walk in it, / When you turn to the right or turn to the left'
Similarly, when Abraham was called, the Lord led him only concerning his first step to leave the land of his fathers
We must obey the Lord's leading concerning the first step before we can receive the Lord's leading concerning the second step
When the Lord leads us, He shepherds us, causing us to enjoy the filling of green pastures and the rest by the waters of rest
The more we consecrate, the more we will deal with sin, and the more we deal with sin, the more we will consecrate
Doing the will of God means to not seek, follow, or accomplish our own will but to only seek, follow, and accomplish God's will
Is he truly not seeking, following, or accomplishing his own will but seeking, following, and accomplishing God's will?
Although He was one with God and equal to God He willingly came to earth and stood in the position of one who was sent to do the will of God
Consequently, we should realize that any practice of the will of God must be according to the Word of God, the Bible
Whatever He wants to complete in us, whatever He wants us to do, and how He wants us to do it are revealed, in principle, in the Bible
Whoever is not willing to let his in my opinion I think and to my point of view be conquered by the Word of God cannot do the will of God
Enthusiastically volunteering to suffer and to be martyred for the Lord cannot replace the will of God, nor is it necessarily God's will
Anything that is according to the predisposition and pleasure of the self cannot be regarded as the will of God
When the Lord clearly knew that God's will included His death, He was willing to drink the cup which the Father gave Him
It shows that the criterion for doing the will of God is not doing good things but accepting what God has measured to us
God has not necessarily measured many good things for us to do; consequently, good things should not be considered as the will of God
Even preaching the gospel casting out demons and works of power should not be counted as the will of God if God has not measured them to us
Anything that is good and spiritual must be measured to us to do; it must be assigned to us by God in order for it to be God's will for us
Even our love for the brothers should be according to God's assignment and God's measure; otherwise, it may be excessive
We must do what God wants us to do and what He measures for us to do in order for it to be considered as doing the will of God
The Lord wants us to be His slaves, receiving His direction and not deciding anything according to our opinion or others' perceptions
As long as something is according to the Lord's desire, we should do it even if we as well as others may think that it is wrong
We should not live under man's evaluation or be influenced by man but live under God's enlightenment and governance
You are a stumbling block to Me, for you are not setting your mind on the things of God, but on the things of men'
Satan can cause people to love the Lord from their self, which keeps them from setting their mind on the things of God
If we want to do the will of God, we must guard against our self, that is, our views and our intention to do good
To suffer-even to suffer for the Lord-is not necessarily to set our mind on the things of God or to do the will of God
Sufferingespecially suffering for the Lordcan sometimes be according to our own will preference or choice and thus is not the will of God
When an ox plows the earth, a wooden harness is placed on its neck to make it submit to its master's hand and to bear a burden
Those who practice the will of God keep the Lord's commandments, and those who keep the Lord's commandments practice the will of God
How can a person who has never passed though the gate understand the will of God on the other side of the gate?
The level of earnestness and the thoroughness of our consecration has a great impact on the depth and ease of our understanding
Not being fashioned according to this age means not being conformed to this age, not being assimilated by this age
All of its old thoughts, concepts, perceptions, and views must be eliminated, and it must be taught anew by God
An unrenewed mind can be compared to a lampshade that is painted a dark color that prevents the light of the bulb from shining out
If our mind is not renewed and if we cannot shake off our old thoughts and concepts, we will not be able to understand the will of God
If we are willing to prove the will of God in this manner, it will not be difficult for us to understand the will of God
If we want to understand the will of God, we must not only have a heart to understand but also a heart to do His will
Only those who have the heart to both understand and do the will of God can gain a revelation of God's will from Him
A heart to understand and prove the will of God and even the resolve to do the will of God are not enough; we must spend time before God
God told him about many things, but He did not tell him about His decision to destroy Sodom and Gomorrah and to save Lot
It was only when Abraham went with God and the angels to bring them on their way that God finally told Abraham of His will
Abraham's going with God to bring Him on His way caused God to open to Abraham to let him know what was hidden in His heart
The friend accompanies him to the gate and, not wanting to leave him, goes with him for a while to bring him on his way
If we want to know how to understand the Lord's will, we must let Him speak and we must listen to His speaking
Even when we let the Lord speak and we listen to Him we often do not allow Him to finish speaking and we do not listen until He has finished
She understood the Lord's prophetic revelation of His death and poured pure ointment on Him ahead of time, which He praised
The other disciples could not understand the Lord's will concerning His death, because they did not listen to the Lord in this way
When he finally rejected his own views and stopped speaking his own words, he knew and understood the will of God
Wisdom refers to the knowledge in our spirit that causes us to have an extraordinary seeing of the will of God
Our spirit will have wisdom from God, and our mind will have spiritual understanding so that we can know and understand the will of God
According to the Lord's promise here, we can gain the love and the manifestation, the presence, of the Lord and the Father
These blessings, which are promised by the Lord to those who love Him and keep His commandments, cannot be surpassed
Samuel said, Does Jehovah delight in burnt offerings and sacrifices / As much as in obeying the voice of Jehovah?
Not everyone who says to Me Lord Lord will enter into the kingdom of the heavens but he who does the will of My Father who is in the heavens
Whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved, but not everyone can enter into the kingdom of the heavens
The world is the enemy of God, and its lust opposes the will of God; therefore, the world and its lust will pass away
Because Saul rejected the word of the Lord , God rejected him from being king, causing him to lose the kingship
In God's eyes the sin of rebellion is as the sin of divination, and insubordination is as idolatry and teraphim
That slave who knew his master's will and did not prepare or do according to his will, will receive many lashes'
What they do may be good and spiritual, but they do not do it according to God's rule; therefore, it is lawlessness
Because of this type of lawlessness, the Lord will disapprove of many, and He will not allow them to enter the kingdom of the heavens
