<h1 class="title">REAL FREEDOM</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: John 8:32, 34, 36<br />
Today everybody talks about freedom. Now we will see what real freedom is.</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>All they that sin are the slaves of sin
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The slave is under bondage, having no freedom. Everyone who commits sin is the slave of sin, under the bondage of sin.</li>
	<li>Today those who talk about freedom are, in fact, the slaves of sin. The high class educationalist and the intellectuals all are the slaves of sin. Playing chess, smoking, dancing, and being under the bondage of various habits are the symptoms of being the slaves of sin.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Real Freedom
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The inability to escape from sin reveals the lack of freedom. The ability to escape from sin shows the real freedom.</li>
	<li>Today many do not have the real freedom because of the bondage and oppression of sin. Many are aware of the bondage of sin and seek for deliverance, but are unable to achieve it. Therefore there is no freedom.</li>
	<li>The real freedom means the absence of the condemnation of the conscience and deliverance from the bondage of sin.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The real freedom is dependent on the Lord
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The Lord is truth. Only He can cause men to know the reality of human life. Only He can cause men to know the mystery of human life. Only He can cause men to know God, and God is the source of freedom.</li>
	<li>To bear the sins of men, the Lord died and rose again from the dead. So He is able to forgive men&rsquo;s sins. He also can deliver men from their sins. His blood brings in the forgiveness of sin and sets men free from the condemnation of the conscience. The Lord&rsquo;s life enables men to escape from the bondage of sin, so there is the real freedom.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to be free
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Whoever wants to be free has to confess that he is the slave of sin.</li>
	<li>He must also receive the Lord and His salvation. In His salvation are blood and life. His blood provides for the forgiveness of men&rsquo;s sins, and His life enables men to be delivered from the bondage of sin.</li>
	</ol></li>
