The Decree of Artaxerxes King of Persia</h2>
<p>Verses 11 through 28 tell us about the decree of Artaxerxes king of Persia to Ezra the priest, the scribe.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Permitting the Children of Israel,<br />
the Priests, and the Levites to Go to Jerusalem</h2>
<p>The king permitted the children of Israel, the priests, and the Levites to go to Jerusalem as they willed, with silver and gold and vessels (vv. 12-19). This means that they were permitted to go freely with all their wealth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Permitting the Provision<br />
for the Needs of the House of God</h2>
<p>The king also permitted the provision for the needs of the house of God out of the king&rsquo;s treasure house (v. 20).</p>
<h2 class="head3">3. Ordering All the Treasurers to Provide<br />
Whatever Ezra Required for the House of God</h2>
<p>The king went on to order all the treasurers in the lands beyond the Great River, the Euphrates, to provide whatever Ezra the priest required for the house of God (vv. 21-23).</p>
<h2 class="head3">4. Ordering the Treasurers<br />
Not to Impose Tribute, Taxes, or Tolls</h2>
<p>Next, the king ordered the treasurers not to impose tribute, taxes, or tolls on the priests, Levites, singers, gatekeepers, temple servants, or servants of this house of God (v. 24).</p>
<h2 class="head3">5. Authorizing Ezra to Appoint<br />
Magistrates and Judges</h2>
<p>According to verses 25 and 26 the king authorized Ezra to appoint magistrates and judges to judge the people in the land, to teach them the laws of his God, and to execute judgment according to the law of God and the law of the king. Here the king did something for his own advantage. Without a person such as Ezra, who would have been qualified to maintain a proper order among the people in the good land? In authorizing Ezra to appoint judges and magistrates, the king of Persia was clever, for he knew that the ones appointed by Ezra would execute judgment not only according to the law of God but also according to the law of the king.</p>
<h2 class="head3">6. Ezra&rsquo;s Blessing to God</h2>
<p>Verses 27 and 28 are Ezra&rsquo;s blessing to God. He blessed God for putting such a thing as this into the king&rsquo;s heart to beautify the house of Jehovah in Jerusalem, saying that God had extended lovingkindness to him before the king, before the king&rsquo;s counselors, and before all the mighty officers of the king. Then Ezra declared that he was strengthened according to the hand of Jehovah his God upon him. What the king did for Ezra, he did according to the hand of Jehovah. To some extent, the king, the counselors, and the mighty officers might have realized that God was with the Jews. God&rsquo;s hand was there, controlling everything sovereignly for the benefit of His elect.</p>
<h2 class="head2">C. The Genealogical Enrollment</h2>
<p>In 8:1-20 we have the genealogical enrollment of those who returned from their captivity back to Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">D. Ezra&rsquo;s Proclamation of a Fast</h2>
<p>Ezra proclaimed a fast before they left Babylon, to humble themselves before God to seek from Him a straight way for them, rather than to ask for troops and horsemen from the king to help them against the enemy in the way (vv. 21-23). Instead of asking for troops, which the king would have provided, Ezra put his trust in the good hand of God.</p>
<h2 class="head2">E. Ezra Setting Apart Twelve<br />
of the Leading Men of the Priests</h2>
<p>Ezra set apart twelve of the leading men of the priests to take care of the offerings of silver, gold, and vessels for the house of God and to bring them to the house of God in Jerusalem (vv. 24-30). This was a serious responsibility, for it involved risk and danger on the journey from Babylon to Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head2">F. The Journey and Arrival<br />
of the Returned Captivity</h2>
<p>Verses 31 through 34 describe the journey and arrival of the returned captivity.</p>
<h2 class="head3">1. Setting Out from the River Ahava</h2>
<p>They set out from the river Ahava on the twelfth day of the first month, having the hand of their God upon them, who delivered them from the hand of the enemy and from people set in ambush on the way (v. 31).</p>
<h2 class="head3">2. Arriving at Jerusalem and<br />
Delivering All the Silver, Gold, and Vessels</h2>
<p>They arrived at Jerusalem and delivered all the silver, gold, and vessels to the house of God by weighing them (vv. 32-34). This indicates that they delivered this wealth in a very careful way.</p>
<h2 class="head2">G. The Offerings to God by the Returned Captivity</h2>
<p>Verse 35 speaks of the offerings to God by the returned captivity. As soon as they arrived, they offered burnt offerings and a sin offering.</p>
<h2 class="head2">H. The Returned Captivity&rsquo;s<br />
Delivering the King&rsquo;s Decrees</h2>
<p>The returned captivity delivered the king&rsquo;s decrees to the king&rsquo;s satraps and to the governors of the provinces beyond the River, and these supported the people and the house of God (v. 36).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of 1 & 2 Chronicles, Ezra, Nehemiah, and Esther &nbsp; pg 45</div><br></body></html>
