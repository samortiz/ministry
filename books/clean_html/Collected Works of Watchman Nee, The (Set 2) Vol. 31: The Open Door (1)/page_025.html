<h2 class="head2">A Letter to the Sisters in Shanghai<br />from England</h2><p>Dear sisters in the Lord:</p><p>The purpose of my writing this letter is to tell you how much we have been praying for the brothers and sisters in Shanghai! You have been on our hearts and in our thoughts! Although I have not yet written to you, I have never forgotten about you. I think of you all the time. May this letter bring my love and prayer to you. The Lord is your life, and He will protect you under the shadow of His wings so that you will prevail over everything. Psalm 91 is indeed written for you! Is it not? I am now attending the co-workers' meeting in Scotland. Many of the attendants are the Lord's servants from various countries. The Holy Spirit released many profound messages through Mr. Sparks. How I wish that you could hear them! We hope that Mr. Nee can be here by the beginning of September. I hope that I can meet him in London and have him stay at my house. I cannot greet the saints one by one by name in this letter, but every one of you is most precious in the Lord. In the name of the Lord whom we all love, I greet you. We all share the same life in Him! This letter shows you the oneness that is in the Body of Christ. Although you are in China and we are in England, our spiritual life makes us one Body in Christ. May the Lord bless you and preserve you, and may He shine His light upon you now and forever! Please give my special regards to dear Miss Lee and the sisters who are staying with her. Greet the brothers in the Lord!</p><p>Your sister in the Lord,<br />Lai-en-shi</p><h2 class="head2">The Church in Ch'eng-tu</h2><p>Dear Sister X in the Lord:</p><p>Thank God that He has led Ju-ru (Mrs. Zhao) to Ch'eng-tu safely. Last night the brothers and sisters broke bread and remembered the Lord in my home. There were twenty-three people, with a few brothers and sisters absent. We have decided to meet every Thursday afternoon at four for prayer in two locations: Mrs. Shen's home and at Shi-Sheng-Tze. On the Lord's Day we have the general meeting at 3 p.m. for the preaching of the gospel and for meetings on the overcoming life. The place is at Mrs. Shen's house. From 6:30 p.m. to 8 p.m., we have the bread breaking meeting in my house. Brother Rue-tze conducted a conference at the West China University last Lord's Day with much blessing from the Lord. Please pray much for the meetings here so that the Lord would open the door of the gospel. The girl students at the university indeed need the gospel. Mrs. Shen's home is an excellent place prepared by God for this work. I hope that you can come soon. The house we rented is very spacious, and there is a place for you. Please inform me as soon as the Lord frees you to come so that I may meet you at the train station. How is Brother Chang Yu-zhi's illness? May we pray in one accord for him. May the Lord bless you. Greetings to Miss Lee, Miss Chang, Mrs. Yuen, Sister Hsieh, Mrs. Lee, Brother Chang, and Brother Keh.</p><p>Brother in the Lord, Zhao Rue-tze<br />Sister in the Lord, Zhao Ju-ru<br />December 26<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Lin Kwang-biao, Shanghai</h2><p>Sister X:</p><p>At the beginning of last month, I heard that planes bombed Ning-Po. Because my mother and my two sons were there, I had to leave Shanghai to see them. But after arriving in Ning-Po, the coastal regions were blocked off, and I could not return to Shanghai. Communication did not resume until three weeks later. Although the city is no longer as busy as it was before the bombing, the situation is much better than at the time of the bombing. Thank the Lord! Although my mother and my two sons suffered much shock, they are safe. They do not want to come to Shanghai, and they have decided to move to the countryside for now. Although this cannot guarantee their safety, it is nevertheless more peaceful than in the city. In the city there are air raid sirens every day; one does not find this in the countryside. On the third of this month I left Ning-Po for Shanghai and arrived in Shanghai on the fourth. All the brothers and sisters in Shanghai are well. Please do not worry. The number in the meeting has dropped greatly. Some have left because of their jobs; some have left because they lost their jobs, but God has preserved the brothers and sisters here. May the Lord be merciful to us, and may He grant grace to afford much opportunity for many to hear the gospel. The Lord's grace be with you.</p><p>Brother Lin Kwang-biao<br />December 8<br />[Address omitted]</p>
