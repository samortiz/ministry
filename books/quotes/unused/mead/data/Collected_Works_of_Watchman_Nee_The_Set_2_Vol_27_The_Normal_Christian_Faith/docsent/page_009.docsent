   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A FEW SUPPOSITIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have to make a few suppositions.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first one is that God exists.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This in fact has been covered by us already.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have agreed that there is a God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is a Being who has a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Second, we assume that God has a desire to reveal Himself to man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If God wants to reveal Himself to man and if He wants us to know Him, how does He do it?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In what manner can He be made known to us?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If He speaks to us through thunder or writes to us through lightning, we will not be able to comprehend His message.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How then does God make Himself known to us?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE WAY GOD REVEALS HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If He is to reveal Himself and if He wants us to know Him, He necessarily must do it through human means.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What then are the common ways that men communicate with one another?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>First, they do it through speaking and second through writing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All means of communication, whether telegraph, telephone, sign, or symbols, are all included in these two categories.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If God is to manifest Himself, these are the only two means for Him to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>For the present we set aside the aspect of speaking; we will see how God communicates with us through writing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If God reveals Himself through writing, of all the volumes written by different people throughout the centuries, there must be one book which is divinely inspired.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a very crucial test.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If such a book exists, it proves not only the existence of God, but it contains His written revelation to us as well.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Is there then such a divinely written book?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the search for such a book, let us first mention a few basic principles.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose I want to order a book from a publisher.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If I can tell him the name and author of the book, there will be no trouble getting it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If, however, I forget the name and author of the book, I can describe the characteristics of it to the publisher, such as the contents, size, color, binding, etc. The publisher will then search through all his books and locate the volume I want.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God has one book in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>How do we find it?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to know its characteristics first.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If there is any book that has been written by God, it must meet certain conditions or have certain qualifications before one can say that it is from God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>FOUR QUALIFICATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let me put forth a few propositions.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If there is a book written by God, it must first of all mention God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It must tell you that it is from God and that its author is God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the first qualification.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Second, it must carry a moral tone that is higher than what we commonly know.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If it is a fabrication, it can at the most be on the same level as man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Third, if there is such a divine book, it must tell us about the past and the future of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only God knows clearly what occurred in the past and what will happen in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only by telling us these matters will we know Him as God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Fourth, this book must be simple and available so that all may be able to secure and understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If there were only one such book in the world, then only a very few people would be able to see it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It would not pass the test unless it is a book accessible to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the United States there is a group of people who claim to have a book from God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is engraved in gold and contains only twelve pages.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such a book then would not be accessible to the Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God would never write to us a book at which we could not look.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now the matter is simplified.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Let us repeat these four conditions once more.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>1 If such a book exists, it must tell us explicitly that its author is God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>2 It must carry a high tone of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>3 It must give a detailed description of the past and the future of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>4 It must be available.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Let us pick out some of the more important writings throughout human civilization and check them against these qualifications to see if any meets our requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>GOOD BOOKS</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We will start from books that are generally considered to be good.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us take the Chinese classics of Confucius.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They are immediately disqualified under the first requirement, for none of them claims to be written by God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>They do have a high tone of morality, but they fail to give the origin and destiny of the world, the universe, and man.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This does not mean that they are worthless books; it means that they do not contain the qualifications we want.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They are not what we are looking for.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Let us go to the classics of other cultures.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There are numerous volumes of famous writings, but none of them passes the first test.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>They are all clearly written by man.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They may be masterpieces in philosophy or morality, but they are not written by God, nor are they divinely inspired.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to set them aside.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>There is a book in India called the Rig-Veda.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It once dominated Hinduism.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, it does not claim to be written by God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Another book called the Avesta, written by a Persian named Zoroaster, is also extremely influential in the Middle East.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It does not claim to be from God either.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Moreover, its moral tone is not especially commendable.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Let us come to the Koran of Mohammedanism.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the closest one we can find.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It tells us that it comes from God; it meets the first requirement.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, it does not fulfill the second requirement, for its moral tone is too low.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The heaven it describes is full of lusts and flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>God could never write a book with such licentiousness and immorality.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hence, this book does not pass the test of morality.</S>
