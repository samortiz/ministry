<p>The young people need to practice to seize the opportunity in the meetings by praying and sharing spiritual things in a fitting way. If we can only call loudly but cannot display any &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo; in a fitting way, the saints may not receive the &ldquo;diamonds,&rdquo; because our way is unfitting. In summary, we should avoid anything that makes people uncomfortable whenever possible.</p>
<p>Anything that is dead or old in the church should be put aside, but this cannot be done by human methods; it can only be done by the supply of life that causes a metabolic transformation in people. Otherwise, we will go from one extreme to another. We must practice these things and ask the Lord to have mercy on us and to grant us endurance so that we will be willing to continue practicing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Encouraging All the Saints to Exercise the Spirit</h2>
<p>We must change our concept and not put on airs to teach people. On the one hand, we must encourage all the saints to be before the Lord, interact with the Lord, and live with the Lord. On the other hand, we must encourage all the saints to exercise their spirit daily. When we pray, we do not have to do it loudly, but our spirit needs to be released. When we speak to people, our spirit needs to be released. Any activity in the meeting should be a matter of the release of the spirit. Our spirit needs to be strong, living, fresh, rich, bright, and ready to be released at any time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO HAVE THOROUGH FELLOWSHIP<br />
WITH THE SAINTS</h2>
<p>When we fellowship these burdens with the saints in our locality, we should not begin with a big meeting but rather start with five to six brothers. We should fellowship point by point. If anyone brings up a problem with some service in the past, we should learn to stay on that point and not jump to another topic quickly. Even if we spend three hours fellowshipping over just one point in order to get through, this will be very good. If there is not enough time in one day, we do not need to wait for another day next week; we can continue to fellowship the next day. We should work on one point and get through, and then work on the next point. After we have had thorough fellowship with these brothers, we can invite some others until we get through with everyone. Then we can call a big meeting.</p>
<p>The success of this matter lies in whether the brothers in each locality are in one accord, praying together, bearing the burden together in one spirit, and speaking the same thing. After we have thorough fellowship with a few, we can fellowship with more. This will eliminate the need for any &ldquo;special meeting,&rdquo; but in fact, every meeting will be special. Whether or not a meeting is special depends on whether we make the saints feel special. If we call an eight-day conference in a rash way yet merely talk about ordinary things, there will be nothing special about it. In contrast, even a prayer meeting can be special if some &ldquo;diamonds&rdquo; are displayed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KEY TO SERVING&mdash;BEING BLENDED IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Whether or not we can be in one spirit is the key to serving in a locality. The most important thing is being blended in our spirit, not discussing how things should be done. When there is blending, it is possible to take some action. An army must be one before it can be dispatched into battle.</p>
<p>If the brothers in a locality cannot be blended in one spirit, they may be polite in dealing with each other and be able to shout slogans outwardly, but the situation will be altogether futile and political. Satan knows these things the best. When we do not have the one accord, he will regard us as a joke and say, &ldquo;Even I know that you are not one. What work can you do?&rdquo; One time we were casting out demons, and the demon spoke of our failures and asked, &ldquo;Do you think that you can cast me out?&rdquo; We immediately prayed for the Lord to cover us with His precious blood. We must see that we are in a war. The brothers in each locality must be blended in spirit. If we cannot be blended in spirit, living in spirit will be only a slogan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT HAVING PRECONCEIVED NOTIONS<br />
BUT BEING BLENDED IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The brothers serving in various localities must not have preconceived notions that the older ones are unwilling to follow but that the young people are willing to follow. We should never have such thoughts. We must treat the older ones and the young people in each locality the same and lead them step by step. We must not regard anyone as an outsider, and we must not distinguish between the older ones and the young people. We must lead both the young people and the older ones into serving.</p>
<p>First and foremost, we must be blended in spirit. If the brothers have many talents yet are not blended in spirit, it will be possible to do only a shallow, superficial work. We will not have a way to do a thorough work that builds up the church. If those who are taking the lead are not blended with each other, how can they build up the church? Instead, they will become hindrances that keep the Holy Spirit from moving forward or from working in a deeper way. Consequently, the advance of the work will stop. The brothers must be blended with each other.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_019.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_021.html">Next</a> </body></html>
