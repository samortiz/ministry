<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. CHRIST IS THE RESURRECTION</H2><P>Without this Person, in the whole universe there is no resurrection. Christ is the resurrection (John 11:25a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. HENCE, THE RESURRECTION IS THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST</H2><P>Hence, the resurrection is the pneumatic Christ as the processed, consummated, compounded, and life-giving Spirit, who is the consummation of the processed Triune God (1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17-18). The real resurrection is the consummated Triune God, the pneumatic Christ, the all-inclusive, compounded Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE POWER OF CHRIST'S RESURRECTION<br>IS THE POWER OF THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT<br>FOR US TO BE CONFORMED TO CHRIST'S DEATH</H2><P>To live a life conformed to Christ's death is not an easy job. Our natural life just cannot make it. It does not have this capacity. We need the power of Christ's resurrection, which is the power of the consummated Spirit. We need the consummation of the Triune God that we may have the capacity and the power to live a life that is conformed to the death of Christ (Phil. 3:10).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. OUR WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT<br>EQUALS OUR LIVING THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST</H2><P>Romans 8:4 says that we need to walk according to the spirit. To walk according to the spirit equals our living the pneumatic Christ (Phil. 1:19b-21a). Philippians 1:19 speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the pneumatic Christ, the Christ in resurrection. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit as the resurrection, and this Spirit has the bountiful supply which enables us to live Christ.</P><P>No one has the ability to live Christ by his own strength. To live as a sinner is easy. We were born sinners, so we spontaneously live as sinners. But in order to live Christ, we need another power. Electrical power is a good illustration of this. By electrical power a room can be made bright with light, and the volume of someone's speaking can be increased through a microphone. In the same way, we need an extra power so that we can have the capacity, the ability, to live Christ. This power is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, who supports us with a bountiful supply, and the bountiful supply is the effectiveness of the power of Christ's resurrection.</P><P>In our Christian life, we should be related to the resurrection of Christ every moment of every day. The life of modern cities today is an "electrical life." If the electricity stops, the cities are paralyzed. In recent years the electricity in New York was cut off, and everything stopped. Some people were held in the elevator with no way to go up or come down. Some were held on the subway. The life of a modern city is a life of electricity, and our Christian life is a life of spiritual electricity. Christ's resurrection to us is the spiritual electricity. Just as electricity is related to our daily life in every aspect, so Christ's resurrection as the spiritual electricity is related to our Christian life in every aspect.</P>
