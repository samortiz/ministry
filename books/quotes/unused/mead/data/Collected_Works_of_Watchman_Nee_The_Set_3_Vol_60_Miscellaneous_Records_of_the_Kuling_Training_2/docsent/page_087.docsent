   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Arguments against</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>the General Heretical Teachings</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>of the Judaizers regarding the Law The Law Not Being Given to the Gentiles</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we have to realize that God did not give the law to the Gentiles; He only gave it to the nation of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Psalm 147:19-20 says, "He declares His word to Jacob,/His statutes and His ordinances to Israel./He has not dealt so with any other nation;/And as for His ordinances, they have not known them."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This shows clearly that God only gave His statutes and ordinances to the Israelites.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Concerning the Gentiles, Romans 2:14 in the New Testament says that the "Gentiles, who have no law, do by nature the things of the law, these, though they have no law, are a law to themselves."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here we find the phrase Gentiles, who have no law.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This proves that the Gentiles are not under the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the clear teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When a Gentile is saved, does he have to keep the law?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Acts 15:29 says, "To abstain from things that have been sacrificed to idols and blood and things strangled and fornication, from which if you carefully keep yourselves, you will do well."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After Paul preached the gospel, many Gentiles were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Some Jews from Judea said that the Gentile believers should be circumcised and should keep the law of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Later the apostles and elders in Jerusalem made the decision not to ask these Gentile believers to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They only had to abstain from four things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before the Gentiles were saved, they had "no law."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After they were saved, the Bible does not ask them to keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They were only asked to abstain from things that had been sacrificed to idols, from blood, from things strangled, and from fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God has not given the law to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is true both in the case of saved ones as well as unsaved ones.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Law Being Given to the Jews</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the Bible speaks of the law, it says that God gave the law to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Jews are born under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To them, the heaven and the earth may pass away, but one iota or serif shall by no means pass away from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In Matthew 5:18 the Lord says that one iota or one serif shall by no means pass away from the law until all come to pass.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord has no intention to annul the law among the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>His intention is to put the Jews under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He says that the law must be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The fulfillment in this case is a kind of complement.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Originally, the law said that one should not kill.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now not killing is not enough; one must not even hate.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a kind of complement, and this is the way the law is to be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Law Having Nothing to Do</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>with Believing Jews</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Since the law is given to the Jews, what should the Jews who have believed in the Lord do?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is their relationship to the law?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After a Jew is saved, he becomes a member of the church and is no longer a Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Romans 7:1-4 says that a Jew believing in the Lord is like a woman marrying a man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The woman in this case already had a husband the law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In order for her to marry another man, her first husband must die.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the only way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But Matthew says that not one iota or serif of the law can pass away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This husband the law will never die.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the reason Romans 7:4 clearly shows us that the law controls a man only as long as he lives.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although the law, which is the husband, will not die, God caused Christ to die so that we, the woman, can die with Christ in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In this way we are freed from the law through death.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are freed from the first husband through dying with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then we are resurrected together with Christ and married to Christ the second husband.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This death must be a real death.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Only then will we not be an adulterer when we are given to Christ in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Within the Lord's death, God included our death.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>What an assurance this is!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Our resurrection is included within the Lord's resurrection as well.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>How sure is this resurrection!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To one who was under the law, it is a miracle to be able to receive a new life in resurrection through dying with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"For sin will not lord it over you, for you are not under the law but under grace" 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is so because the Lord has died.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since we have died to the binding law, we are now discharged from the law 7:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>By believing in the Lord and through participating in His death and resurrection, we are freed from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is what happens to a Jew when he believes in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must be clear about Romans 7 before we can deal with the question of the law.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The law cannot be annulled.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But we have died and have been liberated from the law.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Christian position is one that declares that we are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We stand on the position of death.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today the law has nothing to do with us any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The law can only deal with the old man; it can do nothing to the new man that has passed through death and resurrection.</S>
