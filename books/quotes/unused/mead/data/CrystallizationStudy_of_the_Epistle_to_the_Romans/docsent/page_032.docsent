   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Having Life and Living by Faith</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Romans 1:17 says, "The righteous shall have life and live by faith."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We not only have life but also live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To live is a matter of continuation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Romans 1:17 is Paul's quotation of Habakkuk 2:4, which is also referred to by Paul in Galatians 3:11 and Hebrews 10:38.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Christian life is not just a matter of having life by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You have to live by faith for your whole life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We are not believers for just a small amount of time.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are believers for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We not only have life but also live by what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We live by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the linking faith which continues with us in our living.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Living in Faith, the Faith of the Son of God</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Galatians 2:20 says, "I am crucified with Christ; and it is no longer I who live, but it is Christ who lives in me; and the life which I now live in the flesh I live in faith, the faith of the Son of God...."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many among us know this verse, but actually Galatians 2:20 is difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If I am crucified without Christ, that is pitiful, but we have been crucified with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He takes care of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He bears the responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ does not live by Himself alone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ lives "in me."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should circle the words in me in our Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we saw that Christ lives in us, we would be excited.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You were crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is no longer you, yet Christ still lives in you.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You say "no longer," but something is still going on.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So Galatians 2:20 continues by saying, "...and the life which I now live in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Christ lives in me, and I now live a life in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I live this life in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is no longer I who live, but still I live.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The "I" who no longer lives is the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The "I" who now lives is the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all have two statuses: the old creation and the new creation, the old man and the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As to the old creation, the old man, it is no longer I who live.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But I have another status the new creation, the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As to the new creation, the new man, I still live.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I live this life in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means faith is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Romans 1:17 to have life by faith is the initiation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But here Paul says, "I live in faith."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Faith is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I live by faith, and this faith is not my faith.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This faith is the faith of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These three items God, the Son of God, and faith are one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you heard the gospel, you heard the word, and faith came into you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>That faith is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Now you live by that faith, and this faith is the faith of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Initially, you received the faith which is God coming into you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But now you still live by this faith, yet in the second stage.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the second stage, it is the faith of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>So when you live this life by faith, you do not live by anything of yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>You live this life by faith, which is the faith of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, you have life by the faith of God, and you live this life by the faith of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Faith, God, and the Son of God are one.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Faith links God and the Son of God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If you have faith, faith links you to God.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you have faith, faith links you to the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The initial faith in the initial stage came to you through the hearing of the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But faith in the second stage, the stage to live Christ, comes mostly not by hearing the word.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Faith in this stage comes into you by your contacting God in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>So you have to contact the Triune God all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All the time you should contact the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then you will also touch the Father and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Faith in the second stage comes to us through our contacting the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It is not just to hear the word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the second stage of faith, hearing the word does not work much.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In this stage, faith comes into you increasingly like the electrical current in a building.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You can tell that a "current" in you is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The more you say, "O Lord Jesus," the more the current is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The more you pray, the more the current is going on.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This is why we are told to pray unceasingly 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This current should not be stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is the linking stage of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This faith within us is God Himself in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The electricity in a building links the building with the power plant, even though the power plant may be a hundred miles away.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The electricity in a building also links all the lamps together.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>There are many lamps but only one electricity, and this one electricity is the linking factor which links all the lamps and the entire building with the power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Check with your experience.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If you do not pray for one day, you feel you are cut off from the divine power plant.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you do not pray for two days, you feel you are not only cut off from God but also cut off from all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We Live Because He Lives in Us</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In John 14:19 the Lord said, "Because I live, you also shall live."</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It may seem that He lives alone, and we also live alone.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>But the following verse says, "In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you" v. 20 . The Lord does not live alone.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He lives in us, and we live in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is co-inhering.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Here we can also see the linking.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Faith links us to the Triune God.</S>
