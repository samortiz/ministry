   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But man has turned to his own way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Use examples to show that men live on this earth and do things according to their own will.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because man has turned to his own way, he has committed all kinds of transgressions and iniquities in the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s judgment God s righteousness requires God to judge man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s love causes God to save man.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, God caused the Savior to bear our sins and to be judged in our stead.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The way God judged the Savior on the cross was to put the Savior to death; He wounded and bruised the Savior so that He tasted death for us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Savior s bearing of our sins Not only was the Savior who was nailed on the cross persecuted by men, but moreover, He was chastised and punished by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fact that the Savior was persecuted by men is a proof that men are against God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The fact that the Savior was punished by God proves that God saves man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The reason God punished the Savior was that God laid on Him the iniquity of us all.</S>

   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God had forsaken Him because of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Savior had no sin, so God ought not to forsake Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But He was bearing the sins of men; therefore God did forsake Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If the Lord were only suffering the persecution of men, then God should be with Him all the more, just as in the case of a martyr like Stephen, who was full of the presence of God during the time of martyrdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the fact that the Savior was forsaken proves that He was not a martyr but a sin-bearing One.</S>

   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Repent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To turn back is an outward action, but to repent is an inward change.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>To turn back is to say that my way is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But to repent is to say that my being is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To turn back is to say that the direction of my life is wrong, but to repent is to say that my living is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Confess your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since God has laid your sins upon the Savior and let Him bear them for you, therefore you must confess all your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Believe in the Savior, receive the Savior into your heart, and take Him as your Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This message could be very powerful, if inspired.</S>
