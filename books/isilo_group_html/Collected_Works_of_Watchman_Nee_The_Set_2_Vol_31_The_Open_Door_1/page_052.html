The work of the local church has not started here. In the past, it was all my own work. We have recently rented a local house in Shi-Ping for a meeting hall, and I have rented a portion of it from the church because there were extra rooms. I am preparing to go out to work, but I have not been able to leave because some sisters are undergoing trials. After one sister believed in the Lord, her husband, who was on business, rushed home from another county. He promised to leave her alone if she would only deny her faith, but that he would kill her if she would not deny her faith. This sister would not back down because she hoped in the Lord's appearing. She was beaten and chased out of the home. (This was the first day of the Chinese New Year.) Although many people tried to reconcile the situation, it was to no avail. The brothers and sisters met that evening to desperately petition the Lord. Thank the Lord, the next evening, without any explanation, her husband asked the people to bring her back. He has not persecuted her since. The next day another sister received news from some people that her beloved son had been attacked by bandits on his way home for the Chinese New Year and had been cut into several pieces. It is impossible to describe this sister's grief. Thank God, He is still preserving her to stand in His grace. Through these circumstances the brothers and sisters have manifested the Lord's love. If the Lord is willing, I will go to Bao-Shiu to do pioneering work on the seventh of this month (Bao-Shiu belongs to the second region in Shi-Ping). My family will still stay in Shi-Ping. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your weak brother in the Lord,<br />Lin Kwang-chao<br />January 3<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">The Future of the Work<br />in Yi-Yang and Ch'ang-Teh, Hunan Province</h2><h2 class="head3">One</h2><p>Brother Lan:</p><p>The work in Ch'ang-Teh has already begun, so I will not return to Yuan-Jiang for awhile. Yesterday, I moved into the upstairs of the meeting hall. There is a room that I have rented myself. The rest of the building is shared by the assembly and the Chiu-Shih Tutorial School. They each pay half of the rent. The Lord really prepared this house for us. At this time it would be impossible to find a more appropriate building. We had a good meeting yesterday. The brothers and sisters were smiling and praising the Lord with joy. A brother said that he never thought that there would be so much work to do in Ch'ang-Teh. There is a group of newly saved brothers and sisters who really want to pray for the work in this locality. The present condition seems to indicate that the work will turn out to be very profitable here. I still need to find a building with a storefront for preaching the gospel. I would like to do a good gospel work during the Chinese New Year. I hope you will help me with your prayers. I have heard that the Lord has already raised up a group of brothers and sisters in one accord in Yi-Yang. I hope that Brother Chang is standing firm for the Lord there. We should spread out and not gather together in one place. Peace and well-being in the Lord. Greetings to Brother Chou You-sheng, Brother Hu Lan-sheng, Brother Chu, Brother Lee, and the rest.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Fu-sheng<br />January 24<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 52</div><br></body></html>
