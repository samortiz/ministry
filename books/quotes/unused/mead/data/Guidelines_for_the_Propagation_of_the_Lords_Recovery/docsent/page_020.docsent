   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OPENING OUR HOMES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE PREACHING OF THE GOSPEL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The most effective way to preach the gospel is to open our homes for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, I am burdened to push the elders and co-workers to urge the saints to open their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many saints have not yet opened their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to speak until everyone is restless and rises up to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the past I was not willing to push people, but my concept has changed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I will push the elders and co-workers to ask all the saints to open their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because we were too spiritual, the elders and co-workers merely asked the saints to pray and seek the Lord s leading concerning opening their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As a result very few homes are open.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we must help the saints to open their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After the saints open their homes, they do not need to hold a big gospel meeting or to invite many people to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The saints can invite eight to ten relatives, neighbors, and friends to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Every night there should be eighty to a hundred homes that are preaching the gospel in the church in Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There can be eight to ten people in every home.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It should not be a religious worship service.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our relatives and friends who come should feel comfortable to speak with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In such a warm atmosphere it is easy to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the saints in the church in Taipei and in the Lord s recovery need to open their homes for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should even be willing to miss the regular church meetings in order to preach the gospel in our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Suppose we may have a relative who is free only on Thursday.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should be willing to invite them to our home on Thursday, even if we need to miss a meeting of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The elders should not expect the saints to be in every meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, when the saints are not preaching the gospel in their home, they should be in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In addition to the regular church meetings, we should open our homes to preach the gospel at least one evening a week.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There are advantages to opening our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>On the one hand, our cold hearts will be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the other hand, we can lead our friends or relatives who are not saved to receive the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Moreover, it will benefit our neighbors.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Suppose we open our homes to preach the gospel every week of every month of every year.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every home will be able to lead at least three people to salvation a year.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If there are 1,200 to 1,500 homes in Taipei, there will be an increase of 4,000 people in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a solid and effective way to gain people, because people will be gained gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is not too much for an open home to lead one person to salvation every four months.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every person we gain is a new branch that can easily bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He can lead people to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, it is easy for us to have a twofold increase in a year.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After listening to this word, we should all rise up and take action before God by opening our homes for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The saints who receive this word and are willing to open their homes can invite people over at least once every three weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Every opened home is a gospel station.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If every gospel station gains three people yearly, we will have a considerable increase.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The sisters are key in opening the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The responsible brothers who want to promote opening the homes need to fellowship with the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The husbands usually work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Many sisters, however, stay at home and are not occupied by so many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, the responsible brothers should encourage the sisters to open their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>According to the New Testament, sisters tend to love the Lord more than brothers do.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord Jesus was anointed twice by sisters Matt 26:6-13; Luke 7:36-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The brothers were in their mind, and asked, Why this waste?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Matt 26:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They also calculated that the ointment could have been sold for much and given to the poor v. 9 . Brothers tend to be in their mind whenever they speak about the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Sisters are not so much in their mind; they are more emotional.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When they love the Lord, they are willing to spend for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Therefore, to promote preaching the gospel in the homes, we must begin with the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If the sisters do not respond, we will not succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The sisters must rise up and respond to this move.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The refreshments we prepare make it easy for people to open their hearts so that the gospel can enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The refreshments are prepared by the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, we must rely on the sisters if we want to preach the gospel in the homes.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The sisters should not be frugal when they serve those who come to hear the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When we serve those who come to listen to the gospel, we are serving the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is good to spend our money for people to be gained.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We need to take this way to open our homes willingly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We do not need to rely on the help of certain brothers when we invite gospel friends to our homes.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must preach the gospel ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We may not know how to preach the first time, and we may still lack experience the second time, but as we continue to practice, we will learn.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I did not know how to ride a bicycle when I was young.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It was not until I was in my thirties that I learned to ride a bicycle, because I was assigned to work for the Lord in Tientsin.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When I first got on the bicycle, I fell, but after falling, I got back on the bicycle.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Eventually I learned how to ride a bicycle by trying.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As long as we fail but continue to practice, we will learn.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The leading brothers need to let the saints preach the gospel, especially the saints who do not know how to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Otherwise, only a few saints will be able to bear responsibility in spiritual matters.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We need to let everyone preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When someone opens his home, he should preach the gospel and nourish the ones who are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then the Lord will have a way to spread.</S>
