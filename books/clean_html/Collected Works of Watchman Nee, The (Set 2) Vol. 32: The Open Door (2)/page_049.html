<h2 class="head2">Ch'eng-tu, Szechuan Province</h2><p>Dear Sister Ruth in the Lord:</p><p>I heard that Sisters Chang and Wang have arrived in Chungking and will soon go to Kuei-yang. May the Lord bless your future. When I was in San-Tai, I met a British missionary in a Friends Church. She told me that the Friends Church does not emphasize outward formalities but inner light and that baptism and the breaking of bread are unnecessary. I showed her the meaning of baptism and the breaking of bread from the Bible. She accepted the truth concerning the breaking of bread but was still in doubt about baptism. The next day I went to her again, and she gathered a few to listen to me. I was led by the Spirit to speak boldly concerning the truth of the church. Thank the Lord that they were all very attentive. On the third day in their fellowship meeting, we studied a few passages concerning fellowship with God. The Lord was indeed with us, and they were all willing to receive the word quietly. This is the Lord's doing. May all the glory go to Him. Meetings here are as usual. (On the Lord's Day morning from nine to eleven, we have the fellowship meeting; in the evening from seven to eight-thirty, we have the bread-breaking meeting. On Saturday evening we have a Bible study meeting at Mrs. Shen's house starting at six-thirty.) Last Thursday at the prayer meeting, we fasted and prayed from three o'clock until eight o'clock. We may continue this way with the prayer meeting on the coming Thursdays. Thank the Lord that He always blesses the work that He has ordered.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Chao Rue-tze, September 7</p><h2 class="head2">Kuei-yang, Kweichow Province</h2><p>Dear Brother Tsi-yi in the Lord:</p><p>Thank the Lord that in the midst of all the hectic activities, I have this opportunity to fellowship with you once again through letters.</p><p>I believe you heard that the Lord brought us to Kuei-yang safely! Because of the lesson we learned last time, we did not move rashly this time. I was concerned about exposing the children to the danger of long-distance travel by bus. The mountain roads are dangerous, and there is always the danger of accidents and robberies. Thank the Lord, He cared for the weak and gave us a full promise: "Your women, children, and all your possessions will come in the way of peace." Indeed, we were safe. Although there were dangerous places along the way, we were at peace. The smoothness of the road was beyond my expectation. It was very difficult to get the tickets from Ch'ang-sha to Kuei-yang. But thank the Lord, a supervisor of the Railway Company, who had been my patient, came to consult with me about his sickness. By chance he told me that he worked at the Railway Company. He secured the necessary tickets for me. I work at the Provincial Hospital. My uncle (Brother Liu Ching-si) has been relocated from Kuei-yang Medical School to the Kweichow Provincial Hospital. Presently, malaria is rife in Kuei-yang, and I also have been assigned to the Provisional Immunization Hospital. There are many patients, and work is busy. More and more people are moving to Kuei-yang. The standard of living has become too high and the houses too few.</p><p>Visitors from out of town can find me at the Provincial Hospital. Peace be to you.</p><p>Brother in the Lord,<br />Liu Chu-fei, August 8</p><h2 class="head2">Kweilin, Kwangsi Province</h2><p>Brother Kuo Bu-yue, Sister Lee Tse-tseng, and I arrived safely in Kweilin on August 26. They are staying at the Independent Church, while I am lodging at the house of Sister Chang Tze-ping, who works at the Provincial Library. There are over ten sisters who are in fellowship with us. The people of Kweilin are simple, and their standard of living is not too high. The roads are clean, and the air is fresh. The city is surrounded by mountains, and the weather is fine. The people are quite receptive to religion. It takes a two-day journey by car to go from here to Nan-ning. Transportation is easy. We heard that there will soon be trains from here to there. There are four denominations in this city: the Independent Church, the Baptist Church, the Anglican Church, and the Methodist Church. If some will come and work in this place, there should not be too many obstacles. However, housing is difficult. I need a period of rest, and I am looking for houses.</p><p>Sister Tso Fu-ru, August 31</p>
