   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Jehovah Raising Up</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>to David a Righteous Shoot Christ ,</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Who Will Reign as King</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>and Act Prudently and Will Execute Judgment</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>and Righteousness in the Holy Land</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to verse 5, Jehovah will raise up to David a righteous Shoot, that is, Christ, who will reign as King and act prudently and will execute judgment and righteousness in the holy land.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a very crucial matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the coming restoration Christ will come as the Shoot of David.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This means that He will come as the descendant of David.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, in this verse Jeremiah does not use the word descendant.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If he had used this word, verse 5 would have been indicating merely that Christ is a human being born as a descendant of David.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There would not be any thought or notion concerning the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, the word Shoot indicates Christ's humanity, and it also implies life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A shoot is a new, fresh sprout of a tree, especially a sprout of a tree that has been cut down.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose a tree has been cut down to the ground and only a stump remains.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After a while a new sprout springs out of this stump.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This sprout is a shoot.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As the Shoot of David, Christ is a new sprout from the stump of David.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The royal family of David was like a large tree, but because of the apostasy of Solomon and his descendants, that tree was cut down, mainly by Nebuchadnezzar, leaving only a stump in the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Christ was born, a new, fresh sprout came out of this stump.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The birth of Christ as such a Shoot was wholly a matter of life, and His birth was rich in its implications regarding life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This life has grown and spread to such an extent that Christ is now the King to rule and to act prudently.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the time of Christ's coming nearly two thousand years ago, the tree of the royal house of David was merely a stump in the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In bringing forth Christ as the Shoot of David, God brought together two descendants of David Joseph, a descendant of Solomon, and Mary, a descendant of Nathan, another one of David's sons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ was conceived in Mary, not through Joseph as the father but through the Holy Spirit Matt 1:18, 20 , to be something divine and holy Luke 1:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the days prior to the birth of Christ, a decree went out from Caesar Augustus for a census to be taken of all the inhabited earth, and all went to be registered, each to his own city Luke 2:1, 3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since Joseph was of the house and family of David, he went with Mary to Bethlehem, David's city.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While they were there, Mary gave birth to Jesus and laid Him in a manger because there was no room for them in the inn.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Christ's birth at Bethlehem was a fulfillment of the prophecy in Micah 5:2.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because of Herod's persecution, Joseph took the child and His mother to Egypt Matt 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, after the death of Herod, Joseph returned to Nazareth with the child and His mother vv.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>19-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This was the beginning of the fulfillment of Jehovah's promise concerning the raising up of Christ as the Shoot, as the new sprout, of David.</S>
