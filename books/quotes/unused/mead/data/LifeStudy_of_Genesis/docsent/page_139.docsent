   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1 The Bleeding Sacrifice</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Substitution</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before the skins were taken from the animals, the lambs were undoubtedly sacrificed.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They were killed and their blood was shed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I believe that God probably killed the lambs in the presence of Adam and Eve and that they witnessed the sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It must have given them a deep impression.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps Adam said to Eve, "Eve, don't you know that that should be our destiny?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our blood should be shed because we fell, committed sin, and transgressed God's prohibition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to God's prohibition, we should be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But God didn't kill us, Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God is killing these lambs in our place.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How thankful and grateful we should be to these lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are our substitute."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day the Lord Jesus came, and John the Baptist said of Him, "Behold, the Lamb of God" John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 1:29 is a development of Genesis 3:21.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In type, when the lambs were slain, Christ had already been slain in the eyes of God, for He was slain from the foundation of the world Rev 13:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hebrews 9:22 says, "Without shedding of blood there is no forgiveness."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Thus, this matter of shedding of blood was also sown as a seed in Genesis 3:21 and is developed in John 1:29 and Hebrews 9:22.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you read the Epistles in the New Testament, you will notice how many times the blood is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have been redeemed by the precious blood of God's Lamb ordained by God for us before the foundation of the world 1 Pet 1:18-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christ was ordained before Adam's fall.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can see a picture of the shedding of Christ's blood there in the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Without the shedding of blood, how can a righteous God justify sinful man?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Without the shedding of blood, it would not have been legal, lawful, righteous, or fair for God to put a covering upon fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, before God covered sinful man with the coats of skins, God judged and killed him in the sacrifice.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God will never kill us, because He has already killed us in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the cross Christ was killed by the righteous God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, whenever we respond to the gospel and say, "Living," God immediately comes and covers us with Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that God's justification is based upon redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The putting on of the coats of skins was based upon the shedding of the blood of the sacrifice, for the sacrificial lamb was actually a substitute for sinful man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2 The Covering Skins Union</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although many Christians talk about substitution, about Christ's having died in our place, not many realize the matter of union.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, genuine substitution is based upon union.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Adam and Eve were sinful, and the lambs were killed and their blood shed for their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How could the killing of the lambs have been their killing?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the lambs and Adam and Eve had been separate from one another, the lambs could not have substituted for them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Once Adam believed in the glad tidings God covered him with a coat of the lamb skins, and he became one with the lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The sinner had become one with the substitute.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is union.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Union brings about the effectiveness of substitution, for without union substitution stands alone.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Substitution has nothing to do with us until we enter into that union.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once we participate in that union, whatever the substitute has accomplished is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Christ has done everything for us on the cross, but without union all that He has accomplished on the cross is unrelated to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>But if we say, "Amen, Lord," Christ will be put upon us, and we will be put into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Since we are one with Christ, whatever Christ has accomplished on the cross becomes ours; it is our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Union brings in the effectiveness of substitution, and substitution is based upon union.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When we preach the gospel, some people always ask us, "As long as Christ has died for us on the cross, why do we need to believe?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You have just told us that He has accomplished full redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Why then do we have to believe?"</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>You need union.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If you do not believe in Christ, you do not have this union.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If you do not have union with Him, whatever He has done on the cross cannot be appropriated by you or applied to you.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to believe in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever the Bible speaks about believing for salvation it uses the preposition "in."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We must believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This little word "in" denotes union.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>To believe in Jesus Christ is to be one with Him, to have union with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If I am a poor man and you are a billionaire, you might be afraid to be united with me, but I would be glad to be joined with you, because once I am united with you everything you have is mine.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is why so many women want to marry rich men.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>According to California law, because of the union between husband and wife, whatever the husband has in his name also belongs to his wife.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have the best marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We, the poor beggars, have been married to Christ, the greatest billionaire.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Whatever He has, whatever He is, whatever He has done and is going to do, whatever He has attained and obtained everything is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are now in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This matter of union was also sown as a seed in Genesis, has been fully developed in the Epistles of the New Testament, and will ripen into a harvest in Revelation 21.</S>
