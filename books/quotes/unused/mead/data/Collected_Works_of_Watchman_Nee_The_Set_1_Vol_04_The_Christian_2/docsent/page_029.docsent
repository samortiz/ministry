   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Secondly, what kind of people were they in the churches?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>According to the term messenger, they are the representatives of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A messenger is a representative.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When we read chapters two and three, we see that the messengers were those counted by the Lord to be responsible for the whole church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Lord warned them regarding the removal of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord rebuked them for having held the doctrine of Balaam, and He reproached them for suffering the woman Jezebel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord warned them that He would come to them as a thief.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Considering the way the Lord dealt with them, we know that they were charged by the Lord to be responsible for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They represent their church and bear the responsibility for it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We know that the word "messenger" means the sent ones.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The sent ones, in a practical sense, more or less represent the one who sent them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"He who receives you receives Me, and he who receives Me receives Him who has sent Me" Matt 10:40 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, these messengers were those in the churches who had the gift, the influence, the ability to turn the church.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As to their work or positions we know nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They were the true members of the church, and as such, the Lord charged them to bear the responsibility for the whole church because they were the only ones that were able to hear the speaking of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ spoke of them and the churches they represent as one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In these seven letters, our Lord indicated that there was a distinction, and yet no separation, between these messengers and their respective churches.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We saw how our Lord wrote letters to them and counted these letters as addressed to the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The first sentence of all seven letters in chapters two and three is: "To the messenger of the church...."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, these letters were written "to the seven churches" 1:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is clear that the messengers and the churches are joined as one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These letters to the seven messengers were not like those private letters to Titus and Timothy, which were for their individual guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Although these seven letters were written to the seven messengers, we find the words "the Spirit says to the churches."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Our Lord treated the messengers as the churches and charged them to bear the responsibility of the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, the messengers and the churches are not exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Therefore, our Lord said, "Behold, the devil is about to cast some of you into prison" 2:10 ; "My faithful one, who was killed among you" 2:13 ; "you have some there who hold the teaching of Balaam" 2:14 ; "I say to you the rest" 2:24 ; "you have a few names...who have not defiled their garments" 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord had separated a few among them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, there are differences between the messengers and the churches: "I am coming to you and will remove your lampstand out of its place" 2:5 ; "you tolerate the woman Jezebel" 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although these seven letters were sent to the messengers, these differences were found only in the first four letters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the last three letters, the messengers and the churches were exactly the same, and there were no more separate speakings to the messengers and the churches as in the first four letters.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These ones are represented by the stars.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They are those who faithfully love the Lord, possessing heavenly position and experience like the stars in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They shine for the Lord like the stars at night.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Their home is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their hope and happiness are all in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They have intimate fellowship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They also have the power and authority of the Lord because they are in the right hand of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They represent the church because they are the most faithful ones in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They mind the things of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>They view the failure and success of the church as their own.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They bear in their hearts the responsibility of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every one of us can be a messenger of the church!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Lord will hold those who faithfully serve Him responsible for the rise or fall of their church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>How solemn is this thought!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Let us clearly see our responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should gladly bear the responsibility of the church in the presence of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In spirit we should resist on behalf of the church all the attacks and tactics of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should be on our knees with tears and with outpoured soul, interceding for the church of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although we know that the failures of the churches are not our own, it will be our failure if we are unconcerned about their failures.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should have an enlarged heart to include all the children of God, viewing their business as our business.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, if we ourselves are not faithful, then we will not only set ourselves in danger but will cause the Lord's heart to be sorrowful.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we are willing to submit ourselves totally to the Lord's hand and gladly bear the responsibility for His sake, not only will we receive unspeakable blessing, but the Lord will also use us to accomplish a great and immeasurable work.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, we should know that God is just.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He will not mistreat us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There were only two churches with which God was totally pleased: Smyrna and Philadelphia.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord examined them, saw their faithfulness, and commended them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To all the other five churches the Lord had words of reproach.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For two churches, Sardis and Laodicea, the Lord had no word of praise.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The general state of Ephesus was their leaving the first love.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>For that the Lord considered taking away their lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Lord pronounced a special judgment on the sinners in Pergamos.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the same way, He judged Jezebel and those who followed after her in Thyatira.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even though the messengers represent every church, they represent them only in their hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In reality the messenger is the messenger and the church is the church because there are differences between the star and the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In responsibility, the Lord holds them accountable.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Anyone who cares for the church of Christ should have this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>However, in the judgment the Lord will only punish those who commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The Lord knows who belongs to Him.</S>
