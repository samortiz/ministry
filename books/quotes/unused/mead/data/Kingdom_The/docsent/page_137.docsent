   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE AMBITION FOR POSITION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BEING CONTRARY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>TO THE KINGDOM LIFE Scripture Reading: Matt 20:20-28; 23:8-12; 21:4-9, 15-16, 23-27, 28-32, 33-45</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Now we need to consider several passages in Matthew which are connected by a single underlying thought: ambition for position.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first portion is Matthew 20:20-28.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There we see that the ambition to be great, to be a leader, and to be in authority is deep within fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The source of this ambition is the rebellion of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The man which God created did not have the nature of being ambitious, of desiring leadership and greatness, or of possessing authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The source of this ambitious nature is not the creation of God, but the rebellion of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This ambition for position is in Satan's fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Satan fell because of his ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Isaiah 14 and Ezekiel 28 reveal that Satan was originally a high cherub, an archangel, who was quite good when he was created.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But at a certain time he entertained the thought of being equal with God and rebelling against God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the fallen nature of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When man was tempted by the Devil and fell, the evil nature of Satan was injected into him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, within the human nature of both men and women is the ambition of being greater than others, of being the "chief."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you are a sister, you certainly will want to be the chief sister.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you are unable to be the chief among ten thousand, at least you want to be the chief among ten.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is our fallen nature.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE TWO SONS OF ZEBEDEE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When the mother of the two sons of Zebedee requested that her sons sit at the Lord's right and left hand in the kingdom, the Lord Jesus exposed the ambition of fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only did those two disciples have such an evil ambition, but the others had it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The other ten were very indignant over the request of these two, indicating that all twelve disciples were exactly the same.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They were the same in their ambition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We all must be aware of this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Deep within all of us there is the hidden ambition to be a leader and to be above others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We don't like to be under anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Instead, we desire others to be under us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This thought in our fallen nature originated from Satan and is absolutely against the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As He dealt with this situation, the Lord Jesus set up an excellent example for us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He told the mother that He was not authorized to give her sons such a position, that only the Father had the authority to decide where to place her two sons.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thus, the Lord Jesus Himself took a submissive position, thereby setting a proper example for all His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the kingdom of the heavens there should be no ambition for position.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In a sense, there is not even any position.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord Jesus said, "Whoever wants to become great among you shall be your servant, And whoever wants to be first among you shall be your slave" Matt 20:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord said that we should be not only servants, but bondslaves, slaves sold to others.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then He presented Himself as an example, saying, "The Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve" 20:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>After the Lord Jesus said this, every mouth was shut.</S>
