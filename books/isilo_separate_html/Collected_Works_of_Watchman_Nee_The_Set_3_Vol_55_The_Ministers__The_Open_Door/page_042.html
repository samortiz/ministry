The Lord has graciously taken care of me since school was disbanded, and I have been transferred to the general affairs department of a factory. May the Lord cause me to walk in His will.</p><p>An important town in Taiwan&mdash;Taichung&mdash;is about fifty minutes by car from my home. Three brothers have already begun to have a prayer meeting there. The participants are a student from the agricultural college, a special reporter from the Central News Agency, and a worker from the Third Airplane Factory. Of these three, the college brother already subscribes to all four publications put out by the Gospel Book Room. None of them want to attend worship services in the denominational churches. In addition, the head of the reporters' union, the chief of the Public Security Department, and many other local leaders have believed in the Lord. They want to attend meetings with brothers from the mainland provinces. We now have a small number of brothers praying in one accord in Taichung. We have begun small but will grow bigger. May God accomplish His own work and give us the proper guidance. It will take time to ripen. The brothers are now together watching and praying earnestly. It takes one day to get to Taipei, and we have to travel during the night. It is difficult to do this, and it harms our health and work. Since the Lord has now given us a small number of brothers as a foundation, we believe He will bless us. Most importantly, we ask the brothers and sisters in Shanghai to pray for us, as Moses prayed for Joshua during the battle. We have written a letter asking the brothers and sisters in Taipei to pray for us also.</p><p>We have begun meeting in the home of a brother in Taichung. Some people want to rent the local Kuomintang Party hall. A small number of brothers feel that we do not need to be so ostentatious. They feel we should have a solid foundation before spreading out, lest we bring on unnecessary misunderstandings. We want to pursue peace with all men. At this point in my writing, I feel like thanking the Lord in tears for arranging for my time in Taichung. The person who introduced me to this place has already left, but I am still in Taichung county. By the Lord's grace, we are in a battle against Satan. May the Lord give us sharp weapons to fight the good spiritual fight!</p><p>Sincerely,<br />Kao Xuan-zhen<br />October 13, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: Fuli Sinchun, 56 Dadu, Taichung, Taiwan</p><h2 class="head2">An Answer</h2><p>A meeting place should not be established in the Provincial Political Party Office. The things of Caesar and the things of Christ should be separate. If local officials want to participate, they must be clean in their conduct, pure in their faith, and at the same time, they must have the desire to walk with us. We can receive them as brothers, but we can never receive them as government officials. If anyone retains his official status in a church, that church must be torn down.</p><p>Witness<br />October 20, 1948</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> </body></html>
