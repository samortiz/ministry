   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE THE NATURE OF GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>On the first evening we discussed the problem of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Last night we spoke about God's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, we did not finish these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we will continue the two previous messages and cover the matters of grace and sin further.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, we have to see what is the nature of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>What characteristics does grace have?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We treasure the love of God, for without God's love as the source, there would not be the flow of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The flow of salvation issues from the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>At the same time, without God's mercy there would be no possibility of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Because God has shown mercy on us, He has given us His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God's salvation is the concrete expression of God's love.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hence, we treasure love, and we also treasure mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the most precious of all that reaches us is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Love is indeed good, but it does not give any concrete benefit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Mercy is also very good, but it also does not bring us any direct benefit; however with grace there is a direct benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Hence, grace is more precious.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The New Testament is filled, not with the love of God, nor with the mercy of God, but with the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Grace is God's love coming forth to accomplish something for the fallen, lost, and perishing sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we not only have an abstract love and a sentimental mercy, but we have grace to meet our needs in a concrete way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may think that it is wonderful enough if God is merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A fleshly or fleshy person will think that mercy is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Old Testament is filled with words of mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are not many words on grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When man is in the flesh, he thinks that mercy is enough, that there is no need for grace.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He thinks this way because he does not consider sin to be something serious.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If man were without food or clothing or housing, mercy would not be adequate; there would also be the need of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But the problem with sin is not a lack of food, clothing, or housing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The problem with sin is unrest in man's conscience and judgment before God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this, man thinks that if only God would be merciful to us and be a bit more lenient, everything would be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If God would overlook our sins, it would be good enough for us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In our hearts we hope that God would be merciful to us and let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man's concept is to let go and to overlook.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But God cannot mercifully overlook our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He cannot let us get by loosely.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He must deal thoroughly with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Not only does God have to show mercy on us; He has to give us grace as well.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What issues out from God's love is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God is not satisfied with mercy alone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We think that if there were mercy and that if God would let us go and not reckon with us, everything would be fine.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But God did not say that since He has pity on us He would let us go.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is not the way God works.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When God works, He must do so in harmony with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Therefore, God's love cannot stop with mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His love must extend into grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He must deal thoroughly with the problem of our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the problem of sins were something that could be overlooked, God's mercy would be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But to Him, letting us go and overlooking our sins are not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Thus to have mercy alone is not sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He must settle the matter of sins thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Here we see the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is why the New Testament, though not void of mercy, is full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In it we see how the Son of God, Jesus Christ, has come to the world to show forth grace and to become grace so that we might receive grace.</S>
