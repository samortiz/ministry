AND EXHORTING FATHERS</h2>
<p>As we pointed out in the previous chapter, the church service is not mainly for doing things but for taking care of persons. Our present training is not to build up our skill to be a leader, to usher, or to arrange chairs. I have no intention to carry out this kind of training. Chair arranging is not for chair arranging itself, and ushering is not for ushering itself. If we do a good job merely in the practical matters but do not take care of anyone, we are a failure. This is the way of a worldly corporation. Whatever we do in the church life is for the care of persons. It is easy to do practical things, but to take care of persons is much more difficult. If a sister asks us to clean her house, we may do it in half a day, but if she asks us to take care of her children, we would certainly refuse, because to do that is not &ldquo;in our blood.&rdquo; Before a young sister is married, it may be very difficult to regulate her. After she is married and has children, however, there is no need to regulate her. Her children become very skillful regulators, and she is willing to be regulated. Previously she may have refused to do dirty jobs, but now she will happily do the dirtiest job. This is because she now has a mother&rsquo;s &ldquo;blood.&rdquo; She does it because she loves her children.</p>
<p>First Thessalonians 2:7 says, &ldquo;We were gentle in your midst, as a nursing mother would cherish her own children.&rdquo; To cherish is not merely to do a job or to carry out a business; it is to care for a living person. Verse 11 says, &ldquo;Just as you know how we were to each one of you, as a father to his own children, exhorting you and consoling you and testifying.&rdquo; Paul nourished the Thessalonians as a mother and exhorted them as a father. The apostle was not a businessman or a school master. He was a nourishing mother and an exhorting father. He had an interest in people. If we do not have an interest in people, we are finished with the church service; we are not qualified to serve. We should not say that only the apostle Paul could be like this. What the apostle did is an example for all the believers. We are not apostles, but we should still be nursing mothers. Even the brothers must nourish others as a mother, and the sisters should exhort others as a father. This does not depend on our being male or a female; it depends on the kind of heart we have. A sister can have the heart of a father, and a brother can have the heart of a mother.</p>
<p>This passage shows what the apostle Paul was in the Lord&rsquo;s service. He did not consider himself to be a great man. He considered himself as a small nursing mother and an exhorting, consoling father. His heart was the heart of a mother and of a father (2 Cor. 12:14-15). The heart of a mother is altogether for the care of her children, and the heart of a father is for their upbringing. Even if a mother keeps her house clean and in order, she will condemn herself if she neglects her children. To care for her children is of the first importance; to clean the house is the last. In the church service we should all have such a heart. Strictly speaking, we do not care for keeping the chairs. We care for keeping the persons. The keeping of chairs will not enter into the New Jerusalem, but the keeping of persons will go on forever.</p>
<p>I am afraid that too many of us in the church service care only for the practical service, not for the persons. We need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy to properly exercise our heart. This is a great test to us. Some of us were born in such a way that we do not care for anyone. This is according to our natural disposition. Hallelujah, we have been reborn in another way! We have been reborn, not into a natural family but into the church. This is another birth with another disposition that is absolutely different. The disposition of our new birth is one that sacrifices our self, our soul, and even our lives for the care of others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TESTIMONY OF THE MISSIONARIES IN CHINA</h2>
<p>In the latter part of the nineteenth and the first part of the twentieth centuries a number of missions sent missionaries into the field. Most of the missions tested their new applicants, but not in the way of testing only their knowledge of the Bible. Hudson Taylor was the founder of the China Inland Mission, one of the greatest mission works. One day he made an appointment for a young applicant to come for an interview. When the applicant arrived, Taylor asked him to wait for another twenty minutes. Then at the end of the twenty minutes, he sent word to the applicant to wait for another twenty minutes. At this point, the young applicant was a little offended, but since he still desired to get into this mission, he exercised his patience. A third time and a fourth time, Taylor asked the young man to wait for yet another twenty minutes. After the fourth delay, the young man was unable to tolerate it, and he walked out. Taylor said that it was right for him to leave. If he would go to China, he would have to wait many times longer for one person to be saved.</p>
<p>Missions such as these were the Lord&rsquo;s work at that time to send His gospel to the uttermost parts of the earth. When I was a small boy, I observed the situation of the missionaries. Those dear saints who went on the mission were very much disciplined by the Lord to have a heart for the heathen peoples, and it was through them&mdash;not through their preaching or teaching but through what they were&mdash;that many were saved. It is difficult to imagine what manner of patience, endurance, and attitude they expressed to those unbelieving heathen. This touched the conscience of the people, and it opened the door of the gospel.</p>
<p>The ancient and great country of China was extremely conservative at that time. The Boxer Movement of 1900 intended to kill the Westerners in China and all the Chinese Christians who followed the &ldquo;Western religion.&rdquo; However, the people respected a certain older Presbyterian missionary named Mr. Corbett. Mr. Corbett could not speak eloquently, but he had a heart to love the people. He loved everyone, and he gave whatever he had to them. Eventually, everyone came to know that this was an American who was for everyone but himself. Therefore, even the Boxers proclaimed a slogan: &ldquo;Kill all the Westerners and their followers, except Mr. Corbett.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The American Presbyterian mission came to my province in China around the middle of the 1800s. The leaders of the villages gave the order that whoever saw a foreigner approaching should sound a gong for warning. All the streets would clear, the doors would close, and no one would come out. Because of this, one American missionary would hide next to a door. After several hours when the people inside would open the door to look outside, he would place a stick in the door, and then he would insert his foot. Although the people inside resisted, he was eventually able to enter. According to ancient Chinese custom, every home had a corner for grinding grain. People would mostly use mules to do the grinding, but if mules were not available, they would have to use manpower. When the missionary entered into the yard, the family would come to beat him and chase him out. However, he would find the grinding stone and begin to grind the grain for them. This changed the atmosphere. The family would go away to do other things, leaving the &ldquo;foreign devil&rdquo; to do the grinding. After several hours the mother would send one of the boys to take him a cup of water. It was in this way that the heart of that family was touched and the door of the gospel was opened to them. What a burden this missionary bore, and what an interest he had in people! Those who were saved through this kind of endurance were never able to forget it, and they took the same way to preach to others. This was the way that opened the doors in China.</p>
<p>From this account we can see what touches people&rsquo;s heart and what kind of burden we need to bear. Today we are not in the ancient, exclusive, conservative China. We are in America, a modern country. However, this modern country has its modern demons to keep people away from the Lord. To be sure, we need to pray for people, but there is also the need for genuine care for their souls. If we have the heart to care, we will have a way. Love can do everything; there is nothing impossible with love (1 Cor. 13:7). If we have an intensified burden and care for people, there will be a way to express this care.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Normal Way of Fruit-bearing and Shepherding for the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
