   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A SERIOUS PROBLEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Most Christians only put to death the negative aspects of their natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They treasure the good aspects and seek to preserve them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Those of every nationality treasure their own national characteristics and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Chinese may pride themselves on their philosophical ethics, whereas Americans may boast of their frankness and openness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hardly any Christians are willing to drop their national characteristics in order to live out the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although we may be willing to put so many other things to death, we hold these national characteristics as a priceless treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not treasure these characteristics consciously, we do so subconsciously.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As a result, a basic element of our natural life is not put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This element then becomes a huge rock hindering the release of the power of Christ s resurrection from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Treasuring part of our natural life creates a serious problem with respect to the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are not willing for a certain part of our being to be put to death and conformed to the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, this part of our natural life remains as a frustration to the release of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the reason that, after years of seeking the Lord and experiencing Him, we may reach a place where we find ourselves stopped and unable to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the early stages of our Christian life, we may have grown rather quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But because the rock of our national characteristics remains within us, our growth in life is now held back.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Many of us can testify that this is precisely our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some saints have been stopped by this rock for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Year after year has passed, but they remain the same.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They have not made any further spiritual progress.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The reason for this shortage is that they have not put to death their national characteristics and counted them as refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These saints may be willing to count everything else as refuse, but not their national characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some may proclaim that they count all things as refuse, but at least this one matter remains, hidden within them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>May the Lord shine on us and show us our lack and the reason for it!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reason for our lack of progress is that we have not been conformed to Christ s death in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Years ago, you may have had much more conformity to Christ s death than today.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because you have not progressed in being conformed to the death of Christ, your growth in life has been held back, and your experience of the power of Christ s resurrection has been severely limited.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This hinders you from further and higher experiences of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Thus, instead of speaking of up-to-date experiences, you try to live on your past experiences and speak of them again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>PROCESSED IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 11 Paul goes on to say, If by any means I may attain to the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>To attain means to arrive at.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This requires us to run triumphantly the race for the prize 1 Cor 9:24-26; 2 Tim 4:7-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The out-resurrection from among the dead denotes the outstanding resurrection, the extra-resurrection, which will be a prize to the overcoming saints.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All believers who are dead in Christ will participate in the resurrection from among the dead at the Lord s coming back 1 Thes 4:16; 1 Cor 15:52 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But the overcoming saints will enjoy an extra, outstanding portion of that resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the better resurrection mentioned in Hebrews 11:35.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The better resurrection is not only the first resurrection Rev 20:4-6 , the resurrection of life John 5:28-29 , but also the out-resurrection, the resurrection in which the Lord s overcomers will receive the reward of the kingdom, which the apostle Paul sought after.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>To arrive at the out-resurrection means that our entire being has been gradually and continually resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God first resurrected our deadened spirit Eph 2:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then from our spirit He proceeds to resurrect our soul Rom 8:6 and our mortal body Rom 8:11 , until our entire being spirit, soul, and body is fully resurrected out of our old being by His life and with His life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is a process in life through which we must pass and a race for us to run until we arrive at the out-resurrection as the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Hence, the out-resurrection should be the goal and destination of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We can only reach this goal by being conformed to the death of Christ, by living a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the death of Christ we are processed in resurrection from the old creation to the new.</S>
