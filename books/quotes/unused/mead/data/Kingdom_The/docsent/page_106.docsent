   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TAKING THE KINGDOM BY VIOLENCE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now proceed to chapter eleven where we see even more principles of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One of the principles revealed in this chapter is that we must be violent against all opposition to the kingdom of God 11:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not be so nice or we will be unable to enter the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We must be violent for the sake of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, if there is no opposition to my walking through a door, I may walk in nicely as a gentleman.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>However, if some enemies oppose my entry and attempt to frustrate me, I must be violent and use force in order to enter.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was what the Lord Jesus had in mind when He spoke about the time of John the Baptist's ministry, which was a transitional period.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was neither the Old Testament age nor the New Testament age.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>John proclaimed the kingdom saying, "Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>By making this proclamation, he aroused strong opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When the Lord Jesus appeared, He proclaimed the same message.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This preaching of the kingdom aroused opposition from the religious people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The chief opposition against the kingdom came from Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was very difficult for anyone to enter into the kingdom at that time because the Pharisees, Sadducees, and priests opposed their entry.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By their opposition, they became enemies of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Although the entrance was pointed out and even opened by John the Baptist and the Lord Jesus, the Jewish people rose up in opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you wanted to enter into the kingdom at that time, you had to be violent.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The same principle applies today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you want to get into the proper church life, you need to be at least a little violent because the opposers, criticizers, and enemies are fighting to keep you out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since they make every attempt to frustrate you, what should you do?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You must be violent!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Our present environment is much the same as the one which was created after John's preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When John came and proclaimed the kingdom, immediately the Pharisees, Sadducees, scribes, and priests rose up to oppose.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the Lord's word, everyone who entered the kingdom during that time had to be violent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Do you think today's situation is different?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is the same.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since the local church has been proclaimed in this country, the opposition has been stirred up.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I am not trying to be wild, and I am not teaching you to be tough and rough.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not want you to be rough, but I do expect that you will be violent for the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>NO OUTWARD REGULATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Let us go on to see another principle of the kingdom related to John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In speaking about John the Baptist, the Lord Jesus established this principle: in the kingdom, unlike in religion, there are no regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Judaism, there are many regulations about eating and drinking.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When John the Baptist came not eating and drinking in a normal way, people said that he was possessed with a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the Lord Jesus came both eating and drinking, they called Him a wine drinker and a gluttonous man 11:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They said John the Baptist was demon-possessed for not eating and drinking, and they said the Lord Jesus was gluttonous because He did eat and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You may ask, Which is right to eat or not to eat? to drink or not to drink?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Judaism has many regulations about these matters, but in the kingdom there are no such regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This does not mean, however, that there is looseness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Rather, in the kingdom there are the children of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Wisdom is justified by her children 11:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All of the kingdom people are children of wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is wisdom and who is wisdom?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Christ is wisdom and we are His children.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, it is no longer a matter of outward regulation, but of inward life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We are not regulated outwardly; we are controlled and directed inwardly by the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The kingdom has no outward regulations, for the kingdom people are the children of wisdom, the children of God, who have the life of Christ.</S>
