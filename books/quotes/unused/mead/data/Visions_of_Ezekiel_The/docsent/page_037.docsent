   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ELEVEN GOD'S JUDGMENT UPON HIS PEOPLE Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>8:2-4, 10; 9:3a; 11:22-24; 10:2; 22:17-22; 14:21; 12:15; 7:21; 33:21; 3:17; 9:4; 6:8; 11:16, 17; 20:40; 17:22-23; 21:10, 27; 29:21 THE BASIS OF GOD'S JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we need to see the basis of God's judgment upon His people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God's judgment upon His people was based upon three things: His righteousness, His holiness, and His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the first section of Ezekiel, in the vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord, we saw three main things.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First, we saw a throne which looked like a blue sapphire, signifying the righteousness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We also saw the fire, which signifies God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, we saw the glowing electrum which signifies the glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These three things give us three basic colors.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The throne in the appearance of sapphire was blue, the fire was red, and the glowing electrum was yellow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When these three basic colors shine, reflect, and refract together, they give the appearance of the rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The righteousness, the holiness, and the glory of God are the basic elements with which God exercised His judgment over His people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's Glory versus Idols</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Ezekiel 2 24 there are some negative things which are versus the righteousness, the holiness, and the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's glory is contrasted with the idols in 8:2-4, 10, and in 9:3.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the vision, Ezekiel was brought to Jerusalem and entered the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before him the glory of God and the idols were contrasted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the walls were the images of the idols, and over the temple was the glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How could the glory of the Lord tolerate the presence of the images of the idols?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those images were called the "provoking" images because they were provoking God's jealousy 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our God is a jealous God; He will not tolerate any idols.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of the idols in the temple, the glory of God was withdrawing step by step, leaving the temple, the city, and the people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the last step the glory of the Lord left the temple and the city, stopping on the Mount of Olives on the east side of the city 11:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the same place where the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The glory of the Lord stopped on the mountain and waited, but eventually it left the mountain and went back to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>That was the departure of the glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's judgment upon His people is based first upon His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Anything that is versus His glory will provoke His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I do not like to be a bad man and to speak negatively of others, but I must speak the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you not realize that today all of Christianity is under God's judgment?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The whole situation in Christianity is provoking God's jealousy because it is full of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you go into a Roman Catholic Church, you will see that it is full of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even other so-called Christian churches also have idols.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In some of the churches, you will not see physical idols, but you will see other kinds of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>With some their work for God is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>With others Bible teaching or evangelism is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In every corner of Christianity, there is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you love your work, your activity, or your practice more than the Lord, that is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Based upon this principle, we can realize that Christianity is filled with idols.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is why I say that the situation in Christianity is provoking to God and under His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God's glory cannot tolerate the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God's Holiness versus Dross</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God's holiness is God's separation and sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God's holiness is versus dross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As God's elect, Israel should have no dross, but instead be pure gold, pure silver, and a pure treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But God's people became dross 22:17-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, they needed a fire to burn them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord said that He would put the city of Jerusalem and the people of Israel into a furnace to burn them.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is God's holiness versus the dross.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God's holiness cannot tolerate any kind of dross.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Look at today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Where can you find a pure treasure to God?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Nearly everywhere you look there is only dross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christianity needs the burning of God's holy fire to burn out the dross.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The love, kindness, and humility that many Christians express today with one another is a kind of dross because it is altogether according to their flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In their love, there is no pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In their humility and kindness, there is no pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is not pure; it is a mixture; it is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today they love, but tomorrow they hate.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means their love is not pure and holy.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>What they have is only the flesh doing good things and expressing something in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Though it may be a good expression, it is still the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is no dealing of the cross and no dealing of God's holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All these things need to be burned and judged.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They need God's judgment by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Not only does our hatred need to be burned, but also even our love needs to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Not only does our pride need to be burned, but also our humility needs to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Where in Christianity is any pure gold?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Nearly everywhere there is only dross.</S>
