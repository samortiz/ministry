There are a good number of new ones among us who have been saved into the Lord's recovery in recent years. Many of them are very open and seeking. This is very encouraging. This is the result in the blessing of the Lord's new way. Thank the Lord that we are here for this way, yet thus far one thing has not been ministered into our being.</P><P>We always think, talk, act, work, and do things according to what our being is. We were meeting, serving, and preaching the gospel in the old way for many years. Our practice in the past was too much in a natural way. Our thought concerning meeting, serving the Lord, and carrying out the preaching of the gospel so that sinners might be brought to the Lord is still according to the natural concept. The natural concept today in Christianity is to have preaching meetings. We believe in the preaching by one professional person who has great capacity, ability, gift, and function. I would not say that this does not work. It does work to a certain extent. But through these recent years, under the Lord's mercy, the Lord has shown me that this way is natural.</P><P>Then we may ask, "What way is not natural?" The personal contact with people is the way which is not natural. Recently, a number of small churches have been raised up in southern California. These churches were not started by any worker or by any professional work. They began through brothers who moved to these new places. A number of the working saints among us could not afford a house in a big city, so they moved to suburbs and small towns. The dear saints in these small places brought in new ones, but not through preaching meetings or conferences. They brought them in through personal contact.</P><P>A group of about five or six families may move to a new locality. Then they can gather together with the Word, with the Spirit, in the Lord's name, and in the light of the recovery. When the saints move to new places, they just need to live the recovery. When ten saints are raised up in a new place, they may simply come together and have the Lord's table. They do not need to declare that they are taking the ground. Although elders have not been appointed among them, they have spontaneously become the church there. The raising up of these new churches is evidence of the profit of gaining people for the Lord by our personal contact.</P><P>Thousands of people were saved in Jerusalem in the early days of the church. But eventually the Lord allowed a great persecution to occur. Acts 8:1 says, "And there occurred in that day a great persecution against the church which was in Jerusalem; and all were scattered throughout the regions of Judea and Samaria, except the apostles." All the saints, thousands of them, were scattered to preach the gospel. Verse 4 says, "Those therefore who were scattered went throughout the land announcing as the gospel the word." Their being scattered issued in the spreading of the gospel. New ones were brought in not by preaching meetings but by each saint's personal preaching and personal contact with others. I did not see this in the past as emphatically as I do now.</P><P>Years ago I thought that in order to gain people, we had to have a proper preacher with a big meeting. The saints could be used as a means to bring people to this meeting. By listening to the preaching, these people could be saved. We did this for years. I thought in the past that this practice was needed and was prevailing. Today I realize that it was not that prevailing. During the past seventy years of our history, from 1920 to the present time, that way never brought us an increase of over twenty percent. I have been in the recovery for sixty-one years, and I have seen this through my experience. We found out that the old way of one person speaking and the rest listening was not that satisfactory.</P><P>By the Lord's mercy, the recovery has spread to all the continents. There are over thirteen hundred churches throughout the earth. Most of these local churches, though, are small. Of course, according to history, there has not been a church in Christianity which has continuously had an increase of thirty percent. If any church had a continual increase of even twenty percent, that would be a very flourishing church. We have not reached this percentage of increase in a continual way. We have to admit that the old way of having preaching meetings with a gifted preacher is not the spiritual way. That is the natural way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CONTACTING PEOPLE BY OURSELVES<br>DIRECTLY, PERSONALLY, AND CONTINUALLY<br>TO BEAR REMAINING FRUIT</H2><P>Now I want to come to my point. If you would receive mercy from the Lord to live Him, to live for Him, and to preach Him to gain sinners for Him, just do it yourself. Do not trust in any preacher. Do not expect to get help from any speaker. Just gain people for the Lord yourself. Surely you can save one person within one year. I am burdened that we have a breakthrough in this matter. I am looking to the Lord that each one of you would make a decision to get one person saved for the church life every year. In the natural realm, it is normal for people to have children. But today for us Christians who love the Lord, it seems difficult to bring forth a spiritual child. The Lord told us in John 15 that He is the vine and we are the branches (v. 5). He appointed us to go and bring forth remaining fruit (v. 16). We all should desire fruit that remains.</P><P>In these recent years, we have stressed the truth concerning fruit bearing in John 15 again and again. We may have prayed, "Lord, we hate barrenness. We want to bear much fruit." But the bringing forth of fruit among us has not entered into the God-ordained, practical way. We are still mostly in the natural way. We may wonder what the God-ordained, practical way is. We need to realize that as believers, we must and we should bear fruit. We have to bring forth children. Then we must gain a certain amount of skill in bringing forth fruit. We have to learn how to bear fruit and to practice fruit bearing continually.</P><P>As believers, as members of Christ, and as branches of the vine, we must bear fruit. The Lord said that if any branch did not bear fruit, it would be cut off (John 15:2a, 6). To be cut off is not to suffer eternal perdition but to lose the enjoyment of Christ in the organic union with Him. It is serious not to bear fruit. Many of us, however, do not have a serious consideration about our barrenness.</P><P>Some brothers and sisters have been faithful in the recovery and for the recovery for many years, but I have observed that they have not borne fruit. They love the church, they are for the church, and they support the church financially, but they are not bearing fruit. They should realize that not to bear fruit is a serious thing before the Lord. The Lord wants us to have a spiritual life in the church, to go to the meetings, to worship Him, and to live Him. But what is all this for? If all the saints in the church were like this, yet no one bore any fruit, the church would eventually die out. If the people of a nation did not bear children, the nation would eventually become extinct. The most basic, crucial, and vital thing is for us to bring forth children.</P><P>By His mercy, I have found out that to bring forth spiritual children, you must make a serious decision to contact people directly. Do not trust in preachers and in preaching meetings. Just trust in your direct, personal, continual contact with people. I assure you that if you make such a decision, you will at least bring two people to the Lord yearly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A SIMPLE WAY TO BEAR REMAINING FRUIT</H2><P>I would like to present a simple way to bear fruit. First, you should make a vow to the Lord. You can pray, "Lord, as one of Your branches, I realize that I must bear fruit according to Your charge in John 15. If I cannot get one sinner saved within a year, this is a shame. Lord, every week I will spend two or three hours to contact people for their salvation." This is the principle. This does not mean that you have to spend two or three hours at one time in one day. You may spend some time in the morning to consider how to contact and save your unsaved relatives. You may spend twenty-five minutes to pray and make a record of these relatives. These twenty-five minutes should be reckoned as part of your two to three hours of labor in the gospel every week. In the evening you may write a letter to one of your relatives to find out how he is doing, opening the door for you to have further contact with him. The time spent in writing this letter is also a part of your gospel labor. Let us suppose that you have five unsaved cousins. If you labored three hours a week on these cousins in a concentrated way for one year, surely at least one of them would be brought to the Lord.</P><P>In order to be fruit-bearing branches of Christ, we need to be revived by the Lord day by day. Our publication called The Holy Word for Morning Revival has been a help to the saints to be revived by the Lord every morning. The most effective way to live the Christian life is by having a vital, living, active morning watch with the Lord. We should get two verses from the Scripture to live on every day and then contact people for the Lord in a definite way. In addition to this, we need to bear fruit. The reason why we do not bear fruit is because we do not practice contacting people directly, personally, and faithfully.</P><P>I would beg you elders to learn to have a start in this. You yourself have to do it. Do not expect others to do it. You yourself do this one thing. Practice personally contacting people every week. Contact them individually. You can contact your relatives, friends, neighbors, colleagues, classmates, etc. You need to plan and schedule your time so that you contact two or three individuals every week. You should pray, "Lord, I do not want to contact them in a natural way. I do not want to have natural talk when I meet with them. Lord, show me the vital way, the living way, to bring them to You." If you pray such a prayer, the Lord will show you. Today there is the need of some faithful doers in the practice of fruit bearing.</P><P>We need to practice contacting people. We may contact someone without any success or result. Then we can go to the Lord to repent and open to Him for His adjustment. He will impress us to go back to them in a certain way. When we follow the Lord to contact people according to His way, they will be saved. As we go out to contact people one by one, we will find out the proper way from the Lord. We will also find out the right persons to visit. We will learn not to waste our time. We have found that just to knock on doors in a general way can be a waste of time. We must look to the Lord to get a proper candidate for our labor. Then we need to work on him in a proper way. This is the successful way to labor in the gospel. The ones on whom we labor should be those with whom we are acquainted, either directly or indirectly. In this way the time we spend will be worthwhile.</P><P>Whether or not this can be worked out depends upon our endeavoring. We cannot just make an announcement in the meeting, encouraging others to go. We ourselves have to go. We should start by ourselves and then get a companion to labor with us. After half a year, we can bring forth four new ones who will labor in the same way that we are. For the destiny of the church in our locality, this is needed. We have wasted too much of our time. We must make a budget to be very economical in the way that we spend our time. We need to redeem our time by praying for our acquaintances and relatives, writing them letters, and sending them booklets. Then we can make appointments to go see them. As we labor, we need to learn with an honest and sincere heart. We need to learn how to talk to people and how to gain them within a short period of time. If we endeavor like this, we can bring at least two persons to the Lord yearly as remaining fruit. We may baptize more than five, but out of the five, two will remain in the church.</P><P>Keep this in mind&#151;you must practice this yourself. I beg you to forget about having preachers and preaching meetings. That does not work so well. Just practice visiting people one by one personally and directly. Then after a short time, maybe two or three weeks, other saints will follow you to be your companions. Then you will have a start of the practice of fruit bearing in your locality. You must spend your time on the right persons in the right way. In order to gain a valuable result, you must labor.</P><P>Do not trust in preachers with large preaching meetings. That will waste your time and delay others. You yourself must have a start in the practice of fruit bearing in such a strict way. Every week you should spend two to three hours to contact individuals. You should carry this out as a business. Then you will see the results. I hope and pray for this. I believe that the Lord will eventually work this out, making each one of His lovers a winner of sinners.</P><P>You must go to contact people one by one by yourself directly through planning. You do not necessarily need to go out to knock on doors. We have found that going out to knock on doors is good, but it does not work that definitely. We must take a way so that we can bear fruit in a definite way. Just plan how to contact your acquaintances. Every week you should spend two to three hours on the gospel in this way. Do not send others. You must make a vow with the Lord that you would plan, schedule your time, and find a way to contact your acquaintances directly, at least once a week. If you take any other way, the result will not be that definite. The definite result only comes out of your plan and out of your schedule. Otherwise, you will waste your time.</P><P>You do not need to announce anything to the church. If the saints in the church remain the way they are, do not blame or condemn them. Rather, go along with the church, and help it to go on. But you yourself need to labor in a definite way to gain people. New ones will then be brought into the church life through you, and everyone will see this.</P><P>I would especially like to talk to the elders among us who are full-time. Among the saints, you have to be the examples, the living ones who get three to five people saved every six months. Then you can labor so that one or two of them will remain in the church life. It is not pleasant to see our co-workers serving the Lord full-time and yet not bringing anyone to the Lord within a year. We must labor in the gospel definitely. We have to bring forth some children by ourselves. We should be able to point to some who are our spiritual children. We have to study how to contact people ourselves. We still have much to learn in contacting people. Just to copy what others do does not work. The Lord will show us. If we are definite and desperate to gain people, we will find a way.</P><P>You need to contact people directly and individually, laboring in the gospel two to three hours every week. You should find out who is available for you to contact and then contact them directly and continually over a long period of time. You will gain one of them. If you take this way of directly contacting people one by one, I can assure you that you will bring two people into the church every year. You should make a decision and tell the Lord that you will spend two to three hours every week in the gospel. Then ask the Lord to lead you to contact people one by one. You should not stop going to the church meetings. You should still live your regular church life. You do not need to promote what you are doing. You just need to go and do it. Then gradually some will see what you are doing, and they will join you.</P><P>We have tried many ways in the last six years, and they may work, but they do not work satisfactorily. Only the way of contacting people directly brings a satisfactory result. We need to plan how to contact our acquaintances. We have to keep working on one of them directly, individually, and continuously. To get someone saved and established takes about six months, and to bring them into the church will take another six months. We may think that to bring one or two a year into the church life is too slow. But this slow way is actually the quick way. If twenty are meeting together in a locality, and five of them bring two people into the church life, that is a fifty percent increase. I can assure you that this can be worked out. Any other way will waste our time.</P><P>As branches of the Lord, we should give Him three hours a week for the gospel. Then we can pray, "Lord, lead me, teach me, and give me the wisdom in planning, in scheduling my time, in making appointments, and in talking to people." Then we should practice this directly and definitely. Surely we will gain people for the Lord's kingdom.</P><P>We have to change our concept concerning having a preacher with a preaching meeting. We ourselves need to labor directly to bring one or two into the church life yearly. This should be a goal in our labor. We love the church, but we may not have brought one person into the church in the past five years. We must have a definite beginning. We must practice contacting people to bring definite fruit into the church. We also need to practice the church life in group meetings and in larger prophesying meetings. This is really needed. But we need the adequate number as a base for our practice of the church life. The elders need to work two to three hours in the gospel every week to bring one or two remaining fruit into the church within a year. If the elders do this, others will rise up to follow. We should not give any announcement about this or promote it. We have been doing this for years, with little result. Promotion does not work. We need to labor ourselves to build up a living example.</P><P>This is altogether up to our decision. Would we still remain in the natural way, or would we turn to this way, a way full of the need for learning? A working brother's job may occupy him to the uttermost, but he should still endeavor to save some time every week for definite laboring in the gospel. Many of us have been busy working for years with little result. We must change our way.</P><P>We must have a plan for reaching people. We should make a list of all our acquaintances and study their situation. Then we can work on them according to our study. This is the way to gain the proper persons. We should not leave our bearing of fruit to fortune. It is not a matter of fortune but a matter of labor. We all have acquaintances for whom we can pray. We need to consider them and pray for them. We need to study their situation and decide when the best time would be for us to visit them. Farmers do not labor in a loose way. They study the situation of their land, their crops, and the weather, and they labor accordingly so that they can reap a proper harvest. We need to be the same way in our labor to gain people. We must have a plan and a schedule to labor on people two to three hours every week. We need to learn how to gain people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LABORING IN A PERSONAL WAY<br>FOR THE INCREASE OF THE CHURCH</H2><P>I would ask the elders if they are happy about the increase in their locality. We must make a strong decision to labor in a personal way for the increase of the church. We should schedule our time for the weekly preaching of the gospel. For the Lord's recovery we all need a turn from barrenness to fruitfulness. We need the new ones. We need "new blood," newly saved ones. All the local churches must pay attention to this. If our number remains the same year after year, the saints may eventually lose interest in serving. Instead of being busy in the church life, they may become busy in a negative way. Mothers with young children are consumed with taking care of them. They do not have much time for other things. The only rescue for us is to change our way so that we can gain the increase. This is the only remedy.</P><P>If we cannot gain a thirty percent increase in a year, we should consider that as a failure. A twenty percent increase is good, but not that good. If twenty out of one hundred saints take this way, they can bring in at least thirty yearly. We do not need the whole church to work in this way. But it is altogether reasonable, logical, and possible that one-fifth of the saints will work in this way. Then we can gain a thirty percent increase yearly. This increase will stir up the interest of the whole church.</P><P>This burden has been on my heart for a long time. The increase of the local churches is disappointing. Many churches have been existing for years with under one hundred saints. This has caused me great concern. In the physical realm, the parents are eventually concerned that their children have children. If the parents have five children, and none of them has any children, the parents will be bothered and disappointed. Not to beget children is a serious thing. The increase of the churches is the key point to us today. I have been in the Lord's interest for about sixty-five years. I have no trust in any kind of revival. We found out by history and through our history that big gospel campaigns do not work for the long run.</P><P>The Lord needs some of His saints to practice the priesthood of the gospel according to His ordained way. Then the Lord will have a way. The way of revival with big speakers does not work so well. What we need today is the proper increase due to our labor. If we labor faithfully, we will see the result. We need at least twenty percent of the saints among us to labor in this way. These ones can bring a thirty percent increase to the church. This will lay a foundation for the Lord to start a solid building up of His Body. In the local churches, the basic number with the basic, promising members is short. We need solid members for the solid building. We have to look to the Lord for His mercy that this work could be started among us.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE NEED IN THE ELDERSHIP<br>IN THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY<br>AND<br>THE NEED FOR MORE FELLOWSHIP<br>AMONG THE CHURCHES<br>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H1><P>In this chapter we first want to see the real and scriptural way for the elders to shepherd the churches. I am burdened for this because we have had a change in our practice of the church life. The Lord's mercy has brought us through to our present situation. Even though I still expect to see more, I feel comforted that the Lord has brought His recovery into His ordained way. No one can deny that we are now in a changed situation.</P><P>But we need to see that for the fulfillment of the Lord's ordained way, the eldership is crucial. Whether the new way will be a success or a failure all depends upon the eldership. The eldership is the key point, the crucial point. We need to see what the eldership should be and what the eldership should do in the Lord's ordained way. I have the burden in this chapter to present a real need in the present situation in the Lord's ordained way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE PRACTICE OF THE LOCAL CHURCHES<br>DEPENDING UPON THE APOSTLES' TEACHING<br>AND THE ELDERSHIP</H2><P>From the very beginning of the Lord's recovery, we have seen very clearly that the practice of the local churches depends upon two things&#151;the teaching and the eldership. The New Testament shows us clearly that the building up of Christ's Body is based upon the apostles' teaching (Acts 2:42). In Matthew 16:18 the Lord said, "Upon this rock I will build My church." For centuries the interpretation of "this rock" has not been properly understood. The rock upon which the church is built is surely Christ Himself, but we need to consider the context of Matthew 16:18 to see something deeper. The Lord was asking His disciples who He was. Eventually Peter said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" (v. 16). The Lord Jesus responded to Peter by telling him, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" (v. 17). The Lord was asking the disciples who He was, but eventually what came out was a revelation concerning Christ being the rock. Therefore, the rock in Matthew 16, strictly speaking, does not refer to Christ directly but to the divine revelation concerning Christ.</P><P>We can see from the Epistles that the Body of Christ, expressed through the local churches in many localities, is built upon the revelation of Christ. The apostles' teaching is the revelation. If we only had the four Gospels and Acts without the Epistles of the apostles in the New Testament, our knowledge concerning Christ would be limited. The Gospels tell us about Christ in His incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. The Epistles go on to tell us about God's economy and His eternal plan to have the Body of Christ.</P><P>The Body of Christ is not directly covered in the four Gospels. Of course, in the Gospel of John the church is revealed as the Father's house in chapter fourteen. The Lord said that in His Father's house there are many abodes (v. 2). The many abodes are the many members of the Body of Christ (Rom. 12:5), which is God's temple (1 Cor. 3:16-17). This is adequately proven by John 14:23, which says that the Lord and the Father will make an abode with the one who loves Him. The church is also revealed as the vine tree in chapter fifteen and as the newborn child in chapter sixteen. But the church as the Body of Christ is not directly mentioned in the four Gospels. Without the Epistles, we cannot see that Christ desires to have a Body.</P><P>John 3 shows us that Christ is the Bridegroom and the church is the bride as the enlargement and increase of the Groom. Of course, the Epistles show that the bride, the increase of Christ as the Groom, is the Body of Christ, the enlargement of Christ. This is like Eve being the enlargement of Adam, the increase of Adam. Eve is a type of the church as Christ's counterpart to be His Body. Even though the bride is mentioned in John 3, we could not thoroughly understand who the bride is without the Epistles. The Body of Christ is clearly taught and unveiled in the apostles' teaching.</P><P>Acts 2:42 says that all the newly saved ones were together to continue their life in the apostles' teaching. The apostles' teaching became the very sphere and element of the building up of the church. Ephesians 2:20 says that the church is being built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets. The revelation the apostles and prophets received concerning Christ is considered the foundation upon which the church is built. The building of the church upon Christ as her foundation is according to the apostles' and prophets' revelation. I hope that we all can see this.</P><P>Many recognize that Christ as the rock is the foundation of the church. Christians today are divided, not over Christ as their foundation but by different teachings. The denominations are not built upon Christ according to the apostles' teaching, but the building up of the local churches depends upon the apostles' teaching.</P><P>Once we come together in the name of the Lord, taking Him as our foundation, what shall we do? To build up the church, the proper teaching is needed. When Brother Nee brought the recovery to us according to the revelation he had received at his time, he actually brought in the teaching. We all stood for the Lord according to his teaching. Of course, our standing and doing was according to the Bible. However, although the Bible is one, the interpretations are many. Christians have argued, for example, over the way to baptize people, and they have been divided because of this. This is just one example of many divisions over different teachings. The basic need for the building up of the Body of Christ is the apostles' teaching. We should have no particular teaching other than the teaching of the apostles, which is the teaching concerning Christ's person and redemptive work and concerning God's economy in faith (2 John 9-11; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; Jude 3; Titus 1:4).</P><P>If we do not have the apostles' teaching, what shall we do? This is like sailing without a compass. Without the apostles' teaching, we do not have the compass, and we do not know the direction to take. Thank the Lord that in His recovery, by His mercy, we do have the apostles' teaching. In the recovery He has given us this clear view.</P><P>The apostles' teaching includes two main and crucial items. These items are revealed in Ephesians 4 and 1 Corinthians 14. Ephesians 4 speaks of one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father (vv. 4-6). Many Christians would agree with these seven "ones." But many would not agree with the revelation in verses 11 through 16. These verses are also a part of the apostles' teaching as a continuation of the seven "ones." They tell us that all the gifted persons are for the perfecting of the saints. Who practices this today? These verses also speak concerning the oneness of the faith and the winds of teaching. They go on to speak about the Body building itself up through the joints of supply and through each one part operating according to its measure. The application and practice of these verses cannot be seen in Christianity.</P><P>First Corinthians 14 is also a part of the apostles' teaching. This chapter reveals that the church meetings are meetings of mutuality, not meetings with one person speaking and the rest listening. All the attendants in the meeting should be speakers. Where can such a thing be seen today? Without the practice of Ephesians 4 and 1 Corinthians 14, how could the Body of Christ be built up? We must hold and practice the entire teaching of the apostles, without selection according to our preference.</P><P>The second need for the building up of the church is the eldership. The New Testament shows us that the building up of the Body of Christ, including all the local churches, involves the gifted persons&#151;the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers (Eph. 4:11-12). These are the ones who give the apostles' teaching. The building up of the Body of Christ also involves the elders. It is the elders who put the apostles' teaching into practice. The apostles teach not only the saints in the churches but also the elders of the churches. Then the elders put the apostles' teaching into practice. The elders should never separate themselves from the apostles' teaching. For the building up of the church, we need the apostles' teaching and the eldership to practice it. We may have the apostles' teaching, but what about the proper eldership to carry it out?</P><P>The eldership is altogether a matter of shepherding. The elders should shepherd the church and take care of the church according to the apostles' teaching. The apostles' teaching in the New Testament shows us that Christ builds up His Body through all of His members. Ephesians 4 shows us that Christ as the ascended Head gave the gifted persons to perfect all the saints to do the same work as they do to build up the Body of Christ. This is the way that Christ takes to build up His Body. The gifted persons should not replace the other saints. They should teach and perfect the saints so that the saints can do the same thing that they do. Then all the members have a share in the building up of the Body. All the members should be put to use. Deformed Christianity puts most of the members aside and leaves the function to a special group of clergy.</P><P>We have to admit that over a period of time, we gradually drifted back to the practice of deformed Christianity. Eventually, the elders among us nearly replaced the saints. All the things of the church were in the hands of the elders and on the shoulders of the elders. The eventual result of this practice was that everyone was fired and replaced with a clergy. The saints were not replaced with Christ but replaced with the elders among us. I am concerned that although the way among us has been changed, our old practice actually still remains. The things concerning the building up of the Body of Christ are still mostly in the hands of the elders.</P><P>I would like to give a testimony of my experience in this matter. After the Second World War, the central government of nationalist China moved back to Nanking. In 1946 the saints in Nanking invited me to come and visit them. Eventually, they asked me to move there with my family to stay with them. I moved there in 1947. They had a meeting with me, which could have been considered as a meeting to initiate me into the service of the church there. I told them in the first message that I had a heavy burden to come to Nanking. Then I said that I was going to unload my burden and transfer it from my shoulders to their shoulders. While I was with them, I did this.</P><P>The elders should realize that the way that our Head, Christ, takes to build up His Body is to use all of His members. In Matthew 25 there is a parable about the Lord's slaves. Some have five talents, some have two talents, and others have one talent. The Lord treasures the one-talented ones. The problem among us is that we trust too much in the five-talented and two-talented ones. By trusting too much in these two categories of people, we spontaneously and unconsciously annul the one-talented ones.</P><P>The God-ordained way which has been brought into the Lord's recovery in these recent years is prevailing to recover the functioning of the members of the Body of Christ. This way annuls the clergy-laity system. Actually, this way revives and resurrects the "laity." Through the God-ordained way, the clergy is buried and the laity is resurrected. I am concerned, however, that in some of the churches the eldership is still replacing the saints. In a certain locality, many new ones may have come into the church. They may be full of joy and rejoicing, but after five years they may become calm. They become calm, and the leading brother who helped them becomes more active. If such a situation is to be resurrected, the so-called clergy must be buried, and all the saints must be resurrected.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>LEARNING TO PREACH THE GOSPEL AND<br>TO PROPHESY IN THE NEW WAY</H2><P>In the previous chapter I was simple to stress that we need to have the individual, direct contact with sinners through the proper skill. A better machine sometimes requires higher skill to operate. In the Lord's recovery, the spreading of the gospel is a great thing. All sinners have been captured by God's enemy, Satan. They are kept under Satan's hand and in his kingdom. It is not that simple to get them out of his hand. This is the highest profession in the universe, and it requires the highest skill and the top technique.</P><P>Contacting people individually to transfer them into the kingdom of God is the highest spiritual "machine." Today people need to learn to use the computer because this is the computer age; otherwise, they will not be able to work effectively. We also need to learn to preach the gospel. We cannot change the truth of the gospel, but the way to preach the gospel must be changed and improved according to the Lord's way to meet His need. If we still remained in our old style of eldership, I would be very grieved. We need improvement. The truth can never be changed, but our practice should be improved all the time. The eldership in its shepherding is for the purpose of raising up all the saints, all the members, to function.</P><P>In our preaching of the gospel, we have to learn, but we may not have the heart to learn. We may be filled up with our old way. By God's mercy and grace, we have agreed to take the new way, to let the church go on in this way. But I am concerned that our taking of the new way is still by the old way. Actually, the "cargo" is still the old way. We may have improved our way of preaching the gospel, but that improvement may still be in the old way. The practice of one man preaching and the rest listening is the practice of the old way. The new way is to contact sinners individually and directly. This is the "computer way." I beg all of you who are for the recovery to learn this way.</P><P>In addition to learning the new way of preaching the gospel, we also need to be brought into the organic practice of prophesying for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ. There is a great need in the eldership today. If we are going to shepherd a church with the desire to make it living, we must know how to do two things in the "computer way"&#151;gospel preaching and prophesying. Prophesying is not just a matter of standing up and releasing yourself by speaking in the meeting. There is a difference between prophesying, testifying, and ordinary speaking. Ordinary speaking is not prophesying. A person may speak a lot and still not prophesy. We may have the label of practicing 1 Corinthians 14, but in actuality we do not have the practice of 1 Corinthians 14. Our label may say one thing, but the cargo is different from the label. If the elders want their church to be living, fresh, and even refreshing, they must know how to preach the gospel and prophesy. They themselves must do these two things. These are the terms for us to fulfill the need in our present situation.</P><P>Now I would like to say a word of love, advice, and warning. We should not think that we will abandon the churches which are in the old way. That is absolutely wrong. We will not abandon anyone or any church. Rather, we would still take care of them and help them. It does not matter whether a church is high or low, living or not living; it is still the church. We still have to bear the burden to take care of that church. We should never criticize, despise, or form parties. We must maintain the present churches. Otherwise, the Lord's recovery is finished. If we lose the churches, we lose the recovery.</P><P>On the one hand, you elders must take care of the church and participate in the normal church life. On the other hand, you should practice the new way, the "computer way." The elders should take the lead to practice the "computer way" of contacting sinners. Then within a short time your practice will influence others. Others will rise up to follow you. You do not need to make an announcement. You do not need to promote this in the meeting. On the one hand, you should just go along with the church. On the other hand, you should practice the "computer way" to save sinners. Nobody will condemn you as long as you do not promote, criticize, despise, or form parties among the saints. Rather, all will appreciate what you are doing.</P><P>There are a number of saints who will not be able to take this way, but they will still appreciate your taking of the new way. I appreciate all the saints who are able to use a computer, even though I myself do not use one. We should sympathize with the saints who do not feel that they can take the new way. But at least we should expect that one-fifth of the saints will take the "computer way." If one-fifth take this way, the "computer age" will be brought in. Not everyone in the United States can use a computer, but many people can. The using of the computer is gradually spreading into all parts of society. At the initial stage, I only expect one-fifth of the saints in the church to know and practice the "computer way." I believe that this will issue in a thirty-percent increase yearly.</P><P>This fellowship is very crucial. We need to be the forerunners who take the new way, the God-ordained way. We all need the Lord's grace to have a change in our concept in shepherding the church. First, you have to release everything concerning the church out of your hand, and let the saints share in these things. You need to be revolutionized with this thought. It is hard to ask the saints to take the "computer way" if you do not take it first. You should take the lead to learn the "computer." Then the "computer age" will come into the Lord's recovery. Our way of contacting sinners is the most effective and quick way. This way will change the entire structure of the Lord's recovery.</P><P>There are some churches in the recovery that have had about the same number for over ten years. The saints merely come together in a routine way every week. There is no "new blood," no new element. Today we need the spreading and the increase. I hope that within the next few years there will be more local churches in the United States. I beg you elders to have a change in your concept, in your view. Then you should sacrifice something for the Lord to learn these two things&#151;the "computer way" of preaching the gospel and the "computer way" of prophesying. You do not need to promote these two things. You do not need to charge the saints or rebuke them for not prophesying in the meetings. You should take the lead to learn. Then others will follow you, and you can encourage them.</P><P>You must contact some of the saints meeting with you to shepherd them. Shepherd them into the proper morning revival and daily victory. On the one hand, you should practice this. On the other hand, you should go to tutor the saints one by one. We need to contact sinners one by one and tutor the saints one by one. Our work should be a one-by-one work. Gradually, you will gain someone to do what you are doing. If you elders expect the church to be revived in a general way, it will never happen. This has been an unfulfilled dream in Christianity for centuries. You should work on people one by one. Go to contact sinners one by one and go to tutor the saints one by one. You do not need to give messages in the meeting to encourage them, advise them, or rebuke them. Do not rebuke, charge, or impose things on them. Just do it yourself directly. Then you will see a change in your meeting every week. If you tutor the saints one by one, you will gradually gain a good number of saints to function in the meetings. This is how to shepherd the church in the God-ordained way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE CHURCHES<br>IN THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>I am also concerned about the lack of fellowship among the churches in the Lord's recovery. Our giving to meet the need of the churches should be done by individuals and by the churches in fellowship. We do not have the practice of centralization, especially in financial matters. If the church in your locality has a burden for another church, you should just give directly to them. Then you will be in fellowship with the church to whom you gave the gift, and they will be brought into fellowship with you. The New Testament shows that the apostle Paul had the burden to help the churches in Judea in their financial need, and he brought the other churches into this burden. This practice was to help the churches to communicate, to fellowship, with one another directly. We need more fellowship among the churches today. We also need a number of brothers in the work to travel through the needy churches to have fellowship with them and to bring them into the fellowship. There is the need for the "blood circulation," the fellowship, to reach all the parts of the Body.</P><P>Many of us need to go out to get acquainted with the churches. The circulation of the spiritual blood will become a strong factor in the Body to neutralize all the differences and take away any troubles. Perhaps some in certain areas may be afraid of being confused if others come to visit them. But there is nothing in the New Testament which indicates that the apostles tried to avoid confusion by exclusion. According to Paul's writing, we realize that Apollos was not fully one with him in the work. Apollos was somewhat a factor of confusion, but Paul still recommended him (1 Cor. 16:12).</P><P>Based on this I want to advise us to open up our city, our region, and our country to the recovery, to all the saints. In the seven epistles to the seven churches in Revelation 2 and 3, the word of the Lord to a particular church is the word of the Spirit to all the churches. On the one hand, in the eyes of the Lord, all the churches are distinct, but on the other hand, they are all the same. The Lord's way is not to federate the churches, nor is it that the churches should be independent and separate from one another. All the churches should be dependent on one another and help one another.</P><P>Some of the co-workers may want to keep their locality or area of the country independent and, to some extent, isolated. According to our history, when this happened in the past, turmoil came out of these isolated areas and cities. Through the Lord's mercy, the recovery has reached every continent. It is hard for the recovery to go on if we are lacking in communication, in fellowship. But to have fellowship, to have communication, we must try our best to avoid controlling. When we fellowship with other churches, we should not have the consideration of being under them. No church is under any other church. All the churches are on the same level. On the other hand, none of the workers should have the thought of controlling the churches that they visit.</P><P>All the churches need to be open to the fellowship in the Body. There are no Californian churches or Texan churches. In the Lord's recovery, we have to be fully open to the Lord and open to one another. We should not be afraid that some different practices or teachings will come to our place. We need more fellowship among the churches. This will neutralize the differences among us. If you have been working in one place for years, it might be good for you to take the initiative to go to another place. One brother among us was captured for the church life in Odessa, Texas. Then he went to Los Angeles, to Anaheim, to San Bernardino, and back to Anaheim again. His going to San Bernardino was a great help to himself and to others.</P><P>I hope that my fellowship in these two chapters will impress you and protect you in the Lord's recovery and in His ordained way, so that the Lord would use His recovery through His ordained way to build up His Body. If you keep yourself isolated in your environment and situation, that will be a loss to you and to the Lord's interest. Furthermore, if you do not strive and struggle by sacrificing to pay the price to learn the "computer way" in contacting people for the gospel and in prophesying for the building up of the church, you will be behind in the Lord's move. The Lord's move is going on. To be kept in the Lord's recovery, we must keep ourselves open to one another. Moreover, the only way that can speed us up into the Lord's age, the Lord's move with the God-ordained way, is for us to pay the price and endeavor to enter into the practice of the new way, the "computer way."</P></body></html>
