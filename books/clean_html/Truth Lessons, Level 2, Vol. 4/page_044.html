Giving Us Direction</h2><p>The book of Acts shows us that the Spirit gives direction to the believers in many ways. First, this is seen in Philip’s preaching of the gospel to the Ethiopian eunuch. In 8:29-38 the record tells us that “the Spirit said to Philip, Approach and join this chariot.” So Philip ran up, went up into the chariot, and sat with the eunuch. Then Philip, beginning from the Scripture which the eunuch was reading, preached Jesus as the gospel to him, and he believed and was baptized. “And when they came up out of the water, the Spirit of the Lord caught Philip away” (v. 39). This indicates that the Lord’s move in spreading His kingdom through the preaching of the gospel was by the Spirit’s leading and direction, not by man’s device and schedule.<p>Following this, in Peter’s preaching of the gospel to Cornelius, we can also see the Spirit’s directing. While Peter was in Joppa, praying on the housetop of the house of Simon, a tanner, a trance came upon him and he saw a vision. “And while Peter was pondering over the vision, the Spirit said to him, Behold, there are three men seeking you. But rise up, go down and go with them, doubting nothing, because I have sent them” (10:19-20). So Peter went with them to the house of Cornelius as directed by the Spirit and preached the gospel to the Gentiles. In such a case of great significance, it was the Spirit who directed Peter, and not only so, even the sending of the three men to Peter by Cornelius before his conversion was the Spirit’s move and act through him.<p>In the important step taken by the Lord for the spread of the gospel of His kingdom to the Gentile world, we see that it was also altogether under the Spirit’s direction. Acts 13:1-3 says, “Now there were in Antioch, in the local church, prophets and teachers.…And as they were ministering to the Lord and fasting, the Holy Spirit said, Set apart for Me now Barnabas and Saul for the work to which I have called them. Then, when they had fasted and prayed and laid their hands on them, they sent them away.” Paul and Barnabas were set apart to carry out the Lord’s great commission to spread His kingdom for the establishment of His church in the Gentile world through the preaching of the gospel. This major step had nothing to do with the church in Jerusalem organizationally. It was absolutely a move by the Spirit, in the Spirit, and with the Spirit through the coordination of the faithful and seeking members of the Body of Christ on earth with the Head in the heavens.<p>Furthermore, in the case of the disciples entreating Paul not to go up to Jerusalem, we can also see the Spirit’s direction. Acts 21:4 says, “And when we had sought out the disciples, we remained there seven days. These told Paul through the Spirit not to set foot in Jerusalem.” In 20:23 the Spirit indicated to Paul that bonds and afflictions were awaiting him in Jerusalem. Here the Spirit further directed Paul, through some members of the Body of Christ, not to go to Jerusalem.<p>All these cases show that the believers lived, moved, and worked by the direction of the Spirit. Outwardly they were filled with the Spirit of power economically for them to carry out the work of God’s New Testament economy, and inwardly they were filled with the Spirit of life essentially for them to live a life of the processed Triune God. As a result, they moved, walked, and worked as men of the Spirit. In the same way, today we should experience and enjoy the Spirit to act, walk, work, and serve according to the direction of the Spirit.
