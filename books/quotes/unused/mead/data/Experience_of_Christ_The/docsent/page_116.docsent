   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SECRET OF STAYING ON THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This brings us to still another secret, the secret of staying on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Because it is impossible for us to do this ourselves, we must find the secret of doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The secret of staying on the cross is that Christ is within us as resurrection power.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Remember, Philippians 3:10 speaks of knowing Christ, the power of His resurrection, and the fellowship of His sufferings; it also speaks of being conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Being conformed to His death comes after knowing the power of Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Through the power of resurrection that is within us we are conformed to His death.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although we cannot keep ourselves on the cross, within us there is the power of resurrection, and by this power we can stay on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we stay on the cross, we are not committing suicide, because we are not actually keeping ourselves there; it is the power of resurrection that keeps us there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the foregoing message, we considered Galatians 5:24, which says that those that are Christ's have crucified the flesh with its passions and lusts Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>. This crucifixion of the flesh takes place by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is indicated by the fact that the next verse says that if we have life in the Spirit, we should also walk in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates the crucifying of the flesh takes place by the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Therefore, we are not actually the ones who crucify it; it is the Spirit as the power of resurrection who does this.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this regard we need to remember Romans 8:13, which says that by the Spirit we put to death the practices of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No matter how weak we may be, He is in us as the source of our experience of crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We cannot crucify our flesh or put to death the practices of the body, but the Spirit can do it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why, as we pointed out in the previous message, we need to cooperate with the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have also seen that Matthew 16:24 says that we must deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, not even the denial of the self can be done by ourselves; rather, it is done by the One who lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By Him, it is easy for us to deny the self.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But apart from Him it is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Regarding the denial of the self, there is One within us who is always waiting for our cooperation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If we say, "Amen," He will do the work and keep us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This experience of the cross is not a suffering, but an enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We enjoy the gracious working of the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Hour after hour and day after day, this indwelling Spirit keeps us on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, by the Spirit as the power of resurrection, we are being conformed to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The result of this is that we arrive at the out-resurrection from among the dead Phil 3:11, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>. The power of resurrection works to conform us to Christ's death.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then by our being conformed to His death, the out-resurrection becomes our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thus, resurrection gives us the experience of death, which in turn brings us to the out-resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the reason that A. B. Simpson could say in one of his hymns, " 'Tis not hard to die with Christ when His risen life we know." Because we have resurrection life within us, it is not difficult to die.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In another of his hymns A. B. Simpson says, "Oh! it is so sweet to die with Christ'' Because Christ is in us, it is sweet to die with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The resurrected One in us is the One who has experienced the crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Thus, it is not hard for us to die.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the contrary, it is sweet to die with Him because by dying with Him we enjoy Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Resurrection brings us into death, and death ushers us into higher resurrection, even the outstanding resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Our natural life, desires, intentions, and tendencies are crucified, not by ourselves, but by the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the way to take care of the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>By taking care of the inner anointing, we abide in Him; by abiding in Him, we are in Him; and by being in Him we can do all things.</S>
