   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINETEEN THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Acts 2:42 says, They continued steadfastly in the teaching and the fellowship of the apostles, in the breaking of bread and the prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse speaks of continuing in the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Ephesians 3:18-19 says, May be full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ, that you may be filled unto all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These verses speak of apprehending with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Colossians 2:19 says, Holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This verse shows that we grow gradually by the growth of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We have seen the authority in the Body of Christ or the order in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have also seen the consciousness of the Body and the coordination of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>These are all related.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The coordination of the Body, the order or authority in the Body, and the consciousness of the Body are closely related.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without the order and authority, there is no coordination; without the consciousness of the Body, the coordination is not practical.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In addition, the fellowship of the Body is another great item experienced by those who live in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Body of Christ, fellowship is very practical; moreover, the Body of Christ cannot leave this fellowship even for one moment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If a believer desires to live in the Body, he must live in the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once he loses the fellowship of the Body, he will definitely be disconnected from the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If one remains in the Body, he is in the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The fellowship of the Body is difficult to define.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Portions from the Word of God, such as 1 John 1, show that this fellowship is related to God s eternal life: The life was manifested, and we have seen and testify and report to you the eternal life, which was with the Father and was manifested to us v. 2 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God s eternal life has entered into us, and this life brings in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Fellowship in life means that this life is a fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A person who does not have the life of God often dislikes, even loathes, God s children when he sees them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But once he receives the Lord, the Lord s life enters him and causes him to desire to fellowship with God s children when he sees them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Prior to receiving God s life, he did not understand the story within the children of God; the spiritual things they spoke of sounded like a foreign language.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, after receiving God s life, he not only yearns to have fellowship with the children of God but also understands the story within them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He finds it enjoyable to fellowship with them, and he often feels fed, supplied, and inwardly satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He also feels inwardly dry, as if something is missing, when he is unable to see the children of God for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is a reflection of the condition in his spirit, showing that God s life has brought him into fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE MEANING OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Furthermore, Philippians and 2 Corinthians both show that this fellowship is in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If there is therefore any encouragement in Christ, if any consolation of love, if any fellowship of spirit Phil 2:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all 2 Cor 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since the Spirit is the realization of Christ, when the Spirit is in us, Christ and God are in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit in all of us is one and the same.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit in you is the Spirit in me.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>There is one Spirit in all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This Spirit becomes our fellowship and also enables us to have fellowship with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many times when we meet another child of God, although we may not say much outwardly, there is a mutual flow, a communication, between us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This flow, this communication, is of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Spirit in us is the Spirit of fellowship, just as the life of God in us is the life of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Electricity in a light bulb can be used as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Although there may be many light bulbs in a room, there is only one electric current in all the bulbs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In an instant, the electricity in one light bulb has flowed into another light bulb.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The electric current in the light bulbs is the fellowship of the light bulbs; this is an illustration of the meaning of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE FUNCTION OF THE FELLOWSHIP OF THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Simply speaking, fellowship is the flow of life, the flow of the Holy Spirit, within the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The fellowship of the Body is when the life of God flows among us, when the Holy Spirit flows within us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>An illustration of this flow, this fellowship, is our own physical body.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Word says that the life of the flesh is in the blood Lev 17:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Doctors tell us that the blood in our body is flowing very quickly; it flows very quickly and also through our body many times every minute.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The blood in our hand flows rapidly to our feet; the blood in our entire body moves and flows continually.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In medical science this flow of blood is called circulation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This means that the circulation of blood is the flow of blood; the flow of blood is the fellowship of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We cannot say the blood in our body is the blood of our hand or the blood of our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the blood in a person s hand stops moving and remains in that particular place, the hand becomes dead.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This indicates that his blood flow has a problem and his body is in an abnormal situation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We need to be active, to exercise, so that we may accelerate and increase the blood circulation in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The faster blood circulates in our body, the healthier our body becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Due to this circulation, all the improper things in our body are removed, and all the nutrients we need are supplied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Thus, the circulation of blood in our body has at least two functions: it supplies the nutrients that are needed, and it removes all the extra and improper things.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This maintains the metabolism in the body so that the body can grow gradually.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The blood circulation is the fellowship of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>There is also such a fellowship in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The fellowship of the Body is the circulation of the life of Christ in us, which is also the circulation of the Spirit of life in us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The circulation of the Spirit of life within us has at least two functions: it brings in the spiritual supply we need, and it discharges all the improper, useless, and dead things from within us Titus 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Whenever there is a lack of fellowship among God s children, there is a lack of spiritual supply among them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Furthermore, there is the accumulation of many improper things within them, which creates problems; as a consequence, the Body of Christ becomes ill.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We need to see that in order for the life of Christ to be continually living and strong, as the children of God, we need to have continual fellowship among us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whenever this fellowship is stopped, the supply of life is stopped and death is brought in; thus, the Body of Christ suffers loss related to spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Experientially, many cases prove this.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If I do not see the brothers and sisters and do not attend any meetings for one week, although I may pray and meditate, my spirit seems to become sick, lacking vitality.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is very strange.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It seems that I lack something inwardly, and although I cannot explain it, I can sense it.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I have a feeling within which is neither pleasant nor sweet; I feel like I am sick.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>When I first had this kind of experience, I did not understand the source.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>I was reading the Bible faithfully every morning and praying often; there was no problem between the Lord and me.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Although I had not done anything that the Lord condemned, nor did I sense any condemnation in my conscience, something was missing that caused me to feel despondent.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I did not understand this condition until the Lord showed me that my lack was the fellowship of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Although I had fellowship with the Lord and had no problem with Him, I was cut off from the fellowship of the Lord s Body, and therefore I felt something was missing in me.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After this, I had fellowship with a newly saved brother in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I asked him how he was saved, and he told me that he had been saved for a few days and had come to break bread.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>After speaking with him for a few minutes, I felt refreshed within; I was happy, revived, and bright.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Although I could not explain what I had gained, I was definitely joyful and felt very good.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>I did not understand this in my first few experiences, but I slowly began to understand that this is the fellowship of the Body and that grace is brought in through fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A brief time of fellowship with a brother, who was not more experienced than I and who did not have many spiritual riches, inwardly supplied me; I felt fresh, bright, and pleasant.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is truly wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We all like the prayer meeting and the bread-breaking meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Even though we sit for an hour in these meetings, not listening to messages or testimonies, there is a fellowship in the depth of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The prayers and praises of the saints flow into us.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We may feel somewhat despondent before a meeting, but during the meeting, we spontaneously feel a flow in our inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Once there is a flow, we are altogether enlivened and refreshed in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We have all had such an experience.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We may not listen to many messages, yet we are enlivened simply by praising and praying together with all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This is fellowship and the function of fellowship.</S>
