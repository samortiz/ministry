   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In this lesson we shall cover the last aspect of redemption, that is, reconciliation to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through Christ s redemption, we not only have been forgiven, freed, washed, sanctified, and justified, but we also have been reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The phrase reconciliation to God in Greek means to have a thorough change toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Because of the fall, man disobeyed God, offended God, and became an enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, man needs to have a thorough change toward God through Christ s redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our having a thorough change toward God is our being reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible does not say that God is reconciled to us; it only says that we are reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because He never offended us, God does not need to be reconciled to us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is we who offended Him; hence, we need to be reconciled to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I. THE NEED FOR RECONCILIATION A. Man Being an Enemy of God</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Man needs to be reconciled to God because man is an enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Romans 5:10a says, For if, while we were enemies, we were reconciled to God through the death of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that before man receives God s salvation, in God s eyes he is not only a sinner but also an enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Through the fall, man not only has fallen into sin, but he also has fallen under the authority of Satan 1 John 5:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, he has become a child of the devil 1 John 3:8a, 10 , obeying the ruler of the authority of the air Eph 2:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Being hostile to God, he has also become an enemy of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, man needs not only to be forgiven by God but also to be reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>B. Man Being at Enmity with God in His Mind</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Man needs to be reconciled to God also because he is at enmity with God in his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Colossians 1:21 says, And you, who once were alienated and enemies in your mind by evil works.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Because of the fall, man not only is far off and alienated from God, but he also is at enmity with God in his mind by evil works.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Furthermore, the mind of fallen man is set on the evil flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Such a mind is hated by God and it is enmity against God Rom 8:5, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Hence, man needs not only to repent unto God and be forgiven, but also to be reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>C. Man Disapproving of Holding God</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>in His Knowledge</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man needs to be reconciled to God because he disapproves of holding God in his knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Romans 1:28a says, And as they...did not approve of holding God in their full knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Man is alienated from God to the extent that he disapproves of holding God in his knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Greek, this means that man does not think it good to have God in his knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, it is not that man cannot know God; rather, it is that man disapproves of holding God in his knowledge he does not think it good to have God in his knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Man intentionally refuses to know God, purposely puts God aside, and deliberately rejects God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, man needs to be reconciled to God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>D. Man Hating and Blaspheming God</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Man needs to be reconciled to God because he hates God and blasphemes God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Romans 1:30 shows us that fallen man hates God.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 1 Timothy 1:13 Paul tells us that before he believed in the Lord he was one who blasphemed God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hatred is the inward intention; blasphemy is the outward word and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Man hates God in his inward mind and intent, and he blasphemes God in his outward words and behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>First, man is at enmity with God in his heart, and, disapproving of God, he does not think it good to have God in his knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then he hates God in his heart and thus blasphemes God outwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Man therefore truly needs to be reconciled to God.</S>
