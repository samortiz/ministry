<h1 class="msg">PREFACE</h1><p>Volume 46 of The Collected Works includes miscellaneous messages given by Watchman Nee throughout the period of time covered in Set 2 of The Collected Works. They are primarily notes on messages and fellowship from Sister Elizabeth Rademacher's collection. Since these notes were originally transcribed in English, translation from Chinese was not required.</p>
