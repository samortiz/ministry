   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The glorification of the matured believers is their top portion of their divine sonship in God s organic salvation which they received at the time of their regeneration Gal 4:5; Rom 8:23.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The redemption of the believers body is the transfiguration of their body at the Lord s coming back Phil 3:20-21.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The word redemption indicates it is judicial because the believers redeemed body is of the fallen old creation this redemption of the believers body is the finalization of God s judicial redemption; the word transfiguration indicates it is organic because the transfiguration of the believers body is by the divine life within them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The divine glorification of the glorified believers makes the consummated believers participate in God s divinity to the uttermost.</S>
