<p>In the summer of 1958 Brother Witness Lee, a servant of the Lord, was sent by God to Europe, America, and Asia to visit the saints and to observe the condition of the churches in these places. Upon returning to Taiwan, he was heavily burdened in his heart due to his sense that there is a tremendous lack of building among the churches today. Subsequently he released ten messages in the eleventh conference for the whole island of Taiwan. These messages have been published in the book <em>The Building Work of God.</em> In order to strengthen the revelation contained in these first ten messages, Brother Lee gave another eight messages, entitled &ldquo;The Basis for the Building Work of God.&rdquo; On the one hand, our brother saw that God&rsquo;s eternal will, His ultimate goal, is to build a house that is the mingling and the mutual dwelling of God and man. On the other hand, he realized that despite the presence of Christianity and of Christians all over the earth, there is the lack of such a house. Although there are people in many places who love the Lord, who zealously pursue the Lord, and who pay attention to spiritual things, it is hard to find one group of Christians who have been built together to become a spiritual house in which God can dwell, a house that satisfies the needs of both God and man. Not only do we not have the reality of the building; we lack even the concept of the building up of the church. Most Christians have as their goal getting saved and going to heaven and are ignorant of the revelation of the building of the church. These eight messages are directed at this situation. On the one hand, they aim to make known God&rsquo;s will and to point out His goal; on the other hand, they aim to correct our mistakes and to inspire us in our pursuit. Everyone should have a copy of this book; it is one that must be read.</p>
