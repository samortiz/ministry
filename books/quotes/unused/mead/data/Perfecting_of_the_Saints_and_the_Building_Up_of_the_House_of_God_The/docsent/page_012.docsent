   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FEW PERFECTED SAINTS IN THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What does it mean to be perfected?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Suppose we need a table, and we have a pile of wood.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not merely beautify a piece of wood by sanding and polishing it, we should also determine what type of furniture we can make with the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If it can be made into a leg for the table, we should perfect it into a leg.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We should repeat this procedure until we make the table.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We may need to cut a piece shorter, or we may need to sand a piece.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is what it means to perfect; we make the material useful and buildable.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Eventually, the pieces of wood not only look nice; they are also useful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the table is built, the pieces of wood are no longer in a pile; they are arranged in an orderly manner and have a function.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The principle is the same with making a desk or a chair.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When pieces of wood are built into furniture, each piece has a place and a function.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is building.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If the pieces of wood are not built up, they are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Regardless of how nice they look, they are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In order for the church to advance, we must not be stubborn and think that it is good enough to help the saints to be spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible says clearly that the church needs to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Corinthians 12:14-27 says that the members need to be blended.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Yes, we need to lead the saints to be spiritual; this is a basic need.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is like sanding a rough and uneven surface of a piece of wood before using it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, it is not enough to make it smooth; it also needs to be cut to the right shape.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, we need an eye to see how we can best use the piece, and then we must know how to cut the wood.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is an example of perfecting the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If all the workers serve in this way, eventually all the saints will be perfected.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For instance, if the ushering in the six large meetings was done in a proper way, there would be no problem with the ushering in the smaller district meetings, because it is easier to maintain order with fewer saints.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The visitation service is another example.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Only a small number of saints take care of the visitation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They visit people year after year, but there is no result.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that even though they visit, they do not know how to perfect others to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One out of every five saints should be able to serve in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church has increased to two thousand saints; therefore, we need three to four hundred saints on the visitation service.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>These saints should be perfected by the one hundred who are presently serving.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In other words, while we serve on visitation, we should perfect some saints to serve with us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If every one of the one hundred saints perfects three or four saints, we will have three to four hundred saints who can serve.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, for the churches to go on, we must humble ourselves and be willing to learn; we cannot be indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Even if we know how to do certain things, we must admit that there are other things that we do not know how to do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To be proud is foolish.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to learn to be humble and be apt to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even if we can lead others to have some measure of spiritual growth and to have a greater measure of the stature of Christ, we must confess that we are limited in what we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There are many things that we need to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to learn how to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Regardless of whether we are a brother or a sister, as workers, we need to ask ourselves whether the saints become useful after we are with them for a time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can do certain things because we have been shown mercy, but have we perfected others to do the same things?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I gave a sober word in one elders meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I said that if the ushering in the large meetings was proper, it would also be proper in the district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>A problem with the ushering indicates that the ushers in the large meetings did not perfect other saints to usher.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the initial ushers perfected other saints to usher, there would be saints in the district meetings to take care of the ushering.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This also applies to the business affairs of the church and to the spiritual matters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When there are few perfected saints, everyone is content to merely have a meeting, even if there is not much supply in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to humble ourselves and learn to do the work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The church in Taipei has thirty-nine full-time serving ones and twelve elders.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If these brothers and sisters are willing to change their concept and learn that the best way to labor is to perfect others to serve with them, the district meetings will not be weak and poor.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, if these workers are not willing to change their concept, the church in Taipei will not be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>LEARNING TO PERFECT THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, every worker must learn many things.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There are always things that we need to endeavor to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Regardless of how much we can supply the saints with Christ and help them gain a measure of the stature of Christ, this is only one aspect of our work.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We always need to learn how to perfect the saints so that they may be useful vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We must perfect the saints to be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Our ability to perfect the saints determines how much the church can be built.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we do not perfect the saints, they will not be useful material, and as our number increases, the amount of material that is not useful will also increase.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to perfect the saints and build them into the church according to their measure so that every saint is perfected to stand in his place and fulfill his function.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Then regardless of how large a church is, it will not lack order.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is only when we are perfected that we are genuinely built up.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This can be compared to the wood in the meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It does not cause confusion, because it is built up and has a function.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Suppose that we have material to make some benches, but instead of building the benches, we leave the material scattered in a room.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>No one will be able to use the room.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The church in Taipei is large, but we must be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>More believers are being added, but we cannot do anything with them, because there are few perfected saints.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have formed more meetings, but we do not have perfected saints in all the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The workers and the elders bear this responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need to be humbled and confess that we still have many lessons to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We do not know how to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We must learn to perfect the saints in order for the church to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In a normal situation, after a worker labors in a locality, there should be a strong service when he leaves.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If the service collapses after the worker leaves, there was a problem with his work; that is, a large portion of his work replaced the saints instead of perfecting them.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>May our eyes be opened to the revelation in Ephesians 4:11-12.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>These two verses say that Christ gave apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers as gifts for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of the ministry and unto the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The building up of the Body is not carried out directly by the gifts; rather, the gifts perfect the saints, and the perfected saints exercise their function to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This is the real building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>How much we perfect the saints is how much we build them up.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>If we labor in a city without perfecting any saints, we are not building up the church in that city, and the church will remain desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>After we leave, the church will suffer and have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This means that our work was a failure.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>PERFECTING THE SAINTS TO BUILD UP THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We need to consider this matter and be willing to change and to learn something new.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We must see that the first step of the building up of the church, the primary step, is that we learn to perfect others.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>It is good that we can do things, that we are willing to do things, and that we are actually doing things.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>However, it is a shortcoming if we cannot lead, teach, and perfect other saints to do what we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We need to learn, and to endeavor, not only to do things ourselves but also lead, teach, and perfect others to do the things that we do.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In this way the church will be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This is the urgent need in all the local churches.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>It is especially the need in the large churches such as the church in Taipei and in Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Since new ones are constantly being gained, if we do not learn how to perfect the saints, it will be difficult to continue the work in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This is the result of increase with little perfecting.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We cannot rely on splitting the large meetings into smaller district meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The district meetings in the church in Taipei prove this.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>There is the need to raise up more saints by perfecting them.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>If there are few perfected saints and we continue to split into smaller meetings, the church will eventually be desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Since there are few perfected saints, we should be aggressive and learn to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Even the workers in the smaller localities should be aggressive to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We need to perfect the saints to be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>While we work, we perfect others to do what we are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We should not be idle and direct others to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Rather, we should work diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The most important thing, however, is that we learn to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We should not perform a task by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Even if a saint seems unable to perform a task, we should let him do it to perfect him.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>After some time there will be a result.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Moreover, there are many lessons for us to learn while we perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Many circumstances will force us to go to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>For example, in order to perfect the saints to contact and enjoy the Lord, we must contact and enjoy the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Hence, perfecting the saints will also benefit us.</S>
