   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>IS IT OCCUPIED?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Once I was preaching the gospel with a co-worker of mine in a village.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the way back we were extremely thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There was neither a teahouse nor stream for us to get water.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In fact the whole area was uninhabited.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After walking for a while we came across a thatched hut.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We went to the door quickly and knocked.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>For a long time there was no answer.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We thought that no one lived there.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we opened the door and went in, we found that the floor was swept clean.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In one of the rooms was a bed with nicely folded sheets.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There was a teapot on the table, and the tea in it was still warm.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I said, "Surely someone must be living here.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the arrangements indicate beyond doubt that this place is occupied by someone.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not drink this tea.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must get out quickly or else people will think we are thieves."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We walked out and waited for the owner to return.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>By observing the arrangements of the house, we concluded that someone was living there, without having seen the occupant.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the same way, we know that God is there by the arrangement of everything in the universe, although we cannot see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Every single phenomenon of nature is so balanced, organized, meaningful, and functional.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may say that they come by chance, but it is impossible for me to believe that chance is its sole originator.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Bible says, "The fool has said in his heart,/There is no God."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Only foolish people can say in their hearts that there is no God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>CHANCE OR DESIGN</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The universe has to be created by Someone with profound wisdom, vast knowledge, and intricate design.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you cannot accept the concept of random formation of the universe, you have to admit that it was created by such a God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There cannot be a third explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The choice is left to you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You have to decide if the universe came by chance or whether it was created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A DEMAND AND ITS OBJECT</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One witness may not be enough.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I will call in another.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This time we will consider man's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Before doing so, we should also observe one fact: wherever there is a desire, there must first be an object for that desire.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>For example, an orphan who has never seen his father naturally has a desire for a kind of paternal love.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I have asked many people who were orphans, and they all have felt this irrepressible yearning.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>By this we can see that every desire of the heart arises out of an object in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As human beings we have a need for social belonging.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We need companionship and mutuality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you put a boy on a deserted island and he grows up alone, he still has the yearning for companions, for beings like himself, even though he has never seen a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This yearning or desire is the very proof that somewhere in the world there is something known as "man."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At a certain age, man begins to think about posterity; he starts desiring children and grandchildren.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is not a mere fantasy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This desire stems out of the existence and possibility of offspring.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, where there is desire, there is an object for that desire.</S>
