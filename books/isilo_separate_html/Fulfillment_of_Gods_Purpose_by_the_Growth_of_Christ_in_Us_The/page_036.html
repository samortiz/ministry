He brought everything into the tomb, including us. After burial He was resurrected. By incarnation He put on the flesh of man. Now by death and resurrection, He was transformed from the flesh into the Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45b says, "The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit." He was the last Adam in the flesh, but by death and resurrection He became a life-giving Spirit.</P><P>On the evening of the day of His resurrection, He came to His disciples. The disciples were afraid of the Jews, so they were in a room with the doors shut. Suddenly Jesus came and stood in their midst (John 20:19). He came to them not in the way of the flesh but in the way of the Spirit. He did not teach the disciples or tell them what to do. Instead, He breathed into them and said to them, "Receive the Holy Spirit" (v. 22).</P><P>To receive the Holy Spirit, the holy breath, is better than thousands of messages. Christ did not come to them as a big teacher, but as the best Breather. He is not a teaching, but the breath. He breathed Himself into them. The end of the Gospel of John says nothing about His departure, because He was in them. Later, they went to the sea to go fishing, and Christ was there (21:1-14). Wherever they went, Christ was there, because He was within them in a mysterious way, in a spiritual way, in a way like the air. Wherever you go, the air follows you. Regardless of how much you try, you cannot get away from the air. Christ today is the life-giving pneuma, the life-giving breath, the life-giving air.</P><P>After His resurrection He ascended to the heavens, and He was crowned with glory and honor (Heb. 2:9). He was enthroned and given the highest name, the headship, the lordship, and the kingship in the kingdom, including all authority both in heaven and on earth (Eph. 1:20b-23; Acts 2:36; 5:31). Acts 2 tells us that on the day of Pentecost, He came down as a mighty wind (vv. 1-2). When the breath is intensified and strengthened, it becomes the wind. In a soft way He is the breath. In a strong way He is the wind. The wind brings us the fresh air. The Spirit as the breath was after His resurrection. The Spirit as the wind was on the day of Pentecost.</P><P>In the Epistles there are a number of titles for the Spirit. Acts 16:7 speaks of the Spirit of Jesus, and in verse 6 there is the Holy Spirit. If you read these two verses, you can see that the Holy Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus. These two terms are interchangeably used. Jesus was a suffering man, so the Spirit of Jesus is the Spirit of a man with abundant strength for suffering. Then in Romans 8:9-10 there is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and Christ. These three titles are also interchangeably used. This proves that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself. The Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of the resurrected and life-giving Christ. Then Philippians 1:19 speaks of the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. The Spirit of Jesus Christ is the Spirit of the incarnated, afflicted, and crucified Jesus and the resurrected, ascended, and enthroned Christ. First Corinthians 15:45b says that in resurrection Christ as the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. After His resurrection He is the breath that gives life.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> </body></html>
