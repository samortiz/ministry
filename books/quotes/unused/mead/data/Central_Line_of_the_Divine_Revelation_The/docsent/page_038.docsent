   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING BUILT UP TOGETHER TO BECOME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A COUNTERPART FOR THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's inheritance is the New Jerusalem, and eventually, we as the precious stones will be built together to become His inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the one hand, we do not like to be built together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Instead of meeting together, we may prefer to stay at home and be by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On the other hand, however, there is something within us causing us to feel that we cannot live by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to come together.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the divine life there is togetherness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To come together in the divine life is to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we remain in the church in our locality, we are unconsciously being built together.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God's sovereignty has put us together.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, in the New Jerusalem we will recall with the brothers and sisters how God put us together in many situations.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is hard for me to go for three days without seeing a saint.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I like to see the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Togetherness is an attribute of the divine life, and by this attribute we have the building up.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Through the building up, God will have a bride to match Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The bride in Genesis 2 was a physical bride, but eventually, in the consummation of the building up of the New Jerusalem, the bride will be not only physical and human but also spiritual and divine.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>She will be a wonderful and marvelous bride.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The bride will make herself ready Rev 19:7 in a physical, spiritual, divine, and human situation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This bride is a corporate person, yet all the components of this person are one.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Triune God, after being processed, has blended Himself with the tripartite, transformed men, causing them to all become one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This corporate person is the bride, and this bride is a mutual dwelling place of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God dwells in man and man dwells in God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The New Jerusalem is the tabernacle of God 21:3 , God's abode, and God and the Lamb are the temple for us to dwell and serve in v. 22 . God is our dwelling, and we are His dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is God's heart's desire and God's good pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is also God's purpose according to the counsel of His will.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God's counsel is His economy, and the economy of God is to dispense Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God's breathing His breath into man was a dispensing, and our taking in God as the tree of life is also a dispensing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way God has dispensed Himself into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The elements of His being have been dispensed into our being step by step and day by day.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's dispensing also includes transformation, conformation, and glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Eventually, God will be fully dispensed into us not only as our life and nature but also as our glory.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we will all be one with Him, and He will be one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In this way we will become His bride as His counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What we have presented in this message concerning God's creation of man in the view of His divine dispensing according to His divine economy is what God desires.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is God's good pleasure, and this is our ministry, burden, and commission.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We do not have any other burden besides this ministry of God's economy with His divine dispensing into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must learn to receive God's dispensing every day.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He is dispensing Himself to us every moment and in every situation, even in the small things, for our renewal, transformation, and conformation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, we will be glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we will enjoy the consummation of His divine dispensing according to His divine economy.</S>
