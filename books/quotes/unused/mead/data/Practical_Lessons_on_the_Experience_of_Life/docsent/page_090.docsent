   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING FOR NOTHING BUT CHRIST AND THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Based on this word I would ask you, how much of Christ have you enjoyed today?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Perhaps twelve hours have passed today, from the morning to the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How much of Christ have you enjoyed?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If I ask what kind of food you have enjoyed, you can immediately tell me what you had for breakfast, lunch, and dinner.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now, however, I am asking you in a practical way how much of Christ you enjoyed today.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is our life and life supply as our food.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As our food, we must enjoy Him daily.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He is our daily manna.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am afraid that we talk much about doctrines, and perhaps even about Christ, but we neglect the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I would like to see that from now on, by the mercy and help of the Lord, the church will learn how to help the saints in a practical way to enjoy Christ, not only to know Christ, but to partake of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This time of training from the very beginning to the end is for nothing but Christ, along with His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is for us to enjoy Him as our life and express Him as our Head.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I beg you to learn to forget about other things.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Do not talk about other matters, and do not listen to this kind of talk.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Talk about things other than Christ is distracting.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I realize that a number of the young people have been distracted by that talk.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is to not be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Our training is not for this.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is for the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I hope that from now on we do not give the young people any kind of mere teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, we should give them the adequate instruction that they may know how to contact Christ, deal with Christ, be dealt with by Him, and share Him with others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The leading brothers among the young people have to pray together very much that the Lord would deliver them from anything other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We do not know anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We just know this one thing, to fellowship one with another about Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What we apprehend with all the saints is not knowledge and teachings about absolute grace or sovereign will.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That is something of the Lord's recovery of four or five hundred years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Today is not the time of Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Luther was a great servant of the Lord; there is no doubt about that.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But today the teachings of absolute grace and sovereign will are too childish.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord's recovery today is Christ Himself as life and His Body as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God's recovery today is Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even the gifts are an item of the Lord's recovery in the previous century.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God's recovery today is the full experience of Christ and the practical expression of Christ in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should never be distracted by anything else, even by the good things.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I hate to see that anyone among us would speak only on those other, good things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Those things distract from the very purpose of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The church is not for anything else but Christ and His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church should help the saints in a very practical way, not to talk about anything else or even merely to talk about Christ, but to share Christ with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Ephesians 3:18 is Paul's prayer that we would apprehend with all the saints the dimensions and the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In addition, 2 Timothy 2:22 instructs us to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At that time there was the need to flee, to escape, and today there is still the need.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Flee from the distracting, dissenting, and vain talk.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Moreover, we should pursue after righteousness toward others, faith toward God, and love and peace, which are also toward others, with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must learn to experience Christ in such a way and not know so many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>PUTTING WHAT WE HAVE LEARNED INTO PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church must help the saints to experience Christ, partake of Christ, and share Christ with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a rule, the church should not give people much teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Rather, it must give adequate instruction concerning the experience of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then after giving instruction, the church should help the saints to practice what they have been taught.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For instance, we can instruct the saints that Christ is the life-giving Spirit who dwells in our spirit today; therefore, we must walk in our spirit and exercise our spirit to contact Christ and take Him as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This much is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Now we have to help the saints to put this into practice, because the messages, teachings, doctrine, and knowledge are not adequate.</S>
