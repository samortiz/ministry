   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A Problem concerning Unity</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A brother asked, "As the word concerning the unity of the church goes out from us at this time, people may very easily misunderstand that we are asking others to unite with us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Why do we not unite with them?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to answer this question, we must let them know the basic problem: Before the Lord we can yield in certain things, but there are other matters in which we can never compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What are the things concerning which we cannot compromise?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They are the teachings of the Bible because they are the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even if we want to compromise, we still cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not just a matter of saying things one way as opposed to another; we cannot alter the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In what things can we yield?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We can yield in our own position, but toward brothers who are in the denominations, whether in a congregational church or a united church, there are things which we cannot compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In these things we should stand firm and should not compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, in things in which we can give in, we should yield because we must seek unity.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There are two points in which we cannot compromise: 1 Denominations are sin; hence, we cannot compromise in this.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God said that divisions sects, denominations are of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We cannot say that divisions are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we are not faithful to the Lord, we are not His servants and cannot preach His words.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Denominationalism is always to be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the negative aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>2 We must ask them to acknowledge that the church is local.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the positive aspect with which we can never compromise.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>There should be only one church in each locality, not several churches.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the Word of the Lord, and we have no authority to alter it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We cannot change one or the other.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once the problem regarding the Word of the Lord is settled, there is no problem whether you should unite with me or I should unite with you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will not involve the Word of the Lord; it will only involve our position.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If one considers only his position, he is wrong and is not the servant of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If others are united with us today, how about divisions that may occur in the future?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since they have just started to walk this way, it may be quite easy for trouble to arise again.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For those who have done something once, it is extremely easy to do it again.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For those who have walked in the way of denominations, it is very easy to walk in that way again.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is not that we do not trust our brothers but that they must condemn denominationalism as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then God will deliver them out of it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If they do not condemn the denominationalism as sin, even though they have come out of it, trouble will arise in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Furthermore, if we maneuver to attain unity, problems will arise.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must not relax these two points: Denominationalism is sin, and the church is local.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We can tell these ones that we have been walking in this way for thirty years and that we hope they also will walk together with us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>On the other hand, it is all right for us to consider ourselves as not having walked in this way and starting all over again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In spite of our history, it is all right for us to join others.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Word of the Lord is the Lord's and we cannot give it up, but we can give up our history.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church is local and denominationalism is sin; we cannot relax on these two points.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, we can have a new start tomorrow in regard to our position.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we reject the denominations and they reject the denominations, then we can unite together to become the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>How about that?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our history is something we can give up, and we can start all over again.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We can say that they are not the church and that we are not the church, but that tomorrow we all will be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>How about this?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We will give up anything that can be given up, but the Lord's Word cannot be given up; we cannot relinquish it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This problem is easily settled; this is not a difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As to the administration, there also can be only one in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Congregationalism has several administrations in each locality.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Acts 14:23 says that Paul and Barnabas appointed elders in every church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If this were the only record in the Bible regarding Paul's action, people could say that it is possible to have several churches in one locality and elders in each one of these churches.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, if we read Titus 1:5, we will see that the situation is different.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Paul said, "Appoint elders in every city."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When we bring these two texts together, we will see that they are very specific.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One text says "in every church"; the other text says "in every city."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Therefore, elders are ordained for every church, and the city is the boundary for the elders' administration in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many brothers and sisters think that having unity with us is only a spiritual matter and that their administration will still be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is not the teaching of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Every locality must have only one church and only one administration; it is impossible to have several churches and several administrations in one locality.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Since this is a very important matter, we must be clear about it.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>There can only be one administration in one city, not several administrations.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we are clear about this, there will be little problem.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Otherwise, when we have trouble in one meeting, we will go to another meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If one meeting does not receive us, we can go to another meeting on another street and be received.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If the children of God have seen the unity of the church, the brothers and sisters will be one not only in fellowship but in administration as well.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Watchman</S>
