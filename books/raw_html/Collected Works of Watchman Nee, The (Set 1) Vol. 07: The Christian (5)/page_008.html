<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SIGNS OF THE TIMES</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>(1)</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 3, January 1926<br>(Edited from Newspapers in the West)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ALMOST SIX THOUSAND YEARS</H2><P>Strictly speaking, there is, of course, no proof that the millennium will begin at the end of six thousand years of human history. However, there are many proofs that the millennium is the Sabbath day of all the millenniums and the reality of the jubilee.</P><P>We are now approaching the end of the six thousand years. According to the "creation calendar," by September 18 this year the Jews will have reached the 5,686th year of their calendar, only 314 years short of six thousand years. This is only a little over three centuries. Mr. Martin Anstey of the former London Missionary Society once did an even more accurate and scriptural calculation. If we consider his calculation, we will become more clear. He reckoned that from the year Adam was created, which was roughly the beginning of the "creation calendar," until today, there are 5,967 and one-third years, being thirty-two and two-thirds years short of six thousand years. This is only a little over thirty years from the end.</P><P>This is quite similar to the period that our Lord worked on the earth, about thirty-three years. Although the time was short, how powerful and meaningful those years were!</P><P>This age is about to end! The rapture can happen at any time! May the power of God operate more in the lives of the consecrated ones to perform selfless works and to save the perishing ones!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WEATHER FORECAST FOR 1926 to 1927</H2><P>On July 25 the famous Saturday Evening Post wrote,</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Dr. H. H. Clayton with other observers, in conjunction with the observatories of North and South America of the Smithsonian Institute in Washington, D.C., predicted the nature of the upcoming weather.....Dr. Abbot noted that the result obtained recently was specific and exciting....The issue that the scientists are most interested in is the forecast of the weather for 1926 to 1927. This will be the period when the sun spots will be the highest, that is, when the activity of the sun will be the greatest. According to Mr....and other observers of the new science, these two years will be the most dangerous years, and the weather will affect the crops throughout the world. The notable thing is that 1926 to 1927 will be the second time after the "summerless year" of 1816 when the activity of the sun is the greatest.</P><P>Every 270 to 275 years the whole earth experiences abnormal weather. 1926 to 1927 will be the sixth 271-year cycle after the famine of the Roman Empire at the time of Diocletian (A.D. 299-300). This period is also the 1,372nd year of the Chinese historian in which there will be the forty-eighth cycle of the blackening out of the sun.</P><P>According to an editorial of the U.S. magazine Awake, the weather forecast in the U.S. this year gives enough signs. During the summer of 1925, there were snow and hailstorms in northwestern U.S., and the temperature was very cold. In other parts of California there were abnormal storms and rain, and after the rain and the storms there were hailstorms. Although we cannot predict the weather for 1926 to 1927, we can say for sure that the age we are in is indeed a dangerous age. We will note the fact for now and will observe how things are going to develop. "In the last days difficult times will come" (2 Tim. 3:1).</P><P>Another news item from London on December 19, 1921, said,</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>1926 will be a year that shakes the foundation of the world material supply and world politics. Pestilence, famine, floods, shipwrecks, looting, and revolutions will be frequent during this year. This is predicted by the British astro-magazine. This year Mars and Mercury will line up. According to that magazine, six years after this, the battle of Armageddon will begin. This will be the final battle between the Muslims with the Communists, and the Anglo-Saxons. After 1932, there will be world peace. But perhaps there will be few of us left. By that time, we will be so worn out that we will be forced to make peace. This is the prediction that the astrologists predicted for this year.</P><P>How interesting this article is! These are words uttered by worldly people. Although we cannot believe all that they said, we know that the end is near.</P><P>On August 5, 1922, the Christian Missionary Alliance Weekly quoted Mr. Panton, the renowned writer on prophecy:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1> Concerning the imminent approach of hell, I can relate the following story:<br>A captain in the British army was feasting once in 1911 in Cairo, Egypt. He met an Indian magician who told him that there would be a terrible war in Europe in the first week of August 1914. In December of 1919 he met the same Indian, who said, "Captain, what did I tell you? In 1911, the telepathists in India and Tibet had already seen the things that were about to happen." The captain asked, "What about peace?" The magician answered, "This will not be a peace, but merely a prolonged armistice." The captain asked, "What will happen?" He answered, "In the year 1927, no sooner or later, there will be a great war. The present war is but child's play in comparison to that coming one."</P><P>From all these reports, we can see that the years 1926 and 1927 will be extraordinary years. We cannot say in which year the Lord Jesus will rapture His overcoming believers. But one thing we can say: the time is near. We cannot take everything that the worldly people say as being true, but undoubtedly, we are living in an extraordinary age. I (the editor), for one, hope that the Lord will come this year! May those who love the Lord's appearing pray that the time for God's Son to appear will come quickly, so that we can see our beloved Lord. (Note: The reason we quoted all the newspapers is not to ascertain the date of the Lord's return, but to show that the time is near.)</P>
