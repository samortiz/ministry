   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AVOIDING HAVING DIFFERENT OPINIONS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>From now on we need to strive and push toward the goal of taking the lead well, being apt to teach, and prophesying well.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The young people should never have differences of opinion or live according to their moods.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Instead, they should go on steadily in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I co-labored with Brother Nee for eighteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>May the Lord cover me with His blood; in those eighteen years I never expressed any opinion to Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He used to turn toward me in the co-workers meetings and ask, Brother Witness, what do you think?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I would smile and not say a word.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I maintained an attitude of obedience because I was not taking the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I simply obeyed; I did whatever he wanted me to do, and I went wherever he wanted me to go.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This was my attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In those eighteen years, I never voiced an opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Furthermore, all the messages I spoke in those eighteen years were Brother Nee s messages.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I would even tell the saints the year in which Brother Nee had released the message that I was speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I never considered it a shame to speak Brother Nee s messages; on the contrary, I was proud of it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I am not exaggerating.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In January of 1934, after I heard ten messages in a conference in Shanghai, I went back to Chefoo, and by June I had repeated those ten messages.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was how closely I followed Brother Nee in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today the most damaging things to the Lord s work in His recovery are opinions and gossip.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>These things are a big shame to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once we have differences in opinion and live according to our moods, it will be difficult for us to continue on in the Lord s way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all need to learn to be without opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A person who is not taking the lead should obey the directions he receives, and one who takes the lead should provide directions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we can neither give directions nor follow directions, we are through.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have had many experiences of riding in people s cars.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have learned not to say anything when a brother is driving.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I do not say to go north or south, to turn right or left, or to go fast or slow.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The only exception occurred when a brother and I drove from Las Vegas to Los Angeles in the middle of the night during the winter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The brother fell asleep while driving, and upon seeing it, I needed to remind him that for our safety he should not fall asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Often people express many opinions while riding in the cars of other people.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This makes it difficult for the drivers.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I hope that all the elders and co-workers will avoid expressing different opinions in the work.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If all the co-workers, elders, and full-time serving ones avoid expressing their opinions, the churches will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Where there is opinion, there the church is through; even if the opinion is the greatest and brightest, it is still useless.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This can be compared to a chemical experiment; opinion is like the corrupting factor in the experiment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No matter where this factor is added, the experiment is ruined.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, whether we are co-workers, elders, or young full-timers, we need to realize that when we serve together, we need to learn to have no opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ahead of us is only one goal.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>All the elders and co-workers should not have any opinion when they go back to their localities.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead, they should take the lead well, teach well, and prophesy well.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They should also endeavor to labor on the Lord s word, pray much, pursue the truth, and seek the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Moreover, they need to have close and intimate fellowship with the Lord and live in spirit so that the Lord can give them light and revelation at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In this way, they will be able to prophesy, to speak for the Lord, and to speak forth the Lord, thereby bringing in great blessings for the church.</S>
