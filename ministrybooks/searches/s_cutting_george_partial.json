Just as people know that there are numerous kinds of vitamins, believers can know that they are saved and can be assured of their salvation. Before George Cutting wrote the pamphlet Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment, countless believers had the assurance of their salvation. However, the truth concerning the assurance of salvation had not been clearly presented. If the believers who lived before George Cutting were asked whether they knew they were saved, they may not have said with assurance that they were saved. They may have had some assurance of their salvation, but this truth was not spoken. It was not until the 1800s that George Cutting declared the truth concerning the assurance of salvation. Since then this truth has shined brightly and clearly in the West.

The second best-selling book is this booklet. Although it is small, it is one of the most widely circulated books in the world. When I met Mr. Cutting, he was over eighty years old. His hair and beard were all white. He was in bed all the time, and his mind was not very clear. When I met him, he said, \u201cBrother Nee, I cannot live without Him, and He cannot live without me.\u201d He had such a [319] deep fellowship with the Lord. Thank the Lord, there were over eighty members in his household. All of them were saved. Every one of his sons, daughters-in-law, grandsons, granddaughters, nephews, nieces, great-grandchildren, old or young, male or female, were saved.

This truth was recovered in the West; the recovery of the assurance of salvation among us began after this truth was released by the Brethren. The assurance of salvation has been fully recovered among Chinese Christians; not only do we confess this truth, but also all the orthodox preachers confess it as well.

After his salvation Brother Nee began to diligently read the Bible and spiritual publications. As a result, he had a considerable understanding of Christ. The forewords of the early issues of the periodical The Christian show that before 1925 Brother Nee already had considerable knowledge concerning Christ and the church. In the summer of 1933 Brother Nee went abroad to London, England, and he went also to Vancouver, Canada, and New York in the United States to visit the Brethren assemblies. During this time he visited Brother T. Austin-Sparks, Brother Panton, and George Cutting, the author of the booklet Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment. At that time the books with the largest sales were first the Bible, then The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress, and then Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment.

He told Brother Nee, \u201cWithout Him I cannot live, and without me He cannot live.\u201d Brother Nee never forgot this word, and I also treasure this word. By traveling in this way, Brother Nee received a new and more advanced understanding. He saw that Christ is the centrality of God and also the universality of God. As a result, on January 22 through 31, 1934, there was a ten-day conference in Shanghai, in which Brother Nee gave two messages every day. The messages in the morning session were concerning Christ being the centrality of God and also the universality of God. Brother Nee used these two very good English words\u2014centrality and universality. He said that God\u2019s plan and God\u2019s will focus on Christ, so Christ is the centrality. Furthermore, from the center Christ is spreading extensively. Therefore, Christ is God\u2019s centrality and universality. These messages can be considered as classics. In the afternoon Brother Nee spoke on God\u2019s overcomers. Brother Nee felt that I took good notes, [60] so he asked me to edit my notes. Later, these messages, together with a foreword written by me, were included in Issue No. 34 of The Present Testimony, published in 1934.

Man does not need to weep and beg in order to be saved; instead, he can say, \u201cO God, You have to save me because of the blood of Your Son.\u201d Their vision concerning the gospel was clear to this extent. The light among the Brethren did not stop there; they also saw the matter of the assurance of salvation. The book Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment written by George Cutting can be considered the first book on [393] the assurance of salvation.

In 1927, while I was reading The Pilgrim\u2019s Progress and came across the part where Christian lost the certificate (meaning the assurance of salvation), I was attacked and tempted by the enemy to check whether I myself had lost it. I was sure I had. For days and weeks I could not eat well or work well. I had some books on the assurance of salvation, like Safety, Certainty, and Enjoyment by George Cutting. These books said that the assurance of salvation is simply the word spoken by God in the Bible and that just one verse can be your assurance. I picked up John 3:16 and knelt before the Lord. I read it word by word several times and declared, \u201cLord, I believe every word.\u201d But the doubts remained. They continued for a long time, till one day I read a booklet by Brother Nee, saying, \u201cIf you doubt whether you have been saved, your doubt is the strongest assurance that you have been saved.\u201d That released me! I had doubted to the uttermost; now I had the strongest assurance. The question was settled for me.
