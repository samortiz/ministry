To realize and understand the will of God, we first need wisdom in our spirit and then understanding in our mind
Verse 12 says, 'Giving thanks to the Father, who has qualified you for a share of the allotted portion of the saints in the light'
Not only were we humans reconciled by Christ to God; all creatures, the things on the earth and in the heavens, were also reconciled
The King James Version incorrectly says, 'What is the riches of the glory of this mystery,' using is in the singular
We need to admonish because there are too many things to distract people from the central item, which is Christ
The apostle strove, struggled, and fought to labor in this way, not by his own human strength but by the divine power which operated in him
The fullness dwells in Christ, and now we have been put into Christ, 'dipped' into Him, so in Him we have been made full
Verses 11 through 13 say that we have been baptized, buried together with Christ, raised with Him, and made alive together with Him
When the Lord Jesus was on this earth, the principalities, the evil powers, came to Him, but the Lord brought all this 'dirt' to the cross
The apostle mentions five items: eating, drinking, a feast for joy, a new moon for a new beginning, and the Sabbath for rest
Finally verses 15 and 16 say And let the peace of Christ arbitrate in your hearts to which also you were called in one Body and be thankful
Galatians and Ephesians each have six chapters, and Philippians and Colossians each have four, for a total of twenty chapters
The four Gospels first give us a full record of the life of the Lord Jesus, a full biography of the Lord Jesus on the earth
After Romans, the two Epistles to the Corinthians tell us the way to solve all the problems in the church, the Body
The Corinthians, like theologians, discussed many matters, such as marriage, going to law courts, sacrifices to idols, and resurrection
On the one hand they liked to talk about doctrines, but on the other hand, they also liked to exercise all manner of gifts
If we are frank and honest, we will admit that the more doctrines and gifts we have, the more divisions we have
We need to help people to love this Christ, know this Christ, experience this Christ, and be built up as the church to express this Christ
We cannot solve the problems in the church by teaching and gifts; it is only by Christ, and this One crucified
After the two Epistles to the Corinthians, we have the four short books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians
They tell us how this Christ must be very subjective to us, that is, how Christ has to be worked into us to be the inward, indwelling Christ
Following this, Philippians tells us the secret of how to experience this indwelling Christ, who is the all-inclusive One
Colossians speaks of the eternal will of God, the economy of God, the mystery of God, and the God-given portion to us
Whatever we do in Christ, with Christ, and for Christ is the will of God, because God's will is simply Christ and nothing else
It is that we take Christ as everything that we take Him as life to live by Him and give Him the first place the preeminence in all our life
There is no need to check something in another way; simply check whether or not that thing is in Christ, with Christ, and for Christ
If we can boldly say with full assurance that we are doing something in Christ, with Christ, and for Christ, then it is of the Lord
What God is, what God has, and what God has done and can do are all embodied in Christ and expressed in and through this Christ
All that God planned and purposed to do is for Him, so that He might have the preeminence, the first place, in all things
Millions of solar systems comprise one galaxy, billions of galaxies form the universe, and no one has found what is at the center of it all
In this redemption He dealt with our sins and the world, He abolished the ordinances, and He dusted off the evil forces
He put this flesh with its dirt onto the cross, and by the death of the cross, He dusted away, stripped off, all the dirt
He is everything to us; He is our life and our hope, we have been rooted in Him, and now we are built up in Him
Philosophy, empty deceit, the elements of the world, and the worship of angels can beguile, distract, and sidetrack us
We have received Him, so now we must walk in Him, having been rooted in Him and being built up in Him and with Him
We also need to teach Him to others, to grow, and to help others to grow until we can present them to God full-grown in Christ
When we have this kind of vision of Christ, we will declare that doctrines, teachings, gifts, miracles, and signs mean nothing
In His relationship to God, Christ is the image, the expression, of God, and all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him
He also dealt with the evil forces by 'dusting' off the principalities, powers, and dominions in the heavenly places
In the new man there is no Greek, no Jew, no barbarian, no Scythian, no slave, and no free man, but Christ is all and in all
When we bring an item home, however, the little children appreciate the wrapping more than the contents, which are the central item
In these days we must see the very Christ revealed in the short books of Galatians, Ephesians, Philippians, and Colossians
In the future the Lord will give us the time and the burden to minister more and more of Christ from all these books
Verse 6 of chapter four says, 'And because you are sons, God has sent forth the Spirit of His Son into our hearts, crying, Abba, Father'!
You have been brought to nought, separated from Christ, you who are being justified by law; you have fallen from grace'
For he who sows unto his own flesh will reap corruption of the flesh, but he who sows unto the Spirit will of the Spirit reap eternal life'
The specific characteristic of Galatians is that the Christ revealed in Colossians needs to be wrought into us
God had no intention in creating the universe other than for His purpose to work Christ into a group of human beings
Similarly, He has no intention to give us teachings and doctrines outside of His purpose to work Christ into us
The enemy can utilize everything, even the good things given by God to fulfill His purpose, to distract people from God's purpose
Christians are distracted from Christ by the letter of the New Testament and drawn to the letter of the New Testament
Many people have been distracted from Christ and His Body by taking the teachings of the New Testament apart from Christ
He was strong to say that water baptism means nothing, that every mention of baptism in the New Testament refers to a spiritual baptism
They were brought to nought concerning Christ because they were paying attention to something other than Christ Himself
The apostle Paul, as an example, was religious, but he eventually became one hundred percent for Christ and not a bit for anything else
When we put our hand into a glove, the hand is in the glove but it is not formed in the glove until all the fingers are fixed in place
Gradually the thumb fits in place, and then the second, third, fourth, and fifth fingers; finally the entire hand is formed in the glove
Christ must be fully, thoroughly, wholly mingled with us in all our inward parts-in our mind, emotion, and will
We may say that we do not pay attention to the gifts, but we may still pay attention to something else other than Christ
The main items in Galatians are that Christ is revealed in us, Christ lives in us, we put on Christ, and Christ is formed in us
The Christ who is revealed in us, who lives in us, whom we have put on, and who is being formed in us is the Spirit
The grace of the Lord is nothing less than the Lord Himself, and this grace, which is Christ as the Spirit, is with our spirit
Why then in these four books that are so significant concerning Christ and His church is there nothing of gifts healings tongues or miracles
The phrase works of power is used only in Galatians 3:5, probably referring to something in the past, at the beginning of their experience
When we were in the world, we were indifferent to the things of God; we simply did not care for doctrines or gifts
Right away when this one is raised up by the Lord to seek Him, Satan puts these two snares in front of him to trap him
We need to be warned, and we need to be delivered from worldliness, from seeking after doctrines, and from seeking after gifts
Regardless of how much power is in electricity, if we do not have the current of electricity, we have none of its power
That is why we speak of three matters: the love of God, the grace of Christ, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit
We must realize that Christ is the life-giving Spirit living in our spirit, and we need to learn the secret of contacting Him
We should forget everything else, never be distracted by anything, and always pay our full attention to the Spirit
We must walk by the Spirit, live by the Spirit, sow unto the Spirit to reap of the Spirit, and restore a fallen brother in the spirit
We will enjoy Christ and all the more we will love Him pray to Him turn to Him fellowship with Him and know not doctrine but Christ Himself
We should spend time with Him alone individually, and also spend time with Him by being with others in the church and in the church meetings
The enemy however is subtle to distract people by various doctrines gifts and functions as well as opinions arguments and even fighting
Colossians shows us that He is God, and He is man; He is the Creator, and He is also the first item of creation
After we have repented and been regenerated, from that time onward we need to have our mind constantly renewed
In Philippians, however, we have Christ set up as a pattern based on the fact that Christ is now living within us
God's purpose in giving us so many material things that we may exist is that we may live with Christ and for Christ
The worldly people, the unbelievers, however, have been and still are distracted from Christ by these material things
He was not distracted by the worldly things but by fundamental religion, not the heathen religion but by Judaism
If Christ were not the life-giving Spirit within us, we could not know and experience the power of His resurrection
When Paul was put in prison at the time he wrote Philippians, the prison was not opened and his chains did not fall off
The illness will remain, but praise Him, it simply paves the way and lays the ground for us to experience the resurrection power
If we were to open the door tomorrow and see that manna had come down, we would all be excited, and it would be in the major newspapers
Day by day they saw a miracle as something that came down from heaven in the morning, regardless of where they went or where they stayed
He may also have been challenged, 'If the Jesus you preach is the living One, if He is God, why are you suffering here?
The choragus supplied what they ate and drank, what they wore, their dwelling place, and their music and instruments
Jesus Christ is the reality, the Spirit of God today is the Spirit of Jesus Christ, so the Spirit is the Spirit of reality
If a house has the current of electricity, it has the reality of the electricity; without the current, there is no reality of electricity
Perhaps because people a few hundred years ago did not have electricity, they could not understand the Spirit of Jesus Christ as we do today
We must come to know that Christ is the Spirit, and everything related to God is realized by us in this Spirit
The Spirit was the breath of Christ; when the Lord breathed into His disciples, the breath that came out of His mouth was the Holy Spirit
We can live for seven days without eating and three to five days without drinking, but without air, we cannot live for three minutes
Even the mighty rushing wind on the day of Pentecost also brought in fresh air; the wind always brings the air
In this universe there is the reality of the Triune Godthe Father as the source the Son as the course and the Spirit as the current the flow
If we exercise our spirit and give heed to it, we will realize how rich, how real, and how living the indwelling Christ is
The life, expression, example, pattern, goal, mark, empowering, and secret are in the Spirit of Jesus Christ, who has the bountiful supply
In whom refers to Christ; in this One who will head up all things, we have been sealed with the Holy Spirit of the promise
We have to say that it is the human spirit mingled with the Holy Spirit; the two spirits mingle and twine together
In chapter three, verse 4 says, 'By which, in reading it, you can perceive my understanding in the mystery of Christ'
In chapter five, verse 18 says, 'And do not be drunk with wine, in which is dissoluteness, but be filled in spirit'
We can never exhaust reading it, and we can never exhaust what can be ministered of Christ with His church from it
We have seen in Colossians that Christ is everything, but we do not see much of the work of Christ in that book
He was made transcendent above all things, the things not only in space but throughout time, since the universe is space plus time
Christ is so high and transcendent that He is above all the universe, not only the things in this age but also in the age to come
What God wrought in Christ, what Christ attained and obtained, is not only for the church but also to the church
God lifted Christ up in ascension to the highest place, and God put Him on the throne as the Head of all things
All that Christ has done, all that He has accomplished, obtained, and attained, is to the church, that is, is transmitted to the church
In these last days, however, the Lord will recover not more teachings but more reality, that is, more and more of Himself
We have to minister the riches of Christ to people, such as life, wisdom, patience, and the humility of Christ
All the ministers, all the gifted persons raised up by the Lord in these days, must learn to minister only the riches of Christ
Those who minister to the Lord's people must realize that what people need today are the riches of Christ, not doctrine or teaching
The church today is not built up, because there are too little nourishment, supply, and real material with which to build up the church
The apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers all minister Christ to the saints to perfect them by this ministry
All the experiences of Christ are based on the fact that we are in Christ, that is, incorporated with Christ and one with Christ
We are 'buying' and 'selling' Christ, 'dealing' with Christ, 'making concessions' with Christ, and 'trading' with Christ
Once we have seen these two facts, we need the five factors mentioned above-strengthening, renewing, growing, building, and fighting
We have been regenerated, and we have an inner man, but with some the inner man is weak and young, even childish or babyish
In a proper sense, when He was brought to the cross to be slaughtered, He was weak in His soul, in Himself, but He was strong in the spirit
The inner man is our human spirit with Christ in it, while the heart includes the mind, emotion, will, and conscience
When our spirit, our inner center, is strengthened, Christ can spread out and take over our mind, emotion, will, and conscience
When we are strengthened into the inner man and give Christ more ground, then He can saturate our hearts and make His home there
The husbandman of an orchard can tell us that the way to help trees grow is by cutting off the old branches to make the tree new
Doctrinally speaking, we are in Christ, but experientially speaking, in so many things we are still not in Christ
Righteousness as our breastplate to cover our conscience is Christ Himself, and the shoes of the gospel of peace are also Christ
All the foregoing points-what Christ is to us, the ministry of Christ, and the experience of Christ-depend on the mingled spirit
Concerning our human spirit, we have to be filled in spirit , pray in spirit , and see the vision in our spirit
It is in this mingled spirit, including our spirit and the Holy Spirit, that we are one with Christ and one with the other saints
If we remain in the mingled spirit we will be sanctified and cleansed, and all the spots and wrinkles will be gone
In this way the church will not only be grown up but also purified-without blemish, spot, or wrinkle-and glorious, fresh, new, and perfect
