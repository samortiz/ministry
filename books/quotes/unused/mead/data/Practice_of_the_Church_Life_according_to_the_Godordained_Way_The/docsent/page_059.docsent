   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE THE LABORING WAY Scripture Reading: Rom 15:16; 1 Cor 15:10, 58; Col 1:28-29; 1 Pet 2:5, 9; Acts 2:46-47; 4:24; 5:12; 6:4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message I would like to speak something very practical concerning the practice of the church life according to the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY BEING THE LABORING WAY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The God-ordained way is the laboring way Col 1:29; 1 Cor 15:10, 58 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To labor is more than to work.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Without our laboring, there can be no practice of the God-ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The New Testament tells us clearly that Paul was a laboring apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 1 Corinthians 15:10 Paul said that he labored more than all the other apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Colossians 1:29 Paul used a word that is even stronger than the word labored.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There he said that he was struggling according to God's operation, which operated in him in power.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In his use of these terms, Paul was probably alluding to the competing of athletes in the Olympic games.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In every event in the Olympics, the athletes are struggling to gain the crown 1 Cor 9:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Romans 15:16 Paul said that he was a laboring priest of the gospel of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In that verse the word laboring has the same root in Greek as the word energizing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Energy is the noun, whereas energize is the verb.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There Paul said that he was energizing himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To energize yourself is to use the last ounce of your strength.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In other words, it is to pour out the last drop of your blood.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It also means to exhaust yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In carrying out his ministry for God's economy, Paul exhausted himself.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we do anything by taking the way of laboring, struggling, and energizing ourselves, we will surely have a success.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have participated in the Lord's work in His recovery for more than sixty years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this work I have never suffered a defeat.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I would not be defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I may be defeated today, but I will persevere in the same thing for another period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>My ministering on the God-ordained way has been like a coach's instructing of his players.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>At the present time there is the need for some to develop my teaching into a practical, detailed way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One of the points that I stressed repeatedly is that every local church should have one-third of its members going out in a regularly scheduled way to visit people for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Taipei one brother picked up a burden for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Within half a year he stirred up the entire church in Taipei, which has over five thousand regular attendants each Lord's Day morning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Through this stirring up, one-third of the saints began to practice the regular going out for the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>That was a great help to Taipei.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Now Taipei has seventeen hundred people going out regularly in a scheduled way to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If they do not gain one within a year, surely they will gain one within two years.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we would go to visit people according to a regular schedule, we cannot care for our "climate."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Whether we are happy or full of anxiety, whether we are victorious or defeated, we still must go.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I doubt that many of us have ever practiced this way.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We are all easily directed by our "climate."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just a little "rain" and we stop going.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We may intend to go out to contact people, but then something may happen to stop us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not go, because the "weather" is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This causes us to change our schedule.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In my ministry concerning the God-ordained way, I also stressed very much that we need to learn how to prophesy, and we need to train the saints how to prophesy.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Another brother in Taipei picked up this burden, and today the saints in his district in Taipei are excelling in the matter of prophesying.</S>
