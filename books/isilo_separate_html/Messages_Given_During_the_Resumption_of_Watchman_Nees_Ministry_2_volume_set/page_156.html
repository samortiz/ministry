Today He dwells in the church. Christ is the One who fills all in all. He is exceedingly rich. Today the Christ in you, in me, and in another should also be very rich. Moreover, Christ is also dwelling in the church today. Hence, the church should also be very rich. In the Old Testament, it says that one can drive away a thousand. Logically speaking, two should then be able to drive away two thousand. This is human addition. But God says that two can drive away ten thousand (Josh. 23:10). The church is filled with Christ, and Christ is the One who fills all in all. How rich is the Lord who dwells in the church! The church is His Body (Eph. 1:23). God has made us His dwelling place through the Holy Spirit (Eph. 2:22). The Triune God is now living among all of us, and He is walking among all of us. This is different from living within one single individual.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Church Being the Body of Christ<br>for the Expression of the Riches of God</H2><P>Ephesians 1 speaks of the church as the Body. Chapter two speaks of the church as the dwelling place. The Lord is living within us. Today the Body of Christ is God's dwelling place in spirit. Chapter five says that Christ loves the church and gave Himself for her, for the purpose of gaining her (Eph. 5:25). If He could not gain the church, His death would have become a death in vain. Through His death, the church came into being. The church is intimately related to the kingdom. Revelation 1 says that He has washed us with His own blood to make us a kingdom (Rev. 1:5b-6). The purpose of the Lord's death was to secure a kingdom. The book of Matthew also puts the church and the kingdom together. The keys of the kingdom of the heavens were given to Peter (Matt. 16:18-19). Revelation 9 speaks of a star that fell, to which is given the key of the shaft of the abyss. The things from the abyss come up and fill the earth, so that men have a taste of hell for five months and cannot find death even when they seek for it. What is the meaning of the keys of the kingdom of the heavens given to Peter? It means that the things of the heavens should fill the earth. The kingdom of the heavens is inseparable from the church. The kingdom of the heavens is a great matter. It is not brought in through you or me alone. Such a great thing as the kingdom can only be brought in by the church. An eye or a hand alone cannot do much. Today the church is here. All that there is in the kingdom of the heavens should be opened up and brought in by the church. The Lord told Peter that the things in the kingdom of the heavens can be opened up to man. To open up the things in the kingdom of the heavens takes more than one individual's work. It takes the whole church to do it.</P><P>Wherever there is the testimony of the church, Satan will use all kinds of means to attack it. Among us, the Lord is expressing God's glory, His authority, and His riches. What a glory this is! If we are here by ourselves, God will be limited by us. God's intention is for the church to testify to the authorities in the heavenlies. For this reason, Satan is attacking the church everywhere. Today, if we neglect the testimony of the church, we will surely fail.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>No Member in the Body<br>Being Unnecessary</H2><P>The Body needs all of its members. A farmer plows with his hands and eats with his mouth. His mouth eats what his hands produce. There is a story that tells of a country farmer whose chin was caught by the spikes of a tree. His hands would not help him to free his chin. Instead, all day long he rebuked his eyes for being so careless as to let the chin be caught on the tree.</P><P>There is no useless member in the Body. Even the Head cannot say to any member, "I have no need of you." The Lord is after the whole Body today, and not just after individual members. This requires that we pay the greatest price to accomplish God's will. May God be merciful to us.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_155.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_157.html">Next</a> </body></html>
