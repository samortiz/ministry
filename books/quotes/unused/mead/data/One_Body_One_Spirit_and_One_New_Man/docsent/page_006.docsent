   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MESSAGE TWO THE FULLNESS AND THE BODY Scripture Reading: Eph 1:23; Gal 3:27-28; Rom 12:5; 1 Cor 12:12; Acts 9:4-5; 1 Cor 1:13a THE BODY BEING THE FULLNESS OF THE ONE WHO FILLS ALL IN ALL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we will speak directly about the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must first ask, "What is the Body?"</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We may say that there is only one verse in the entire New Testament that tells us what the Body is, and that is Ephesians 1:23: "Which the church is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The phrase the fullness of the One who fills all in all is very difficult to understand and explain.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Of course, we all know that the One who fills all in all refers to the unlimited Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Here all is used twice, successively, once referring to Christ's filling all and another time referring to Christ's being in all.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All comprises all persons, all matters, and all things and includes every person, every matter, and every thing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Greek, the word for all is pan, encompassing persons, matters, and things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is not wrong to translate that Christ is "the One who fills all in all," but the meaning is very broad.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After studying this phrase for many, many years, I still do not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to its meaning, all is the correct translation, but according to its usage, it is very difficult to understand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some people have translated this verse as "the fullness of the One who fills all people in all people."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This translation is also correct, and it is easy to explain and apply.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Christ truly is the One who fills all people and is in all people.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All people does not refer to the unsaved; instead, it refers to all those who belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is similar to Colossians 3:11: "Where there cannot be Greek and Jew but Christ is all and in all."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All here is the same as all in Ephesians 1:23.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, the translation of this word requires a great deal of consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At this time I do not want to use the broad explanation of all because it is too difficult to define accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I want to use the narrow definition of this word and thus explain it as referring to all men, to all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all men in all men.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>All of us saved ones, as the members of Christ, are the "all men" mentioned here.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ is in all of us, and He fills every one of us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, what is the church?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The church is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What is the Body?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Body is the fullness that issues from Christ's filling us within.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Simply stated, the Body is the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is the Body of Christ, and this Body is His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To say that the Body is the fullness is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Suppose we have a strong, husky brother here who does not have a body but who only has a head hanging in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even though his head is very big, he is without a body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Would you consider him full or not?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>He is not full; rather, he is poor and empty.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We must know that the fullness of a person is not in his head but in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A person's body is his fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Body of Christ is the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do not forget that Ephesians 1:23 says, " The church is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In brief, the Body of Christ is the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Where is this Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This Christ is the One who fills all the saints in all the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His Body is the issue of such a filling.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST COMING FROM THE RICHES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Now we must go one step further to see where the fullness comes from.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When a brother is born, he is just a little baby who is not so full.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How then does he become so full?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He eats chicken, beef, bread, and other things for many months and many years.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then all the food as the riches are assimilated and constituted into his organic body to become his fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In the past seventeen or eighteen years I have stated several times the fact that Ephesians chapter one and chapter four both mention fullness, while chapter three mentions the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What is the difference between the riches of Christ and the fullness of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Please remember that if you put a big pile of food here, it would not be called fullness; it would be called riches.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, once you have eaten these riches item by item and have digested them, they become your cells and the elements of your body.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Consequently, your body is constituted with what you have eaten and digested.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This constituted body is a fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After the riches have been digested and constituted into a body, they become the fullness of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The riches of Christ are boundless, immeasurable, and unsearchable, but you still need to eat and assimilate these riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The more Christ you eat and the more Christ is assimilated into you, the more element of the fullness you will gain.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I believe that you all are clear what the fullness of Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is Christ experienced by you, assimilated by you, and constituted into your being to become your element; this is the fullness, which is the Body of Christ.</S>
