   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>GOD POURING OUT THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>UPON MAN FOR HIS SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What should we do now that the Holy Spirit has enlightened and we have seen our position?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There is one thing we continually neglect in our preaching of the gospel, which the Bible pays attention to all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have to realize that the work of the Lord Jesus for the sinners is indeed precious and crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But likewise the work of the Holy Spirit for the sinners is equally precious and crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Bible shows us that not only does the Holy Spirit come to enlighten us and to show us our sins, our lost position, and our unrighteousness before God and men, but this Spirit is also sent from God and is poured forth upon all flesh for the purpose that man everywhere could be saved through His work Acts 2:17-18, 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some who know a little more than others concerning the truth of the Bible think that it is easy to receive forgiveness and to accept the Lord Jesus as Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All he has to do is to kneel down and pray and accept Him from his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps he does not even have to kneel down; he only has to accept in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But many people do not have this knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They may be weak or from inaccessible lands and may not have had the chance to listen to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They may think that it is a very difficult thing to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They may think that they have to pray for a long time, and they have no assurance whether God would listen to their prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If I were to ask you today if you are saved, you can answer quickly that you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But such a statement would sound strange to one from an inaccessible land.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They would wonder how you could be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>To them it is a most difficult thing to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They would say that they have prayed for many years and are still not sure if they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>They hope to be saved, and they try their best to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But they still do not know if they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It seems as if they are not yet saved.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To them, salvation is something very difficult to achieve.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But my friends, just as the work of the Lord Jesus is complete, the work of the Holy Spirit in causing us to appropriate the Lord's work is also complete.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Bible shows us clearly that God sent the Holy Spirit for the purpose that we, the sinners, would receive the Holy Spirit's work and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Son of God came for the sake of the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the same way, the coming of the Holy Spirit is also for all flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As long as we are a man in the flesh, we can obtain the Lord's work for us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>WHOEVER CALLS UPON</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE NAME OF THE LORD SHALL BE SAVED</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Let us read Romans 10:13: "Whoever calls upon the name of the Lord shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The subject of Romans 10 is on God causing the Lord Jesus to die and resurrect for us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the few verses prior to this verse, God asks if there is anyone who can bring Christ down from heaven to die for us and if there is anyone who can bring Christ up from the abyss to resurrect for us vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no such person.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Such a work can only be done by God alone.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is God Himself who has caused Christ to die for us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is also God Himself who caused Him to resurrect for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Hence, everyone who calls on the name of the Lord today is saved.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not know if you realize that it is a most wonderful thing to be saved just by calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the original language, the word call means that we only need to say His name.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Today in order to contact a brother, all I have to do is to go to his door and knock twice with the door handle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is to call upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I do not have to beg him to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I do not have to implore him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I only need to go to him and inform him with a word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is the meaning of calling.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Chinese version translates this word as implore.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is incorrect.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although one cannot say that the Greek word carries no sense of imploring, it does mean more of an invoking.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since God has caused the Lord Jesus to die and resurrect for us, all who desire to be saved need only to go to God and tell Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They will then be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As long as you would go to the Lord Jesus and call His name once, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>All you need to do is to open your mouth once.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>You do not need to do anything else because He has already completed all the work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All the work has been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>That is why we say that we are justified by faith, and not by works Gal 2:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If you think that even to call once is a work, then God says just believe a little in your heart and it will be enough.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 8 says, "The word is near you, in your mouth and in your heart."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since the Lord has done the work of death and resurrection, we have nothing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>As long as we open our mouth once, everything is done.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You may ask why it transpires so quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is true that the work of Christ has been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But why will I be saved just by calling?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How can the Lord's work in death, resurrection, and ascension be applied to me so quickly?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Acts 2 is an added explanation to this.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Verse 17 says, "And it shall be in the last days, says God, that I will pour out of My Spirit upon all flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We have to remember that in the last days God will pour out of His Spirit upon all flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What is the result of this?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Verse 21 says, "And it shall be that everyone who calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Verse 17 is linked to verse 21.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God says that He will pour out of His Spirit upon all flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then He says that whoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Everyone who calls on the name of the Lord will be saved because God has poured out His Spirit upon all flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Holy Spirit is working now on all flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If there is anyone today whose sins have not been forgiven and who still does not know how to be saved and receive eternal life, who does not know that the Lord Jesus is his Savior, he must remember that God has poured out the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Holy Spirit is upon you already; He is waiting for you.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Once you call, you will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>God says that He would pour out of His Spirit upon all flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Why is there Pentecost?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God gave us Pentecost because He wanted to pour out the Holy Spirit upon all flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Now one only needs to open his mouth and say, "O Lord!" and the Holy Spirit will come into him.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Holy Spirit is like the light.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>As long as there is a crack, light will come in. You may not realize how well light goes through cracks.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If you do not believe this, just go next door.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If you drill a hole in the wall, as soon as the drill is taken out, the light enters.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>You do not have to look for it because it comes in immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>As long as there is a crack, the light will come in. Today God has poured out the Holy Spirit upon all flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>As long as you are alive, the Holy Spirit is upon you.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Whenever you say, "O Lord!" the Holy Spirit begins working.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>This is the meaning of calling on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The ancient Chinese say that one must appeal to heaven, to earth, and to his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Now we only need to appeal to the Lord once.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>When one mentions prayer, he always thinks of supplication more than invocation.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Actually, all we need to do is invoke Him.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Once we open our mouth, the Holy Spirit comes in. When the Holy Spirit comes in, the accomplished work of the Lord Jesus is brought to us.</S>
