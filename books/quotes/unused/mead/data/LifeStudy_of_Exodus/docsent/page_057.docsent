   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SECOND CONFLICT A. On God s Side</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us now consider the second conflict between Jehovah and Pharaoh 7:8-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Exodus 7:10 says, And Moses and Aaron went in unto Pharaoh, and they did so as Jehovah had commanded: and Aaron cast down his rod before Pharaoh, and before his servants, and it became a serpent Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I doubt that Pharaoh and his servants realized that the significance of this miracle was to expose the fact that their life was a life under Satan s usurping hand, that their living in Egypt was under the Devil s usurpation and possession.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Pharaoh and his people relied on the natural resources of Egypt, especially on the rich supply of the Nile.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This supply was their rod, a rod which was actually a serpent, the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In God s eyes Pharaoh and the Egyptians were relying on Satan and were living under Satan s usurping hand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This exposure was not a punishment, but an expression of God s mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In His mercy God exposed the true nature of Egyptian living.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He wanted the Egyptians to know that everything they relied on was of the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God s intention in this exposure was to cause them to forsake that kind of living.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The principle is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When God comes to us, He does not firstly punish the self, the flesh, or the old man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In His mercy He firstly exposes the satanic nature of our fallen life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. On Pharaoh s Side</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Pharaoh called upon the magicians to do the same thing with their rods as Aaron had done with his 7:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Verse 12 says, For they cast down every man his rod, and they became serpents: but Aaron s rod swallowed up their rods.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Years ago, I wondered why the Egyptian magicians were able to do the same thing Aaron had done.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I asked the Lord concerning this and told Him that I did not see how such a thing could happen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may encounter a similar situation in the preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We may compare the philosophers of the world today to those magicians.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These philosophers may teach things similar to what we preach in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may expose the nature of the fallen human life, and they may do the same.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may speak about the preoccupations of life in the world, and they may do this also.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nevertheless, just as Aaron s rod swallowed up the rods of the Egyptian magicians, so the preaching of the gospel swallows up today s philosophical teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We experienced this many times in our gospel preaching in China, where there were many magicians, or philosophical teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Certain teachings of these philosophers were nearly the same as some of the teachings in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>For example, the Bible teaches that we should not love the world.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some Chinese philosophers taught the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, in our preaching of the gospel Aaron s rod swallowed up the rods of the magicians.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Philosophers from colleges and universities sometimes attended our gospel meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead of being threatened by their presence, we called on the Lord and asked Him to deal with these people.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He showed forth His wisdom, and we saw the gospel swallow up the teaching of the philosophers.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The gospel swallows up all the philosophies of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not be threatened or discouraged in your preaching of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Rather, believe that your rod will swallow up the philosophical rods.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Nothing can overcome the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Although the gospel is not philosophy, nothing is more philosophical than the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this reason the gospel is able to swallow up the rods of the world s philosophers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>C. The Issue</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In verses 13 and 14 we see the issue of the second conflict.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Verse 13 says, And Pharaoh s heart was hard, that he hearkened not unto them Heb .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Most versions of the Bible say that Pharaoh s heart was hardened.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This, however, is not the meaning here.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Such a rendering implies that Pharaoh s heart may have been soft but that it became hard.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But Pharaoh s heart was hard from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Darby says that the Hebrew word for hard in this verse means stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Because Pharaoh s heart was stubborn, it could not be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The second conflict exposed the hardness of Pharaoh s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A further issue of this conflict was Pharaoh s refusal to let the children of Israel go v. 14 . The first time God came in, Pharaoh refused to hearken to His word.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This time Pharaoh refused to hearken to God s demand, even after God had exposed the nature of life in the world under Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This forced God to deal with Pharaoh more severely in the third conflict.</S>
