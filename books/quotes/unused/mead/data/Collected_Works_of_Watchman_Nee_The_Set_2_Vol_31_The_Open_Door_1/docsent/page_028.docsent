   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Peace to my dear Brother X and Sister X in the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I really thank the Lord for your letter today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>My heart was filled with sadness to learn that Brother Luan was so physically weak.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Praise God that His children are always in His hands.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord always has a good intention for them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I praise Him for allowing me to learn a little of your situation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>May the Lord greatly support you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I give you 1 Peter 5:6-7, and 9-10 and pray for you unceasingly in my heart.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I went to England in August and stayed with Miss Fischbacher for six weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I attended a ten-day conference on spiritual growth there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The condition of the meeting was very good.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We stayed in the country for another four weeks, praying in private and often mentioning your name.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I wanted to write once, but I did not get around to it.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I praise God for charging me with the work of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I really want to speak with you face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These days Luke 21:28 has been a comfort to my heart!</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Greet each of the brothers and sisters for me.</S>

   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Sun Wen-hwa</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>October 11</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Address omitted</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A Letter from</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Brother Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Brother Watchman, peace in the Lord:</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It was a big loss that I could not meet you and all the co-workers at Hankow and receive your teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I hope to read in The Open Door about the light the Lord has given you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have been studying the Hebrew language with the brothers and sisters here for the past four weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We finished last Friday.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I had originally planned to visit the region around Dong-Shiang this week, but I felt later that I should still finish some of the articles for The Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I also felt that I should have some fellowship with the brothers and sisters, so I postponed my departure to the countryside.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>A letter from Peking invited me to go there with my family, but I felt that, for the present, I should do something in Jiao-Dong.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Brother Chang, who was first in Chefoo and then in Tsingtao, is now clear about his calling.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although outwardly this brother does not appear to be able to do anything, his life before the Lord and his heart for the Lord are excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, only that which passes through the test counts.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He has a burden for the countryside around Jiao-Dong.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A few days ago he was here in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He will probably go with me into the countryside this time.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>May the Lord lead and bless!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Another brother, Chang Tien-ren, is working in Yi County.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This brother studied in the Yingkow Seminary and knew Brother Hwa Tien-min and the others as classmates.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The brothers in Chefoo baptized him last summer.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When I came to Chefoo this spring, he also came to stay in Chefoo.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He came again to Chefoo a few days ago, and I got to know him better.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Perhaps the Lord has His leading in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Please pray for this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Brother Bi-Chen is now in his home town in Ping Yin County; Sister Sung is also in her home town.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This region still has a need for workers.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>May the Lord remember this!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I praise the Lord for His presence!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Please greet Brothers Luan and Lan for me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>December 9</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Address omitted</S>
