   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Parents Do Not Have</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Unlimited Authority</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some people hold on to the concept that parents are always right.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They hold on to this concept even after they have become Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Please remember that many parents are not always right.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many times the parents are quite wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should not pick up pagan concepts, and we should not assume that we have unlimited authority over our children.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Please remember that parents do not have absolute authority over their children.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Children have their own spirit and their own soul, over which the parents have no control whatsoever.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Since children have their own spirit and soul, they are under their own control.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They can go to heaven, or they can go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They must be responsible for themselves before God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We cannot treat them as an object or as property.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should not assume that we can exercise unlimited authority over them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God has not given us such absolute authority.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has given us unlimited authority over dead things, but He has not given us unlimited authority over human beings who have their own spirit and soul.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>No one can have absolute authority over another person with a spirit and a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The thought of absolute authority is a pagan concept.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is related to pride and should not be found among us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Children Are Not the Means</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>by which Parents Vent Their Wrath</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are reasonable with our friends and with other members of our family.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We are courteous and reasonable with our colleagues and are even more courteous and respectful to our superiors.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We try to get along well with every kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But we treat our children as if they are our personal property, forgetting that they also have a spirit and a soul and that they are gifts from God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is possible for us to vent our anger on them and treat them as we please.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some people think that they need to be courteous to everyone in the world except their own children.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>They seem to regard their children as the means of venting their anger.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I know of parents who are this way at home.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They seem to think that a man must be courteous and gentle and yet, at the same time, have a strong temper.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It seems that they are not complete if they do not lose their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Nevertheless, they realize that they will be in trouble if they lose their temper with others.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Their superiors will fire them if they lose their temper with them, and their friends will despise them if they lose their temper with them.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>They think that there is only one place where they can lose their temper without suffering punishment with their children.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many parents have a terrible temper toward their children.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is as if their children were the cultivating ground for their temper.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Please forgive me for saying such strong words.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I have seen many parents shout at their children over dinner and then turn toward me and say, Mr. Nee, please take some of this food.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is delicious.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When this happens.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I have no heart for the food.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These things often happen within a span of just a few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>On the one hand, they scold their children, and on the other hand, they say, Mr. Nee, please eat.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The problem with some parents is that they consider their children to be the rightful means for venting their anger.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Did God give us children so that we have a place to lose our temper?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>May God be merciful to us!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please remember that God has not denied all rights of children.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He has not annulled all the self-esteem, personal freedom, or independent constitution of the children.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He has not put them in our hands for us to beat them and scold them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There is no such thing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a non-Christian thought; it is not a Christian concept.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Please remember that the same standard of right and wrong equally applies to us and our children.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There should be only one standard for us and our children.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We cannot have one standard for ourselves and another standard for them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let me say a word to the new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You must be tender and gentle to your children.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Never be rude to them.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Do not scold them or rebuke them arbitrarily, much less beat them at will.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Please remember that such conduct leads to indulgence.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Everyone who wants to know God must learn to control himself.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>In particular, he should control himself when it comes to dealing with his children.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This kind of self-control comes from a proper respect of a child s soul.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>No matter how small or weak a child is, remember that he has his own personality.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God has given him a personality and a soul.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You must not damage his character, destroy his personality, or despise his soul.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You must not treat him in an arbitrary way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You must learn to respect him as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>At the same time, our children are entrusted to our family.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Their standard of morality must be our standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Whatever applies to them must also apply to us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Parents have no right to vent their wrath on their children.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>A Christian should not lose his temper with anyone, not even with his own children.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is wrong for us to lose our temper with anyone, no matter whom it may be.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should be reasonable, and we should only reason with our children.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>What is right is always right and what is wrong is always wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Do not intimidate them just because they are small and weak.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Those who oppress the weak and the small are the most cowardly people in the world.</S>
