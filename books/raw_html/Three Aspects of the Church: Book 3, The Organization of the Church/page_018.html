	 <h2 class="head4">To Submit to an Apostle&rsquo;s Authority<br />
Being to Accept His Apostleship</h2>
<p>In summary, an apostle is not appointed by man; rather, he is acknowledged by man. However, those who acknowledge an apostle do not become an authority to the apostle; rather, they submit to the apostle&rsquo;s authority. An apostle is one who absolutely submits himself to God and who receives his work and commission from the Lord. In the work an apostle receives a measure of authority, which enables him to carry out the work. Moreover, those who receive his work must accept his authority. To accept his authority is to acknowledge that he is an apostle. If there is a lack, it is proof that there are problems with the work and the church in that particular place. If these two aspects are not made clear, both the work and the church will be abnormal. For the work to be normal and the church to be strong, those sent by the Lord must be dealt with by the Lord, and those who receive the work must learn certain lessons before the Lord.</p>
<p>We may desire to receive a work, but are we willing to submit to authority? This is an important question. An apostle should ask himself whether he has authority when he goes out to work. Some people work without authority. We must remember that those who are not sent by the Lord but go out to work by themselves have only a work but no authority. On our part, we must do only one work&mdash;the work that the Lord has sent us to do. Then when we go out to work, we will go with authority. Moses was an apostle sent by God to bring the children of Israel out of the land of Egypt. When Moses led the children of Israel out of Egypt, he had not only a work but also authority. When the children of Israel caused trouble and even rebelled against him, he did not contend with them; instead, he turned to Jehovah God and spoke to Him of His work (cf. Exo. 32).</p>
<p>When the children of Israel worshipped the golden calf at the foot of Mount Sinai, God wanted to forsake them. He said to Moses, &ldquo;Go, get down; for your people, whom you brought up out of the land of Egypt, have corrupted themselves&rdquo; (v. 7). Moses replied, &ldquo;Jehovah, why does Your anger burn against Your people, whom You brought out of the land of Egypt with great power and with a mighty hand?&rdquo; (v. 11). God was angered by the children of Israel and wanted to destroy them, yet Moses immediately told Him that the children of Israel were <em>His</em> people, whom <em>He</em> had brought out of the land of Egypt. In other words, God, not Moses, brought the people out of the land of Egypt. What Moses meant was that God&rsquo;s people were God&rsquo;s business, not his. When we serve the Lord and encounter difficulties, can we be like Moses and boldly tell God, &ldquo;God, this is Your work. This is Your business&rdquo;?</p>
<p>There can be no pretension in this matter. If someone dares to pretend, God will strongly touch his conscience and ask him, &ldquo;Whose work is this?&rdquo; One who is sent by God for a particular work surely has received from God the authority inherent in his work. He who has the authority in the work must be commissioned by God. Man does not determine who has authority. However, if those who receive the work have been shown mercy by God and have learned the necessary lessons, they will know that authority is inherent in the work. If one does not receive authority, he will miss the blessing.</p>
<p>Some people speak of authority in the church so that they can control other people and make them submit to their personal authority. If this is the case, we had better not submit to such authority. Authority is not a tool to ensnare people; nonetheless, God&rsquo;s children cannot receive the work that God carries out through His servants, yet deny the authority that God has given to his servants. If we deny the authority of God in one of God&rsquo;s servants, we should utterly reject that person&rsquo;s work. This is permissible. However, if we desire to receive the work that God is carrying out through His servant, we should not deny His servant&rsquo;s authority.</p>
<p>If God&rsquo;s children are afraid to receive the authority of one of God&rsquo;s servants because they are afraid of being ensnared and controlled by someone who assumes to have authority, they should examine or test that person. They can do so by observing whether or not there is blessing related to the work. If we receive a work but reject the authority related to the work, our inner eyes will be blind and we will be in darkness; moreover, we will not have the blessing related to the work. God has established laws related to the universe and even laws related to our body. Likewise, God has also established laws in the church, the Body of Christ. One of these laws is that the Lord gives authority to the one whom He commissions to do His work. We cannot receive the work of one of God&rsquo;s servants yet reject his authority. If this is the case, we will surely lose the blessing.</p>
<p>Those who always say that the church is wrong and that the Lord&rsquo;s servants are wrong will never be able to rise up. Their eyes are blind. My point is that, logically speaking, these people should be clear and strong, because if they were not clear, how could they tell that others are wrong? Moreover, if they themselves are not strong, how can they continually condemn others? The fact is that the more they say that the church is wrong, the worse and the more abnormal they become.</p>
<p>If we meet a person who has not been meeting for half a year, we might expect him to say that the elders are wrong, the responsible brothers are wrong, and the workers are wrong. The only thing that he will be able to see is that everyone else is wrong. Why is it that the weakest one knows everyone else&rsquo;s shortcomings? This is because he has lost the blessing and does not see clearly. He has lost the blessing and does not have clear sight. This is because he has received God&rsquo;s work but has rejected the authority of the one who was commissioned with the work.</p>
<p>God has never given any person the authority to determine who is an apostle. Rather, apostleship can be acknowledged by the apostles themselves and by those who receive the apostles&rsquo; work. Whether or not a person is an apostle is something that must be proven by the person himself and by those who receive his work. No one can control or determine anything by himself, because authority comes from the Lord&rsquo;s hand.</p>
