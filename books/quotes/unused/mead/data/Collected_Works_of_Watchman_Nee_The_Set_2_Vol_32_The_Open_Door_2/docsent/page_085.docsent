   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>15 The Gospel Book Room, P. O. Box 323, Shanghai, March 1939 NEWS OF THE WORK A Letter from Brother Watchman Nee</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>My work during the last year has been centered around Honor Oak where Mr. Austin-Sparks is . Although there are many other works, to me the most important work is at Honor Oak.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The situation in Europe is the same as that in China.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many works and many of the workers are good, but not as the result of revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, they are based on tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As in China, the knowledge of the flesh and the denial of the natural life are subjects that are almost unheard of.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Honor Oak is indeed the center of testimony in Europe and America today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The testimony, the revelation, and the knowledge of the self and the natural man are here.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The light concerning the Body life is rarely seen by others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of course, Honor Oak, like any other place, needs help before it can be perfect.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But so many have volunteered to come and help in Honor Oak that the brothers at Honor Oak cannot but be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>During the past year, they have indeed treated me as being much more than a common guest.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They are both open and on guard at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I have gradually shared with them what I have received from the Lord through His grace, what has been kept hidden by the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You know that I never presume to be a teacher of others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I know of many areas that God can help Honor Oak in, yet how do I know that I am not wrong?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>How easy it is for man to be governed by his own deceptive dreams and to be obsessed with his own importance!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, I am waiting and waiting patiently.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>My heart is really earnest for coming home, yet I know that there is work that I have to do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>During the February conference, God led us especially Mr. Austin-Sparks and me to see many similar things.</S>
