   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE SEVEN THE CORPORATE THORN-BUSH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the thorn-bush in Exodus 3 is a symbol of Moses as God s called one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the eyes of God, Moses was a thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No one has much appreciation for a thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although Moses had been rejected by man, he was accepted by God, and the fire of God s glory burned within him and upon him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, Moses was a thorn-bush burning with the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The burning thorn-bush in Exodus 3, however, refers not only to Moses as an individual, but also to the children of Israel as a corporate entity.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God s people, the children of Israel, included those who were weak and those who were strong.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moses was only one among God s corporate people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To the Lord, the thorn-bush burning in chapter three was not only an individual, but also a corporate people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>My burden in this message is to consider the corporate aspect of the thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>As individuals, we all are today s Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we are also part of the church as the corporate thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God s goal in dealing with His people, the children of Israel, was to obtain a proper dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Deuteronomy 33:16 speaks of God as the One who dwelt in the thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This word, written by Moses, indicates that God possessed that burning thorn-bush as His house, His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who would ever have thought that God s habitation on earth would be a thorn-bush?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Moses must have realized that the burning thorn-bush he saw when God called him was a symbol of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>At the time of Deuteronomy 33, Moses regarded himself as a thorn-bush, but to God he was the man of God Deut 33:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the individual aspect Moses was a thorn-bush, and in the corporate aspect the children of Israel were a thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nevertheless, the God of blessing dwelt in such a bush.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If God does not dwell in us, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without Him we are nothing more than ordinary thorn-bushes.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although we may be cultured ladies and gentlemen or well-trained professionals, we still are thorn-bushes because our fallen nature is related to thorns and to the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In referring to God as the One who dwelt in the thorn-bush, Moses heart must have been full of thanks to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>During the last forty years of his life, Moses knew that he was just a thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But he knew also that God was with him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We all need to have such a realization.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whenever we have a proper spirit before the Lord, we know that we are a thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We know that even our natural virtues, such as kindness, humility, and patience, are thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes we may even feel like prostrating ourselves before the Lord and confessing to Him how pitiful we are.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As he was blessing the children of Israel, Moses must have had such a sense about himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A well-known gospel song says, I m only a sinner saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The sense Moses had was much deeper, even more tender and sweet than this, for he realized he was a thorn-bush burned by the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today, as believers in Christ, we are not merely sinners saved by grace; we are a thorn-bush burning with the fire of God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moses had this realization both about himself and about the children of Israel as God s corporate people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Deep within he knew that both he personally and the Israelites corporately were a thorn-bush.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I. THE THORN AND THE FLAME OF FIRE</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>IN GENESIS 3</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to see that there is a connection between Genesis 3 and Exodus 3.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In both chapters we have the thorn and the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The thorn in Genesis 3 indicates that man is under a curse vv.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>17-18 , and the flame of fire indicates that man is excluded from God as the tree of life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>22-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>According to Genesis 3, thorns came from the curse due to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hence, thorns are a symbol of fallen man under the curse.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Immediately after the curse was pronounced, a flaming sword was placed at the east of the garden to keep the way of the tree of life v. 24 . Thus, sin brought in the curse, and the curse brought in the flame of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The function of fire in Genesis 3 is to exclude sinners from the tree of life, that is, from God as the source of life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If the Bible had ended with Genesis 3:24, our situation would be forever hopeless.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>According to chapters one and two of Genesis, we were created specifically to receive God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The man created by God was placed in front of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then in chapter three sin came in, man fell under the curse, and the fire of God s holiness excluded the cursed sinners from any direct contact with God as the tree of life.</S>
