<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>31. Concerning Dealing with Oneself</H2><P>Like a city that is broken down, without walls, is a man whose spirit is without restraint (v. 28). Blessed is the man who always fears, but he who hardens his heart will fall into calamity (28:14).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>32. Concerning Visions</H2><P>Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint (29:18a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. General Words of Wisdom</H2><P>In chapter thirty we have general words of wisdom.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Not Having the Knowledge of the Holy One</H2><P>Verses 2 through 4 say, "Surely I am more stupid than any man,/And do not have a man's understanding;/And I have not learned wisdom,/Nor do I have the knowledge of the Holy One./Who has ascended into heaven and descended?/Who has gathered the wind in his fists?/Who has wrapped up the waters in his garment?/Who has established all the ends of the earth?/What is his name, and what is his son's name, if you know?"</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Every Word of God Being Tried</H2><P>Every word of God is tried; He is a shield to those who take refuge in Him. Do not add to His words, lest He reprove you and you be found a liar (vv. 5-6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Two Things Being Asked For</H2><P>In verses 7 through 9 the writer asks for two things. He says, "Remove far from me falsehood and lies./Give me neither poverty nor riches;/Feed me with the food that is my portion,/Lest I become full and deny You and say, Who is Jehovah?/Or lest I become poor and steal and profane the name of my God."</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Not Slandering a Servant to His Master</H2><P>Verse 10 tells us not to slander a servant to his master, lest he curse us, and we be held guilty.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Four Detestable Generations</H2><P>Verses 11 through 14 speak of four detestable generations: "There is a generation that curse their father,/And do not bless their mother./There is a generation that are pure in their own eyes,/And yet are not washed from their filthiness. /There is a generation&#151;oh how lofty are their eyes,/And their eyelids are raised arrogantly./There is a generation whose teeth are like swords,/And their jaw teeth like knives,/To devour the afflicted from off the earth,/And the needy from among men."</P>
