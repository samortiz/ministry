   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In 2 Corinthians 1:21 the apostle Paul said that God was the One who "firmly attaches us with you unto Christ and has anointed us."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to consider why the apostle Paul said this.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When he wrote 2 Corinthians, the Corinthian believers were doubting his apostolic authority.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some even claimed that he was an insincere, fickle person, a man of yes and no. This is why he told them that the Christ he preached to them was always yes 1:19-20 . Then he told the Corinthians that he was a real priest in the priesthood who had been anointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In ancient times no one could assume the position and function of a priest unless he had been anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul said that he was anointed and attached to the Head of the priesthood, Christ, the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After the compounding of the ointment in Exodus 30, God told Moses to anoint all the parts of the tabernacle and Aaron and his sons vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>26-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Aaron became the anointed one, and all his sons were attached to him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then all his sons were anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The apostle Paul used this background to indicate to the Corinthians that today Christ is our real Aaron.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is the High Priest, and we are His sons.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God has attached us to Him, and God has anointed us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are assuming the position and function of priests because we have been attached to Christ, the anointed One.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God has anointed and appointed Christ to be the Head of the priesthood, and we all have been attached to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, we are the sons of the real Aaron today.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have become the priests of the divine priesthood because we have been attached to the Head Priest, and we have been anointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul's proof of his apostleship was the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He was attached to Christ, the anointed One, and he was anointed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the priests were anointed, they were consecrated and commissioned.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This ointment became Paul's seal, sealing him to assume his priestly position.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Spirit sealed him with everything of Christ's person, work, and attainments.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>These elements of Christ upon him were his seal to prove that he was anointed by God to serve Him as a priest.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, this anointing and sealing became a foretaste to Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No matter what the Corinthians thought of Paul, he testified that he was enjoying the Spirit as a foretaste.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The anointing and the sealing brought him the divine element for him to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I want to say again that what we need today is not doctrinal teaching, but the heavenly anointing with the heavenly ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We are consecrated, commissioned, ordained, and inaugurated into our priesthood by being anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The anointing is the painting of all that Christ is, all that He has done, and all that He has attained into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have been firmly attached to God's anointed One, and we have been anointed.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This anointing is the sealing, and this seal becomes the foretaste, the pledge, for our enjoyment.</S>
