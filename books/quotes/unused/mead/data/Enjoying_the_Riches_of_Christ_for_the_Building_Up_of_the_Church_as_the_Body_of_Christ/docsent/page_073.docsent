   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE LORD'S NEED FOR A RECOVERY, NOT A REVIVAL</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now we must see what the Lord's recovery is.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First we must point out the difference between recovery and revival.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We are not speaking here about a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A revival is good, even marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, consider the situation of the people in captivity; even if they had a revival, what good would that have been to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps it would have been good for the people, but it would not have been much good for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may illustrate the need for recovery by the scattering in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The city of Jerusalem was in the center of the good land, the temple was built in the center of Jerusalem, and all the people surrounding the temple were one.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then the captivity came in. According to history, the first captivity was to Syria, and later the captivity went to Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the ultimate captivity almost all the people of Israel were captured to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>By this we can realize that with captivity there is scattering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Scattering may not seem to be a negative word, but scattering implies divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The people were one in the holy land, but in captivity they were scattered and divided, some to Syria, some to Egypt, and some to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>While the people were in captivity, some godly ones might have prayed much, asking the Lord to give them a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>By the Lord's mercy He may have given them a revival there.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Considering the whole situation, however, what good would a revival have been to the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Regardless of how many revivals there were and how great they were, the people were still in captivity, and the building of God, the temple, was still destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even if there were a big revival in Syria, another big revival in Egypt, and many big revivals in Babylon, the Lord might have said, "I do not care for revivals.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Regardless of how many revivals you have, I do not have a dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I do not have a temple.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On this earth there is no place for Me to manifest My glory.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may have many revivals, but I am chased away by My enemy from this earth and from My people.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You feel very good to have revivals, but I do not care for that.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I care for a recovery of the building up of the destroyed temple."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some have been in Christianity for many years and heard much talk about revival, but they may never have heard about recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many pray, "O God, send us a revival."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Many godly ones in the past few centuries did pray very much in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Even today some still kneel and pray for a revival, saying, "O Lord, America needs a revival!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Oh, send a revival!"</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After the First World War, many Christian papers were published calling for a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have been reading the newspapers day by day for close to fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I have been watching not only the world situation but also the situation of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>To my observation in all the past forty or fifty years, there has been no real revival.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There have been many reports of big healings and other such matters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I went to some of the places where there was such a report.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Before I went, there were wonderful reports of revival, but by the time I arrived, the revival was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This happened not only in one place but in several places.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Today the Lord does not care much for revivals.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He cares for a real recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Again I say, if there were revivals in each place of captivity in Syria, in Egypt, and in Babylon the Lord would have said, "Regardless of how many revivals you have, I still do not have the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, I have shame from the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I do not need a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I need the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rise up and return.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For My recovery I need your return.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Return from captivity!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Return from Babylon!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Return back to Jerusalem!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is what I need."</S>
