   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Discipline Not Being a Punishment but a Glory</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What we are receiving is discipline; it is not punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Punishment is for the retribution of one s mistakes, while discipline is for the purpose of education.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Punishment comes because we have done something wrong; it responds to the past.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Discipline is also related to our mistakes, but it is something for the future.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Discipline bears an element of the future; it has a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have been called into the name of the Lord today; we belong to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Now we must be prepared to allow God to make us vessels of glory to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I can say with much confidence that God wants every one of His children to glorify Him in certain areas.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Every child of God should glorify Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, each one does it in a different way.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Some will glorify Him in one way, some in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We glorify God through different circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a consequence, God is glorified in a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Everyone has his own part and his own specialty.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God wants to create a certain kind of character in us for the purpose of glorifying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No one is exempt from God s disciplinary hand.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Such a hand works to accomplish the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have never seen a child of God who was exempt from His disciplinary hand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>D. Ignorance of Discipline Being a Great Loss</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is indeed a great loss if God s children do not understand His discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many people live a foolish life in the eyes of God for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They have no way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They do not know what the Lord wants to do in them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They walk according to their own will and wander in a wild, unrestrained, and aimless way through the wilderness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God does not operate this way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He is a God of purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He does things for the purpose of molding a specific character in us so that we may glorify His name.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All discipline is for the purpose of bringing us on in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>ENDURING FOR GOD S DISCIPLINE</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The apostle quoted Proverbs when he wrote to the Hebrew believers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 7 the apostle explains the quotation from Proverbs in verses 5 and 6, saying, It is for discipline that you endure.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the first New Testament explanation of the subject; it is a crucial word.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Here the apostle shows us that endurance, suffering, and discipline are the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God is disciplining us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The apostle shows us that this disciplining is the same as our endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is for discipline that we endure.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A. Suffering Being God s Discipline</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps some will ask, What is God s discipline?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Why is He disciplining us?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Verses 2 through 4 speak of enduring the cross, despising the shame, and resisting sin, whereas verses 5 and 6 speak of discipline and scourging.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What is the relation between these two things?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What are the discipline and scourging in verses 5 and 6, and what are the shame, affliction, and resistance against sin in verses 2 through 4?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 7 is a conclusion of verses 2 through 6.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It shows us that what we endure is God s discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Thus, suffering, shame, and affliction are God s discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Although our resistance against sin is not unto blood, the pain and tribulation are nevertheless part of God s discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>How does God discipline us?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His discipline has to do with whatever He is bringing us through and whatever He is charging us to endure.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Do not consider God s discipline as anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God s discipline is what we endure every day, things such as harsh words, an unkind face, a sharp tongue, an impolite retort, an unreasonable criticism, unexpected troubles, various kinds of shame, irresponsibility, infractions, and other more serious problems arising in the family.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes it may be sickness, poverty, affliction, or difficulty.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We encounter many things and endure many things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The apostle said that all these are God s discipline!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is for discipline that we endure.</S>
