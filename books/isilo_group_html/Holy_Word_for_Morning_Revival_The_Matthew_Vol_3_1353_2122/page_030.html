The first part is in this age, and the second part is in the coming age. The first part of the kingdom reward is mainly related to material things and natural things. If, for the kingdom&#8217;s sake, or for the sake of the Lord&#8217;s name, we leave all these things, the Lord will reward us a hundredfold. In verse 29 the Lord said, &#8220;Everyone who has left houses or brothers or sisters or father or mother or children or fields for My name&#8217;s sake shall receive a hundred times as much and shall inherit eternal life.&#8221; To receive a hundred times as many houses, fields, and relatives is to be rewarded in this age (Mark 10:30). This refers to our enjoyment of brothers and sisters in the Lord, with their possessions.</p><p>In verse 29, the Lord also speaks of inheriting eternal life. To inherit eternal life is to be rewarded in the coming age (Luke 18:29-30), in the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens, with an enjoyment of the divine life that is fuller than the enjoyment in this age. In the manifestation of the kingdom, we will participate in the enjoyment of eternal life in the millennial kingdom with the Lord Jesus. This will be greater than the first aspect of the kingdom reward, which we receive in this age.</p><p>In verse 28 the Lord said, &#8220;Truly I say to you that you who have followed Me, in the restoration, when the Son of Man sits on the throne of His glory, you also shall sit on twelve thrones, judging the twelve tribes of Israel.&#8221; The restoration is the restoration in the coming kingdom age (Acts 3:21), after the Lord&#8217;s second coming. In the coming kingdom the overcomers will sit on thrones to reign over the earth (Rev. 20:4). The first twelve apostles, including Peter, will judge the twelve tribes of Israel, and the other overcomers will rule over the nations (Rev. 2:26).</p><p>After hearing the Lord&#8217;s answer, Peter had nothing more to say. His mouth was shut. But the Lord went on to say, &#8220;But many first will be last, and many last first&#8221; (v. 30)....The Lord gave the parable in 20:1-16 to explain the meaning of this verse. The word &#8220;For&#8221; at the beginning of 20:1 indicates that this parable is an explanation of 19:30.</p><p>In order to understand 19:30 and the parable in 20:1-16, we need to see that Peter had a commercial mentality....Therefore the Lord said that many (but not all) who are first will be last, and the last first. This indicates that many, like Peter, who were the first would be the last to receive the reward. The Lord said this in order to revolutionize Peter&#8217;s commercial mentality. The Lord seemed to be saying to Peter,...&#8220;Although you must pay in order to receive the reward of the kingdom, receiving the reward is not a commercial matter....The price you have paid means nothing.&#8221;</p><p>Actually, what we pay is refuse (Phil 3:8). Everything apart from Christ is dung. The Lord seemed to be saying to Peter,...&#8220;Peter, all you have given up to obtain [the kingship] is dung....Although the price you pay is dung, I will reward you with the kingship.&#8221; Peter, who had a commercial mentality, needed to be reeducated by the Lord Jesus.
