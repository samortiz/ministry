   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. The Rest of the Jews</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Joining Him in Hypocrisy</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 13 Paul says, And the rest of the Jews joined him in hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the leading one backslid, the rest easily followed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is almost incredible that Peter, the leading apostle, practiced hypocrisy in relation to the truth of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>At least twice in the New Testament we are told that Peter took the lead in a negative way and that others followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In John 21 Peter led the way to go fishing.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this he was followed by some of the other disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Here in Galatians 2 Peter practiced hypocrisy, and others followed him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>D. Barnabas Carried Away by Their Hypocrisy</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul points out that even Barnabas was carried away by their hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Barnabas participated in Paul s first journey to preach the gospel to the Gentiles and to raise up the Gentile churches.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even one who had so much fellowship with the Gentile believers was carried away by Peter s hypocrisy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What a negative influence Peter exerted upon others!</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Surely he deserved to lose his leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although there was a prevailing atmosphere in favor of circumcision, Peter should not have been subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord had shown him an impressive vision, and he should not have forgotten it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Nevertheless, even though he did not forget the vision, he behaved in a hypocritical way with respect to eating with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>E. Not Walking Straightforwardly</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>in Relation to the Truth of the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because Peter and the others were hypocritical, Paul rebuked him when he saw that they did not walk straightforwardly in relation to the truth of the gospel v. 14 . Peter was absolutely wrong, and Paul rebuked him to his face.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He would not allow the clear truth of the gospel to be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Probably Paul was the only one with the boldness to rebuke a leading apostle such as Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thank the Lord for Paul s faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If he had not been faithful there at Antioch, the truth of the gospel might have been blurred.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>F. Compelling Those of the Nations</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>to Live like Jews</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In front of all, Paul said to Peter, If you, being a Jew, live like the nations and not like the Jews, how is it that you compel the nations to live like Jews?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To live like the nations is to eat, live, and fellowship with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To live like Jews, or to Judaize Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>, is not to eat or have fellowship with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We praise the Lord that through Paul s faithfulness the truth of the gospel was preserved.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Today it is crystal clear according to the New Testament that in Christ there is no circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have been set free from slavery under the law and from the bondage of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There is no need for us to keep the law or to be circumcised.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, we only need faith in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because of Paul s faithfulness and boldness, this truth was preserved and has remained clear for us today.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We thank the Lord for this.</S>
