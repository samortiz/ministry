<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. The Spirit of Jehovah Resting upon Him</H2><P>Concerning Christ as the twig and the branch, verse 2 goes on to say, "The Spirit of Jehovah will rest upon Him,/ The Spirit of wisdom and understanding,/The Spirit of counsel and might,/The Spirit of knowledge and the fear of Jehovah." The Spirit of counsel and might here equals the wisdom and power in 1 Corinthians 1:24, which tells us that Christ is God's wisdom and God's power. He is the wisdom which gives counsel and the power which gives might.</P><P>The branching out of Jehovah is altogether a matter of the Spirit. Christ was born of the Spirit, meaning that He was constituted of the Spirit. Then He was baptized, anointed, with the Spirit. The Spirit was with Him all the time and was one with Him. He walked by the Spirit and lived a life in, with, by, and through the Spirit. Thus, as John 14 reveals, the Spirit is the reality of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Savoring the Fear of Jehovah</H2><P>"He will savor the fear of Jehovah" (Isa. 11:3a). The word savor indicates that Christ will delight in the fear of Jehovah. Moreover, "He will neither judge by what His eyes see,/Nor decide by what His ears hear./But He will judge the poor in righteousness,/And decide with equity for the afflicted of the land" (vv. 3b-4a). Unlike today, there will be no shortage of righteousness and equity. Verse 4b continues, "And He will strike the land with the rod of His mouth,/And with the breath of His lips He will slay the wicked." Here, as is common in Isaiah's poetic writing, we have a pair: the rod of His mouth and the breath of His lips.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Righteousness Being That Which<br>Girds His Loins,<br>and Faithfulness Being That Which<br>Girds His Hips</H2><P>Righteousness will be that which girds His loins, and faithfulness will be that which girds His hips (v. 5). Girding the loins gives one the strength to move, act, and especially to fight. Righteousness and faithfulness are two of Christ's virtues for standing and fighting. He stands with faithfulness and fights with righteousness.</P>
