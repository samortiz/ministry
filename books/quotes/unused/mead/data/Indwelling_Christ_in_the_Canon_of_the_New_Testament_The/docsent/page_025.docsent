   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE POWER AND WISDOM OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This Christ in whom we are participating is the power of God and the wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But unto them which are called, both Jews and Greeks, Christ the power of God, and the wisdom of God 1 Cor 1:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Our Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is not only the wisdom, but also the power.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is not only the way, but also the ability.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the Christ as our portion into whom we have been called.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have not been called into anything else.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As our portion He is the power to do things and He is the wisdom to accomplish things.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>TRANSFERRED</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then 1 Corinthians tells us that it is of God that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But of him are ye in Christ Jesus, who of God is made unto us wisdom, and righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We were all born in Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We were not born in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But one day God accomplished a kind of translation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He translated us from one sphere into another.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We were born into Adam, but God has transferred us from Adam into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is of God that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be in Christ is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all must realize that we have been transferred.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We did not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even if we tried, we could never make it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But, praise the Lord, God can do it, and He did it!</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is of God that we all have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I can testify that before I was transferred, I fully realized that I was in a certain kind of sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But then God put me into another sphere, the wonderful Person of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is of God that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We did nothing but open ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I remember the day that I was transferred.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I said, God, I want You today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I don t want this world.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I am through with this world, and this world is through with me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I just want You.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At that moment God took me out of that sphere and put me into another sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I was transferred by God out of Adam and into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the first years I tried a number of times to go back.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I even told God that I was not so happy to be in this sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It seemed that God said, All right, you try your best to go back.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You didn t get into this sphere by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I put you here.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>And unless I put you back, you can never go back.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I tried several times, but I couldn t make it.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I couldn t go back.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Can you?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I assure you that you cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We all have been put into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>CHRIST AS EVERYTHING BY HIS INDWELLING</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God has put us into Christ, and now this Christ has been made our power, our wisdom, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God put us into Him, and God made Him everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the first place God transferred us into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He took us out of Adam, and put us into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Then from that day God made Christ everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He s our power, our wisdom, our justification, our sanctification, our redemption, our everything!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But how can Christ be everything to us?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is by His indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In 1 Corinthians 3:16 we are told that we are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God is the dweller.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Know ye not that ye are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwelleth in you?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We are the dwelling, and He is the dweller.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We have already seen that the Spirit of God is the full realization of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We should never consider that the Spirit of God here is separate from Christ or other than Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He is the Spirit of Reality John 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means that He is the reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The real Christ is the Spirit, and this Spirit is the dweller.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He dwells in us, and we are His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is by His dwelling in us that He is everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we need righteousness, He is our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we need holiness, He is our holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>If we need justification, He is our justification.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we need sanctification, He is our sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>And eventually, Christ will be the redemption to our body.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He is all these things to us by His indwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Suppose God put us into Christ, and He did nothing more.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We may be in Christ, but there is no way to apply Christ as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>To be in Christ is a positional matter.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But to have Christ as our everything is something of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>On one hand, we have been put into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>And on the other hand, He is made everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>But His being everything to us is by His indwelling.</S>
