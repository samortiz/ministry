   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SOURCE OF TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As believers we all have some apprehension of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How many of us, though, are in the light?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Light is in God and is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Until we are brought into God Himself, we may be under the shining of the light, but we are not in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To be under the shining of the light is one thing; to be in the light is another.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Under the shining we may have the truth, or the realization, but we are not in the light until we are in God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then every hidden thing will be exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>From the time we were saved, we have been under the shining, coming to certain realizations and understandings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some day we shall be willing for this inner fellowship to bring us into God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Him we shall be in the light, not merely the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Most Christians today are far off, even in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some are under the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But very few are in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Probably a good number of us have occasionally had experiences in which we were brought into God and recognized that we were in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Suppose you get annoyed with another brother.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You are not in the light yet, but under the shining you sense that your attitude was poor.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>You go to that brother and apologize that your attitude earlier was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For you the apology is sufficient; after all, a bad attitude is a common fault, not to be taken all that seriously.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Some Christians would not even admit that they were wrong to be annoyed with a brother.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was the brother's fault, they would insist.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why did he act that way toward them?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He is the one who needs to say he is sorry; there is nothing for which they need to apologize.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Such Christians are fully in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Will you allow the inner fellowship to bring you into God?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then you will be in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Under its glare you will tremble.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You will realize that it is not only your attitude toward your brother which is to be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You yourself in every part are sinful, fully contaminated, and thoroughly unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the light there is no excuse, no back door, no side exit, no escape.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>You will weep, repent, and take hours to confess.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Your hands may look quite clean now, but if you see them in the light, you will see how full of germs they are.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this fellowship with the Father we have light, and in this light we have fellowship 1 John 1:3, 5, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The result of being in the light is the recognition that we are utterly sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Every member of our body is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every relationship with others is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The way we wear our clothes is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Because we are in the old creation, nothing about us is clean; we are polluted and condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everything within us our feelings, our intentions, our decisions, our concepts, and our ideas is sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As human beings we are full of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The reason we do not have this conviction is that we are not in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When Isaiah was brought into the glory of God, he said, "Woe is me! for I am undone; because I am a man of unclean lips" Isa 6:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We have some amount of truth, knowing that we should do this and be like that, but such a realization is not light; it is only truth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we are willing to abide in the fellowship, it will bring us into God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Then we shall be thoroughly exposed by this light from which nothing can be hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE BLOOD</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is common among us to say that we apply the blood to our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is not what 1 John 1 says about the blood, however.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"If we walk in the light, as he is in the light, we have fellowship one with another, and the blood of Jesus Christ his Son cleanseth us from all sin" v. 7 . To say that we apply the blood is an indication that we are not in the light, but rather avoiding it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Light takes away all our cover-ups.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It penetrates every hiding place.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It so exposes us that we cry out, "Woe is me!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>I am unclean!"</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>At that very moment the blood cleanses.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This verse clearly tells us that if we are in the light, the blood follows the light to cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>There is no requirement on our part to apply the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To apply the blood means that we have the realization that we are sinful but have not yet had our sins exposed in the light.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Whatever the light exposes, the blood cleanses.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Praise the Lord for His provision.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Yes, the blood cleanses, but all too often the weak ones, after the exposing, keep right on condemning themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We Christians are peculiar!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Before we are brought into the light, we will not admit that we are sinful; yet once the blood has cleansed us, we will not believe that we are cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We seem to like being in a state of condemnation!</S>
