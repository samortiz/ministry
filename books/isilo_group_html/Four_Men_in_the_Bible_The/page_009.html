<h1 class="title">THE MAN-CHILD IN THE BOOK OF REVELATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Date: February 11, 1972</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 12:1-5, 7-11; 19:1-9</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE FOUR MEN IN THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>The first three men that the Bible speaks of are Adam, the Lord Jesus, and the church as the one new man. The third man&mdash;the church&mdash;is a corporate man produced by the Lord Jesus through His death on the cross and through the pouring out of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost after His resurrection. However, the church soon became desolate. God then began to call for overcomers, signified by the man-child in Revelation, to accomplish His purpose. The man-child is the fourth man spoken of in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNIVERSAL WOMAN</h2>
<p>The man-child in Revelation 12 is brought forth by a universal woman. Verses 1 through 5 say, &ldquo;A great sign was seen in heaven: a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars; and she was with child, and she cried out, travailing in birth and being in pain to bring forth. And another sign was seen in heaven; and behold, there was a great red dragon, having seven heads and ten horns, and on his heads seven diadems...And the dragon stood before the woman who was about to bring forth, so that when she brings forth he might devour her child. And she brought forth a son, a man-child, who is to shepherd all the nations with an iron rod; and her child was caught up to God and to His throne.&rdquo; Verse 1 says, &ldquo;A great sign was seen in heaven.&rdquo; Hence, the woman, the dragon, and the man-child in this vision are all signs.</p>
<p>Certain Scriptures are clear and can be interpreted literally. For example, the phrases <em>in the beginning God created the heavens and the earth</em> and <em>God so loved the world</em> (Gen. 1:1; John 3:16) are neither symbolic expressions nor signs. Rather, they are clear words that can be interpreted literally. However, other verses, which contain visions, symbols, and illustrations, cannot be interpreted literally but should be expounded according to their spiritual significance. For example, Matthew 25 says, &ldquo;At that time the kingdom of the heavens will be likened to ten virgins&rdquo; (v. 1). <em>Virgins</em> here does not refer to ten actual virgins; rather, it signifies a group of people. Matthew 13:24-25 says, &ldquo;The kingdom of the heavens has become like a man sowing good seed in his field. But while the men slept, his enemy came and sowed tares in the midst of the wheat.&rdquo; <em>Wheat</em> and <em>tares</em> are metaphorical expressions that refer to a group of people who are like wheat and to another group of people who are like tares. Based on this principle, the woman and the man-child in Revelation 12 need to be interpreted figuratively.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Woman Signifying All of God&rsquo;s People</h2>
<p>The woman in Revelation 12 is not an actual woman but a symbol with spiritual significance. Verse 1 speaks of the woman being &ldquo;clothed with the sun, and the moon underneath her feet, and on her head a crown of twelve stars.&rdquo; This gives us a view of the universe and shows that the woman represents a corporate woman in the universe. The word <em>universe</em> encompasses both time and space, involving all time both past and present and including all space, that is, all places. This woman, as a sign, refers to a group of people, encompassing all time and all places; therefore, she is a universal woman.</p>
<p>This universal woman is clothed with the sun, the moon is underneath her feet, and a crown of twelve stars is on her head, but who does she symbolize? The Bible speaks of the sun, the moon, and twelve stars together in the same context twice&mdash;once in Revelation and once in Genesis. In Genesis 37 Joseph dreamed of the sun, the moon, and eleven stars bowing down to him (v. 9). From the context we can see clearly that the sun refers to his father, the moon to his mother, and the eleven stars to his brothers who, along with Joseph, add up to twelve stars. When the sun, the moon, and twelve stars are put together, they represent all of God&rsquo;s people. Hence, the woman in Revelation 12 symbolizes the totality of God&rsquo;s people. Everyone who is of God throughout the ages and throughout the earth is included in this woman.</p>
<p>The Bible often refers to people who are of God as females because, figuratively speaking, God is the unique male. Hence, those who belong to God are female. According to the flesh, I am a male, but before the Lord, I am a female. In Song of Songs in the Old Testament the Lord is spoken of as our Beloved, and we are His love (2:10). In the New Testament, the ten virgins in Matthew 25 refer to all those who are of the Lord. Ephesians 5 also speaks of the church as the wife of Christ (v. 25). Thus, we can see that the persons who belong to God in the Bible are designated as females. Therefore, the woman in Revelation 12 symbolizes those who are of the Lord throughout all the ages on the earth. This woman includes Adam, Abel, Enosh, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Moses, David, Elijah, Jeremiah, Zechariah, Peter, James, John, and you and me.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Four Men in the Bible &nbsp; pg 9</div><br></body></html>
