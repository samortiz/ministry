   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF DANIEL MESSAGE TWELVE GOD'S ECONOMY IN THE BOOK OF DANIEL Scripture Reading: Dan 9:26; 2:35, 44; 7:13-14; 3:23-25; 10:4-9; 4:17, 25-26; Rev 19:7-9, 11-16, 19-21; 17:14</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although the book of Daniel is short, it has many points, it speaks of many events and persons, and it contains many spiritual lessons for us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>But above, behind, and within all these things, there is something else, and this is God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Of course, the expression God's economy is not found in Daniel; neither is it found anywhere else in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nevertheless, God's economy is revealed in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We all need to see God's economy in the book of Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we see this vision of God's economy, our whole being will be changed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>CHRIST THE CENTRALITY</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>AND UNIVERSALITY OF GOD'S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Christ is the centrality and universality of God's economy, and God's economy is for Christ to be the centrality and universality in God's move.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is what we must see in our reading of the book of Daniel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The various spiritual lessons and the historical details covered in this book are very good, but they are secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is primary is that in His economy, in His plan with His arrangement, God desires to make Christ the centrality and universality of His move on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Concerning such a Christ, the book of Daniel covers five main points: the death of Christ, the upcoming appearing of Christ, Christ as the Son of Man who comes to the throne of God to receive dominion and a kingdom, Christ as the Companion of the suffering witnesses of God, and the excellency of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I would like to say a word about each of these points.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>CHRIST'S CRUCIFIXION</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first point is Christ's death, Christ's crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Regarding this, 9:26 says, "After the sixty-two weeks Messiah will be cut off and will have nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This word is simple, but it is rich in its implications.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The death of Christ was all-inclusive, comprising every item in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The main item terminated by the death of Christ was the old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>After God's work in creation, Satan came in to corrupt, poison, devastate, and ruin God's creation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As a result, the entire old creation became not only corrupt but corruption.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Yet God still uses that corrupted creation in producing a new creation through Christ's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ's greatest achievement in His first appearing was to terminate the whole creation by His death.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In this termination, however, there is something rising up, that is, Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In His resurrection Christ became a life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b to enliven, to germinate, to regenerate, some of those in the old creation to be the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This new creation begins with the believers as God's sons and Christ's members as the constituents of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This Body will grow and eventually consummate in the New Jerusalem Rev 21 22 , the total aggregate and consummation of God's new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is all involved in Christ's first coming with His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the entire universe, Christ's death with His resurrection is a great landmark of the ages.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>His death has cleared up the entire universe by terminating the old creation spiritually.</S>
