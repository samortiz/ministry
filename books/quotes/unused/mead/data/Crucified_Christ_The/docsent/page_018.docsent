   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TREASURE BEING IN EARTHEN VESSELS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we think that to believe in Jesus is merely for us to obtain peace, joy, and blessing, then we only know the appearance of the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>For example, suppose you go to a jewelry shop to buy a diamond, and the salesperson puts the diamond into a very nice box.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When your children see the package, they want that pretty box but ignore the diamond inside the box.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is the same with many of us in our knowledge concerning salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Why do we believe in Jesus?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We believe in Jesus because we want to avoid sufferings and to have peace and security.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What we want is only the pretty box.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not know that God's salvation is for Christ to be our life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All we want is the box, but we have not seen the diamond within.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 2 Corinthians 4:7, Paul says, "We have this treasure in earthen vessels."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What is this treasure?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This treasure is Christ Himself, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The center of the entire New Testament is that the Triune God is living in us and we in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Holy Spirit is in us, Christ is in us, God is in us, and we are in the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The center of the New Testament is to show us that we, the saved ones, have God in us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is true that God gives us peace, joy, and blessing, but these are all outward things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The intrinsic content of God's salvation is God Himself, Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He is the treasure in us, the earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>THE CHRISTIAN GROWTH BEING DEPENDENT ON KNOWING CHRIST AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We often say that Christians have to grow, but what is the Christian growth?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Our Christian growth begins with knowing that God is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When we were saved, Christ came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>However, our eyes need to be opened one day to see that Christ is truly the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This glorious Christ, the God of glory, is living in us; He is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is the first step of the Christian growth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Our Christian growth is dependent on our knowing Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>What is a Christian?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In short, a Christian is one who has two different lives his own life and Christ's life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once a person receives Christ, he is no longer simply himself, but he has Christ within him.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ and he have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This simple word reveals to us the highest, most glorious, and most mysterious fact Christ is in us as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every saved one has the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Therefore, every saved person has two lives his own life and Christ's life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>These two lives live together.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you truly are a saved person, many times you may have an experience in which you sense that apart from yourself there is another person within you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is the wonderful thing about being a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>You have no need to consult people outwardly, because there is One in you who is very wonderful, and you can come near to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When you have a problem, you can trust Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When you encounter something that you do not understand, you can ask Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When you are sad and sorrowful, and no one sympathizes with you, this One in you, as a voice or a thought, will comfort and cherish you.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When you are about to lose your temper or to commit a sin, this One will urge you not to do so and will stop you from doing so.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In addition to yourself, there is another person in you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This person is Christ, God, and the Spirit.</S>
