   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Issue No. 2 THE EDITOR AND THE READERS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Since the first publication of The Christian, we have been so thankful for your unhesitating subscription, which increases the usefulness of this paper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>There are more brothers and sisters who have helped this magazine by promoting it and collecting money for it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We do not have the time to thank you one by one, but we would like to thank you in a general way here.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I know that you are doing this for the Lord's sake; however, since this magazine has received your benefit, we would nevertheless like to thank you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We hope that you would not forget this little work in your prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Pray to God for us that the editor would be healthy physically, that sinners would receive salvation through reading this paper, and that saints would be perfected through reading it as well.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I still hope that you would not forget that the responsibility of increasing the usefulness of The Christian lies with you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You can write to believers within and outside your province, telling them of the publication of this magazine and asking them to subscribe to it and to introduce it to others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After the publication of the first issue, some friends wrote to tell us that the type is too small.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are aware that there are many unsatisfactory places in the first issue, but we have improved them in this issue.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Now we have set the type less densely and have divided the page into two columns.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I believe even those with weak eyesight can read it without much difficulty now.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This magazine has just started, and for various reasons we have to increase the price.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Hence, beginning from next year, all new subscribers will be charged according to the new price, but those who have subscribed during this year will be charged the old price.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We thank the Lord that many brothers and sisters who have subscribed during this year are willing to have the price adjusted to that of next year.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Brothers and sisters, since you have bought this magazine, I hope that you will not leave it on your shelf.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What benefit is there, if a person only buys a magazine without reading it?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For the convenience of the readers, we have tried to put all the long articles into one issue.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For some that are too long, however, we have to publish them in several issues.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We hope that the readers will not give them up because of their length.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All the sections published in this issue are necessary knowledge for the study of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We hope that the readers will read it carefully.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We will continue with our format in the next issue.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If you have any questions related to the Bible or spiritual life that you want us to answer, please send them to us within a few days of your receiving this magazine.</S>

   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To those readers who have not paid their subscription yet, would you send in your money to the Gospel Book Room as soon as possible?</S>

   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I would love to correspond with God's children very much.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>However, if you want me to reply to you personally, please enclose a return envelope with stamps included.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Overseas readers are free to do whatever they want to do.</S>
