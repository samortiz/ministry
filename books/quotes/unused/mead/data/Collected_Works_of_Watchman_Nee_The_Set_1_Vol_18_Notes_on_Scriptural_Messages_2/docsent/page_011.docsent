   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Once I went to Lushan Mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I like the flowers and birds on that mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I do not like to place birds in cages; I like to see them flying freely.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One day the birds came and ate up all the rice I left on the railing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This was very interesting, and I went and got a whole bowl of rice.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As soon as I walked close to them, the birds flew away; after I left, they all flew back.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I had no intention to catch them or hurt them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I was more than happy for them to come and eat my rice.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I thought it would be the happiest thing for me to sit in the midst of the birds while they surrounded me on all sides.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But they did not know my heart, and they always avoided me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If I wanted the birds to know my heart, the only way was for me to speak their language or become a bird flying among them and telling them my intention.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Then I would not be misunderstood.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But there was no way that I could become a bird; consequently, there was no way for me to show my heart to them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the same way God feels about us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God loves us; He likes us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He wants us to be close to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But we do not understand His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's Word tells us that God has spoken of old in many portions and in many ways through His servants concerning His heart's desire and that He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But man did not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, God had to personally come to this world and become a man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This man is Jesus, the Christ, whom we know.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If I became a bird, you might say that I humiliated myself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But for God to become a man is more of a humiliation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What humility that the God of glory would lower Himself to become a man!</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is far above all, but He emptied Himself, took the form of man, and came in the likeness of men.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When Jesus was on the earth, everything He did expressed God's love toward men.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If you read the life of Jesus, you will find out that He is not only a good man but God from heaven becoming a man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We thought that God hated us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But He became a man in order to show us that God is the same as Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was on the earth for thirty-three and a half years; during this time He expressed God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God is the same as Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The way Jesus treated men is the way God treats men.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Once, a man full of leprosy came to worship Jesus and said, "Lord, if You are willing, You can cleanse me" Luke 5:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Jesus very easily could have made him clean by one of His words.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Instead, He stretched out His hand and touched him, saying, "I am willing; be cleansed!" v. 13 . A man full of leprosy is unclean and smelly! But the Lord put forth His hand and touched him.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He sympathized with this man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He seemed to be saying, "If others are not willing to come to Me, and you are willing, I will touch you."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Another time, a woman caught in adultery was brought to the Lord John 8:3-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>According to the law, such a woman should be stoned to death.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus could not say that she did not commit sin, yet He did not want to see her stoned to death.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, He said, "He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her" v. 7 . They were all convicted in their own consciences and left one by one, from the oldest to the youngest.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Then Jesus was left alone, and the woman stood before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What did the Lord say?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He said, "Has no one condemned you?" v. 10 . She said, "No one, Lord." Jesus then said, "Neither do I condemn you; go, and from now on sin no more" v. 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>O friends!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you have not believed, let me tell you that God does not hate you; rather He loves you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>On another occasion, a publican named Matthew invited many publicans and sinners to his house, and he also invited Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At that time the publicans were a very despised kind of people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The Jews had lost their country and were under the domination of Rome.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For a Jew to work for those who conquered his country and dealt harshly with his own people, was something very despicable.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If it were us, we would not have eaten or drunk with them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But Jesus ate and drank with them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Would you as a college student be willing to sit with such people?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You might think that if a newspaper reporter found out that you were socializing with such people, it would be a big disgrace to you.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But in any case, Jesus went.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>At that time there was another kind of people called the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When they saw this, they spoke to Jesus' disciples, saying, "Why does your Teacher eat with the tax collectors and sinners?"</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>They were debating and criticizing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But how did Jesus reply?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He said, "Those who are strong have no need of a physician, but those who are ill...For I did not come to call the righteous, but sinners" Matt 9:10-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Jesus opened up God's heart to men.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Some may wonder, "Does God still want me?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I am such a terrible sinner."</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Others may wonder if God would want persons like themselves because they have robbed others, committed adultery, told lies, and been unclean and filthy sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But Jesus has opened up God's heart and shown us that God wants us and loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He is, in effect, saying, "I am like a doctor, and I am not afraid of patients."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Are patients afraid of doctors?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Of course they are not afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Some may make up their minds to be better persons from now on, never losing their temper, playing cards, or going to the movies.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But they can only do this for two or three days; then they misbehave again.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some may think that God does not like them and wants them to perish.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But I must tell you that God wants you because He loves you!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Friends, please do one thing today: remove the veils from your eyes so that you can see that God has no evil intentions toward you.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He loves you.</S>
