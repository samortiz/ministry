An obsessed person falls into abnormal conditions. Let us consider the following examples.</p><h2 class="head2">Obsession with Words</h2><p>Some are obsessed with their words. They say something, yet they become convinced that they have not said it, or they may never have said something, yet they believe they have said it. Others may not have said anything, but the obsessed ones believe that they have. They are not just lying; they are obsessed. In the beginning they may have been lying. But after they have lied repeatedly, their lying becomes a habit and they become obsessed. Being obsessed in this way is the result of deceiving others with lies to the extent that the liar himself becomes convinced that what he says is true.</p><h2 class="head2">Obsession with Facts</h2><p>A man may become obsessed with facts. Being obsessed with facts means a person does something, yet thinks he has not done it. In addition, others may not have done something, yet he thinks they have done it.</p><h2 class="head2">Obsession with Feelings</h2><p>When a man is obsessed with his feelings, he will feel that something is there when it is not. For example, a person may fear something, yet there is really not that much to be afraid of. Yet once he develops a fear of this thing, it becomes dreadful to him. He can be given many reasons why he should not be afraid, yet he is still fearful. People can be obsessed not only with evil things but also with good things.</p><h2 class="head2">Obsession with Discernment<br />between Right and Wrong</h2><p>Some people are so obsessed that they will take evil for good, good for evil, darkness for light, light for darkness, bitterness for sweetness, or sweetness for bitterness (Isa. 5:20). They may be clearly wrong, yet they think they are right. Some Christians have sinned, yet they do not see their sins. On the contrary, they think they are very good. This is obsession. Some may be obsessed with the sense of guilt, thinking they have committed unpardonable sins. They have not committed such sins, yet they are convinced they have committed such sins.</p><h2 class="head1">DELIVERANCE FROM OBSESSION&mdash;<br />SEEING LIGHT IN THE LIGHT</h2><p>It is a sad thing to be obsessed. God's children should do everything to avoid being obsessed. An obsessed person cannot see the true nature of things. We have to consider how one can discern the true nature of things and avoid becoming obsessed. Compare Psalm 36:9 with Isaiah 50:11. We can see the great difference between the words, "In Your light we see light," and, "Behold, all of you who kindle a fire,/Who surround yourselves with firebrands...." God's light enables man to see light, but the light that comes from man's firebrands is useless; it cannot give him light. The light that comes from man's firebrands originates from his own considerations and thoughts and is totally worthless. Isaiah 50:11 says that those who kindle a fire and surround themselves will lie down in torment. Spiritual darkness can never be removed by human firebrands. What we really need is God's light. Only God's light will give us true spiritual sight. Examining ourselves or engaging in introspection are acts that rely on human firebrands; they cannot render us any light.</p><p>Psalm 36:9b says, "In Your light we see light." This tells us that a man can only see real light and realize the true nature of things through God's light. The first occurrence of the word "light" in this verse means the enlightening light, and the second occurrence of "light" means the true nature of things. The first "light" refers to the light that comes from God's enlightening, and the second "light" is the facts that one sees, that is, the facts that are revealed under God's enlightening. A believer must live in God's light before he can have sight. Only those who live in God's light will see light, and only those who live in His light can discern the true nature of things. Those who do not know the power of sunlight will search around with a torchlight. But once a man sees the power and radiance of sunlight, he will drop his torchlight. Once we realize that God is light, we will live in His light, and there will be no more need for human firebrands.</p><p>God can deliver a sinful man from his sins, but He cannot do anything with a man who lives in darkness and who is blind. We have to say to the Lord, "I want to be delivered from self-assurance, pride, and self-confidence. Be merciful to me, and shine Your light on me so that I see light." In order to see God's light, we must be meek and not trust in ourselves. Stubbornness, selfishness, and self-centeredness can accomplish nothing except shutting out God's light. We have to ask the Lord to deliver us daily so that we can live in God's light and discern the true nature of things. May the Lord deliver us from falsehood and obsession.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_055.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_057.html">Next</a> </body></html>
