   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If certain ones still are not convinced that the Father's house does not denote a heavenly mansion, after considering the subject of glorification in these chapters in relation to the Father's house, you may try to present the truth another way.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You may say, "Brother, you believe that the Father's house in chapter fourteen is a heavenly mansion and that you will go to this mansion when you die.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What will be the ultimate consummation of this heavenly mansion?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He may tell you that eventually the heavenly mansion will become the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If he answers in this way, you should go on to say, "How wonderful that your heavenly mansion eventually will be the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let us read Revelation 21:10, where the Apostle John tells us that he saw the holy city, Jerusalem, coming down out of heaven from God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This verse indicates that your heavenly mansion, if it becomes the New Jerusalem, will not remain in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead, it will come down to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Furthermore, the foundations of this mansion, which has now become the New Jerusalem, bear the names of the Apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that your heavenly mansion, the New Jerusalem, is the consummation of the church, of which the twelve Apostles are the foundations.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, you will go to the New Jerusalem by way of a mansion in the heavens, but we shall go to the New Jerusalem by another way.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This means that, ultimately, you will lose your heavenly mansion, but we all shall be together in the New Jerusalem."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE SAINTS IN PARADISE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppose someone says to you, "You claim that the Father's house in John 14:2 is not a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Since you don't believe in a heavenly mansion, where do you think you will go when you die?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You may reply, "If I should die before the Lord comes, I would go to Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The New Testament reveals that when a believer dies, his spirit and soul go to Paradise.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, if I should die, I would go to Paradise and wait there for the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Lord Jesus comes back, all the dead in Christ will be resurrected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then we shall be brought together with the living saints to meet the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then after the millennium, the New Jerusalem will descend from heaven to earth."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A GNOSTIC CONCEPT</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What we have been presenting here is the pure truth of the Word, the truth without any leaven.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Actually the concept that the Father's house in 14:2 is a heavenly mansion is a Gnostic concept.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The thought of going to heaven when we die comes from a pagan source.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Greek word for house in 14:2, oikia, was used by the Gnostics to mean a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This usage, being Gnostic, is pagan and heretical.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some expositors of the Bible even think that John was influenced by Gnosticism.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These expositors make a serious mistake in saying this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They understand the word oikia in a way that is similar to the understanding of the Gnostics.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>John certainly was not a Gnostic or influenced by Gnosticism, and oikia in 14:2 does not refer to a heavenly mansion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Instead, here oikia refers to the Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have seen that to Christ the church is the Body, whereas to the Father the church is a house.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>TWO GREEK WORDS USED INTERCHANGEABLY</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some who know Greek and who also hold to the concept that the Father's house in 14:2 is a heavenly mansion may point out that in 2:16 and 14:2 different Greek words are used for house: oikos in 2:16 and oikia in 14:2.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They may go on to say that originally oikos had a wider range of meaning than oikia.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>They may also say that, as used in the Gospel of John, oikos in 2:16 refers to the temple, but they may claim that oikia in 14:2 refers to a particular kind of dwelling in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How should we deal with this objection to our statement, which is based on the Scriptures, that the house in 14:2 definitely does not refer to a mansion in the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps the best way is to point out that in the New Testament oikos and oikia are used interchangeably.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>For example, in 1 Corinthians 1:16a Paul says, "I baptized also the household of Stephanus."</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here Paul uses the word oikos for household.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1 Corinthians 16:15 Paul says, "You know the household of Stephanus, that it is the firstfruit of Achaia."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In this verse Paul uses oikia.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, Paul twice mentions the household of Stephanus, in the first instance using the word oikos and in the second, the word oikia.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is a strong proof that, by the time the New Testament was written, oikos and oikia were synonyms and were used interchangeably.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If Paul used these two words interchangeably in 1 Corinthians, we may also say that they are used interchangeably in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Anyone who cares to study this matter will learn that elsewhere in the New Testament oikos and oikia are used interchangeably.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The point we are making here concerning the Gospel of John is that oikos in 2:16 and oikia in 14:2 do not refer to different things; rather, they have the same basic meaning.</S>
