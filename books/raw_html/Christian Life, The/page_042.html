<H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. To Bear Our Sins</H2><P>Christ died on the cross to bear our sins (Heb. 9:28; 1 Cor. 15:3; Matt. 26:28). These are the sins in our conduct, in our behavior, not in our nature. Hebrews 9:26 speaks of Christ's death dealing with the sin in our nature, whereas verse 28 speaks of His death dealing with the sins in our conduct, in our behavior. First Corinthians 15:3 says that Christ died for our sins, and Matthew 26:28 says that His blood was shed for the forgiveness of sins.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. To Take Away Sin in Totality</H2><P>John 1:29 says, "Behold, the Lamb of God, who takes away the sin of the world!" This refers to sin in its totality. Christ died to take away sin in totality.</P><P>When we define the death of Christ in dealing with sin, we have to cover the above three items with all the related Scripture references.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Dealing with Satan</H2><P>The death of Christ, on the negative side, also dealt with Satan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. To Destroy the Devil,<br>Who Has the Might of Death</H2><P>Christ's death destroyed the devil, who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14). Satan is the source of death who has the might of death.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. To Judge the World and to Cast Out<br>the Ruler of the World</H2><P>Through His death on the cross, Christ judged the world of Satan and cast out Satan as the ruler of the world (John 12:31; Gal. 6:14). The world belongs to Satan. It is Satan's kingdom and Satan's possession. Christ's death on the cross judged the satanic world and cast out Satan as the ruler of the world.</P>
