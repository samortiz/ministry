BEING BARRENNESS</h2>
<p>I can testify to you that I have lambs everywhere. This is why I am so happy. Wherever I go, there are flocks of lambs receiving my feeding. When I am feeding them, my heart feels joyful and glorious. I hope that you all would answer the Lord&rsquo;s call, forgetting about everything else and not caring about the situation of the meetings, but you would simply go forth and bear fruit, bringing the lambs into the church life.</p>
<p>I do not mean to incite anyone; I just want to point out the way of life to all of you. The reason we do not have much growth in life is that we are barren. Hence, we must drop all other things and simply go forth and bear fruit. Once we bear fruit, all our sicknesses will be healed spontaneously. Those who are weak will be made strong, while those who are spiritually unhealthy will become normal and healthy.</p>
<p>Every parent has this kind of experience. Sometimes they are very busy and tired and even become sick, but once they see their children, their sickness is gone and all their strength wells up. When a person is sick, he may ask for a leave from his company, but he cannot ask for a leave from his children. Once he sees his children, all his sicknesses will be gone. Similarly, when we see our &ldquo;lambs,&rdquo; the ones we have led to salvation, our problems will all disappear and our sicknesses, whether physical or spiritual, will all vanish.</p>
<p>Yesterday at lunch, due to a little overeating, I did not feel well and became sick. Last night after I had released the message in the meeting, I took my temperature at home and found that I had a fever. Perhaps I began to develop the fever while I was releasing the message, but for the sake of feeding my lambs I did not take care of myself. It was not until after I had fed my lambs that I was conscious of my rising body temperature. After I took some medicine, my fever was gone. When I got up the next morning, I felt very hungry and did not have any energy. Originally, I had intended to rest that day, but when I remembered that the lambs needed to be nourished, I came to the meeting. As soon as I opened my mouth, my strength welled up. Thus, I deeply believe that when we go forth to bear fruit and shepherd the lambs, all of our sicknesses will be gone and all of our weaknesses will disappear. Moreover, we will surely grow in the spiritual life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT ONLY PRODUCING THE LAMBS<br />
THROUGH FRUIT-BEARING<br />
BUT ALSO FEEDING THE LAMBS</h2>
<p>The way John wrote the Gospel of John was very special. He first mentioned in chapter fifteen that we have to go forth and bear fruit. This is related to the plant life. Then in chapter twenty-one he said that we have to feed the lambs (vv. 15-17). This means that the plant life becomes the animal life&mdash;each fruit becomes a lamb. It is relatively easy to bear fruit, but it is not that easy to take care of and feed lambs. Every parent knows that even though it is laborious to give birth to a child, it is still somewhat easy. However, after the child is born, it is not easy at all to raise him up to be an adult. According to John&rsquo;s words, to lead someone to be saved is to bear fruit. Initially, this one is a like a grape; however, after he is saved, baptized, and regenerated to be a child of God, he becomes a lamb that requires much feeding for his growth in life. This is truly a toilsome task.</p>
 <p>Today we all desire to lead people to salvation, but once some are baptized, we usually hand them over to the elders of the church to be taken care of. However, a church has only a few elders at most. Even if they are all experienced &ldquo;mothers,&rdquo; they still cannot take care of so many children. Hence, many of these children either die prematurely or are taken away by others. In the end, we may gain a hundred, yet only five may remain in the church. Time and again many were regenerated through the church&rsquo;s baptism meetings, but after they were baptized, it seems that there was no follow-up care. This was because we were interested in delivering babies, but we neglected to nurture them. In the past the church in Taipei also had the same kind of problem. The church there led many people to be saved and often baptized eighty to ninety people at a time. However, the more people were baptized, the more people were neglected because no one took up the responsibility to take care of them. From now on, every saint in the church has to learn to be a responsible parent and to change the former situation of handing over the new ones. After you give birth to a baby, you should not just hand it over to others; rather, you have to take good care of him and feed him. If you have brought in a new one, you should bear the responsibility to shepherd him. Since he is your baby, you must take care of him and feed him. Only by this way can the new ones be kept and become remaining fruit. If we only lead people to salvation without bearing the responsibility of shepherding them, later we will still have to give an account before the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s words to Peter clearly reveal that we must shepherd the few lambs that the Lord has committed to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FRUIT-BEARING AND LAMB-FEEDING ISSUING IN<br />
THE GROWTH AND MULTIPLICATION OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>While we are fulfilling the obligation of feeding and taking care of the lambs, we will find that our knowledge of the truth is very inadequate and that we need more learning and equipping. At the same time, we will also realize that our experience of Christ is inadequate and that we therefore need to pursue a deeper experience of Christ, just as parents, in taking care of their children, realize their insufficiency and are forced to learn more and practice more. Only this will cause the growth of the whole church.</p>
<p>I do not mean to criticize anyone, but the fact is that the older saints tend to be easily drawn to the old things. All the elderly saints have to realize that the situation today is very different from that of twenty years ago and is altogether different from that of half a century ago. Therefore, do not keep talking about how the situation of the church was in 1934 or in 1964. We should not confine ourselves to the old, traditional ways. Rather, we should just go forth and bear fruit. The Lord&rsquo;s recovery in the Philippines has already had a history of twenty to thirty years, but the number of saints is less than ten thousand, merely .02% of the entire population. Excluding the southern part of the Philippines, we have less than one thousand saints in the whole metropolitan area of Manila. This condition is not a glory but a shame to us. Do not say that the elders should bear this responsibility. There are only a few elders, and even if they exhausted themselves, they still could not bear such a responsibility.</p>
<p>I say this in order to stir you up to go forth and bear fruit. Every saint in the church has to go forth and bear fruit. Once a fruit is produced, it becomes a lamb. We should not be lambs. We should be little shepherds feeding the lambs. If we all take care of our lambs, they will also be influenced by us to go forth to bear fruit and feed the lambs. This will become the family tradition in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The church will multiply endlessly and expand and grow year by year. In this way, when people come to the church and see that there are so many new ones growing healthily, they will surely have a glorious feeling.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_023.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_025.html">Next</a> </body></html>
