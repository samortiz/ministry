   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PNEUMATIC CHRIST IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BEING THE SPIRIT OF THE DIVINE LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>TO HIS BELIEVERS</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Spirit of life is the pneumatic Christ in resurrection as the Spirit of the divine life to His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The term the Spirit of life is used only once in the New Testament in Romans 8:2.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Spirit is not only the life-giving Spirit but also the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Spirit of life is the reality of life, for this Spirit contains the element of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, the Spirit Himself is life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, with the Spirit of life, we have the riches of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE SPIRIT OF REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>THE SPIRIT OF WHAT GOD IS, HAS, AND DOES</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In John 14:6 the Lord Jesus said that He was the way, the reality, and the life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This shows us that life and reality are related.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Reality is life and life is reality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The reality of our person, of our being, is our human life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Likewise, the reality of God is the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Spirit of life is the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Spirit of reality is the Spirit of what God is, has, and does.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, the Spirit of reality is the Spirit of God s being, of God s possession, and of God s doing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In John 14:16 and 17, the Lord said, And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever; even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the Lord referred to another Comforter, He was saying that this Comforter was Himself in another form.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was a Comforter in the flesh, but in resurrection He became the Spirit, which would be another Comforter.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This Spirit is the Spirit of reality, who is the reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He is the real Christ, the real Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>John 15:26 and 16:13 also refer to the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In John 16:13, the Lord Jesus said that the Spirit of reality would guide us into all the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 16:15 He said, All that the Father has is Mine; therefore I said that He receives of Mine and shall disclose it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All that the Father is and has is the Son s, and all that the Son is and has is received by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then the Spirit discloses all of this to us to be our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit of reality makes everything of the Triune God ours.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the sense of worship, God is three-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But in the actual, daily life experience of the believer who is enjoying the Lord, the three-in-one God is one with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three-in-one, and They are one with the believers, including you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is because we are in Christ, the embodiment of the Triune God, and He is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In our worship, we worship the three-in-one God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We worship the Father, the Son, and the Spirit as one God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We worship our God, who is three-in-one.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But in our Christian experience, the three-in-one God is one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is because we are one with the Father, one with the Son, and one with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are all one in the Triune God in one essence.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All of us are in the same divine essence because we all have received the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Second Peter 1:4 says that we have all been made partakers of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Within the divine nature is the divine essence.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>As we have seen, essence is more intrinsic than nature.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We are one with the Triune God because the Spirit of reality makes God real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In whatever Christ is, in whatever He has, and in whatever He has done, He is one with us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, His experiences have become our history.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We were crucified with Him Gal 2:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His crucifixion is our history.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have also been resurrected with Him Eph 2:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Whatever He is, is ours; whatever He has, is ours; and whatever He has done, is ours.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have passed through all the processes which our Triune God has passed through because we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even humanly speaking, we may say that the experiences of our fore fathers are our history.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>When a person s great-grandfather came to the United States, that person came with him and in him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hebrews 7 tells us that when Abraham paid tithes to Melchisedec, Levi also paid them because he was in the loins of his father when Melchisedec met him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Levi, as a great-grandson of Abraham, offered something to Melchisedec before he was born because he was in Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can also say that before we were born, we were crucified, buried, and resurrected with Christ through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Without the Spirit, there is no linking between us and the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Spirit of reality is the linking between us and the Triune God, making us one with the Triune God in experience.</S>
