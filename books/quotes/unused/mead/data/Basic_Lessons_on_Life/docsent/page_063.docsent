   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Spirit Being Life</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Because Christ is in us, our spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Regeneration is a mingling work to mingle Christ with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today Christ is life, and our spirit is also life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is because our spirit has been made one with Christ, who is life.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First Corinthians 6:17 says, "He who is joined to the Lord is one spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Surely this one spirit comprises both Christ and our spirit, so both Christ and our spirit today are life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is why we need to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we exercise our spirit, life will be infused into people because our spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we exercise our spirit to minister to others, then our spirit will reach others as life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>DISPENSED INTO OUR MIND</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Romans 8:6 says that the mind set on the spirit is life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Not only our spirit is life; even our mind can be life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But this mind must be set upon the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that this mind must be flooded, saturated, and infused with the spirit to become the mind of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Eventually, the spirit becomes the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is mentioned in Ephesians 4:23.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Because our mind is set upon the spirit, our spirit saturates our mind and makes our mind a mind of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Eventually, our spirit becomes the spirit of our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The renewing is by this spirit that saturates our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We always have to tell the saints this spirit is the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is our spirit mingled with Christ as the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because our mind is one with our spirit, connected, joined, saturated, and infused with our spirit, our mind is also life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Such a mind can function to minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>By our natural mind we cannot minister life to others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This mind is not life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But when our mind is joined to our spirit and is saturated with our spirit that is life, our mind at this time also becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A. The Mind Set on the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For this point we have to say that the mind set on the spirit means the mind is joined to the spirit and is relying on the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The spirit can be likened to the husband and the mind to the wife.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The mind as the wife should always rely upon the spirit as the husband.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The mind should always depend upon the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Just as the wife and the husband are really one couple, the mind and the spirit are really one unit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are no longer separated.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Romans 1:28 speaks of the fallen mind as a disapproved mind, a reprobate mind.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A reprobate mind is one that rejects God and that is rejected by God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is a mind that disapproves of knowing God and is also disapproved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>That was our original mind in its fallen state.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Romans 7 shows us that a saved person seeking to serve God uses his natural mind to keep the law and is defeated vv.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>23, 25 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In chapter seven the mind is no longer reprobate, but it is still independent.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is living like a widow, having the heart and desire to do things but without a husband to rely upon.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The mind in chapter one is a reprobate one, but the mind in chapter seven is a seeking one, seeking after God and trying to please God but not relying upon the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Romans 8 also mentions the mind, but the mind here is set upon the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Now the mind as the widow has married a new husband.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is not just a seeking mind but a married mind, a mind married to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such a mind becomes one with the spirit, and because of this, such a mind also becomes life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The fourth place which talks about the mind in Romans is 12:2, which speaks of the renewing of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Such a relying mind must be renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, in Romans we see the reprobate mind, the seeking mind, the relying mind, and eventually the renewed mind.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In order for us to have a renewed mind we need the mind relying on, depending upon, the spirit.</S>
