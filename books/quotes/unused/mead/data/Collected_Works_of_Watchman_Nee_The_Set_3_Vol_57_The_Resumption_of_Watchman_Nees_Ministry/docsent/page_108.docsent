   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why do we have to choose poverty?</S>

   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Mammon is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Covetousness is the same as idolatry Eph 5:5; Col 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you worked in an office and others tried to pay you with an idol or a golden calf, would you take it?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Of course, you would not take it.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But today many people do not realize that mammon is the same as idols.</S>

   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We are afraid that we will become too much.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Actually, there are too many times in our life that we have been too much already.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you would not misunderstand me, I would say why not do it one more time and be a little bit too much in consecration.</S>
