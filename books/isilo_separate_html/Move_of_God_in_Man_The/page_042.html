Begetting the Incarnated Christ<br>as God's Firstborn Son</H2><P>In resurrection the incarnated Christ was begotten as God's firstborn Son (Acts 13:33; Rom. 8:29). Christ was originally the only begotten Son of God without humanity. Then through His resurrection He became the firstborn Son of God with divinity and with humanity also. This was God's move in man to beget Christ as His firstborn Son in resurrection.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Making Christ, Who Was the Last Adam<br>in the Flesh, the Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>In the resurrection of Christ, God also made Christ, who was the last Adam in the flesh, the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Christ was a man in the flesh, but through resurrection God made Him the life-giving Spirit. Today Christ as the life-giving Spirit is within us (2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:16).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Raising the Believers Up with Christ<br>from the Dead</H2><P>When Christ was resurrected, we all were raised up in His resurrection (Eph. 2:6a). God not only created the heavens and the earth but also moved in all these steps. But most Christians today in reading the Bible do not care for these mysterious, invisible steps of God's move in man. This is why we have the burden to see how God moved in taking so many steps in Christ in humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>E. Regenerating All the Believers<br>in Christ as God's Many Sons</H2><P>In Christ's resurrection we all were regenerated in Christ to be God's many sons (1 Pet. 1:3; Heb. 2:10; Rom. 8:29). In God's eyes, we all were regenerated in Christ's resurrection before we were born. Before we were generated, we were regenerated in Christ's resurrection about two thousand years ago. The fact of our regeneration took place almost two thousand years ago, but we experienced this fact when we were saved.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>F. Releasing the Divine Life from<br>the One Grain Broken through the Death<br>of the Cross of Christ to Produce Many Grains<br>for the Constitution of the Body of Christ</H2><P>Christ was the one grain of wheat containing the divine life within His human shell. One day He was killed and that killing on the cross broke His human shell to release the divine life within Him. This released divine life produced many grains by dispensing the divine life into His believers (John 12:24). All these many grains are the members of His organic Body (1 Cor. 10:17). This is a particular step of God's move in man.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_041.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_043.html">Next</a> </body></html>
