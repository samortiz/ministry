<h1 class="title">THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
AND PRAYER IN THE SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 3:6; 4:24; 1 Cor. 6:17; 12:3; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; Eph. 2:22; John 16:14-15</h1>
<p>The Lord has shown us the vision of the building up of the church. He has also shown us that the building of the church depends on the priests (see <em>The Vision of the Building of the Church, The Blueprint and the Ground for the Building Up of the Church,</em> and <em>The Priesthood and God&rsquo;s Building</em>). In order to be built up together, the saints must be priests. Only the priests live in the Holy of Holies; that is, they are in spirit and can be built up together in God. In this chapter we will cover the relationship between our spirit and building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
DEPENDING ON<br />
THE MINGLING OF GOD WITH MAN</h2>
<p>The building of the church is accomplished by building God into man. We should not think that the builded church is composed of only human beings. The church is built by building God into man and building man into God. When God is built into man and man is built into God, those who are many become one Body in one Spirit. The Body being one depends not only on man but also on God. When God is in all of us and we are in God, we are one Body. This is the way that we are built together.</p>
<p>In the New Testament age, the age of grace, God is doing a specific work in His Son and through the Holy Spirit. He is entering into people to become their constitution so that they may be filled with the element of God. God is also bringing these people, who are filled with His element, into Himself. This is the mingling of God with man; this is God entering into man and being mingled with man. The believers who have been mingled with God are built up together in God.</p>
<p>When we are in ourselves instead of in God, we are scattered and torn down. There is oneness and building only when we enter into God. The building up of the church is not a matter of being united because we have the same opinions, the same views, or even the same feelings toward one another. At the most, such a group would be a pleasant organization. The church is not built on having the same opinions or feelings; the church is built on Christ (Matt. 16:18). God is building Himself into man in order to be man&rsquo;s constituent. God is also bringing man into the Spirit so that man can be full of God&rsquo;s element. All those who are in God are spontaneously one Body. This one Body is the building. The building of the church is not a matter of human organization, nor is it based on having the same views or feelings. Rather, the building of the church is a matter of being mingled with God and being saturated with the Spirit. Those who are mingled with God and submerged in the Spirit are in the God of glory and are being built up together as one Body to be God&rsquo;s dwelling place, His glorious family.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD IN HIS SON<br />
BEING EVERYTHING TO MAN</h2>
<p>God had to take some definite steps in order to reach the goal of being mingled with man. First, God put all His elements, all the fullness of the Godhead, all His glory, in His Son, Christ (Col. 2:9). God wants His Son to have the first place in all things (1:18). Therefore, a person who does not know Christ does not have a way to know God, and if he does not contact Christ, he does not have a way to contact God. If he does not have a relationship with the Son, he will be alienated from God, because it is impossible to touch God outside of Christ, the Son of God (John 14:6). God is in His Son, and He wants to glorify His Son, our Lord Jesus (v. 11; 17:5). Any person who is willing to contact the Lord Jesus, no matter the time or the place, will immediately touch God. As long as he believes in the Lord Jesus, he will have a relationship with God. Human beings cannot obtain God apart from the Son of God. All God&rsquo;s glory, all the fullness of the Godhead, and all God&rsquo;s elements are in His Son bodily so that the Son can be everything to man for man&rsquo;s enjoyment and possession.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus is everything to us. He is our life, our light, our way, and our wisdom. He is our bread of life and our living water, and He is our power, our joy, our peace, and our comfort. All that we need is in the glorious Son of God, because all the fullness of God dwells in the Son for us to enjoy, possess, and experience. For this reason, we need a deeper and more thorough knowledge of the Son. The Bible says that we need to know God (Col. 1:9-10; 1 John 4:7; Rom. 1:28), and it repeatedly says that we need to know Christ, the Son of God (Eph. 4:13; 2 Cor. 2:14; Eph. 3:19; Phil. 3:10; Col. 2:2; 2 Pet. 1:2).</p>
<p>The apostle Paul wrote the Epistle to the Philippians while he was in prison. In 3:10 he says, &ldquo;To know Him.&rdquo; This word does not refer to Paul&rsquo;s knowing Christ in the past but to his knowing Christ in an ongoing way. When Paul wrote this Epistle, he had been an apostle for many years with many considerably deep experiences of the Lord, yet he still said, &ldquo;To know Him.&rdquo; Christ is boundless and limitless. In Ephesians 3:18 the apostle says that Christ is the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe. There is no way to describe how wide is the breadth, or how long is the length, or how high is the height, or how deep is the depth. The breadth, the length, the height, and the depth are immeasurable. The apostle could not find suitable words to describe the infiniteness of Christ; therefore, he simply spoke of &ldquo;the breadth and length and height and depth,&rdquo; which are immeasurable. Paul knew Christ to such an extent that he could describe Him as the breadth, the length, the height, and the depth of the universe. Christ is boundless; His breadth, length, height, and depth are all limitless. Christ the glorious Lord is so boundless because He is the embodiment of God. The infinite God, the God who exists from eternity to eternity and whose years will never fail, is embodied in this glorious Christ. Hence, we can never fully know Christ or exhaust our experiences of Him. Such an infinite Christ has become everything to us.</p>
