   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Need to Come out of the Smaller Oneness</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>into the Larger Oneness</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Christian oneness is as narrow as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Anything foreign to the Body must not be brought in. Christian oneness is also as large as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Any so-called oneness that is smaller than the Body cannot be considered Christian oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The more you maintain this so-called oneness, the more you are in division.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more intimacy you have built up with your brothers, the more you are sectarian and divisive.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You need to come out of the smaller oneness into the larger oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you want to be part of the larger oneness, you must forsake the smaller oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Do not think that oneness is good enough by itself; you must ask what kind of oneness it is.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do not say that any oneness is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The only oneness that is good enough is the oneness of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whatever oneness is smaller than the oneness of the Body should not be endorsed by Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>No oneness should be smaller than the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Anything that is smaller than the Body of Christ is not acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>E. What Division Is</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The word division or sect is hairesis in Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is used nine times in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is used six times in Acts, and it is translated sect, such as the sect of the Sadducees, the sect of the Pharisees, and the Nazarene sect.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is used three times in the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Let us consider the passages in the Epistles where this word is used.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Division Being Possible Only in the Church</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First Corinthians 11:18 says, First of all, when you come together in the church, I hear that divisions exist among you; and some part of it I believe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here it says that the Corinthians were divided among themselves in their meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>What does it mean to be divided?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Division can only be possible in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Corinth was a church, and these believers were in the church in Corinth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One day someone said, I am of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Another person said, I am of Cephas.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A third one said, I am of Apollos, and a fourth one said, I am of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The words were wrong, the tone was wrong, and the attitude in spirit was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There were strife and jealousy, and the love of Christ was clearly missing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whenever they met, those who said that they were of Paul met in one place and those who said that they were of Apollos met in another place.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This was division.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Anyone who wants to accuse another person of being divisive can only raise such an accusation in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This accusation is not possible outside the church.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A man can only commit the sin of division in the church; he cannot commit such a sin outside the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A man can revolt only against a legitimate government; he cannot revolt against a government which is itself not legitimate.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is rebellion to separate oneself from a legitimate government, but it is not rebellion to separate oneself from a government that is not legitimate.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Therefore, division is something that can only happen in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Such division is not well pleasing to God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Division Being the Work of the Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Galatians 5:19-20 says, The works of the flesh are manifest, which are such things as...outbursts of anger, factions, divisions, sects hairesis .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>One item of the works of the flesh is sects.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Chinese Bible translates it heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In Greek this word is the same word as division or sect.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Here we see what division is.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Division is a work of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Paul was telling not only the Galatians and the Corinthians, but also you and me, that division is not a spiritual thing but a work of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Paul gave an itemized description of all the works of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He spoke of fornication, uncleanness, lasciviousness, idolatry, sorcery, enmities, strife, jealousy, etc., and he also spoke of division.</S>
