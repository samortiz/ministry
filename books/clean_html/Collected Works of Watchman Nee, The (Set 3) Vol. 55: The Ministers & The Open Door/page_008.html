<h2 class="head1">IN WU-YUAN</h2><p>Peace in the Lord to dear Brother Witness:</p><p>I have not corresponded with you for several years. I really miss you! How are you? How are the brothers and sisters? I miss them all. After leaving Cheefoo, I went first to Bao-Tou, then to Feng-Zhen, and now I have come to Wu-Yuan. I have seen the Lord's leading and grace in all matters. I am working for the Wu-Yuan county government, and it is going well. There are nine brothers and sisters here. We have meetings on Tuesday, Thursday, Saturday, and the Lord's Day, and we really have the Lord's presence. Please remember us much in prayer. We hope you will write us often and teach us.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Wang Chu Hsin<br />February 2, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: Wu-Yuan County Government Office, Sui-Yuan</p><h2 class="head1">ALL CARE</h2><p>It was really God's grace that I went to Shanghai and had the opportunity to fellowship with the leading brothers and sisters. The assembly in Tientsin has been really blessed by the Lord. There may be a baptism meeting soon. The brothers and sisters all feel that there is not enough room in the hall. They all care about this and feel that we should rent or buy a bigger house. We are now in the process of getting one. May the Lord give us grace. We hope you would remember this when you pray.</p><p>Did Brother Yu and Sister Wang go to Tsingtao? Have the brothers going to Foochow left yet?</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Sia Xi-ling<br />May 17, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: 116 Yau-Hwa Lane, Shansi Road, District 10, Tientsin</p><h2 class="head1">THE FUTURE OF THE HEBRON ORPHANAGE</h2><p>Greetings in the Lord to Brother Watchman and Brother Witness:</p><p>I left Shanghai on the eleventh and arrived safely in Hankow on the fifteenth. The problems in the school have all been resolved. The only matter left is personnel; I am desperately waiting for the coordinating brothers and sisters to come. We desperately need to resolve the future of the orphanage, both with respect to location and to method of administration.</p><p>Since my return, it seems as if I have committed a great sin, as if I have been struck with a great illness. My head is heavy, and my body is weak. I cannot pray or read the Bible. I cannot speak or even think. If the church does not make some arrangements for the future of the orphanage, I really feel that I will not be able to carry out my responsibilities. I would like to be able to drop this burden and look for a small place in a locality where I could learn to serve God with all the members in that locality. I am afraid of ending up in the wrong place, doing the wrong thing, and shaming the Lord's name.</p><p>It has been rainy for the last few days, and the river is rising quickly. It is two feet higher than it was in 1932. All the inhabitants of Wuhan are worried.</p><p>I have been working on the debts and doing the books since my return. I really ask for guidance with respect to the future. I am awaiting your prompt response. I respectfully greet you with peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Lan Tsi-yi<br />May 20, 1948</p><p>Mailing Address: P. O. Box 99, Hankow</p>
