   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. FEARING GOD AND BEING GENEROUS TO OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Two other portions of the Word speak about God's governmental hand: Matthew 6:15 and 18:23-35.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One very important thing can be found in these verses do not condemn others easily.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is a very serious matter!</S>

   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In whatever matter you do not forgive or excuse others, the same matter will come back to haunt you!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This surely has to do with God's governmental hand.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord said that if you do not forgive others of their sins, God will also not forgive you of your sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This refers to governmental forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This forgiveness is different from other kinds of forgiveness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Matthew 18:35 uses the phrase My heavenly Father.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The fact that a person can call God Father proves that the matter of eternal forgiveness with him has long been settled.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a brother offends such a one, and that one does not forgive his brother, God will not forgive him either.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His governmental hand will come.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Learn to be a generous and forgiving person!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Learn to be generous to others and learn always to forgive.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If you keep complaining about the conduct of others and continue to count the ill treatment you receive from them, please bear in mind that this will bring you into God's governmental hand and it will not be easy to come out!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God will put you deeper into the hole.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you are severe toward others, God will also be severe toward you.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the slave went out and found one of his fellow slaves who owed him a hundred denarii, he seized him and took him by the throat.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When his lord found out about this, he was unhappy with the slave.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He delivered the slave to the torturers until the slave paid all that he owed 18:23-35 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He would not be released until he paid all that he owed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God disciplined the unforgiving slave.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God's governmental hand was upon him, and he could not easily get away.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We should not only be generous in forgiving others but also avoid criticizing or speaking about others in a light way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Please bear in mind that our criticism and careless comments about others often becomes a judgment upon ourselves.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Sometimes a person may make a remark about someone's troublesome children, saying, "See how God's hand is always on this person."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But after some time, the same thing happens to the one who criticized.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What do we do when this happens?</S>

   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It is not wise to incur God's governmental judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It is very serious and sobering.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should be careful not to take other people's affairs upon ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whatever we lightly condemn about others will soon become a condemnation upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We reap what we sow.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is something very real among God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I hope that we will learn to be generous persons in the eyes of God.</S>

   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They will have no clothes and nothing to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The sheep will be the ones who will visit them in prison, who will give them clothes when they are naked, and who will give them food when they hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>These charitable acts will give them the ground to receive grace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We must not say that since God has ordained that they go through persecution and suffering, we will do our part by adding suffering to them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>God indeed has ordained the suffering, but we must be generous to them.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We cannot say that we will add more sufferings to them because God has ordained their persecution and affliction.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Governmental discipline is God's concern.</S>

   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must be generous toward others if we want to avoid God's governmental hand!</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>May we learn to love and forbear one another.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We must always ask God for mercy in dealing with our foolishness and weakness, both in our walk and in everything we do.</S>

   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Be merciful to me!"</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The more pliable and humble we are, the easier it will be for us to be delivered from our afflictions.</S>

   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Therefore, we must learn to humble ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>BEING HUMBLE AND OBEDIENT, AND "IN DUE TIME,"</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>GOD'S GOVERNMENTAL HAND BEING WITHDRAWN</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Should we fall into God's governmental hand, for any reason great or small, the last thing we should do is rebel.</S>

   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>His hand here is not for protection.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>If it were for protection, the verse would say, "The eternal arm of God."</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Here we are the ones who humble ourselves under God's mighty hand.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This implies obedience.</S>

   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We cannot shake off such a hand!</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>We cannot resist it.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Instead, we must learn to humble ourselves under it by saying, "Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>I am willing to obey.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>I will not resist You no matter where You put me.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I accept everything, and I accept it willingly!</S>

   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>I am willing to obey Your word!</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>No matter how long You keep me in this condition, I am willing to obey!"</S>
