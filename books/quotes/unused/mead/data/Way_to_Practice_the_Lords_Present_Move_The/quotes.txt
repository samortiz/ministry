[1]  The Way to Practice the Lord's Present Move CONTENTS
[2]  The Need of the Present World, the Divine Truths in the Lord s Recovery, and the Blessing on the Lord s Recovery
[3]  Since October of 1984, at the time when I finished writing the notes in the Recovery Version of the New Testament, I began to have the burden to reconsider the practice of the Lord s recovery.
[4]  We are here in the Lord s recovery, and we do not like to go on blindly or do anything in a contented way.
[5]  From the 1930 s until this present day very few spiritual books have been published outside of the Lord s recovery which are full of life, truth, and light.
[6]  I had a further realization that we needed to put out something as an index, which I called The Conclusion of the New Testament, on seven great persons: God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem.
[7]  If you want to know anything concerning God in the New Testament, you can come to the section on God and find all the verses concerning Him in His many different aspects.
[8]  In this chapter we want to fellowship further concerning the need of the present world, the divine truths that the Lord has shown us throughout the years, and the blessings we have been receiving of the Lord through these many years.
[9]  I would also like to relate something of our recent experience in Taiwan which shows how the Lord s blessing is with us.
[10]  In October of 1984 I went to Taipei and I was led by the Lord to carry out and finish three risks.
[11]  Soon before His ascension, the Lord told the disciples to wait in Jerusalem until the Holy Spirit would come upon them Acts 1:4, 8 .
[12]  After the Spirit came upon them, they would go to be His witnesses in Jerusalem as a start and unto the remotest part of the earth, as the consummation of His ministry in the New Testament.
[13]  Now all of us as the disciples of the Lord have the Spirit within us essentially and the Spirit upon us economically.
[14]  We need to realize, however, that neither do we have any feeling concerning the Lord s incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.
[15]  We just have to claim these facts and say, Thank You, Lord Jesus, that You died for me, You were resurrected for me, You breathed Your Spirit into me, and You have poured out Your Spirit upon me.
[16]  If we mean business to believe that the Spirit has been given to us within essentially and has been poured out upon us outwardly and economically, we have to repent of all of our sins, our weaknesses, our filthiness, our mistakes, our wrongdoings, our offenses, and whatever is an evil and sinful thing in the eyes of God, toward God, and toward man.
[17]  If we are going to rise up, we have to repent and make a thorough confession.
[18]  However, you cannot say that because you washed your hands two weeks ago that you do not need to wash your hands anymore.
[19]  Neither can you say that you took a shower two months ago so there is no need for you to take another shower.
[20]  FOR THE MEETINGS Scripture Reading: Matt 18:20; Acts 4:31; 1 Cor 12:8; Col 3:16; Eph 5:18-19; John 6:63b; Eph 6:17-18a PRAYER, THE WORD, THE SPIRIT,
[21]  We need the Word and the Spirit for the meetings, but without prayer the Word is not so real to us, and without prayer the Spirit is not so living to us.
[22]  You have to fight to come to the meeting, but actually the Lord Jesus is fighting within you to pull you out from so many things in your environment and gather you into His name.
[23]  Once we are gathered together into His name, we need to speak.
[24]  BEING FILLED WITH THE CONSUMMATED SPIRIT ESSENTIALLY AND ECONOMICALLY
[25]  Even if we have the adequate vocabulary we still need the Spirit.
[26]  The book of Acts shows us that we need to be filled with the Spirit and we need to receive the outpouring of the Spirit.
[27]  Inside we need to be filled and outside we need to receive the outpouring of the all-inclusive, processed, compound, life-giving, indwelling, sevenfold intensified, and consummated Spirit.
[28]  The essential aspect is that He would enter into us as our spiritual and divine essence to be our very life supply and the spiritual content of our divine life for our life and living.
[29]  The Holy Spirit, who is today s consummated life-giving Spirit, is God s very essence, God s divine substance John 4:24 .
[30]  It is a divine fact that we have Him within us as the essence and upon us for the economy of God, yet in our experience we are short of Him within and we are short of Him without.
[31]  The Holy Spirit, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of Jesus, the Spirit of Jesus Christ, and the seven Spirits are among the many titles of the Spirit s person.
[32]  The way to get this all-inclusive Spirit is to pray, and when you come to pray the first order of business is to offer the sin and trespass offerings.
[33]  If you do not do this, you do not realize how many sins you have.
[34]  But when you come to the Lord to contact Him, not being occupied with so many prayers for matters, things, and persons, to be filled with Him and to be a person wrapped up with Him, you will immediately have the deep sensation that you are wrong in so many matters.
[35]  When you get yourself fully cleared up in prayer by confessing your failures, your wrongdoings, your mistakes, your sinful things, your offenses, and your shortcomings, that will be the time you will be filled with the Spirit.
[36]  Every day we need some time to deal with the Word and we need some time to deal with the Spirit to keep us always prepared to speak Christ, to speak for Christ, and to speak forth Christ at any time and at any place.
[37]  I went there purposely at the sacrifice of the Lord s recovery in the western world because we do have a great heritage, a big investment in the Lord s recovery there.
[38]  They heard how Jesus was God, how Jesus became a man, how Jesus lived among them, how He was rejected and how He was put on the cross, crucified, yet God had honored Him, God raised Him up, and He was living.
[39]  My burden is that we would not follow the fundamental way or the Pentecostal way in dealing with the Word and the Spirit.
[40]  The fundamental way is to emphasize the Word and neglect the Spirit, and the Pentecostal way is somewhat to emphasize the Spirit and neglect the Word.
[41]  In the Bible we can see that as children of God and members of Christ we surely need to have the real experience in the holy Word, and to experience the Spirit of God, essentially and economically.
[42]  Most of the saints in the Lord s recovery are at a standstill, not dealing with the Word and not dealing with the Spirit.
[43]  CONCERNING OUR SERVICE TO THE LORD Scripture Reading: Rev l:5b-6; Rom 15:16; John 15:2, 5, 8; Matt 25:14-15, 19, 21, 30; Acts 2:44-45; 2 Cor 8:12-15; 1 Cor 16:1-2; 2 Thes 3:8-12; 1 Cor 9:7-14; Phil 1:5-6; 4:15-19; Acts 20:33-35; 18:1-4; 3 John 5-8; Luke 16:9-13
[44]  In this chapter we want to fellowship concerning the most crucial and practical point of the many aspects and details concerning the matter of the believers serving the Lord full-time.
[45]  We must be clear that all the believers are priests, offering people to God, branches of the organic Christ to express God for His glory, and the Lord s servants to serve Him by making profit for His kingdom.
[46]  THE SUPPLY OF FULL-TIME WORKERS Living of the Gospel
[47]  The ones who give up their job to serve the Lord full-time should live by announcing the gospel.
[48]  About sixty years ago, the Lord began His recovery among us brothers in China, and one of the things we studied was how the Lord s full-time servants could be taken care of.
[49]  I have been serving the Lord full-time since 1933 and I have experienced the Lord s faithfulness, the saints love, and the churches care.
[50]  At the very beginning of the church life recorded in the book of Acts, the saints were, no doubt, under the Holy Spirit s move.
[51]  On the day of Pentecost at least over three thousand saints were touched by the Lord to have everything in common.
[52]  This was only practiced for a short time at the initiation of God s New Testament economy; it did not continue for the long run as a practice of legality in the church life during Paul s ministry, as proven by his words in 2 Corinthians 9 and other places.
[53]  On the other hand, the Bible encourages us to support the full-time workers.
[54]  Third John 5-8 tells us we need to take care of, support, and send the traveling full-time workers forward on their way in a way that matches God, who is generous.
[55]  If we support the full-timers, we are participating, sharing in, their work for the truth, and we become fellow workers in the truth v. 8 . We are not directly taking part of the full-time work, but we are indirectly sharing the same work.
[56]  Therefore, if you do not have the burden to be full-time, you should make more money for the Lord s interest.
[57]  Paul told the Philippians that in the beginning of the gospel, when I went out from Macedonia, not one church shared with me in the account of giving and receiving but you only; for even in Thessalonica you sent both once and again to my need.
[58]  In Luke 16 the Lord Jesus tells us that we should be the prudent stewards to use the present money of unrighteousness to make friends for ourselves v. 9 . When we give to support the full-time workers for the furtherance of the spreading of the Lord s truth, many will be saved.
[59]  You may not be in the proper environment or have the burden or gift to be full-time to preach the gospel, teach the truth, and minister life to others; yet you may have an ability, by the Lord s sovereignty, to make a lot of money.
[60]  Every time you give to the Lord through the church, five percent of your income should be given to the Lord to support full-time workers for His propagation.
[61]  Prayer: Lord, how we worship You and thank You that You have raised up Your recovery in these final days.
[62]  Thank You, Lord, that You have opened up Your Word to us and have unveiled to us so many truths concerning God s New Testament economy and the Triune God being processed and consummated.
[63]  We need to teach the truths concerning the New Testament economy of God and concerning God, Christ, the Spirit, the believers, the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem.
[64]  We all are priests of God, branches of Christ, and slaves of the Lord, so every day at any time and any place we preach and teach what the Lord has revealed to us.
[65]  In Berkeley, California, many young teenagers who passed through the summer school to study the truths concerning God s economy went to the campus to talk to the professors and students about the Triune God, about God s creation of man being for the purpose of expressing Him, and about man being a vessel, a container, to contain God.
[66]  We have booklets with titles such as: A Proper Living in the Relationship between Wife and Husband, The Surpassing Greatness of God s Power, The Hope of God s Calling, A Spirit of Wisdom and Revelation, The Spirit the Pledge of Our Inheritance, The Sealing of the Holy Spirit, and Chosen to Be Holy.
[67]  CHAPTER SEVEN BE WATCHFUL IN LIFE Scripture Reading: Matt 24:39-44; 25:1-13 THE RECOVERY OF THE LOST TRUTHS
[68]  In this chapter I am burdened to have more fellowship concerning being filled with the Spirit inwardly and outwardly.
[69]  Many Christians have taught concerning the believers having the fullness of the Spirit, yet hardly any teachers have referred this matter to Matthew 25.
[70]  Some may quote portions of Matthew referring to the virgin s son being called Emmanuel and given the name Jesus 1:23, 25 , to being pure in heart 5:8 and poor in spirit 5:3 , which to them is to be humble, and concerning coming to the Lord for Him to give us rest 11:28 .
[71]  Many of us who say we are in the Lord s recovery, even the ones saved among us who were never in Christianity and still remain with us, are in the degraded situation.
[72]  Matthew 24:39 says, And they did not know until the flood came and took all away; so also shall the coming Gk. parousia of the Son of Man be.
[73]  Watch therefore, for you do not know on what day your Lord comes.
[74]  The two men or two women in 24:40-41 are the living saints because they are still working in the field and grinding at the mill. A minority of the Lord s saints will be living at His coming back, while the majority represented by the ten virgins 25:1 , will have died before the Lord s coming.
[75]  By reading the context of Matthew 25:1-13, we can see that to be watchful is to be filled with the Holy Spirit.
[76]  If we are not being filled all day long, we are not being watchful.
[77]  I feel that now the Lord is working among us and taking a new step to move among us.
[78]  We call this the present-day move of the Lord, but we have to realize that this is the recovery.
[79]  We Christians have two kinds of statuses before the Lord we are virgins in life and we are slaves for our service to the Lord.
[80]  If we do mean business with the Lord s present-day move, we must be filled with the Spirit every morning of every day.
[81]  I pray frequently, especially during conference and training times, for the Lord to protect the saints from any accidents, but who can say when we will go to be with the Lord.
[82]  By His mercy, especially over the last ten years, I have been releasing all the high, deeper truths concerning the New Testament economy of God.
[83]  I hope that we can read these two portions of the Word in the Scripture reading again so that we may clearly see how the Lord desires for us to be in the right position of being watchful every day and all day before Him.
[84]  CHAPTER EIGHT BE FAITHFUL IN SERVICE Scripture Reading: Matt 24:45-51; 25:14-30 THE EXTRA PORTION OF THE SPIRIT IN OUR SOUL
[85]  In the last chapter we covered the matter of our being watchful in the spiritual life so that we may have an extra portion of oil.
[86]  This extra portion of oil is not in the lamp but in the vessel, and is not concerning the Spirit in our regenerated spirit, which is the lamp of Jehovah, but concerning the Spirit of God in our soul, our entire being.
[87]  Today not many of us are paying attention to this saturating Spirit, moving from our spirit into our soul, even into our entire being, so that we may have not only the oil in our spirit but also an extra portion of this oil to saturate our entire being.
[88]  Second Corinthians 3:18 says that we all beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.
[89]  You may say we are to be transformed by the Spirit, or that we are to have an extra portion of the Holy Spirit in our soul that our being might be saturated.
[90]  However, it is difficult to find one who stresses that you need to be filled in your spirit that you may have a flow out of your spirit to have an extra portion of the Spirit in your soul.
[91]  In these two chapters we have two things to take care of our watchfulness in life and our faithfulness in service.
[92]  The watchfulness in life has very much to do with our being raptured on time, with our receiving the permission to enter into the Lord s wedding feast Matt 22:2; Rev 19:9 .
[93]  The one thousand year kingdom will be the wedding day in which we will have the wedding feast with the Lord 2 Pet 3:8 .
[94]  In chapter thirteen of Matthew the Lord said, Allow both to grow together until the harvest, and in the time of the harvest I will say to the reapers, Gather first the tares and bind them into bundles to burn them up, but the wheat bring together into My barn v. 30 . When the Lord comes, He will send the angels to bind the tares, the false believers, and cast them into the lake of fire vv.
[95]  Now we need to fellowship concerning our practice of being faithful in service.
[96]  First, in Matthew 24:45-51 we are told clearly that the Lord commissioned us to take care of His household.
[97]  The Lord charged us, commissioned us, to minister something to His household, that is, to the believers in the church.
[98]  Do not say that others have a gift of teaching to teach you the Word of God and minister spiritual food to you, but that you do not have such a gift.
[99]  When you go to school, even if you are not going there to teach but to attend classes, all the classmates around you are the Lord s possessions delivered to you that you may take the opportunity, the appointed time, to minister the gospel to them.
[100]  In the first of these two portions of Scripture, the Lord spoke of food, related to our service.
[101]  As a servant commissioned by the Lord to take care of His household, we need to serve food, but as a slave in the parable of Matthew 25:14-30, we need to make a profit.
[102]  A WORD OF SUPPLY AND A WORD OF WARNING
[103]  Who knows that the Lord will not come back soon?
[104]  To have the Holy Spirit come into our spirit is simple, but to have an extra portion of the Holy Spirit to fill you up, to saturate your entire being, takes much time.
[105]  The one-talented one argued with the Lord, taking to Him a very good excuse, saying, Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter Matt 25:24 .
[106]  CHAPTER NINE HOW TO BE WATCHFUL IN LIFE Scripture Reading: Matt 24:42-44; 25:1-13; Eph 6:17-18; 4:30; 1 Thes 5:19; Rom 8:4 A BOOK ON THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS
[107]  The book of Matthew has been mostly misunderstood throughout the history of the church.
[108]  Now we need to see how to be watchful, which means we need to see how to buy the oil.
[109]  When I was a young Christian, I considered that to be watchful was to look to the heavens for His coming, and even to figure out when He would come.
[110]  You may not do anything sinful, but this parable of the virgins does not indicate that the Lord will judge us according to how much sin we have committed, but according to how much oil we have in our vessel.
[111]  We need to pray from the time that we wake up every morning, Lord, I do not like to do anything that is not under my being watchful, that is not under my buying of the oil.
[112]  We do not need to resurrect in the future to discover that we need to go and buy the oil.
[113]  Even though they did not know as much truth as we do, have as much light as we have, or have as much growth in life as we have, they had a heart for Jesus, to preach Him to the poor ones.
[114]  CHAPTER TEN THE WAY TO BE FAITHFUL IN SERVICE Scripture Reading: Matt 24:45-51; 25:16-30
[115]  We believers in Christ all need to have a serious realization that the Lord has given us a double status, a twofold status.
[116]  We are the virgins in the divine life, in God s life, and we are the slaves in the Lord s service.
[117]  We have seen that we need to be watchful and pray that we may always buy the oil to arrive at the maturity in life so that we might be ready for the coming rapture.
[118]  In this chapter we want to see the way to be faithful in the Lord s service.
[119]  This heavy book of Matthew tells us that if we are not faithful in His commission in 24:45-51 or in His gifts in 25:14-30, we will be put into a place called outer darkness where we are cut off from the coming Lord.
[120]  For many of us, though, who were saved years ago and have been in the Lord s recovery for a number of years, the Lord will ask us how much oil we have bought and accumulated since we came into the recovery.
[121]  All of us should be those who are feeding the Lord s people at the appointed time Matt 24:45 and using the Lord s talents in full 25:20, 22 .
[122]  You may not do your duty to perform your service, but instead you are criticizing and sometimes even strongly opposing the brothers.
[123]  The slothful servants who are not so faithful in the Lord s commission have an excuse that the Lord is not coming back immediately, that He is delaying His coming 24:48 .
[124]  Their excuse is that if the Lord would return right now, everything would be solved; they would not have the time to love the world.
[125]  However, the Lord s word in Matthew 24 tells us He would not take this kind of excuse.
[126]  He said, Lord, I knew you, that you are a hard man, reaping where you did not sow, and gathering where you did not scatter; and I was afraid, and went away and hid your talent in the earth; behold, you have what is yours Matt 25:24-25 .
[127]  The way to be faithful is to scatter the Lord s word, which is food to every hungry one.
[128]  The Lord s household is composed not only of believers but also of sinners.
