[2]  The following chapters are translated from seven messages given in Chinese by Brother Witness Lee at a special conference in Quezon City, Philippines, in March, 1989.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE THE RICHES OF CHRIST 1 Scripture Reading: Phil 2:6-8; John 5:17; Heb 1:2-4; Eph 3:18, 8, 9-11 OUTLINE The all-inclusiveness and unlimitedness of Christ: His person, nature, experience, work, accomplishments, and attainments all being excellent beyond comparison Phil 2:6-8; John 5:17; Heb 1:2-4.
[4]  His measure being the breadth, length, height, and depth of the universe Eph 3:18.
[5]  We all know that the person denotes the being of a man.
[6]  We all know that it is not easy to be a human being.
[7]  REALIZING OUR OWN USELESSNESS FOR THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST'S UNSEARCHABLE RICHES
[8]  Many of you young ones here today have known Christ.
[9]  This training is to lead the brothers and sisters to know themselves, to realize their own uselessness, and to contact Christ, so that the riches of Christ can become their riches.
[10]  CHAPTER TWO THE RICHES OF CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 12:9; John 1:14; 2 Cor 13:14; Phil 4:13; 1 Cor 15:9-11; Phil 1:19; 2 Tim 4:22; 1 Cor 6:17; Phil 1:21 OUTLINE The grace of Christ 2 Cor 12:9: The embodiment of the processed Triune God becoming the believers' enjoyment John 1:14; 2 Cor 13:14.
[11]  The bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ Phil 1:19: The Spirit of Jesus Christ being the embodiment of Christ, who is the pneumatic Christ in resurrection.
[12]  THE GRACE OF CHRIST The Embodiment of the Processed Triune God Becoming the Believers' Enjoyment
[13]  All the riches of this God become His grace.
[14]  Today, when we enjoy God, we are enjoying His all-inclusiveness and limitlessness being given to us freely as grace.
[15]  Hence, 2 Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.''
[16]  This grace is what God is in Himself as all His riches.
[17]  Paul told us that he became an uncommon person not through himself, but through the grace of Christ that was present in him.
[18]  The Spirit of God is simply the reality of Christ, and Christ is the embodiment of the Triune God.
[19]  CHAPTER THREE THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST 1 Scripture Reading: John 1:14, 16; Eph 1:23 OUTLINE The riches of God becoming the fullness of Christ: The riches of the Triune God overflowing in the flesh to become the fullness of Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God John 1:14, 16.
[20]  The riches of Christ overflowing to the believers to become the fullness of Christ as His expression and God's fullness Eph 1:23.
[21]  This Body being the church constituted of the believers in Christ: Being constituted in Christ by the divine life of Christ.
[22]  Being out of Christ and being one in life and nature with Christ.
[23]  The riches of Christ are the riches of God.
[24]  When they are expressed without in Christ, they become the fullness.
[25]  When the riches that are in this Christ, who is the embodiment of the processed Triune God, are experienced by us, they overflow to become His fullness.
[26]  CHAPTER FOUR THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST 2 Scripture Reading: Eph 4:16; Col 2:19; Eph 4:15, 13, 12, 16, 7-11 OUTLINE The organic Body of Christ needing the growth Eph 4:16: Growing by the growth of God in the believers Col 2:19.
[27]  Causing all the saints to grow into the Head, Christ, in all things, being full of the element of Christ Eph 4:15.
[28]  The growth of the organic Body of Christ being the organic building of the church as the Body of Christ Eph 4:12, 16: Christ as the resurrected and ascended Head producing the gifted persons through His resurrection life to be the gifts given to the church produced by Him as His Body Eph 4:7-11.
[29]  These gifts given by Christ to the church perfecting the saints for the work of the unique New Testament ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:12.
[30]  The gifted ones being the joints of the life supply in the organic Body of Christ, the other members being the different parts in this organic Body; the two coordinating to build up the Body of Christ organically.
[31]  For example, in the book of Ephesians Paul revealed the thought concerning the fullness of Christ as the Body of Christ, which is the church of Christ.
[32]  In chapter four of Ephesians, Paul used another profound word, "the fullness of Christ'' v. 13 . He said that the fullness of Christ is the expression of Christ.
[33]  When Christ enters into us, not only is He life to us to save us, but He is also making us the church through this saving life.
[34]  As the human body needs to grow, in the same way the Body of Christ needs to grow.
[35]  But when we speak of the church, we should speak of growth, because the church is the Body of Christ.
[36]  Because the church needs the growth, and because we all have to arrive at a full-grown man, being full of the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ, we need to know how the Body of Christ grows.
[37]  Until All the Saints Arrive at a Full-grown Man, at the Full Measure of the Stature of the Fullness of Christ
[38]  Those brothers and sisters who have come from various localities should know that the growth of the church where they are depends on their growth.
[39]  Whether or not they grow depends on whether or not they have Christ growing in them.
[40]  If you give Christ the ground, He will grow in you.
[41]  Hence, you have to allow Christ to grow in you, and you have to grow in Him, so that the church can grow in you.
[42]  The church is the Body of Christ, and the growth of the Body is the building up of the Body.
[43]  In the past messages, we have seen Christ, and we have seen the church.
[44]  We have also seen that when this Body enjoys the riches of Christ, it becomes the fullness of Christ.
[45]  This fullness is the expression of Christ, whereas Christ is the expression of the Triune God.
[46]  The fullness of this Body and its expression are built up gradually, and it grows gradually as the Body of Christ until it reaches the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[47]  Although these truths that the Lord has given us are in the New Testament, by the end of the apostolic age they had gradually been lost.
[48]  At the beginning, the way we carried out our service, the way we met, and the practice of the gospel preaching were done eighty percent according to the way of the Brethren in the nineteenth century.
[49]  After I had completed the Life-study of the New Testament in 1984, I began to observe the development of the churches in the Lord's recovery.
[50]  CHAPTER SIX THE ADVANCED RECOVERY OF THE LORD TODAY 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:1, 39, 3-5, 12, 24-25, 31, 26 THE GIFTED PERSONS BEING FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS
[51]  I believe today the Lord is recovering Ephesians 4:11-16.
[52]  Not only do we need to be perfected, but we need to go on to practice prophesying also.
[53]  They will not be speaking their own words, but they will learn to speak forth the Lord and to deposit the riches of Christ into others.
[54]  The Condition for Prophesying Every Morning Being Revived to Live Always in the Spirit
[55]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE ADVANCED RECOVERY OF THE LORD TODAY 3 Scripture Reading: Eph 4:12; Heb 10:24-25; 1 Cor 14:1, 3-5, 24, 31, 26
[56]  THE CHRISTIAN MEETING BEING FULLY A MATTER OF SPEAKING
