   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 3 DAY 3</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Eph 6:17-18 And receive the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition, praying at every time in spirit</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 6:63 It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Pray-reading the Word When Coming to the Bible, Having to Prepare Ourselves to Enter into Fellowship with God</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we come to the Bible, we have to prepare ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are getting ourselves prepared to read the word of God, not a newspaper or any secular book.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, we must pray, "O Lord, cleanse me with Your precious blood.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Lord , I am sinful, forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I am mistaken; forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I do not love You; forgive me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Even I do not fear You; forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We must confess all of our sins to make ourselves pure and clean, without any hindering thing between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Then we are in God's fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At that time we are in the Spirit of God, and when we come to the Bible, it is different.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Receiving the Word by Means of All Prayer</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then we have to pray-read, not just read, the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Throughout the centuries, all the devoted lovers of the Lord and students of the Bible practiced pray-reading in fact, though they did not have the term pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Some in the past pointed out that we have to read the Bible prayerfully.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To read the Bible prayerfully is to pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We teach the practice of pray-reading based upon Ephesians 6:17-18.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>69 The apostle Paul took in, received, the word of God by means of all prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He not only prayed in a general way, but he also petitioned in a particular way.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Prayer is general, while petition is particular.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Not only so, Paul prayed with "all prayer and petition."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All includes a great number of ways.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You can pray loudly, or you can pray softly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You can pray quickly, or you can pray slowly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You can pray-read not only in one way but in many ways: by yourself, with your spouse, with a group, and in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Paul said that we should receive the sword of the Spirit, the word of God, by means of all prayer and petition.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This tells us that we pray all prayer and petition to take in, receive, the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>70</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What is the most profitable way to touch and deal with the Word of God?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First, there is no need to close your eyes when you are pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Keep your eyes on the Word as you pray.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In all of the sixty-six books of the Bible I cannot find one verse which says that we must close our eyes to pray, but there is a verse telling us that Jesus looked up to the heavens, saying, "Father " John 17:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was looking at heaven while He was praying.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Second , there is no need for you to compose any sentences or create a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Just pray-read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Pray the words of the Bible exactly as they read.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eventually, you will see that the whole Bible is a prayer book!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Open to any page of the Bible, and start to pray with any portion of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>71</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus said, "It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The words, the Spirit, and life are three items, but the Lord speaks of them here as one.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When the words are merely words, they are only black letters printed on the white paper; they are not the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But when the words get into your mind through your eyes and you begin to pray with your spirit, then the words become the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When the words become the Spirit, they are life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we pray in our reading of the Word, we turn the verses we have read into prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When we pray, we must forget everything else and have only the Lord and His word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hymns, #389 says, "From morning to evening my one world Thou art."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This means that when we seek the Lord, we have only one world: "O Lord, You are my world; I seek You."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Once the word enters your spirit, it becomes the Spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, if you do not pray, then the word that you read will not become the Spirit, nor will it become life.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>72</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Enlightenment and inspiration:</S>
