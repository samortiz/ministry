   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE GIFTS PERFECTING THE SAINTS That the Saints May Participate</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the Work of the New Testament Ministry,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Which Is the Building Up of the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The book of Ephesians shows us that the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are for the perfecting of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In a university, there are many professors of various subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They perfect the students with the purpose that the latter would do the same work they are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the same way, the church is like a university.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some advanced brothers and sisters have already become the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Daily they lead, feed, and teach the saints with the goal that the saints would be perfected to do the work of the ministry, which is the work of the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This work of the building up of the Body of Christ, when considered separately, involves first, the preaching of the gospel to bring people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, it involves the home meetings for the feeding of the believers; this is a mouth-to-mouth feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Third, it involves the group meetings where they are taught the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Fourth, it involves the prophesying where they speak forth the Lord and dispense Him into others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As a result, they become the apostles and can conduct meetings and help people to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All this is to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To achieve this goal, you must improve yourselves through studying.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every morning you need to read and digest two to three verses of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>At other times you also have to try your best to read as much of the Bible as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you take two to three verses a day, in a month you will have sixty to seventy verses.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In a year you will have about a thousand verses digested.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After three years you will have three thousand verses of the Lord s Word in you.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have the Recovery Version of the Bible with the footnotes and all the Life-study Messages.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We are like a scholarly family; there is constantly the scholarly influence around us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Spontaneously we will have a full knowledge of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Next, you must pay attention to the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>You must grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even the way we comb our hair, dress ourselves, and put on our ties have to match the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If they do not match, we have to change.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is to grow up into the Head, Christ, in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In this way, you will have the light of the truth, and you will have the growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When you go to contact people, you will be able to feed the younger ones and teach the more mature ones.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>For the ones who are even more mature, you can perfect them to do the same thing that you are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At the same time, we all have our own family and children.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should live a normal life in an uplifted way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should provide our children with a good and proper education.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For this we need to work to earn our living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This involves our time and energy.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We should make a good schedule and should devote at least one or two evenings a week to go out for two hours, either to preach the gospel by knocking on doors, or to feed the saved ones in their homes.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We can also go to the small groups to contact three to five families and teach them some further truth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then we can bring these to the bigger meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If there are ten or twenty thousand saints in Taipei who would do this week by week, the first aspect of the gifts perfecting the saints would be achieved, which is that the saints would participate in the work of the New Testament ministry, the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Leading the Saints to Arrive at the Oneness</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>of the Faith of the New Testament</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we go out to preach the gospel, we are leading people into the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Man basically has no faith.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whatever faith he does have is blind faith.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We have to give people the proper faith by telling them that there is only one God in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This God has become the Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>For us He became a man, died on the cross, accomplished redemption, and resurrected from the dead to dispense life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When we receive Him, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>These kinds of words will put others onto the proper track of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After this we have to continue to teach and to lead them until they arrive at the oneness of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The more we help them, the more they will be focused in the faith, and the more they will be brought to the oneness of the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today there are many denominations and sects within Christianity because they all hold different views concerning the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They cannot agree, and the oneness of the Body of Christ is lost.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I hope that among us we can arrive at the oneness of the faith so that we can preserve the oneness of the Body of Christ.</S>
