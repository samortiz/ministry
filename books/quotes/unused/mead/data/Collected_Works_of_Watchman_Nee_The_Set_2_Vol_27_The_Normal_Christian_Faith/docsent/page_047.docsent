   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WRITING HAND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I write a great deal, yet my handwriting is not very good.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The reason is probably due to my failure in early years to learn the art properly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When I was young, my father hired an old tutor to teach me to write.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>During the time that he was with me, I always went against him; I never sat down properly to learn.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a result he was quite upset with me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One time he said, "Look at your brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They are all writing beautifully.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You are the only one who does not write well.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here, let me hold your hand and write with you."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>His broad hand grabbed hold of mine and started to move across the pages.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I was trying to be stubborn and uncooperative.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When he stopped I purposely tried to slide a bit further, and when he tried to write a straight line, my hand twisted around left and right.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He never managed to get good handwriting out of me.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>One day he made a poignant statement which I will never forget.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He said, "I wish I could crawl into you to write for you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I do not see how else you can write well."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's way of salvation is to get into us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is the effective and ultimate solution.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not an outward teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not His holding of our hands to move them back and forth.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is not a set of do's and don'ts.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When He put off His flesh, He entered into the Spirit and can now get inside of us to be our life and live out of us.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What that old tutor could never do is now being realized by God in Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE COMFORTER</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>How is Christ in the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have to look into a passage in the Gospel of John in detail.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>John 14:16 says, "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Comforter here is understood to be the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The original word is parakletos.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is formed by two roots.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first part para means beside.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The second part kletos carries the idea of help and succoring.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, this word means helping you at your side.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Comforter gives the sense of one being near to you, helping you, watching over you, and sustaining you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here the Lord is praying the Father to send a Comforter to help and sustain you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>THE SPIRIT OF REALITY</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Verse 17 says, "Even the Spirit of reality, whom the world cannot receive, because it does not behold Him or know Him; but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This Comforter is the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>All spiritual realities are in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we have the Holy Spirit, we have reality.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, the Comforter is also the Spirit of reality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit of reality is only related to the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It has nothing to do with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Why does the world not receive Him?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First, it is because they do not see Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When people in the world do not see something, they naturally will not receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Second, they do not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Something unknown is usually hard to be accepted also.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Lord, however, says, "But you know Him."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christians know the Holy Spirit because "He abides with you."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Even today, the Holy Spirit is constantly with the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But notice the phrase after this: "And shall be in you."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>"Shall be" points to a future time.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord was saying, "This Holy Spirit is presently with you.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But a day will come when He will get inside of you."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Let us read on to see more concerning this point.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Verse 18 says, "I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you."</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What is an orphan?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is a child left without the care of a father.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A son has all of his living, food, books, etc., provided for by the father.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The father prepares everything and does everything for him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>A fatherless child, on the other hand, must prepare everything by himself.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord is saying that He will not leave us as orphans to manage all of our spiritual affairs alone.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Instead, He will come to be our Father, to care for and look after us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>TWO PRONOUNS</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Please note the pronouns in verses 17 and 18.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Verse 17 says that "He" shall be in you, while verse 18 says that "I" am coming to you.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>What is the relationship between the He in verse 17 and the I in verse 18?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do they qualify as two persons or one?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is best for us to read the two verses again to find out who the "He" and the "I" are in verses 17 and 18.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If I were to tell you something like this, "A man just stopped a taxi by the city hall.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He paid five dollars and had the driver bring him here.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When I arrived, I ran in and saw all of you sitting here, and I began to preach."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Please tell me what would be the relationship between that man and me?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Of course, that man is I and I am that man.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>It is just a different way of mentioning the same person.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Likewise the "I" in verse 18 is the same one as the "He" in verse 17.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The meaning of this passage is clear; the Lord will ask the Father, and the Father will send a Comforter to your midst.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This Comforter, who is the Holy Spirit, is just the Christ that will dwell inside of you.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In this way the disciples will no longer remain orphans.</S>
