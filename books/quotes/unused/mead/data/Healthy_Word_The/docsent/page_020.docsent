   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE IMPERATIVE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A particular characteristic of the two Epistles to Timothy is that they contain many imperative words.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>One such word is 2 Timothy 2:1, which says, You therefore, my child, be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This word was written because the church was in degradation, and Satan was telling the children of God, You cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the past some among us have said that we should be liberated from any legalities or standards because we cannot change what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, the Bible says, Be transformed Rom 12:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We should not remain in a low condition.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We need to be empowered in the grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His grace is sufficient 2 Cor 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Flee Youthful Lusts</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second Timothy 2:22, another imperative word, says, Flee youthful lusts, and pursue righteousness, faith, love, peace with those who call on the Lord out of a pure heart.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>First Timothy 6:11 says, You, O man of God, flee these things, and pursue righteousness, godliness, faith, love, endurance, meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible teaches the young people not to fulfill their lusts but to flee them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The young people need to flee youthful lusts and pursue righteousness and godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our standard is godliness.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The two Epistles to Timothy establish a high standard of morality and character.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Timothy was a young man.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>First Timothy 4:12 says, Let no one despise your youth, but be a pattern to the believers in word, in conduct, in love, in faith, in purity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Paul exhorted Timothy to be an example.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Purity is a high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The young people should pursue to be pure in everything, including their thinking, their word, what they look at, their attitude, their motive, their heart, their emotion, and their will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The words flee, refuse, and avoid are imperatives 1 Tim 6:11; 4:7; 2 Tim 2:23, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because the Lord lives in us, we should be not cowardly but empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The standard should be high among us.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The church should have the highest morality, character, and ethics in human society.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If the church is a group of loose people, there is no testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The New Testament says that the churches are golden lampstands Rev 1:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A lampstand is full of light, and gold signifies the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What a high standard!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to receive only the healthy word and have our concepts thoroughly washed from the germs of any unhealthy speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we read the two Epistles to Timothy to find all the imperative words, the Holy Spirit will spontaneously lead us to have a high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should not believe that we cannot make it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We can make it by the Lord s grace.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God Has Not Given Us a Spirit of Cowardice,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>but of Power and of Love and</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>of Sobermindedness</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Second Timothy 1:7 says, God has not given us a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Power here refers to our will, love refers to our emotion, and sobermindedness refers to our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God has given us a spirit that empowers our will, strengthens our love, and sobers our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is a brief yet marvelous picture of the kind of person we should be.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We should not be wishy-washy like jellyfish; rather, we should have a strong spirit with a strong will, a loving heart, and a sober mind.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are such persons, Satan can do nothing to us and will be scared away.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We need to be empowered in the grace which is in Christ Jesus and declare, God has not given me a spirit of cowardice, but of power and of love and of sobermindedness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord Be with Your Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Second Timothy 4:22, the conclusion of these two Epistles, says, The Lord be with your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Grace be with you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord with our spirit is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is in this grace that we need to be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE NATURE, GROUND, AND CONSTITUTION</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>OF THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The nature and the content of the Lord s recovery is life, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The ground, the standing, of the Lord s recovery is oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The constitution of the recovery is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Thus, the recovery is built with Christ as life upon the genuine oneness and according to the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The nature of the Lord s recovery should not change from life to a movement.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The ground of the recovery should not change from oneness to divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The constitution of the recovery should not change from truth to falsehood.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The Lord is bringing us back to life, oneness, and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord s recovery is not a work or a movement; rather, it is a testimony of life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Unlike religious Christianity, the Lord s recovery is not a matter of activities, movements, ways, organizations, or concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the Lord s recovery we have only Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Rather than a work or a movement, we should have a spontaneous testimony of life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We simply need to live Christ, grow Christ, and produce Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is our daily living and our testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord s recovery is to express Christ and bring His testimony to maturity.</S>
