The Masterpiece of the Consummated Spirit<br>of the Triune God as the Lord Spirit<br>throughout the Believers' Entire Being<br>as the New Creation by His Renewing Work</H2><P>Eventually, we believers become the masterpiece of the consummated Spirit of the Triune God as the Lord Spirit throughout our entire being as the new creation by His renewing work (2 Cor. 3:18; Titus 3:5b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>I. Accomplished in the Believers Who,<br>with Unveiled Face, Behold and Reflect<br>as a Mirror the Glory of the Lord</H2><P>Transformation is accomplished in the believers who, with unveiled face, behold and reflect as a mirror the glory of the Lord (2 Cor. 3:18a). We are like mirrors beholding and reflecting Christ. When the mirror looks at Christ, the mirror reflects Christ. Then people see Christ in us because He is expressed in us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>J. Issuing in the Glorious Image<br>of the Glorified Lord</H2><P>Our beholding and reflecting Christ eventually issues in the glorious image of the glorified Lord, as we are being transformed from one degree of His glory to another until we enter into His glory to be glorified by the bright splendor of God's glory (2 Cor. 3:18b; Heb. 2:10a; Rom. 8:30c).</P><P>Through regeneration, transformation, and glorification, we will be made absolutely the same as He is. The only thing in which we will be different from Him is His Godhead. We can never share in His Godhead. Only He is God. But we can be exactly the same as He is in His life, in His nature, in His image, in His expression, and in His attributes. In everything we will be the same as He is, but not in His Godhead. He is the unique God for people's worship. We are just His duplication, continuation, and multiplication to express Him through transformation.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_051.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_053.html">Next</a> </body></html>
