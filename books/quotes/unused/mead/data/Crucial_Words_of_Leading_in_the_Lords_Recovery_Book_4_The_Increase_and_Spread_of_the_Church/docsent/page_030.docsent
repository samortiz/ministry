   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THOSE WHO ARE ADVANCED IN TRUTH AND LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NEEDING TO FUNCTION TO SUPPLY OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we open to the Lord faithfully, the Spirit of the Lord will lead us to be a member who supplies others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even an elderly sister, who has been saved for many years and who also loves the Lord dearly, can function to supply others with grace.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We do not need to wait for the elders to give us a title in order to function.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We need to believe that the Lord s grace is with us, and we must rise up to faithfully and diligently to offer our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all love the Lord and are willing to pay the price because we have a heart; however, we need to take a further step to bear this burden faithfully.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>On the surface it is a burden, but actually, it is a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In your eyes I am laboring; actually, I am quite joyful because I see so many being saved and so many young people being trained and receiving grace.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is a joy to me.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we all function in the small groups, our small groups will ignite the city of Taipei just like a spark of fire burns through a meadow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, we should not be timid or proud.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our spirit has to rise up.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Once we rise up in spirit, we will not care for outward ways or practices that can cause us to deviate, to be opinionated, and to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We do not care for these things at all.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We desire to be fully in the spirit, to love the Lord, to love the church, to love people, and to love the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as we receive a burden in spirit, the blessing will come.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then whomever we touch will be enlivened, whomever we meet will be blessed, and whomever is in our thoughts will be waiting for us when we visit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is not a small matter when someone dreams of us coming to visit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This was the story of Paul s conversion in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Saul of Tarsus was saved, no one dared to believe that he could be saved because he had persecuted the Lord s church so severely.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then the Lord sent Ananias to seek him out, and while the Lord was conversing with Ananias, He told Ananias that Saul had seen a vision of Ananias s coming while he was praying Acts 9:10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The dream of the hospital director was a similar work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We should all be faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not say that we have no responsibility because we are not an elder or a deacon.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Every person should be in a small group.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we love the Lord and are faithful, we should begin to work in our small group.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>First, we should build up the small group by being burning and by burning others.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>After two months of mutual burning, the entire group will be in a revived condition, and even when the saints in the small group see each other in a big meeting, the meeting will be enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every member in a group must have a sense of responsibility; every person is responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, we must bear in mind that there should not be any competition or rivalry within a group.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Having Love and Patience</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We all should learn to kindle a fire in the group and also to kindle a fire in order that every brother and sister can be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Every recovered brother and sister is tender and delicate; they must be treasured.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They cannot be touched casually, or they will be damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, it is not necessary to always let them have their way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In our interaction with them, we must exercise our spirit and have love toward all.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>First Thessalonians 5:14 says, We exhort you, brothers, Admonish the disorderly, console the fainthearted, sustain the weak, be long-suffering toward all.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The most touching part of this verse is being long-suffering toward all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When we are with the brothers, we often are quite lacking in patience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Even I need to learn this lesson because it is hard for me when I see the trainees being so sloppy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes, when I look at their shoes, it seems as if they have not been polished for two or three years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 1953, when I set up the first formal training here, I trained the brothers to polish their shoes.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I spoke a strong word to the trainees, telling them, If your shoes are not well polished, do not expect your work to be carried out in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The brothers and sisters who were being trained at that time are now fifty to sixty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They remember the detailed aspects of our training.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I often went into their rooms at irregular times and touched their desks or nightstands with my fingers to see if they were dusty; this was part of our training.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not despise these things.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If our shoes are not well polished, should we expect to be able to properly recover a brother?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Putting Emphasis on Personality and Character</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>and Needing to Be Diligent and Faithful</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 1965 I brought an American brother to the Philippines.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He had been a traveling evangelist with some renown before turning to our way.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I took him with me to the Philippines because the door to the gospel was quite open there.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The saints offered him warm hospitality, putting him in the best room.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, even though he was quite good in preaching the gospel, the character in his living was rather disturbing to others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The brothers who gave him hospitality told me that he made a mess of the house where he stayed; this greatly detracted from the gospel he preached.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>His gospel preaching was like someone building a house twenty feet high but then tearing it down by ten feet.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although he was a competent speaker and very eloquent, he did not have much fruit in his work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thus, having much knowledge and great ability does not necessarily mean success.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Success depends not only on knowledge and ability but also on character and personality.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We need to be diligent and faithful.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we are proper in personality, character, diligence, and faithfulness, we will have success even if we are slightly lacking in knowledge and ability.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We all must bear responsibility in the small group before the Lord and learn to be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When we take care of a brother, he may not be helped immediately or even want to receive our help.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should never let this be a source of hurt for us or a point of blame toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If we have a quick disposition, desiring quick results, we need the Lord s mercy so that we will be persistent in our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even if the brothers and sisters we are caring for do not meet our expectations, being anxious concerning them will be of no benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In fact, the more anxious we are, the further they will seem to be from our expectations.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We need patience.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Patience in a small group is essential because it is not easy for someone to become instantaneously burning.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When this is the case, we should not murmur or be disappointed.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We have to be long-suffering and patient with endurance.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Even if a person has not become burning after six months, we need to continue to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should never say, Forget it!</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I will let him go; I do not care any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Of course, we also should not be stubborn, pressing him to be burning when it is obvious that he is not open to be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We need wisdom with regard to our time, neither abandoning him nor being anxious about him.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>If he is slow to begin to be burning, we should let him be slow for a period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the meantime, we can fan others into flame.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>After fanning others for a period of time, he may become burning as soon as we focus on him again.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We should bring these matters to our fellowship with the Lord so that we can gain a proper sense of His burden and timing.</S>
