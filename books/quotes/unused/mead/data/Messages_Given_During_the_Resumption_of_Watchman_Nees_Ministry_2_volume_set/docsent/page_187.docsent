   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HANDING OVER OURSELVES BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE FIRST CONDITION FOR SERVICE IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If I do not hand myself over, but instead I study and pursue after spirituality by myself, I will end up in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first condition for serving in the coordination of the Body is to hand ourselves over.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should hand over ourselves to God, and we should hand over ourselves to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>ONLY BY HANDING OVER OURSELVES</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>WILL THERE BE THE PRACTICAL SERVICE</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Here is a brother from Tsingtao.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I have known him for eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Perhaps he has helped the brothers and sisters, and he has offered money and provided hospitality for others.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But can these services be counted as service according to the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot replace gold with brass.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>How can we gain the practical experiences in our service?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I say that God's way today is to hand over ourselves, to offer up everything, to throw it away and to drop it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to empty out everything in our pockets and put it all in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When Brother Chiu handed over himself, he discovered that there was a "tail" behind.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How strong is that something that is holding onto his "tail."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Brother Chang's testimony shows us that as soon as he was saved, he wanted to serve the Lord in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But my concern is this: It is one thing to have a heart to serve the Lord; it is another thing to be willing to hand over everything.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Have we handed everything over to the church?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we have not, what should we do?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We all know that we should hand over ourselves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But practically speaking, have we handed ourselves over?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some brothers forgot the question of their living when they handed over themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later they asked the responsible brothers, "What should we do about our living?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What should we do about the children's education?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When I heard that, I laughed within myself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You have too many worries.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>O men of little faith, if you can be concerned for yourself, will God not be concerned about you also?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you think that all the responsible brothers in the church are cruel people?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Will the Body not love its own members?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>PRINCIPLES IN OUR PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the history of the church, many brothers and sisters have consecrated everything to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But today we have received God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Not only do we have the light; we are clear also as to the way to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the past, the persons may have been right, but the methods were wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For six years, I have been pondering over this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I feel that here are two principles.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The first is on the spiritual side, and the second is on the practical side.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>A. On the Spiritual Side 1.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>On the One Hand,</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Accepting All The Offerings of the Saints 2.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>On the Other Hand, Making Arrangements</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>according to the Amount of Grace Each Receives</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If you have less grace, the church will make fewer arrangements for you.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But if you have more grace, the church should make more arrangements for you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If a newly saved believer offers up everything, the church should mark his condition and should accept all his offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The church should say to such a one that the church has accepted one hundred percent of what he has offered up.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, soon after that, the church should return to him ninety percent of what he has offered up and should only take ten percent.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Later, when this brother is strengthened in grace and grows in life, the Lord will provide other measures to take care of him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I know of a newly saved brother who was not very strong in grace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church only took ten percent of what he offered.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is like a child giving things to the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The mother only takes ten percent of what the child offers and returns the other ninety percent back to the child.</S>
