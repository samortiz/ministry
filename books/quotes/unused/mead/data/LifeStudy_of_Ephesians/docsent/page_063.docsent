   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. In the Heavenlies</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 6 says that we have been seated together in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The third step of God s salvation in life is to seat us together in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He not only raised us up from the position of death, but also seated us in the highest place in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The heavenlies are the high position into which we have been saved in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the book of Romans, Christ as our righteousness has brought us into such a state that we may be acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the book of Ephesians, Christ as our life has saved us into such a position that we may be above all God s enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The church people today are in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The word heavenlies is rather peculiar.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It refers not only to a place, but also to an atmosphere with a certain nature and characteristic.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s salvation by life has brought us into a heavenly place and into a heavenly atmosphere with a heavenly characteristic.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we meet together, we often have the deep sense that we are not in an earthly atmosphere, but in a heavenly atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, if you go to a theater or some other worldly place, you will have the sense that you are immersed in an earthly atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because we are in a heavenly atmosphere with a heavenly nature and a heavenly characteristic, we are a heavenly people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s salvation has transferred us into such a realm and atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>B. In Christ Jesus</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It was in Christ that God seated us all together, once for all, in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was accomplished when Christ ascended to the heavens, and it was applied to us by the Spirit of Christ when we believed in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today we realize and experience this reality in our spirit through faith in the accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Both Romans and Ephesians indicate that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Romans, however, to be transferred from Adam into Christ is primarily a matter of being placed into a justified position.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, in Ephesians to be in Christ is not only a matter of a heavenly position, but, even more important, a matter of life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because we are in Christ, we have the vitality of life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Romans Christ is the righteousness of God, but in Ephesians Christ is life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, according to Romans, to be in Christ means to be in a justified position; but according to Ephesians, to be in Christ means to have the vitality of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE SURPASSING RICHES</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>OF GOD S GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 7 says, That He might display in the ages which are coming the surpassing riches of His grace in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church is produced in the present age; the ages which are coming are the ages of the millennium and eternity future.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>To display the riches of God s grace is to exhibit them to the whole universe publicly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The riches of God s grace surpass every limit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>These are the riches of God Himself for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They will be publicly displayed for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Verse 7 says that the surpassing riches of God s grace are in kindness toward us in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Kindness is a benevolent goodness which issues out of mercy and love.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is in such kindness that the grace of God is given to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>VII.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>BY GRACE</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 8 says, For by grace you have been saved through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word for at the beginning of this verse gives the occasion for God to display His grace v. 7 . Because we have been saved by His grace, God may display it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In Ephesians grace denotes God dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Therefore, to be saved by grace means to be saved by having God dispensed into us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Most Christians regard grace as a thing, not as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>To them, grace is merely a gift freely given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to this concept of grace, we were sinners who did not deserve God s salvation, but God saved us freely by giving us His unmerited favor.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This, however, is a superficial understanding of what it means to be saved by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>John 1:17 says that grace came through Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This indicates that grace is somewhat like a person.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Ephesians reveals that the saving grace is God Himself in Christ wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have emphasized that the governing concept in Ephesians 1 is the dispensing of the Triune God into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Therefore, to be saved by grace means to be saved by the dispensing of the Triune God into us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many Christians consider salvation as merely being rescued from a pitiful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>According to this understanding, to be saved by grace is to have the Savior, who is rich in mercy, reach down to us in our low estate and rescue us.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But this is not the salvation revealed in Ephesians.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to Ephesians, salvation is the transmission of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When this Person comes into us as grace, we are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once we receive such a divine transmission, we are made alive, raised up, and seated with Christ in the heavenlies.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, in Ephesians grace is the saving Person of Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Hallelujah for such a salvation!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is a deeper understanding of salvation by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It was not a simple matter for God to be transmitted into us as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He had to be processed through incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>By being processed in this way, He is now able to transmit Himself into us.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When the processed God is transmitted into us, He becomes the saving grace.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This grace is not only the amazing grace; it is the abounding grace.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Grace is the processed God transmitted into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Do not regard this as a mere human interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you read Ephesians 1 and 2 with much prayer, you will see that God processed and transmitted into our being is the saving grace and the abounding grace.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have been saved by the transmission of this processed God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As we have indicated, this grace has surpassing riches.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It has many aspects, virtues, and attributes, such as life, light, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Apart from life, light, and power, God cannot save us.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>For example, how can you rescue a person who has fallen into a pit if you do not have the strength to lift him out?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Furthermore, if you do not have love for him, you will not bother to save him.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In order to save us, God needed love and wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>These are some of the surpassing riches of God s saving grace.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In His kindness toward us in Christ Jesus, God has saved us by His grace.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the ages to come in the millennium and eternity future God will display this grace publicly to the whole universe.</S>
