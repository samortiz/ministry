   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>From the time of creation God has always been going on.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>He has a plan, and with this plan He has an aim, a goal.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to reach this goal He has to go on and on.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>With every step of the Lord's going on, there is always something new.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>With people like Adam, Abel, Noah, Abraham, Moses, and David there was always a new step of the Lord's going on.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is hard for God to go on with older ones because they tend to be set, settled, and occupied.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is much easier for God to do something revolutionary with young people, to turn the age from one direction to another direction.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do you think that God is satisfied with the present situation of Christianity?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Do you not think that the present religious system is something too old?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do you not believe that God is waiting for a chance to do something new, to have a change, to have a transfer, to have a turn in the age?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The record of the Scriptures shows us many changes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There was a change in history with Noah, with Abraham, with Moses, with David, and with Isaiah.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then there was a great change, a great turn with John the Baptist.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Finally the greatest turn, the greatest change, in the history of mankind was brought in by a young man named Jesus when He was thirty years old.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then the Lord proceeded to go on further in His heavenly ministry with the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Throughout the history of the church we can see how the Lord raised up young men to turn the age.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Lord raised up Martin Luther during the reformation to bring mankind out of the dark ages.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was a transfer in the age.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is always doing something new.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He is always going on.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Generally speaking, God does not impart something new through the aged persons, but always through young persons.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Martin Luther was young when he was called and dealt with by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Zinzendorf was a young man when he was caught by the Lord as was John Nelson Darby, the leader of the Brethren assemblies.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>John Wesley, Charles Wesley, and George Whitefield were also young men when they were called by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Missionaries that the Lord used in church history to gospelize the world, such as Hudson Taylor, William Carey, and David Livingstone, were called by the Lord when they were young.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is hard to find a case from the Scriptures or from church history where God called an older person to do something for Him in a new way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is because every piece of God's work is something new.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God is always going on, so He always needs a new start with a new nature in a new way and for a new age.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Man is so central in God's plan, yet man must be used by God while he is still young.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When you become old, the time for God's calling, the time for God's use, mostly is over.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I do not mean that the time for God's salvation is over.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Many older persons have been saved by God, but the time for God's use is mostly over.</S>
