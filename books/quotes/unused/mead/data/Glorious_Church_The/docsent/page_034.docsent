   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When the Pharisees asked when the kingdom of God would come, the Lord Jesus answered, "The kingdom of God does not come with observation; nor will they say, Behold, here it is! or, There!</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For behold, the kingdom of God is in the midst of you" Luke 17:20-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What did the Lord mean when He said that "the kingdom of God is in the midst of you"?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He meant, "I am standing here."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Of course, we all know that the kingdom of God could not be within the Pharisees.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>On that day the kingdom of God was in their midst because the Lord Jesus stood in their midst.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When He was there, Satan could not be there.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord Jesus said, "The ruler of the world is coming, and in Me he has nothing" John 14:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Wherever the Lord Jesus is, Satan must depart.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Luke 4 there was a man possessed by a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>How did the demon react when he saw the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Before the Lord said anything to cast him out, the demon cried out, "Ah!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What do we have to do with You, Jesus, Nazarene?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Have You come to destroy us?" v. 34 . Where the Lord is, the demons cannot be there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The very presence of the Lord Jesus represents the kingdom of God, and He is the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Where He is, the kingdom of God is also.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What does this have to do with us?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Revelation 1:5-6 says, "To Him who loves us and has released us from our sins by His blood and made us a kingdom, priests to His God and Father, to Him be the glory and the might forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Notice the word "kingdom" in verse 6.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This shows us that not only where the Lord Jesus is, but also where the church is, the kingdom of God is.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Not only does the Lord Jesus Himself represent the kingdom of God, the church also represents the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The important point here is not a matter of future reward or position in the kingdom, whether large or small, high or low.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The concern is not with these things.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The vital matter is that God wants the church to represent His kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The work of the church on earth is to bring in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All the work of the church is governed by the principle of the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The saving of souls is under this principle, and so is the casting out of demons and all other works as well.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Everything should be under the principle of God's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why should we win souls?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For the sake of the kingdom of God not just because man needs salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We must stand on the position of the kingdom of God whenever we work, and we must apply the kingdom of God to deal with the power of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord wants us to pray, "Our Father who is in the heavens, Your name be sanctified; Your kingdom come; Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth" Matt 6:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the coming of the kingdom of God was automatic, the Lord would never have taught us to pray in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But since the Lord asked us to pray in this way, He simply showed us that this is the work of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yes, the church should preach the gospel, but much more, the church should pray to bring in the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Some people think that whether or not we pray, the kingdom of God will come automatically.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But if we know God, we will never say this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The principle of God's work is to wait for His people to move.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then He will move.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>God told Abraham that the people of Israel would come out from the nation which afflicted them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, this was not accomplished until four hundred thirty years later.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the Israelites cried unto God, He heard their cry and came to deliver them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Never presume that whether or not we cry things will happen in their own way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God needs man to cooperate with Him in His work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When God's people move, He will also move.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When God's people saw that they should leave Egypt though not all the Israelites realized this, yet some did , they cried to God, and He moved to deliver them.</S>
