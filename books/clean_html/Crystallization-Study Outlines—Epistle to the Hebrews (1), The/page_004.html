<li>Hebrews 2 reveals the Man Jesus, the Man-God, for the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s purpose:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>God ordained the man in creation to express Him in His image and to represent Him with His dominion (Gen. 1:26-28), but the man in creation failed God in His purpose.</li>

	<li>The second man, the Lord Jesus, who has recovered man&rsquo;s lost ordination and has fulfilled God&rsquo;s original purpose, is presented to us in Hebrews 2:

		<li>After He had accomplished redemption by suffering death, Jesus was glorified in His resurrection (Luke 24:26), and in His ascension, in His humanity, He was crowned with glory and honor&mdash;Heb. 2:9b:
