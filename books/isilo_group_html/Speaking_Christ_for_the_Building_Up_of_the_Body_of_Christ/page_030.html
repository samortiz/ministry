<p><em>Question: What is the difference between overlapping someone&rsquo;s speaking and emphasizing a certain point?</em></p>
<p>Regardless of how much you would emphasize any point, you should not speak it by overlapping others&rsquo; speaking. You must wait until others finish their speaking. Then you may utter something. It is not good to have two speakings overlapping each other.</p>
<p><em>Question: If something is spoken that is incorrect according to the truth, should we let it go or should we correct the speaker in the meeting?</em></p>
<p>Errors in the truth are in degrees. If the error is to a serious degree, such as denying the deity of the Lord Jesus, it must be adjusted immediately in the meeting for it concerns our basic faith. On the other hand, a mistake in numbers, such as saying that the Lord fed five thousand in Matthew 15 rather than four thousand, should be let go. To correct people in the meeting is not pleasant. You should avoid doing this unless the mistake is serious and concerns basic truths. If the mistake is serious and concerns basic truths, we should correct the error immediately in order to let people know what our faith is.</p>
<p>In other cases in which an error is made in a person&rsquo;s testimony, the correction should not be made immediately after the testimony. If you do this, that person may be offended. You may feel to correct the person, but many others may feel that it is better not to correct him. We all have to exercise our love. To stop a speaker who makes errors may not only offend him but may offend the other saints as well. It is better to wait until another meeting. In another meeting you may give a little message telling the saints to learn how to follow the trend in the meeting. Give them some illustrations and examples. That will spontaneously correct and change the way of meeting.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_029.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_031.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Speaking Christ for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 30</div><br></body></html>
