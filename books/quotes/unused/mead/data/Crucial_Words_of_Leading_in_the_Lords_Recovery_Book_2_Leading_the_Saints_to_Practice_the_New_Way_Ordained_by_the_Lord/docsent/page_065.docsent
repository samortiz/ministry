   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE PRINCIPLE OF DISCUSSING MATTERS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE ELDERS MEETING Scripture Reading: Exo 28:29-30; Acts 15:6-22, 28-29</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the church life the principle of discussing matters in the elders meeting is of great importance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is an assembly of many persons; if we think that the discussion of matters in the elders meeting is the same as the discussion of official business in the world, this view is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible contains no such thought, and strictly speaking, it does not allow us to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to the record in Acts 14:23, once the church came into being, elders were appointed in the churches locality by locality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The designation elders is derived from the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not a new term in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Genesis the record is mostly of individuals, not of a congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This record extends from Adam until Jacob, including Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not until Exodus that the congregation of Israel appears.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This congregation consisted of the descendants of Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, in Exodus there is a congregation including a group of elders cf.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>4:29; 12:21; 19:7; 24:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The appointment of elders is based on the outward manifestation of their actual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, elders in a clan are determined by age and conduct, that is, by the manifestation of the maturity of the clan members.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No doubt, Moses appointed the elders of Israel based upon their age and conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When Moses ascended Mount Sinai to draw near to God, he brought with him seventy elders vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>1, 9 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Old Testament, before there were kings among the children of God, the elders were the rulers and administrators; nevertheless, if the elders wanted to understand God s intention toward His people, they needed the help of the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the Old Testament the elders were a group of older ones who were responsible for the administration and management of practical affairs, and the priests were a group of people who drew near to God to seek God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Old Testament the Levites served God by bearing the responsibility of slaughtering cattle for the offerings, and the priests lit the lamps and burned the incense.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In addition, the priests bore a great and important commission to teach the children of Israel concerning the law in the Old Testament and to let them know all the words written by God in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although God s written word is extensive, it could not cover every matter.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In addition to the written word, there was a need for another item, that is, the breastplate, which the high priest wore when he came near to God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Bible calls this item the breastplate of judgment Exo 28:29-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Every time a question or problem arose among God s people that the priests could not answer based on the law of the Old Testament, the high priest was needed to bear the breastplate of judgment before God to receive a direct revelation from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the Old Testament the administration of God among His people was neither a democracy nor an autocracy but a theocracy; that is, God ruled His people directly.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God led and governed His people by His written word and by instant instruction transmitted through the breastplate of judgment worn by the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, two categories of people carried out this government: the elders and the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The elders carried out God s administration, and the priests received instructions from God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If there had been only elders but not priests, there would have been only administrative personnel without a channel, or means, to receive divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The priests were the channel and means through which divine revelation was received.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the New Testament God still desires to administrate His children through the elders, and they must be assisted by the priests.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the New Testament all Christians, those who have been saved and regenerated, are priests 1 Pet 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, the elders appointed from among the believers are also priests.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the age of the Old Testament the elders and priests were two separate groups of people, but in the New Testament age elders and priests are the same group of people.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the one hand, they rule the children of God; on the other hand, they seek God s instructions.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the New Testament age every one of us has a Bible in our hands through which we can search and know God s intention.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, the written word is not written so completely that there is no need for the instant revelation of the Holy Spirit, typified by the breastplate of judgment in the Old Testament.</S>
