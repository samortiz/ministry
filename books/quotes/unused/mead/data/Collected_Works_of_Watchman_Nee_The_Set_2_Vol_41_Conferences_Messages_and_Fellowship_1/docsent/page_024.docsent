   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Asking God to Grant Us the Power to Overcome</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Another group of people know that they have received a new life, new standards, and new demands and aspirations.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They know that they are weak and prone to defeat and failure.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They think that they should ask God to grant them strength and help them to overcome sin.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They think that they should ask God to empower them for their new living.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They think that God will grant them the necessary strength if they pray enough.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They think that once God hears their prayer, they will overcome many sins and be able to do good and live out God's requirements.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These Christians know that it is wrong to make resolutions, and they know that they cannot do anything by their own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, they pray for God to give them the strength.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Even though they cannot make it by their own strength, they think that they can surely make it if they have God's strength.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As a result they beseech God, pray, and even fast.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They shut themselves up behind closed doors to pray to the Lord, or they leave the secular world behind to pray on the mountains or by the sea.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They think that God will answer their prayers if they are earnest enough.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The amazing thing is that even though God seems to answer other prayers, He never answers their prayer for victory over sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They are surprised that their sin can torment them to the extent that they become totally defeated in its face.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They think that they are not desperate enough; consequently, they pray day and night, asking God to grant them the power to overcome their sin.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When they lock themselves up in their rooms, they are kept from their sins, and they think that they have overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But as soon as they finish praying and walk out of their rooms, temptations and Satan are waiting outside the door, and they fail again.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Tonight I will not ask if you have prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I will only ask one penetrating question: How many of you have overcome sin through praying for God's help?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may have prayed for God to make you a strong Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may have prayed for Him to give you strength and help.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God may answer your prayer and make you strong, but you still cannot overcome your sin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is an amazing fact.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God never helps you overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He never helps you stop yourself from sinning.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Asking God for Virtues</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After many failures, some Christians become aware of the sins they frequently commit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They know why they fail.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I am afraid many of you have not yet realized your habitual sins.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Some are better and know their habitual sins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Some realize that they are too quick and excessive in their speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Some realize that their thoughts are unclean and unpresentable before men.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some realize that they are too blunt; they know that they hurt others all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They know that they are not meek.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Some realize that they have a bad temper, and some realize that they are proud.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Many people realize their habitual sins and then pursue the virtues that are the opposite of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For example, those who are proud seek humility.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who are jealous seek to be lowly.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who have a bad temper seek patience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Those who have unclean thoughts seek to have a clean heart.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Whatever sins they have, they seek virtues that are opposite of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>While one is seeking patience, he may think that he is not all that bad.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He thinks that he only has a little shortcoming in his conduct; he only needs a little patience.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He prays for God to send a package of patience from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The amazing thing is that this patience never comes.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>No matter how hard he tries, patience never comes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He tells the Lord that he lacks a certain virtue and that he aspires to have it from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But no matter how hard he prays, the Lord will not give it to him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>GOD'S WAY OF SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>My burden is not to speak about the wrong concepts of Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I have mentioned only these three, but other concepts are similar in principle.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>My purpose for bringing them up is to show that they are dead ends for a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>They are not the biblical way.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God has no intention for a Christian to live this way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If we live according to these principles, we will fail all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God has given us a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This new life brings us not only new knowledge and new desires, but also new energy and new strength to meet the new desires and new demands.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The new desires and new demands come from the new life, just as the new source of supply to meet these new desires and new demands also comes from this new life.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When we were regenerated, we not only received new desires and new knowledge, which aspire to overcome our lusts and our sins, but we also received new power to meet the demands of this new life.</S>
