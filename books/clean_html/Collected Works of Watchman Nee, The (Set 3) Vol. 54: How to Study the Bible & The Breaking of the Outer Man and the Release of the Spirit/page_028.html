<p>"And Jacob lived in the land of Egypt seventeen years: so the whole age of Jacob was a hundred forty and seven years. And the time drew nigh that Israel must die" (47:28-29). We should notice that at his birth he was called Jacob but at his death he was called Israel. "And he called his son Joseph, and said unto him, If now I have found grace in thy sight, put, I pray thee, thy hand under my thigh, and deal kindly and truly with me; bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt: but I will lie with my fathers, and thou shalt carry me out of Egypt, and bury me in their buryingplace. And he said, I will do as thou hast said. And he said, Swear unto me. And he sware unto him. And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head" (vv. 29-31). What a beautiful picture this is! We have to touch the spirit here. Here was a man who by nature was cunning and hard, who would do everything to satisfy himself and would ask for nothing less than the best. Yet on that day he said to his own son, "If now I have found grace in thy sight." What tenderness! "I pray thee...deal kindly and truly with me." He asked for kindness and truthfulness. "Bury me not, I pray thee, in Egypt." God's place for him was Canaan. His promise could not be fulfilled in Egypt. Under God's sovereignty he was about to die. Yet he asked for kindness and truthfulness that he would be buried in God's promised land. Jacob was not doubting God's promise. On the contrary, he asked Joseph to swear because he believed in God. He wanted Joseph to see the solemnity of the matter. Unless we touch his spirit, we will not understand what he was doing. "And Israel bowed himself upon the bed's head." What a wonderful scene!</p><p>Let us also read Genesis 48. Verses 2 through 4 say, "And one told Jacob, and said, Behold, thy son Joseph cometh unto thee: and Israel strengthened himself, and sat upon the bed. And Jacob said unto Joseph, God Almighty appeared unto me at Luz in the land of Canaan, and blessed me, and said unto me, Behold, I will make thee fruitful, and multiply thee, and I will make of thee a multitude of people; and will give this land to thy seed after thee for an everlasting possession." He remembered God's promises to him. He knew clearly that it was God's blessing that gave him seventy people in his household. God had promised that he would be fruitful and multiply and that the land of Canaan would be given to his seed.</p><p>Verse 5 says, "And now thy two sons, Ephraim and Manasseh, which were born unto thee in the land of Egypt before I came unto thee into Egypt, are mine; as Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine." He placed Joseph's two sons under God's promise. "As Reuben and Simeon, they shall be mine." He accepted Joseph's two sons as his own sons. At his old age, Jacob was clear about everything.</p><p>Verse 7 says, "And as for me, when I came from Padan, Rachel died by me in the land of Canaan in the way." This incident touched him deeply. He still remembered it at his deathbed. How tender, mature, and sweet is a man who has passed through God's chastisement! How rich was his deposit! The conniving Jacob had been changed; he became an entirely different man.</p><p>Verses 8 through 10 say, "And Israel beheld Joseph's sons, and said, Who are these? And Joseph said unto his father, They are my sons, whom God hath given me in this place. And he said, Bring them, I pray thee, unto me, and I will bless them. Now the eyes of Israel were dim for age, so that he could not see. And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them." When Isaac was old, his eyes were poor, and he was deceived. When Jacob was old, his eyes were also poor, but his inward eyes were very clear. Unlike Isaac in his old age, who was greedy for venison, Jacob was ready to bless. "And he brought them near unto him; and he kissed them, and embraced them." Here we sense the overflow of compassion of an old man.</p><p>Verse 11 says, "And Israel said unto Joseph, I had not thought to see thy face: and, lo, God hath showed me also thy seed." Here we find again a spirit stricken by God.</p><p>Verses 12 through 14 say, "And Joseph brought them out from between his knees, and he bowed himself with his face to the earth. And Joseph took them both, Ephraim in his right hand toward Israel's left hand, and Manasseh in his left hand toward Israel's right hand, and brought them near unto him. And Israel stretched out his right hand, and laid it upon Ephraim's head, who was the younger, and his left hand upon Manasseh's head, guiding his hands wittingly; for Manasseh was the firstborn."</p><p>Verses 17 through 19 say, "And when Joseph saw that his father laid his right hand upon the head of Ephraim, it displeased him....And Joseph said unto his father, Not so, my father: for this is the firstborn; put thy right hand upon his head. And his father refused, and said, I know it, my son, I know it." Although Jacob's eyes were dim, his inward being was not dim. He knew what God wanted him to do. "He also shall become a people, and he also shall be great: but truly his younger brother shall be greater than he, and his seed shall become a multitude of nations." We should remember that Isaac was muddled in his blessing but Jacob was very clear in his blessing.</p>
