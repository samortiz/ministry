[1]  The words in the Bible concerning the requirements for an elder are quite clear.
[2]  There are two things which I wish to point out to the brothers and sisters.
[3]  An elder should be a person who has spiritual value, who knows spiritual things, who has spiritual understanding, who knows the way in spiritual things, and whose spiritual course is clear.
[4]  An elder needs to have considerable experience concerning spiritual things and to know before God what the spiritual condition of other children of God is; then he can take care of the church.
[5]  In addition, they need God-given abilities and gifts so that they can take care of the affairs of the church and administrate them.
[6]  I hope that you will not select an elder for the church who only knows how to handle practical affairs and how to direct things and yet has no spiritual understanding before God.
[7]  I know that many localities have problems, and the failure is altogether related to selecting those who are famous in the world, who have position, who know how to handle practical affairs, who have ability, and who are experienced in the ways of the world to be elders in the church.
[8]  If he goes to work in a hospital, at the most you can ask him to handle practical affairs, but you cannot ask him to be the chief physician.
[9]  In every locality all the responsible brothers those who are elders and overseers should have an overseers meeting every week.
[10]  This is the time for the responsible brothers to pray together and to receive the brothers and sisters.
[11]  I know of a certain church not in China where the responsible brothers decided to meet for a whole day once a week.
[12]  After those brothers leave, tell the elders why you answered in that way, why you said it in those words, what scriptural basis you have, and what feeling you have.
[13]  When you go out, you may lead many to be saved and bring them into service, yet if you cannot produce a few reliable brothers to bear the responsibility of the church, your going out will be a total failure.
[14]  The regular meeting of the responsible brothers is a very important item of their training.
[15]  If you go to a place and live for three months those who travel often for the work need to pay special attention to this , you need to arrange a time to gather all the responsible brothers together, perhaps on Friday or Saturday for an entire day or half a day, to help them take care of the affairs of the church.
[16]  Let the brothers and sisters know that this is the time the responsible brothers are dealing with things before God, and no one should come in. They can knock on the door only if the house is on fire and only when the fire has burned to the floor; even then they still should not come too early.
[17]  Therefore, brothers, when you go out to work, if you cannot reach the last step, the final step of causing all the brothers and sisters to rise up to serve God and bear responsibility in church affairs, you have totally failed, because that is not the church.
[18]  OF THE LOCAL CHURCH First Helping Them Learn to Bear Responsibility
[19]  Certain brothers asked: If we appoint some brothers to be the responsible ones of a local church, there is still some question concerning whether or not they are fit to be elders.
[20]  But if we do not appoint them, the church is paralyzed.
[21]  Answer: You can ask the few brothers whom you feel are promising and let them first learn to bear responsibility.
[22]  Whether or not we have the assurance, we should tell them, Come, and I will help you, the more promising brothers, learn how to take care of the affairs of the church.
[23]  For example, if you are in Peking and you see that there are three very good brothers in Sui-Yuan and another two very good brothers in T ai-yuan, you can invite them to come to Peking.
[24]  He should learn to observe how you manage spiritual things before God, how problems are solved, how questions are raised and discussed, how prayers are offered, how to sense before God whether or not a certain thing should be done, and how to make a decision when peace is obtained.
[25]  Then show him how to answer the questions the brothers and sisters bring, how you fellowship with brothers from out of town, how you receive those who ask to participate in the breaking of bread, and how you fellowship with those who want to be baptized.
[26]  When you come into this meeting, you should say, We are handling things before God and should not have a loose attitude.
[27]  If there is any responsible brother who comes to the meeting of the overseers and does not give his opinion in the meeting, but gives it in front of the brothers and sisters, you should rebuke him before the brothers in the next meeting: You are not qualified to be a responsible brother!
[28]  If you have a feeling or something to say, you should bring it up in the meeting of the overseers when all the brothers are together.
[29]  I hope that the responsible brothers in all the localities know that if any brother goes out of the meeting of the overseers and speaks a word behind the other brothers backs, he has to bear full responsibility before God.
[30]  We must speak to him in front of all: If you have anything to bring up, you must bring it up in front of the responsible ones among the co-workers; if you bring it up behind their back to any other person, you damage the oneness of the Body.
[31]  If this meeting is strong before God, all the other meetings will spontaneously be uplifted.
[32]  If you do not prepare in your private time, when you come to the overseers meeting, you will have nothing to say; when you come each time, nothing will happen.
[33]  I believe that one day all of God s children will gradually realize that at least once a week a group of brothers go before God to deal with things on their behalf and on behalf of the whole church.
[34]  We should first establish the principle that all of God s children are priests who should serve God.
[35]  With this principle in view, let us see how we can lead all the brothers and sisters to be priests in a local church.
[36]  In other words what kind of arrangement should we have in the spiritual work so that all the believers can participate in the spiritual things, both the new believers and those who have known the Lord for many years?
[37]  We need to see which spiritual things in a local church can be taken care of by the brothers and sisters.
[38]  When we compare these two, we see a very important matter, that is, God has established a category of people in the church called evangelists; but to those who are not evangelists, the command of the apostle is that they should do the work of an evangelist.
[39]  However, if you are not established by God as an evangelist, the Lord s word is that all of God s children should do the work of an evangelist.
[40]  When you take care of a sinner, you have to find a way to bring him to the gospel meeting.
[41]  If you bring too many, then you will not be able to take care of them.
[42]  But when you do, you need to immediately ask the responsible brothers to help you find some brothers or sisters who can share the responsibility of taking care of them.
[43]  Whenever we preach the gospel, we must always draw the net.
[44]  When the preaching is over and the one at the podium begins to draw the net by exhorting people to raise their hands to indicate their willingness to receive the gospel, you need to help in this work.
[45]  On the one hand, you need to pray, and on the other hand, you need to be quite strong to persuade them, saying, I think you should stand up to receive the Lord due to your sin.
[46]  Another matter presents a very difficult problem when attending a gospel meeting.
[47]  Before the meeting starts, we see five or ten rows of people just sitting there.
[48]  Caring for New Believers The Meeting for Edifying New Believers
[49]  After a person has believed, is baptized, and becomes a new believer, we should bring him to our prearranged meeting for edifying new believers.
[50]  In this meeting we will have a special topic for them to get into every week.
[51]  The way we are taking today is absolutely different from our way in the past.
[52]  Today the workers should not do the work, but the workers should cause others to do the work.
[53]  I say again that if you go out to work and only you yourselves are working, you have failed.
[54]  You need to learn to work, and you also need to learn to be a master builder who leads other brothers and sisters to work.
[55]  In the church, when brothers encounter problems, or if some special situations arise, you need to allow these brothers and sisters to make some arrangements concerning these problems among the saints.
[56]  The last item related to spiritual affairs is the care for the brothers and sisters who have moved away and for the brothers and sisters who have come from other places.
[57]  I hope that when there is a brother or a sister who moves away from your locality, there would be a number of brothers who would do two things with them.
[58]  Therefore, on the one hand, there is the need among us for several brothers to correspond with him; on the other hand, some brothers need to be responsible to record the words spoken in the meetings, whether they are words spoken to believers or words of the gospel, and send them to that brother at least once a month.
[59]  My thought is that in the future, regarding the brothers who move away, letters of recommendation can never be the final thing.
[60]  As the church, after one or two months, we should write a letter to the church where the brother is.
[61]  If they have never helped him, you can write letters exhorting them that in the future they need to help the brothers who move from other places and that they should pay attention to this matter.
[62]  We need to preach the gospel, we need to care for the gospel, we need to care for the new believers, we need to care for problems, we need to care for those who are absent from the meetings, and we need to care for those who come from other places.
[63]  We do not need to say much concerning the service of the Levites, because it is a very simple matter.
[64]  You have to be clear before God about this principle that all the brothers and sisters must have spiritual service as well as practical service.
[65]  Brothers, I say again that you must realize that the responsibility upon you is very great and that the things in your hands will keep you very busy.
[66]  You have to work to such an extent that you bring all the brothers to the same condition that you are in. When all the brothers come and serve together, the church in that locality will have a foundation.
[67]  In this training here on the mountain, if God really deals with our self and with our work to the extent that we go out to provide a way for all the one-talented ones to serve, for the first time the church will begin to see what brotherly love is and Philadelphia will appear.
[68]  Today the church needs not only oversight but also brotherly love.
[69]  Otherwise, if the present condition continues, we will still be hanging on to the tail of Roman Catholicism and Protestantism; we will not know what the brothers of Philadelphia are and what the authority of the church is.
[70]  Today we want to spend some time to see the situation concerning the ministers of the word in the local churches.
[71]  In the co-workers meeting in Hankow, we saw quite clearly that there was no need for a local church to maintain the Lord s Day message meeting, because this kind of meeting is not a church meeting.
[72]  The outward reason is that all the nations have a Lord s Day message meeting, and if we do not have one among us, we fear that without a message to listen to many brothers and sisters will go to other places to listen to messages.
[73]  The inward problem is that if there is not a Lord s Day message meeting, many brothers and sisters, after being Christians for ten or twenty years, will feel that this is absolutely different from their former habit as Christians.
[74]  Today I want to discuss with the brothers and sisters what we should do concerning this matter.
[75]  I believe the light is very clear now: The church is everyone being a priest.
[76]  Let us first speak concerning the supply of the word.
[77]  Then we will come back and talk about the way of the church.
[78]  Once many have been saved, there will be more trouble for the church because all kinds of people will come in. All kinds of fish will be pulled into the boat; therefore, we will need to take good care of them, providing the new believers with edification once a week.
[79]  Today there are many localities where the Saturday night meetings cannot be strong because all the brothers are passive, even though many are gifted with a ministry.
[80]  If there is no pressure on them, as with the Lord s Day meetings which force them to go before God, then every Saturday night meeting will be a time to relax.
[81]  If all the brothers relax, bearing no responsibility, how can the meeting be strong?
[82]  I am amazed that often three to five brothers are ministers of the word before God, but they think that they can open up the Saturday night meetings for other brothers to speak.
[83]  The Lord s Day Message Meeting Being a Waste
[84]  I have considered before God many times for many years, and I deeply believe that the help rendered to people by the Lord s Day morning preaching cannot match what God desires to do.
[85]  Frankly speaking, if we are not careful, the Lord s Day preaching will become a waste and a loss.
[86]  If, after two years, you send these brothers and sisters to another place or another church and ask them to listen to messages, they will not be able to sit still.
[87]  Since this is the case, you can see that the supply of the word is very important.
[88]  We need to preach the gospel, edify the new believers, and have mutual and special edifying.
[89]  Therefore, many, including the sisters, need to go out, group by group, in twos or threes, so that every locality may be able to stand on its own.
[90]  What shall we do with the locality where the center of the work is?
[91]  I believe that the local church at the center of the work also needs to have these several kinds of meetings.
[92]  Formerly, we preached the gospel once a month; now once a month we preach a message to the brothers, or if there is a strong ministry of the word, perhaps we will select one day out of the week and use it specifically for preaching a message.
[93]  In the church there are different kinds of meetings.
[94]  The local brothers should find a special time for the gospel preaching meeting, perhaps the Lord s Day morning, to gather together to preach the gospel or to go to various districts to preach the gospel.
[95]  When you have a gospel preaching meeting, as we have already mentioned, you need to bring people with you.
[96]  I remember that some brothers, when they made up lessons for others, spoke just one sentence: The message for the new believers today says that we need to read the Bible every day.
[97]  But when you go to a person s home to make up lessons, if you only speak a sentence such as, You need to read the Bible every day, I think this word is equivalent to not speaking anything, unless the Holy Spirit works in a special way.
[98]  There are two or three special matters in the prayer meeting which the brothers should pay attention to.
[99]  When you are having your personal time before God, you may stop before a sentence is fully uttered; of course, you would have to continue this sentence in the prayer meeting.
[100]  Sometimes when you are in a prayer meeting, you do not know whether a certain brother is praying for you or for God to hear.
[101]  The bread-breaking meeting is already quite clear among us, but we must always tell the brothers in various localities to take note that the bread-breaking meeting is the real worship service, the real worship.
[102]  In this meeting we need to see that the first section is always toward the Lord and the second section toward God.
[103]  Many times you may feel that before God the brothers have already reached the climax of their feelings toward the Lord, yet they have not broken the bread.
[104]  CHAPTER SIX THE AFFAIRS OF THE SERVICE OFFICE Scripture Reading: And they sold their properties and possessions and divided them to all, as anyone had need Acts 2:45 .
[105]  For neither was anyone among them in need; for as many as were owners of lands or of houses sold them and brought the proceeds of the things which were sold and placed them at the feet of the apostles; and it was distributed to each, as anyone had need Acts 4:34-35 .
[106]  Today we want to come to the sixth matter, that is, the affairs of the service office the church business office or work office.
[107]  It is also sufficiently clear how the church is organized and how the church is local and has brothers, deacons, and elders.
[108]  LEARNING IN TWO ASPECTS The Need to Arrange Practical Affairs
[109]  Therefore, today I want the brothers to learn something here, because there is a basic principle.
[110]  There may be brothers among us who misunderstand to the point that they think that practical affairs need no arrangements.
[111]  However, today we cannot go to the other extreme.
[112]  Many people do so, thinking that there is absolutely no method in the church.
[113]  The principle of a record book is here, but as to the way of setting up this record book, you and I need to pray: Lord, we know that in the early church there was a record book, but we do not know how to set it up.
[114]  We need it because man s memory is not reliable.
[115]  For this reason we need a training; we need some knowledge concerning this matter.
[116]  Therefore, I hope that in all the places, although we do not need to be in absolute uniformity, our procedures would be somewhat similar.
[117]  Next, we need to have someone there to receive people every day.
[118]  Therefore, you need to tell the local brothers and sisters to serve not only in other matters but also in the business office.
[119]  The responsible brothers should not merely preach a message once from the podium and then consider the job over.
[120]  It is your responsibility to motivate the brothers who are with you to work.
[121]  If you do not have this, you have no way.
[122]  Therefore, every one of you needs to labor every day, and you also have to cause all of the brothers to serve.
[123]  If you invest an extra hour, pay attention to one more person, ask one more person today you ask five brothers, and tomorrow you ask ten brothers, Have you done your job?
[124]  Question: How do you motivate all the brothers to work?
[125]  First, we need to show the brothers that the service is the whole church serving, with every member of the Body having its function.
[126]  When the brothers and sisters fall prostrate before God, when they crawl to come and serve God, then we will see that what we have talked about is not a difficult matter.
[127]  If I hear a brother in a certain place say, Today God loves you and you need to come and serve Him, as if God will be very happy if this one will just come and serve Him, I have no patience for this at all.
[128]  If the locality of a church is large and also has many saints, district meetings become a necessary arrangement.
[129]  We do not believe as the Congregationalists do that each congregation is a unit, for that is not the teaching of the Bible.
[130]  Therefore, if the number of brothers and sisters in a locality is quite large, as in the case of Jerusalem, which had tens of thousands of believers, you will realize that it is impossible to meet in one place.
[131]  The Bible does not show us how Jerusalem was divided into districts.
[132]  When we read the book of Acts, we know that there were districts, although they did not use our terminology.
[133]  Let me repeat that the Bible does not give us all the particular detailed items of the affairs of the church, because God is not pleased when everything is structured.
[134]  This causes the church in every generation to learn to seek God and to make arrangements according to the Lord even though the church encounters the same situations again and again.
[135]  Today when you are going to carry them out, you will find that the Holy Spirit has not left you, that the Holy Spirit is still in the church, and that Christ is still the Head of the church through the Holy Spirit.
[136]  Another thing we have to consider is what we should do with the local church at the regional center of the work.
[137]  In a place like Philippi, for example, you can see that there were elders, deacons, and brothers and sisters in the church.
[138]  The Bible shows us that when the church held a conference to discuss how to handle matters in the church which only happened once in the Bible , they sent out letters saying, The apostles and the elder brothers... in Jerusalem Acts 15:23 .
[139]  If you are elders, you cannot administrate affairs of other local churches.
[140]  You cannot go beyond the sphere of your local church to go to another local church to administrate their affairs.
[141]  If you are an apostle, you should not directly administrate the affairs of a local church.
[142]  If you know God, you must bow your head and worship Him every time you read Acts 13 and 14 because here is a very important matter.
[143]  As I have said, it is interesting that these two apostles sent out from Antioch were not elders at Antioch.
[144]  If they had been elders in Jerusalem when they went to Ephesus, they could have stayed for three weeks at the most before returning; they could have gone out from Jerusalem, but they would have had to return soon after.
[145]  The Lord has not established a federated church, a mother church, or a head church above the local church.
[146]  The Decision Made by the Apostles and the Elders
[147]  Peter stood up to state his personal opinion, relating to them what he had personally experienced, saying, Men, brothers, you know that from the early days God chose from among you that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.
[148]  Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles....Therefore I judge these were words of authority that we do not harass those from the Gentiles who are turning to God, but that we write to them to abstain from the contaminations of idols and fornication and what is strangled and blood.
[149]  The most crucial thing in studying the Bible is to touch the spirit of the Bible.
[150]  The basic requirement in studying the Bible is that a person touch the spirit of the Bible.
[151]  The other brothers were their seniors, but due to these two brothers standing up to speak, everyone was brought before God, and God s presence was brought into the meeting.
[152]  It is not that when you go out you know how to deal with the situations you encounter; rather, it is that you live before God and thus are able to bring the entire meeting before God.
[153]  CHAPTER TEN THE COORDINATION AMONG THE WORKERS RECOGNIZING AUTHORITY Master Builders in God s Work
[154]  One thing we need to know is that even though there are many persons who are workers in God s work, some are manifested as master builders established by God.
[155]  In 1 Corinthians 3:10 Paul said, According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder.
[156]  You need to keep in mind that Paul was an apostle and that Barnabas was also an apostle when he went out with Paul.
[157]  In the Bible, just as I said a few days ago, there is no chief apostle.
[158]  Please remember that in God s work and in the church of God there can never be a situation in which there is no order.
[159]  We need to see before God that even with two people, one is put ahead of the other.
[160]  Although God does not set up a chairman, we need to listen to the one whom God establishes among the elders when carrying out the Lord s affairs.
[161]  In verse 9 the Bible records that Paul was filled with the Spirit in the work for the first time.
[162]  No little dissension and discussion with them came about through Paul and Barnabas v. 2a . Later, when the brothers sent people to Jerusalem, the brothers directed Paul and Barnabas and certain others among them to go up to the apostles and elders in Jerusalem concerning this question v. 2b .
[163]  In coordination, the first matter is authority, and the second matter is fellowship.
[164]  A basic need among co-workers is that they be ones to whom we can open up our heart and with whom we can have fellowship.
[165]  Brothers and sisters, I can tell you this, that one day when you are really clear about the principle of fellowship, you will be amazed at how some Christians whom you consider not so capable can render you such great help.
[166]  For instance, if three, five, or eight brothers in the work are going to Tsingtao and all of them are still individuals, there is no co-working and there is no coordination.
[167]  In the case of the brothers who are going to Wenchow, if each one is still individualistic and his spirit is not open to the others, it will be useless even though they may live together.
[168]  In the New Testament there are many arrangements and much fellowship in God s work.
[169]  Especially with Paul we can learn that there are many arrangements, and we can find a basic principle in these arrangements there is authority and also fellowship.
[170]  Therefore, if we spend some time to look into the record in the Bible, we can repeatedly see that there are many arrangements in which the young brothers should listen to instructions in the work.
[171]  When a brother has received knowledge and light, he not only uses authority to send some brothers to carry things out, but he also fellowships knowledge and light with them.
[172]  Therefore, on the one hand, we need to see that this is a matter of authority, and on the other hand, we need to see that it is a matter of fellowship, because Paul shared his knowledge with his young co-workers.
[173]  In other words, give Timothy a message that when he comes to you, you need to send him forward, and that he needs to come to me.
[174]  But if I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.
[175]  Erastus remained in Corinth, and Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.
[176]  Today we have two questions which we want to resolve: Who are our co-workers, and who are the apostles?
[177]  Therefore, I hope that you brothers will be thoroughly clear concerning what God really shows us in His Word as to who an apostle is and who a worker is.
[178]  Here I hope the brothers and sisters will be able to see what the actual relationship between an apostle s financial source and his occupation is.
[179]  When you look at Peter with his company and Paul with his company, you can see a straight way.
[180]  If you read the Gospels, you cannot see the straight way there, because they contain only half of the matter.
[181]  Therefore, we see here that apostles truly need to leave their own occupations.
[182]  Today, brothers and sisters, we need to see this basic principle: All who go out to preach the gospel, who have been called by the Lord to serve Him fully in the gospel, who are apostles, whether brothers or sisters, need to throw away their occupation entirely.
[183]  THE SCOPE OF THE DEFINITION OF A CO-WORKER BEING WIDER THAN THAT OF AN APOSTLE
[184]  It is good, even very good, if in your locality you have the means to support yourself and you completely give up your occupation simply to serve God in your locality.
[185]  If our purpose of serving God so that He may have a way in China is the same, if you give your all and I also give my all, if you give all your time and I also give my time, if you give all your money and I give all my money, I tell you, we are co-workers.
[186]  Therefore, brothers and sisters, I often feel that if someone is absolutely for the Lord, gives everything he has, does not care for the world, lives on the earth wholly for the Lord, and uses all his means whatever they may be to serve God, regardless of what job he has and regardless of his position, you will feel that he is a person full of light.
[187]  Now we want to talk about what kind of arrangements we should have in our midst in the matter of finances.
[188]  On the one hand, how should we distribute the income of the church?
[189]  You are aware that there are many brothers in the local church, especially responsible brothers, who, because of being busy with many church affairs, were unable to continue on with their business and lost their source of income.
[190]  In addition, a local church can also send money to other local churches for their use.
[191]  THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG CO-WORKERS The Need for Those Taking the Lead
[192]  In China I know two or three brothers who were quite useful in God s hands in the beginning, and yet they cannot be conceived of as leaders among the brothers in the matter of money.
[193]  If you are foolish, you will think that since God gave to you, you are able to serve the church.
[194]  QUESTIONS The Practical Way to Distribute Arrangements Being Needed
[195]  Question: How should we distribute money in the local church at the center of the work?
[196]  The Need to Have Two to Handle the Money
[197]  I personally believe that in every region there should be at least two persons to handle the money.
[198]  Question: In the past there were a few localities which wrote to all the other localities when they needed to build meeting halls.
[199]  When you visit churches in different places, if you see elders who labor in a church and are therefore encountering financial need, those who are Timothys need to cause the local brothers to see that such ones should be given double honor.
[200]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS THE MATTER OF THE ELDERS CHILDREN
[201]  Question: The Bible indicates that the children of the elders should believe in the Lord.
[202]  Among us there are a few elders in the church whose children have not yet believed in the Lord.
[203]  Question: Philip went to Samaria by himself, and Peter went to Caesarea by himself.
[204]  Not acting individualistically does not mean that we have someone sleeping next to us, or that we have someone eating with us, or that we always buy two tickets when we travel.
[205]  With individualism one always tries to maintain his individual spiritual life before God, his individual visions before God, and his individual work before God.
[206]  Many children of God today can say only in words that they cannot do without other brothers or that they must have the church in order to live.
[207]  If a person receives the principle of fellowship and the principle of the Body only in concept, yet in actuality lives and works by himself, has a spiritual life without fellowship, and does the work of the Lord without fellowship, then this person has never been broken before God.
[208]  Individualism is not a matter of one person or two; it is not a question of more people or less people.
[209]  Individualism is a matter of whether one is under authority and whether one has the fellowship of the Body.
[210]  Today some brothers may go out with several others, but these brothers can still be completely individualistic.
[211]  When you go down from the mountain to work, you may say that you are standing in the position of the Body to learn to serve, yet if five of you are still five persons, and ten of you are still ten persons, you have failed completely before God.
[212]  Fellowship is not a matter of how many people are in the room, the number of people who sit beside you, or whether anyone accompanies you as you go out.
[213]  Question: Peter and John went to Samaria, and the Bible says that the apostles in Jerusalem sent them.
[214]  Paul and Barnabas went, and the Bible says that the brothers sent them.
[215]  Perhaps, while twelve or more than twelve brothers were waiting and praying together, Peter and John felt that they should go, and the rest of the brothers also felt that they should go.
[216]  It is not that I use authority to tell you to go; rather, it is that I fellowship the Lord s desire with you so that you can walk more properly.
