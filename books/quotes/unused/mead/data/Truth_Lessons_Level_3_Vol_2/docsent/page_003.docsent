   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This fine flour is produced out of wheat which has passed through many processes, including being sown and buried in the ground, growing up, being beaten by wind, frost, rain, and sun, and then being reaped, threshed, sifted, and ground.</S>

   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is a man in humanity, yet He expressed His divine attributes as human virtues, thus expressing God in His humanity.</S>

   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>C. The Peace Offering</S>
