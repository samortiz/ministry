   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER NINE THE WORD OF THE CROSS AND THE WORD OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If you have only a superficial knowledge of the New Testament, you may think that its pages contain just stories and teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Buried beneath its surface, however, are the implications of the death and resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We shall discuss this further after we answer some questions.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I believe I have had the experience of dying that you mentioned in the previous message, but I am not clear about resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the Bible death is the threshold of resurrection 2 Cor 4:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you have the experience of death, you do not need to understand resurrection; it is the complement of death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They go together, both in the Bible and in the Spirit, and therefore in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When we go to the Word, how do we know what portion to read?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Let me suggest a way that I learned from Watchman Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Have two copies of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One should be plain, just the pure text of the Bible without any notes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is for your morning reading, not too long a portion, a half chapter at most.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For this reading prayerfully select a book, like one of the Gospels or one of the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Do not choose Ezekiel for nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Wait till you are full-grown and can handle that kind of food!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Go through this book consecutively verse by verse, praying over every phrase so that you thoroughly digest it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This kind of reading is for your spiritual nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Use the other copy of the Bible to study for knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Make notes on its pages of light you receive or of comments from messages or from reference books.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this reading, go through the whole Bible consecutively, once a year, four chapters a day.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Gaining this knowledge will give you a solid foundation for life and will enrich the nourishment you receive from your morning reading.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These two ways of getting into the Word, one for nourishment and the other for knowledge, I surely recommend to all of you.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What is the difference between being legal with oneself to get into the Word whether one feels like it or not, and Christian behavior?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The routine, daily eating of the Word will surely influence your behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Because the Bible is the word of our God, when we come to it we have the sense, even before we read it, that we are coming to God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You will be improved just by this sense.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Suppose you were to use your time for the Word on a secular magazine or newspaper instead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Do you not think that giving that time to what the world thinks will have a negative, worldly influence on your behavior?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For over fifty years I have been kept by the Lord in His Word, without ever becoming loose.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It would grieve me to see any of you become loose by not diligently reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The time you waste cannot be recovered, and the poison you take in has a lasting effect.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Some of you who are ex-hippies can testify how drugs have damaged your mind, even though you have repented.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Go the legal way, not the loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When you talk about being strict and legal, do you mean living like a monk?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is not only monks who are legal.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Think how strict the Armed Forces are.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even though the United States is so democratic, once you are in the military service, even the length of your hair is regulated.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You have a precise time to get up and get your bed made, and you must keep all your belongings in order.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This strict treatment has improved the character of many sloppy, young men.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>I do not want you to become like a monk or a nun; just be a proper person.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not get to bed too late.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Get up and get dressed at an early hour.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Make your bed, then pray and read the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Keep all your books in order.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Keep all your clothes in their right place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do not leave dirty clothes around.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Put your shoes where they belong.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every room in your house must be neat.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even your yard, including the part by the street, should have a well-kept appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our testimony as Christians must be that we are people of the highest caliber.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We are the witnesses of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do you think we can be both sloppy and spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In God's creation everything is in good order.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We do not want to live in the fallen situation of the worldlings.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>From my observation of over fifty years, I can state that everyone ever used by the Lord has been one who is strict with himself.</S>
