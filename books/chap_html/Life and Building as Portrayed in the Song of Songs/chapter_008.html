<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER EIGHT</h1><h1 class=msg>THE GARDEN AND THE CITY</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: S. S. 1:11; 3:6, 9, 10; 4:4a, 6, 12-16; 5:1; 6:2, 4</h1><h2 class=head1>LIFE IS FOR BUILDING</h2><p>We must keep in mind that the theme of all these chapters on the Song of Songs is life and building. It is not only a matter of life, but also of building. In the above verses we see something of building. “We will make thee borders of gold with studs of silver” (1:11). This verse follows the one in which the Lord calls His seeking one “a company of horses.” As we have mentioned, a horse is something natural, something of birth. There is absolutely nothing of building related to a horse. Therefore, the Lord promises to work on her with gold and silver. Both of these materials are not natural to her. They must be built into her. Here we have the implication that the Lord is going to build something upon her.<p>All the books in the Scriptures were inspired by God Himself. We see this clearly in the Song of Songs. Not one human being could compose such poetry with all the spiritual applications found in this book. If we did not have the experience and the light from the Lord, even though we were scholars in the language and poetry of this book, I do not believe we could see the real significance here. The real significance is in the matter of building.<p>From 1:11, we must go to 3:9-10, the verses concerning the palanquin. We have seen that it is built up with wood, silver, gold, and purple, plus the interior decoration. The palanquin has gold as the base, just as the New Jerusalem does. In the New Jerusalem, the main part of the city is gold (Rev. 21:18). In that city is the throne for Christ the King. This is just like the palanquin, in which there is a purple seat, signifying the kingship of the Lord. All of these materials are for building. The palanquin is not natural; it has been built up with all these materials.<p>Chapter four says that her neck is like the tower of David. A tower is a high building, and this building is for an armory. By this time, it is clear that the seeking one already has a certain amount of building. Life comes first, and building follows. Life is for building, and building is the issue of life.<h2 class=head1>THE GARDEN</h2><p>After this, the seeking one continues to improve. This is seen in 4:12-14: “A garden inclosed is my sister, my spouse; a spring shut up, a fountain sealed. Thy plants are an orchard [paradise] of pomegranates, with pleasant fruits; henna flowers with spikenard. Spikenard and saffron; calamus and cinnamon, with all trees of frankincense; myrrh and aloes, with all the chief spices.” Now the seeking one is likened by the Lord to a garden. She is not only a palanquin, but also a garden. The purpose of this garden is mainly for the growth of certain things.<p>This corresponds with 1 Corinthians 3:9, which says that we are God’s farm and God’s building. God’s farm is equal to the garden. Growing is for building. What is grown on the farm is for the building of God’s house. The seeking one has become not only a palanquin in which Christ can move, but also a garden to grow so many spices. Eventually it says this garden is “a paradise” (Darby’s New Translation and ASV footnote).<p>Whatever grows in this garden is for the Lord’s satisfaction and enjoyment. The Song of Songs begins with eating, drinking, and enjoyment on the seeker’s side, but now the enjoyment is for the Lord. In chapters one and two, the seeker is eating the fruit of the apple tree and drinking the wine in the banqueting house. But now, the Lord is eating the fruits of the garden and drinking the wine and milk for His enjoyment. “I am come into my garden, my sister, my spouse: I have gathered my myrrh with my spice; I have eaten my honeycomb with my honey; I have drunk my wine with my milk” (5:1).
