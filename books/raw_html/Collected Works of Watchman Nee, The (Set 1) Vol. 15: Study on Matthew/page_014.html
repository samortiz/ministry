<P>Verses 17-20:This section is on the importance of the law. (1) Verses 17-18 say that the Lord did not come to abolish the law; (2) verse 19 refers to people in the Old Testament; and (3) verse 20 refers to people in the New Testament. Verse 17 is the Seventh Day Adventists' basis for keeping the law; but to keep the law in this way is like committing suicide. "To fulfill" (v. 17) is to fill up that which is lacking in the law; it does not refer to what He would accomplish on the cross. Verse 19 is concerned with the annulling of the law in general, that is, by "whoever." Verse 20 is concerned with the fulfilling of the law; it refers to another group of people, not people in general but the disciples specifically. The highest righteousness of the scribes and Pharisees can fulfill only what is said in the second half of verse 19. But even if we can attain the righteousness like that of the scribes and Pharisees, we still cannot enter into the kingdom of the heavens. In other words, unless our righteousness surpasses the righteousness in verse 19, we still cannot enter into the kingdom of the heavens. What does the Lord want to fulfill? It is the words spoken in Matthew 5—7. This is to complement that which is imperfect in the law; it is not to add more items to the law.</P><P>The requirements of the law are of three aspects. First, it requires keeping. Men are required to keep every item of the law, from the first item to the last item. Only Christ keeps the law in such a complete way. Second, it requires punishment. If a man is punished, the law is also fulfilled. For example, if a man sheds another man's blood, his blood also needs to be shed. Both the first and second aspects are mentioned in Matthew. Third, it requires teaching. Because the law is not perfect, it needs either to be changed or to be fulfilled. This is still the fulfilling mentioned in Matthew 5:17.</P><P>The first requirement comes first, and then there is the second requirement, because the first requirement gives Christ the qualification to be punished in our place. The third requirement comes after the second requirement. Since the old covenant is over, the requirements of both keeping and punishment are over. The third requirement is what we need to keep.</P><P>"To fulfill" in verse 17 is different from "come to pass" in verse 18. Verse 17 refers to complementing, and verse 18 refers to carrying out. Verse 17 speaks of complementing because it mentions both the law and the prophets. Verse 18 speaks only of the law and does not mention the prophets. What is covered by the law extends only to the end of the millennial kingdom, but what is covered by the prophets, such as Isaiah, extends to the new heaven and new earth. The law does not mention eternity. In verse 18, "until" means up to that time.</P><P>Verses 21-26:This section is on being reconciled to our brother. Verse 21 corresponds to verse 17, and verse 22 corresponds to verse 19. Both prove that the above explanation is accurate. The judgment in verse 22 is the same as the judgment in verse 21. Although the judgment in verse 22 was not the judgment by the Jewish council, we can tell that it was the preliminary judgment because at that time the preliminary judgment was held at the gate of the city. The judgment by the Sanhedrin was a step higher. The next step would be before God. Although this portion is a word spoken to Christians, at that time those standing before the Lord were Jews. Naturally, the Lord used the background of the Jews in His speaking.</P><P>To be "angry" is inward. It is mentioned in the Gospel of Mark that the Lord was angry (Mark 3:5). The Bible does not say that all anger will be judged, but it says that some anger offends God and offends the brothers. Therefore, Ephesians 4:26 says, "Be angry, yet do not sin; do not let the sun go down on your indignation." This means not to be so angry as to sin and not to be controlled by sin. Anger should have a time limit. We should control our anger. Why is it that being angry with our brother is equivalent to killing him? This is simply because many times it is our position, our physical body, our environment, and our ethical education that prevent us from carrying out the killing. However, in reality, the inner desire to kill is present in us.</P><P>Since judgment is mentioned here, we can see that it is a fact that Christians will be judged. Therefore, we should not believe the teaching by some that says that Christians will not be judged. "Brother" is mentioned here, and the requirement here is high. Therefore, this is not a word spoken to those outside the church. The Presbyterians, the Episcopalians, and the Brethren all follow Calvinism, which teaches that salvation is predestinated and, therefore, all who are saved cannot perish. The Methodists and some of the Pentecostalists follow Arminianism, which teaches that man has a free will and that Christians still can perish, since many Christians had fallen, as seen in the Bible. Calvinism is prevailing in that it exalts God, but Arminianism is also somewhat reasonable. Therefore, in my opinion, we should not overthrow a teaching that is based on a few Bible verses with another teaching that is based on many Bible verses. We should put all the verses together and let the Bible decide the matter.</P><P>The Lord speaks of eternal life and of not perishing forever, which are things relating to eternity. Before the creation of the world and after the book of Revelation—this is all eternity. Only the section in between, a temporary section, is called time, that is, from the creation of the world to the book of Revelation. In this period of time, some Christians may be punished (2 Cor. 5:10), and some may receive retribution. What could this be if this were not punishment? Luke 12:47-48 mentions the matter of receiving lashes. This is a matter before the judgment seat. It is possible for Christians not only to lose the reward but also to receive lashes. First Corinthians 3:15 mentions also that some will "suffer loss." Some have said that even if it speaks of suffering loss, as long as one does not feel the loss, it cannot be considered a loss. John 15:6 says, "If one does not abide in Me," showing that that one had abided before; then it says, "cast them into the fire," showing that there is surely punishment. Revelation 2:11 says, "He who overcomes shall by no means be hurt of the second death." In other words, he who does not overcome will be hurt of the second death. According to Revelation 20:6, only those who overcome will reign with Christ. If a Christian commits sin, God will cause him to pass through fire at the time of the millennial kingdom.</P>
