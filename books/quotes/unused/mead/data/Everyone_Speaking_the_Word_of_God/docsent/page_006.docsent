   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO BEING FILLED WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND SPEAKING THE WORD OF GOD Scripture Reading: Acts 6:4; 4:31; 8:4; 2 Tim 4:2 OUTLINE Prayer and speaking the word of God Acts 6:4.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being filled with the Holy Spirit and speaking the word of God Acts 4:31.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Speaking the word of God everywhere Acts 8:4.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Speaking the word of God at all times 2 Tim 4:2.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is easy to say that everyone must speak the word of God, but it is not easy to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, in this training we have three lines: 1 The Full Knowledge of the Word of God, 2 Everyone Speaking the Word of God, and 3 Meeting to Speak the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To understand the Word of God you must first have some deposit within you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Today you may only understand the Word of God a little, but tomorrow you will understand a little more.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One year later, and then two years later, you will understand still more.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After a long time of study to understand the Word of God, you will have some deposit within you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is like going to school.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>You cannot begin school today and then graduate next week.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You must first spend six years of study in order to have the elementary school education gradually deposited into you.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then you must study in junior high, high school, college, and graduate school.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You must not only have the will to study from elementary school to graduate school, but you must also spend eighteen years in order to have an adequate deposit within you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then, because you already have something deposited within you, you will be able to meet the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is the same with the Word of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we read it often, even daily, and also pray-read it often, month after month and year after year, we will have an accumulation of the Word within us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I hope that when you speak God s word to others, you will not just tell them that the Word of God is very good, and that the word in your church is the richest of all.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I hope that you will not merely tell people that previously you were not able to speak, but now you are able; that formerly you were dumb, but now you open your mouth; that previously you had no boldness, but now you have boldness; or that previously you had no eloquence, but now you have eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may speak like this for a long time, yet you are still only introducing the ball ; you have not yet played the ball.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>People might listen to you the first time, but the second time they will not be happy to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You must have the ball in your hand, and you must also know how to play the ball.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, you must play the ball in the way of an exhibition that others can see.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE NEED FOR A SOLID EDUCATION</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>AND A CLEAR PRESENTATION OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, this training would first encourage and guide you to understand the Word of God, to be educated daily in the Word of God, and to be saturated daily with the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Formerly you had only the Life-study Messages; we had not made them into textbooks.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, the education you received was not that solid.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Just as in learning mathematics, it is not adequate merely to listen to lectures; you must have a textbook in order to receive a solid education.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The truth among us is indeed rich, but it is just piled up in a heap.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have seriously considered this situation, and we have decided to use the materials in our publications to put out textbooks, level by level.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This training is to encourage you to learn the word of God in the Bible systematically and solidly.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, it will be easy for you to speak for the Lord, and you will have something to give to others.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moreover, when you speak to someone you must know what type of person he is, on what level he is, and what kind of word he needs.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then you should speak that kind of word to him.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Applying the words of a Chinese proverb, do not be afraid that he will not appreciate the value of your merchandise, but be confident that by comparing your goods with others , he will realize which is better.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You only need to bring out the good things, to present to him a few big diamonds from the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Once he sees them, he will be attracted.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the way to preach the gospel, and this is also the way to speak to the brothers and sisters in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not merely say that our church is very good, that our way is right, that here we have light, life, and truth, and that they must come quickly to meet with us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The more you speak this way, the more people will not be convinced.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You must bring out and show them something precious from the Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>About six months ago in Austin, Texas, a college girl, who was a fervent Christian meeting with a denomination, heard some erroneous rumors concerning us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One day a saint among us read to her a portion of a Life-study Message from Genesis.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Upon hearing this portion, she felt that it was precious, and she asked for a copy of the message.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After she finished reading one message, she read another and was greatly attracted.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As a result of this, she came to a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Not long ago I received a letter from her thanking me.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you have something precious that you want people to buy, you must bring it out and show them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When you have a clear knowledge of the truths and have stored them within you, at the proper time you can present them.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Sometimes you may not know how to present them; at those times you may bring with you the Recovery Version and also one or two Life-studies.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>You may simply turn to a footnote and read it to someone.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For instance, in 2 Corinthians 13 there is a long footnote on the Triune God note 14 1 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If your father is a Christian and does not yet agree to your taking the way of the recovery, do not argue with him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Find an opportunity to speak to him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You may say, Dad, I have here a paragraph that speaks about the benediction given at the end of each of your meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Let me read it to you.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I believe that he will be attracted before you finish reading one third of it.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because of this note, your father will be attracted.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We, the salesmen, must be trained.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not say that others merchandise is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>What businessmen avoid the most is saying that the merchandise of others is poor.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The more you depreciate the merchandise of others, the more people will not buy yours.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You need to present your treasure to people.</S>
