<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST AND SECOND SAMUEL</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE HISTORY CONCERNING SAUL</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>HIS ORIGIN AND GOD'S ANOINTING</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Sam. 9&#151;10</H1><P>In this message we will begin to consider the history concerning Saul. Although Saul's history is neither positive nor encouraging, I believe that our study of it will be quite encouraging to us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. HIS ORIGIN</H2><P>In 9:1 and 2 we have a word regarding Saul's origin.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Of the Tribe of Benjamin</H2><P>Saul was of the tribe of Benjamin, the smallest tribe (v. 1a).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Of His Father, Kish</H2><P>Saul's father Kish was a man of wealth (vv. 1b, 2a). The Hebrew word for "wealth" here may also be rendered "valor." Kish was a man rich in wealth and perhaps rich also in valor.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Named Saul</H2><P>The name Saul means "asked for" (v. 2b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. A Handsome Young Man</H2><P>Saul was a handsome young man (v. 2c). The Hebrew word for "young" in verse 2 also means "choice." As a young man, or, a man of choice, Saul was a choice to people. The fact that he was handsome, or, comely, indicates that he was attractive to people. Humanly speaking, Saul was a good choice for king.</P>
