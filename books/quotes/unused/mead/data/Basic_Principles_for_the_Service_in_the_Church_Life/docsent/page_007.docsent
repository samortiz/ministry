   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Choosing a Hymn in the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Suppose you plan to choose a hymn for a meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are two ways to choose a hymn the way in the letter, and the way in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Suppose on the Lord's Day morning we are having a morning service in the way of the letter, and we have one to take charge of the service.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We have invited another one to come to give us a sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before the service you may find out what topic that one will use for his sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>From this you consider what hymns we should sing, perhaps two or three, and you write all the hymn numbers on the board for everyone to see when they come.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a way in the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You may think that you would never do anything in such a way in our meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But at least in principle you may have this kind of practice in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>For the prayer meeting, you may look in the index of the hymnal and select a good hymn related to prayer just according to the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A way in the letter is a way of death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then what is the other way to choose a hymn?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is a way that is not according to your mind, your mentality, but according to the inner feeling of your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>You need to exercise to sense the inner feeling of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If there is no inner feeling for a certain hymn, you should not select it.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When you have a proper hymn, you will sense it by the inmost feeling of your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Ministering a Word in the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to learn not to act or serve according to knowledge, but to act and serve according to the inmost feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Suppose you are going to give a message in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You need to learn the lesson not just to speak according to your knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first time I was asked to speak before a large congregation was in 1927.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I was a young man, about twenty-two years of age.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I prepared a sermon and practiced for quite a number of days.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I went to the seashore and practiced giving the sermon to the ocean.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then I went to the pulpit on the Lord's Day morning and delivered that message according to the mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Afterwards, I realized I had forgotten a good portion of it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Later on, I found out that my way was absolutely a way in the letter.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>That was something dead.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At that time I was so young, so immature.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I simply did not know how to minister in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Gradually, however, the Lord brought me to a point where I had to minister in the spirit, according to the spirit, not according to the mentality or to knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I can testify to you that many times in the past years, even on the way to the meeting, I did not know what to minister, simply because I was planning to serve in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the hymns and prayers were over, I had to stand up to minister.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>While I was standing to speak, even while I was speaking the words, "Let us read," up to this point I myself did not know what to read.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I spoke slowly, "Let us read."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>While I was pronouncing the word read so slowly, there was a feeling a book, a chapter, a verse.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While I was reading that portion, there was some anointing within me.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Word by word, sentence by sentence, the message came out, not according to the mentality, but according to the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Oh, that is wonderful and that is powerful!</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I cannot tell you how many times this has happened.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Offering a Prayer in the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Likewise, there are two ways to offer a prayer in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One way is to offer a prayer according to knowledge, according to a routine, much like coming to an office to do routine work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sometimes I have an impression when certain brothers are praying that it is as if they have come to the office to do their routine work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to forget about all kinds of routine, all kinds of knowledge, and all kinds of letters.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When we come together to pray, we need to exercise our spirit to sense the inner anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We should not pray according to knowledge or routine, but according to the inner feeling, the inmost feeling of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Many times we can sense when a brother is ministering in letters.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We can also sense when a brother is ministering from the anointing, when he is ministering in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In such a case we can sense something living, something anointing, something enlightening, not merely something of teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The same is true of prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>By the inner sense we know when a brother or sister is praying in the spirit or merely praying in the letter, according to knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many times, when I was praying together with some living ones who prayed in the spirit, after just one sentence I had to say, "Amen," because there was a deep echo in my spirit to their prayer in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I could not hold back my "amen" because something was burning within me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When anyone utters a prayer from the spirit, there is a spontaneous expression of agreement from the spirit of the others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Some Christians would not agree with the saying of "amen" while others are praying.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Within them there is an "amen," but they suppress it; they would not release it simply because of their opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But whether they would utter it or not, when anyone prays in the spirit, there is always an echo in the spirit of others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, many times a brother prays in the mentality, in knowledge, in the letter, in the mind, and brings in death.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The more he prays, the more people are deadened.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we are praying, we need to sense whether there is an echo in the spirit of others.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When there is no echo, we need to close the prayer right away.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to learn how to exercise our spirit while we are serving and learn how to serve in the spirit.</S>
