   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verses 15-20:"This parable" is the parable of a blind man leading a blind man, referring to the washing of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The heart is the source of evil.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The traditions of the Pharisees require people to wash their hands until they are clean and white, but such traditions ignore the fact that the people's heart remains defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>One does not need to go to Africa to find a savage; savages are everywhere in America, England, China, Japan, etc. This section shows 1 how defiled man's heart is, 2 how loving God's heart is, and 3 that it is the heart that needs cleansing; this is not an outward need.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The foregoing passage speaks concerning man's heart being defiled, whereas the following passage speaks concerning God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If we do not know man's heart, neither can we know God's heart.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 21:"And Jesus went from there and withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because He desired to leave those hypocritical ones, the Lord withdrew into the parts of Tyre and Sidon, which were places cursed by God see Isa 23; Joel 3:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God openly cursed Tyre and Sidon through the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Lord preferred to leave the secret sinners to go to the open sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"The parts" means the realm.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Although we do not live in Tyre and Sidon, we are in that realm.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 22:"And behold, a Canaanite woman came out from those borders and cried out, saying, Have mercy on me, Lord, Son of David!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>My daughter suffers terribly from demon possession."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This Canaanite woman belonged to the race of the Canaanites, who were also cursed Gen 9:25-26 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>She came out from a cursed place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>"Lord" is a cry for mercy; "Son of David" is a cry by mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Son of David had nothing to do with a Canaanite woman.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 23:"But He did not answer her a word.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And His disciples came and implored Him, saying, Send her away, for she is crying out after us."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If the Lord were only the Son of David, He could have nothing to do with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This woman was standing in an improper position to lay hold of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, when we pray, we should not be careless in the way we address the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The disciples were impatient with the bothersome woman, so they asked the Lord to fulfill her desire quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Verse 24:"But He answered and said, I was not sent except to the lost sheep of the house of Israel."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>All the works of the Lord on the earth were for the Jews; His open works for the Gentiles would begin in the house of Cornelius.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Until then the Lord's works toward the Gentiles were only suggestive.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Even in His going to the house of Israel, He went only to the lost sheep the remnant .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Why did the Lord speak such a word?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He wanted to give the woman a handle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord was sent only to the house of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Now, since He was to go to the lost sheep, the realm had become much broader.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Was the woman not a lost sheep?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Could she not receive grace?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All she needed to do was to admit that she was a lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord stayed at a far distance to allow her to think.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His not answering was not a refusal; rather, it was a silent permission.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although the Lord did not open His mouth at that time, His heart was beating unceasingly, and He was eager to give grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, since the woman did not stand in the position of a sinner, it was inconvenient for the Lord to answer her request.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>God's silent delay is not a rejection.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When our God delays, it is not that He rejects us; rather, He is waiting for us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After the Lord speaks one sentence, He stops.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But within, He eagerly expects and loves us immensely.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>His outward distance is not a real distance.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Verse 25:"But she came and worshipped Him, saying, Lord, help me!"</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This woman began to realize the handle of the Lord's word, and she held on to it.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>She thought, "Oh, I thought that all the Israelites were moral and good people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Little did I know that they are lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since this is grace, there is not the limitation of position.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Although I am a sinner under the curse, I am also a lost sheep and therefore may receive grace."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord Jesus brought the entire nation of Israel down to the same level as Tyre and Sidon all are sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Now she called the Lord only "Lord" and eliminated the title "Son of David," for she now understood what salvation was.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 26:"But He answered and said, It is not good to take the children's bread and throw it to the little dogs."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This was the first time the Lord answered the woman directly.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The previous word was spoken indirectly to the woman but directly to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord likened the Jews to sheep and the Gentiles to dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Only the Israelites are qualified to be God's flock; they are the Lord's sheep mentioned in John 10.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The "other sheep" are the Gentiles who are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Not all Jews are sheep, but the Jews considered themselves as sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Therefore, the Lord said that they were lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The Gentiles thought that they too were sheep, but the Lord said that they were dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A sheep has divided hoofs outward cleanliness and chews the cud inward cleanliness .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This woman considered herself a sheep, yet the Lord said that she was a dog and refused her.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>However, He still did not give her up; rather, He again gave her a handle to hold on to.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Verse 27:"And she said, Yes, Lord, for even the little dogs eat of the crumbs which fall from their masters' table."</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>In saying, "Yes, Lord," the woman acknowledged that what the Lord had spoken was right and that she was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In Greek there are two different words for dog.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>One is used in reference to wild dogs and the other is used in reference to domestic dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Here the word used is that for domestic dogs.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord gave her the handle of His word, and she held on to it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What she meant was this: "Although I am a dog, I am Your dog.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Since I am Your dog, I can eat the crumbs."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Verse 28:"Then Jesus answered and said to her, O woman, great is your faith!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Be it done to you as you wish.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>And her daughter was healed from that hour."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord here addressed her as "woman," and He first praised her and then gave her what she had asked.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The way of the Lord's rewarding is also first by praising and then by giving Matt 25:21, 23 .</S>

   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>God's delay and God's trial are training schools of our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The longer the delay in answering, the greater the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>"Son of David" denotes a natural relationship.</S>
