EXPERIENCING THE CROSS</h2>
<p>There are two ways to know and experience the cross. One way begins with seeing a great light, which is followed by step-by-step dealings. The other way begins with step-by-step dealings that culminate in a great light. One way begins with a great light and proceeds step by step with small dealings. The other way begins with small dealings and continues step by step toward a great light. The first way is superior to the second way. Paul and a few other believers followed the first way, but the majority of believers follow the second way.</p>
<p>Immediately after his conversion Paul saw that all things had been terminated in the death of the cross and that he himself had also been terminated. When he subsequently encountered his flesh, his temper, the world, and the things of the world, these items were under his feet. They were under his feet according to what he had seen. The vision that he saw was complete, but his experience was gradual. He first saw the complete vision, and then he experienced its application step by step.</p>
<p>Most of us, however, did not begin as Paul did. We did not begin by seeing that the cross had dealt with everything and terminated all things. Rather, we saw that the death of the cross dealt with our sins. This is all that we saw. According to our view, the cross was small. This does not mean that the cross is small; rather, it means that our seeing of the cross at the time of our salvation was limited. Nevertheless, the Lord gradually gained ground in us and showed us that we need to deal with certain things and drop certain matters. After a while the Lord showed us that our flesh, our temper, and our self need to be dealt with and that our disposition and naturalness need to be broken. As time goes on, the Lord will show us that even our prayers and spiritual activities need to be dealt with. These breakings and dealings are experiences of the cross. The more we are broken and dealt with, the greater our vision of the cross will be. This will bring us into deeper experiences of the cross. Our knowledge and experience of the cross complement each other as cause and effect and will progress in cycles. These cycles continue until our flesh, temper, naturalness, self, and everything that belongs to the old creation are broken, dealt with, and terminated by the Lord step by step. Eventually, we will see that everything of the flesh, the world, and the old creation has been dealt with and terminated on the cross. When the Lord shines us upon with this great light, a light like Paul saw when he met the Lord, we will regret having spent so many years in being dealt with by the Spirit.</p>
<p>When the Spirit has to deal with matters such as movies, clothing, temper, and disposition only gradually, it seems as if the Spirit is cutting down the &ldquo;trees&rdquo; in us with a small knife. He spends a long time to cut down one tree and then even more time to cut down another tree. However, such a slow work in us is not the only way. The light that He gives can be so intense that everything of the self will be terminated instantly. If we experience the Spirit&rsquo;s shining with its exploding power, everything related to Satan and the old creation, including sin, the world, the flesh, and the self will collapse. This way of knowing and experiencing the cross is not only superior; it is normal. This was Paul&rsquo;s experience.</p>
<p>Nevertheless, the majority of the believers do not know and experience the cross in this way. The Lord may need two weeks to cut down a tree in some believers, and this would be considered quite fast. Other believers may not let Him cut down a tree even after a year. A brother may allow Him to cut only a branch, and after the branch has been cut, he will give a testimony in the meeting, and the other saints will praise and thank the Lord, thinking that he has received light. However, the truth is that four other branches have grown during this time! The saints do not have much growth in life, because the Lord can cut only one branch at a time and one tree at a time. Although this is right, it is slow. We must ask God to grant us much light, light with exploding power, so that we may know and experience the cross in a definite and quick way.</p>
<p>Christians follow one of these two ways of knowing and experiencing the cross. Even though these ways differ in their sequence, the pathway is actually the same. One begins from the larger end, and the other begins from the smaller end. The one that begins from the larger end is normal, solid, and quick. The one that begins from the smaller end is correct, but it is weak and slow. The saints who know and experience the cross in the second way think that the second way is solid and practical. They even teach others to know and experience the cross in this way. They encourage others to pray and wait for the Spirit to touch their problems and then to deal with what the Spirit touches. This way of knowing and experiencing the cross may be practical, but it is too slow.</p>
<p>Since the Lord&rsquo;s light enables us to know and experience the cross in a definite and quick way, why would we not seek the shining of this light? I do not deny or negate the gradual way of knowing and experiencing the cross. This way has its place. Those who know and experience the cross gradually obey the feeling that the anointing gives them. If the Spirit gives them a sense concerning movies, they deal with movies, and if He gives them a sense concerning clothing, they deal with clothing. Whatever He touches in their inner being is what they deal with. If the brothers and sisters among us practice this, they are doing something commendable, and they will advance. If there are brothers and sisters doing this in a certain locality, that church will be beautiful, because these saints are living in fellowship with the Lord, experiencing the moving of the Spirit, and dealing with matters one by one according to the teaching of the anointing. This is precious. However, this way is slow. There is another way, a faster way, in which we receive the shining of intense light that subdues everything instantly. We should treasure and seek this way.</p>
<p>May the Lord in His mercy show us that if we begin from the smaller end, we will have to deal with matters one by one before we see the great light, but if we begin from the larger end, we will see a great light and many things will be terminated by the shining of the light. Some portions of the Scriptures refer to the seeing that begins at the larger end, and some portions refer to the dealings that begin at the smaller end. Galatians 2:20 says, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ.&rdquo; This refers to the seeing at the larger end. Romans 8:13 tells us to &ldquo;put to death the practices of the body.&rdquo; This refers to the dealing at the smaller end. These two verses seem to speak of two different experiences of the cross, but they are on the same pathway of knowing and experiencing the cross. Our vision should be great and complete, and our dealings should be small and gradual. The pathway that begins with a great and complete vision is solid and fast, and the pathway that begins with small, step-by-step dealings is weaker and slower.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PROPER ATTITUDE AND ASPIRATION</h2>
<p>We should walk on the pathway of knowing and experiencing the cross, but we should begin from the larger end. We should experience the cross gradually, but we should begin with a full knowledge of the cross. We should not be content with what we know or have experienced, nor should we be satisfied with beginning from the smaller end. Rather, we should aspire and seek after the better beginning, that is, to see the great and complete light of the cross and then let this light lead us on the way of the cross.</p>
<p>We may feel that we have seen the great light of the cross, but we should not be too confident or satisfied, because our feeling may not be accurate, and what we have seen may not be complete or solid. Hence, we need to seek with a humble heart and a deep aspiration. Our knowledge and experience of the cross can never be too deep or too solid. Even if we have some amount of knowledge and experience of the cross, there is much more for us to know and experience. We need to be humble, and we also need the Lord to create a deeper hunger and a more pressing desire in us.</p>
<p>We should not be satisfied with the gradual knowledge and experience of the cross, nor should we despise it. The accumulation of gradual knowledge and experience will lead us to see the great light. If we are faithful in every step of knowing and experiencing the cross, the light that we see will increase. Many people know and experience the cross according to the gradual way. They begin with limited knowledge and experience but continue step by step to a fuller knowledge and experience of the cross. Even fragments of knowledge and experience are precious. However, we must beware of being content with our knowledge and experience of the cross, because this contentment will hinder us from seeing greater light.</p>
<p>Those who follow the second way of knowing and experiencing the cross should not be self-satisfied or content. They should realize that there is more to know and experience of the cross. Furthermore, those who follow the first way of knowing and experiencing the cross should not despise the saints in the second way. The second way still comes from the Lord through the Spirit, and those in this way will eventually see a great and solid light.</p>
<p>A person&rsquo;s knowledge and experience of the cross can even reflect both ways. For example, some believers seem to begin in the second way, but their knowledge and experience quickly change in their intensity, becoming like the first way. Both ways require spiritual revelation and sight. Our knowledge of the cross depends on the revelation that we have received, and our experience of the cross equally depends on how much we have seen. We must seek revelation and pursue vision. If we have revelation and vision, we need to be faithful to pay the price to obey. Whatever the Spirit touches needs to be condemned, and we must deal with it. We should forsake whatever needs to be forsaken. If we are not willing to obey, we will have very little genuine knowledge and experience of the cross. May the Lord be merciful to us!</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_054.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_056.html">Next</a> </body></html>
