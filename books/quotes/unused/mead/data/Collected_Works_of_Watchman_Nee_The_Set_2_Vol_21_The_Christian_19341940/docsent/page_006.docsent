   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAN'S ONLY SIN Issue Nos.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>2 and 3 Scripture Reading: Gen 2:17; 3:12; 4:3; 25:30; Luke 15:18; John 3:18; 16:9; Acts 2:36-38; Rom 1:21, 24, 26, 28; 3:10, 23</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This morning, by the grace of God, I would like to deliver a gospel message to you.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>My focus today is on the one unique sin in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is very strange that man's view concerning sin is completely different from God's view.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is unfortunate that in preaching the gospel, some have presented the principle of sin in a wrong way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They say that man needs a Savior because he has sinned, and if man had not sinned, he would not have needed a Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But what kind of sin has man committed?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Sin is a general term.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You have your sin, and I have my sin.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we have not committed the same sin, why do we need the same Savior?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible focuses on only one sin from the first to the last page.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Whether or not man receives eternal life depends on how he deals with this one sin.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Whether or not a man will perish depends on how he deals with this one sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man's position before God depends on the way he deals with this one sin.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The biblical emphasis is not on thousands of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Even if thousands of sins are dealt with, if this one sin is not dealt with, a person is still a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is this one sin?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This sin is the failure of man to have a proper relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Something has gone wrong between God and man, and there is a kind of disruption.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sin is not just lying, pride, or jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Although lying is a sin, and being proud or jealous is also a sin, these can only be considered as miscellaneous sins.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>There is only one sin that the Bible cares for; this is the sin that leads to perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You may not have committed many sins, but as long as you have committed this one sin, you are qualified to go to hell.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may not have committed fornication, and we may not have gambled.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But we all have committed the sin of failing to have a proper relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Something has gone wrong between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Suppose that there is a man or woman who is very clean, but who has committed the sin of being wrong in his or her relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If there is anyone here who has not believed in the Lord, you may not have committed any other sin, but you are a sinner already.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have all committed the common sin of being wrong with God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As long as we have this sin, we are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There are many names to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Enumerating all these names would take more than three days and three nights.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You may not have committed any of these sins which would be enumerated during the three days and three nights.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But you cannot deny one sin, the sin of having a breakdown in your relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If you do not have Christ today, you are a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>What is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is being in a position of having no fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What is sin?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is being in a position that is in opposition to God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sin is not murder, arson, pride, or jealousy.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sin is to be wrong with God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let me give you an illustration to show you the critical nature of this sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose a man has brothers, sisters, and parents at home and also has colleagues at work.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In addition, he has many relatives and friends.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Perhaps he is married and has children.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He may be a very good brother at home.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He may be a very good husband and father.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He may be blameless in the way he handles business and very faithful to his friends.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He may be an excellent person among his relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He may be good at everything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He does not smoke, drink, lie, and is not jealous of others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He abides by all the moral laws; indeed, he is a gentleman and a good person.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>However, he has one shortcoming: he hates his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He can get along with everyone but his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is civil to everyone but his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is polite to everyone but his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He can forgive anyone, but he is mad at his parents whenever he sees them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By himself, he is morally good in every aspect; he is good to his brothers, friends, and relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He has not committed any of the sins that men ordinarily commit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But he has committed one great sin, which is being wrong in his relationship with his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He has not committed sins which are commonly committed, but the one unique sin he has committed is being wrong with his parents.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is where the whole world stands today.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If you ask many people whether or not they are a sinner, they will say that they have not sinned very much.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In man's eyes they are gentlemen, and they are moral and courteous people.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Their conscience seems to testify that they are good people.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But I have to ask one thing: is there any problem between you and God?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It may be true that you have no problem with men and no problem with your relatives.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You may be moral and courteous.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But I have to ask: is there something wrong between you and God?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is not only a relationship between you and your wife, children, friends, and relatives; there is also a relationship between you and God!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Man is a sinner for no other reason than not having a proper relationship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>A man is a sinner not because he has murdered, committed arson, or been darkened in his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>He is a sinner because he is not right with God; he is standing in a position that opposes God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He is a sinner because there is no communication between him and God.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>You can excuse yourself by saying that you have not committed this and that sin, but there is one sin which you surely have committed.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You can say that you have not committed a hundred and one sins, but you cannot excuse yourself from this one sin.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This one sin makes us all sinners.</S>
