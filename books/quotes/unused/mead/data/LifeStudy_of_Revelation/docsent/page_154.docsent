   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A. The Overcomers Having Fought unto Death against Satan on Earth</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 7 says, And there was war in heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Immediately after the man-child is raptured to heaven, a war commences with Michael and his angels against Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that the man-child, the stronger part of God s people, is always engaged in fighting God s enemy, Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The overcomers have been fighting Satan continually, even unto death, and have defeated him on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But heaven is still waiting for them to arrive there that a war may be waged to cast Satan out of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Lord has shown us the most effective way to defeat the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What we need to do is to take the covenant, the word of God, and preach to Satan regarding what the Lord has accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, whenever we were troubled by our temper in the past, we firstly confessed it, then asked the Lord for forgiveness, prayed to the Lord to help us, and finally made up our mind never to lose our temper again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I experienced this many times.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But we should not do this anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When our temper is aroused, we should forget it and preach to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Go to the source of the problem Satan and preach to him, saying, Satan, you have been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The more you preach to Satan, the more you will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the man-child is delivered and is raptured to the throne, he will say, Satan, you were defeated by me on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Are you still here hiding in the heavens?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now I have come here to preach to you!</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Don t you remember the messages I gave you on earth?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I am not joking about this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When we get there, this will be the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then the man-child will say, Satan, you should no longer be here!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Get out!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As soon as this word is uttered by the man-child, Michael the archangel will lead all his angels to war against the dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After the executor gives the word, all the policemen will come to carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God is waiting in the heavens for this executor.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Who will be the executor?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We, the man-child.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Let us go there to preach to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before we can do this, however, we must first defeat him on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After defeating Satan on earth, we shall fight upward to heaven and eventually we shall fight downward to earth.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Now as we confront Satan, we must give him many messages.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Later, we shall go to the heavens, meet him there, and preach to him again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then, after he has been cast down to earth to damage it, we shall descend and say to him, Satan, are you still here?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Let me give you another sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now is the time for you to go to the abyss.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then after the millennium there will be the fourth sermon given to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>At that time, Satan will instigate mankind to rebel against God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But we shall say, Satan, listen to us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is our last sermon.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now you must go to your destination the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you would be qualified to participate in this, you must fight now.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Do not be indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I hope that after you read this message you will give a strong word to the enemy, saying, Satan, you have deceived me for years.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But by reading these messages, my eyes have been opened and I see that I must no longer be indifferent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Satan, you are not only God s enemy you are also my enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>From now on, I will be absolute for my Lord and I will never listen to you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The longer you make your message, the better it will be.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Also, it is better for us to do this preaching individually.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you preach to Satan like this, you will become another person and will probably soon be included in the stronger part of the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Begin now to be qualified, equipped, and perfected to be among those who will be raptured to heaven to execute judgment upon Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We must tell the enemy, Satan, I will preach to you on earth today.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Later, I will also give you a message in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After that, I will see you on earth and preach to you once more.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Finally, I will give you one more message, and then you will be cast into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I say again that the rapture is not for our happiness; it is for God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Our God is waiting for the overcomers, the man-child, to go to heaven to execute His judgment upon the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>What a privilege it is to share in this!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The angels are not positioned to share this privilege, but we are.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Now we have the ground to say, Praise the Lord that I am in the position to be an overcomer!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We have seen that as soon as the man-child is raptured to heaven, the war begins.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When I was young, I sought to understand why this war will start immediately after the man-child is raptured to the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I also wanted to know why the man-child did not actually fight but that the fighting was done by Michael and his angels.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The reason is that the man-child is the executor, and the executor does not need to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Rather, he simply gives the word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>After we, the executor, give the word, the angels who serve us will fight for us.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The angels are our servants.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When we say, Satan, go away, Michael will take the lead to fight against him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the executor gives the word, all the policemen will carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Are you willing to be in the stronger part of the woman?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If you are, then you must learn to preach to Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Satan has constantly been troubling you, but after you decide to preach to him, he may run away, for he knows what you intend to do.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Thus, you need to say, Satan, don t go yet.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You are not allowed to leave until I command you to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Stay here until I am through speaking to you.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The angels are ready to war against the dragon.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Michael might even be saying, Man-child, come up here and give us the word.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We ll carry it out.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But if we would be qualified to be there in the heavens to execute judgment upon Satan, we must begin to execute the judgment upon him now on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Say, Satan, I will not let you go.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I will bind and defeat you.</S>
