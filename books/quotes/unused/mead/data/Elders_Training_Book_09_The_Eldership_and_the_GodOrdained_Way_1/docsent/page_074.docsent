   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>It is not worthwhile for us to remain in the old way any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need to take the new way gradually and positively.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the small group meetings, we need church meetings, or district meetings, of about fifty saints.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Occasionally, we can have conferences to meet the need of the churches through the ministry of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This way of gospel preaching by visiting people, home meetings, group meetings, and church meetings is scientific.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the God-ordained, scriptural way that we must take for the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We pointed out in chapter seven that even the Southern Baptists have said that visiting people in their homes with the gospel is the New Testament plan and will never be improved on.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we do not visit people where they are, how can we expect to gain them?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we only beget them and do not visit them again and again to nourish them and cherish them, how can we expect to keep them?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the past we encouraged the saints to share in the meetings, but we did not properly teach them to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we do not teach the new ones under our care properly, how can we expect them to speak?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All over the world today, there is a common system of education with six years of elementary school, six years of junior high and high school, four years of college, two to three years of graduate school for a Master's degree, and another two or three years for a Ph.D. This is the scientific way of educating people that is practiced, in principle, worldwide.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The new way to practice the Lord's present recovery is also scientific and cannot be improved upon.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As we practice the new way, we should not criticize other places that are not practicing the same way that we are.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every place will be practicing the new way to one degree or another depending on the situation in that locality.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I also ask the leading ones in every place not to restrict any of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is my word of love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>An elder should not have the attitude that the saints need to get permission from him to go out and knock on doors.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The elders may have the heart to keep the church in a good order, but they should not restrict the saints in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the saints need to be free to exercise in order to develop their function.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The people in the world exercise themselves by going to worldly and even sinful amusements, but actually the best amusement for the human life is the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church life is the best place for us to exercise ourselves unto godliness 1 Tim 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To come to the church meetings to sit and listen to others is not to exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To exercise is first to pray much and go to knock on people's doors to preach the gospel to them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will help us to enjoy the Lord more.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It will even give us a greater appetite for the Lord as our spiritual food.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The more we exercise, the greater our appetite will be.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We can continue to exercise in the home meetings, small group meetings, and church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have to instruct the new ones how to prophesy in the church meetings with the exercise of their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We even need to instruct them to speak loud enough for others to hear them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to perfect them.</S>
