<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TEN</h1><h1 class=msg>SANCTIFICATION IN ROMANS</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Rom. 5:12-21; 6:4-6, 11, 19; 7:1-6, 18, 20-25; 8:2, 4, 6</h1><p>The third main section of Romans, the middle part, is the heart of this book. This part of Romans begins from 5:12 and continues to the end of chapter eight. All Bible students agree that the things mentioned in this section and the thoughts contained here are very deep.<h2 class=head1>THE GIFT IN CHRIST AND THE HERITAGE IN ADAM</h2><p>In chapter five there are several key words. The first two are related to two persons. The first person is Adam, and the second person is Christ (5:14-15). Related to the first person, Adam, the two key words are sin and death (vv. 13-14, 21a). Sin is the cause, and death is the effect. Related to the second man, Christ, the two key words are righteousness and life (vv. 17-19, 21b). Righteousness is the cause, and life is the effect. Therefore, righteousness is versus sin, and life is versus death. We inherit sin and death from the first man, but we receive righteousness and life in Christ, the second man (v. 17). All the things in Adam were inherited by us, whereas all the benefits in Christ are received by us. Therefore, the key items in chapter five are Adam, Christ, sin, death, righteousness, life, inheriting, and receiving.<h2 class=head1>IDENTIFICATION WITH CHRIST</h2><p>In Romans 6, the most important term is the word grown. Verse 5 says, “We have grown together with Him.” Grown is a difficult word to translate. There are several translations of this word, including grafted, as a branch grafted from one tree onto another. The King James Version translates it as planted, the American Standard Version as united, and J. N. Darby’s New Translation as identified. Another translation renders this word as joined and another as incorporated. Therefore, there are at least these different renderings of this one word: grown, planted, grafted, united, identified, joined, and incorporated. Of these, grafted and identified are two of the better translations. This is the most important term in this entire chapter. We are grafted into Christ and identified with Him. Christ and we, we and Christ, are one in this grafting, in this identification. We are no more two; we are one with Christ.<p>There are a number of other key words in this section: crucified, buried, and resurrection (vv. 4-6). Since we are identified with Christ and one with Him, in Him we are crucified, buried, and resurrected. We are identified with Him especially in His crucifixion, in His burial, and in His resurrection.<p>Some other important terms found here are the old man and newness of life (vv. 4, 6). We must keep all these key terms in mind; otherwise, we will not be able to understand this section. The old man has been crucified and buried in order that we may walk in newness of life. Our walk must be in newness of life; once we are identified with Christ in His death, burial, and resurrection, we no longer live by the old man but walk in newness of life.<p>To complete this section, we must add the key words reckon and present (vv. 11, 19). When we realize that we are one with Christ, we reckon that His death is our death in Him and that when He was buried and resurrected, we were buried and resurrected in Him also. In such an identification, we simply reckon that we are dead to sin but living to God. Then in verse 19 Paul says, “Present your members as slaves to righteousness unto sanctification.” Based on our reckoning that we are dead to sin and alive to God, we present our members as slaves to righteousness.<p>These nine key terms—grafted, identified, crucifixion, burial, resurrection, old man, newness of life, reckoning, and presenting—make the entire picture of Romans 6 very clear to us.<p>In chapter five we are told that we were born in Adam, but now we have been transferred out of Adam into Christ. In Adam we inherited sin and death, but now in Christ we receive righteousness, which is versus sin, and life, which is versus death. However, in order for us to understand how we are transferred into Christ, we need the definition and explanation in chapter six. We are transferred out of Adam and into Christ by identification. We are identified with Him, that is, planted, grafted, and united with Him. Therefore, His death becomes ours, His burial becomes ours, and His resurrection also becomes ours. In other words, His experience is our history. In this way, our old man has been crucified and we are now walking in newness of life, which is the newness of Christ Himself. Therefore, we must reckon ourselves dead to sin and alive to God. For this purpose we must present ourselves, especially all the members of our body, no longer to sin but to righteousness.
