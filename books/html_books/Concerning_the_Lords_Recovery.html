These messages cover the primary and crucial aspect of the Lord's recovery&#151;to recover the dispensing of the Triune God as life into His redeemed people in order that He may be fully expressed on the earth.</P><P>The term recovery means that something which previously existed in a normal state has been ruined or lost so that there is the need to bring that thing back to its original condition. Most Christians consider the Lord's recovery only as a recovery of doctrines, practices, and spiritual experiences that have been damaged or lost such as justification by faith, a life of holiness, the presbytery, baptism by immersion, various aspects of the church life, etc. These are items of the Lord's recovery, but they are not the central matter.</P><P>To know the main item of the Lord's recovery we need to see the complete revelation of the Bible. In both the Old Testament and the New Testament God's purpose, intention, and goal to have man as His expression is clearly revealed. Also, His accomplishments according to that intention can be clearly seen. Furthermore, both Testaments give a clear record of how Satan, God's enemy, works to corrupt and destroy what God has accomplished. Finally, the two Testaments reveal how God comes in after Satan's destruction to regain His expression. This regaining of His expression is the basic matter of the Lord's recovery. God plans and God accomplishes; then Satan destroys and God recovers.</P><P>Genesis 1:26-27 reveals that man was made in the image of God. Man was created to express the Triune God. Also, the Old Testament as a model or type and the New Testament as the fulfillment and reality reveal that God desires that this man become a collective people who will express Himself in a full way on the earth. This people, in this age, is on the one hand the temple of God (Eph. 2:21-22) and on the other hand the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One Who fills all in all (Eph. 1:22-23). This corporate entity. the church, is the manifestation of God in the flesh (1 Tim. 3:15-16). The ultimate expression of the Triune God will be consummated in the New Jerusalem where all of God's redeemed people will be one corporate entity expressing Him for eternity.</P><P>God's enemy hates this expression. God's expression has been greatly damaged and even ruined by him. Today, in the church, there is the need for a recovery of this expression. May we all pray for this!</P><P>Benson Phillips<br>Irving, Texas<br>August, 1983</P></td></tr></table></div><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER ONE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN INTRODUCTORY WORD</H1><P>The word recovery means that something was there originally, and then was lost. So there is the need to bring that thing back to its original state. The word recovery is somewhat simple and not too profound, but when we speak of the Lord's recovery we need to apply it to the revelation of the whole Bible. From this point of view the Lord's recovery is a profound and crucial thing. In a sense the revelation of the entire Bible is a revelation of recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S INTENTION</H2><P>First of all the Bible unveils to us clearly concerning God's intention, God's purpose, and God's aim. The Bible shows us that God had an intention, a purpose, with a goal as His aim. If we don't have a clear vision of what God wants, what God desires to have, what God's intention is. we cannot know what the Lord's recovery is. So we need to see God's intention, God's purpose, God's eternal plan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S ACCOMPLISHMENT</H2><P>The Bible gives a clear picture not only of God's intention, but also of God's accomplishment according to His intention. First, God purposed, and then God came in to accomplish His purpose. Apparently, the Old Testament is simply a history of a number of great men plus a people, the nation of Israel. But actually the history of those great individuals and the nation of Israel is just the history of God's accomplishment.</P><P>Even the New Testament has a history. First, there is a history of a man by the name of Jesus Christ. He is a wonderful Person whose history needs four books. The four Gospels are the history of Christ. Then from Acts to the end of the New Testament there is the history of the church. So the whole Bible, including the Old Testament and the New Testament is a history book concerning God's accomplishment, God's move.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S ENEMY</H2><P>Third, the Bible also gives us a clear record of how God's enemy came in to destroy what God had accomplished. The Satanic way to destroy God's accomplishment has two aspects: the inward and the outward. The inward aspect is to ruin God's people, to make God's chosen people rotten and corrupt. In the Old Testament after God had accomplished His purpose, Satan came in to ruin the children of Israel so that they became corrupt and rotten within. Then Satan came in to destroy God's accomplishment outwardly. The temple, which was the expression of God, was destroyed, and God's chosen people were carried into captivity. This means that whatever God had accomplished was gone.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>Fourth, God is a God with an eternal purpose. He is a purposeful God, and once He has made up His mind to do something, nothing can change His mind, and nothing can stop Him. Apparently some things may frustrate Him a little, but nothing can stop Him. So after Satan's destruction, God came in to redo the things that He had done before. This redoing is His recovery. This is to bring back whatever has been lost and destroyed by His enemy, Satan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A MODEL IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</H2><P>The Bible has two Testaments, the Old and the New. God is wise, and in His wisdom He foreknew that what He wanted to accomplish with His creature, man, would not be so simple. So first He had the Old Testament as a pretype, a prefigure, of the real thing. Before He came in to do the real thing in the New Testament, He took the time to make a model in the Old Testament. Today in architecture before a building is constructed, the blueprints are drawn, and then a model of the building is built according to the blueprints. What God did in the Old Testament was just a model of what He would do in the New Testament. What God did and accomplished in the Old Testament was not the real thing. It was just a model. If you have a clear view of the Bible you could see that the model in the Old Testament was the same as the real thing in the New Testament. The two Testaments actually reveal the same thing. One is a model, and the other is the real thing. For example, in the Old Testament you could see God's predestination, God's selection, God's calling, God's redemption, God's justification, God's salvation. All the crucial things in the New Testament were present in the Old Testament. In the Old Testament there were the types of regeneration and transformation. There was also the gathering of God's people and the building up of God's people to be God's dwelling place. In terms and in words the church is not mentioned in the Old Testament, but the model of the church is there. The temple typified the church, and the people of Israel typified the church. Other things in the Old Testament also typified the church. The complete model of the church in the Old Testament was the temple. When the temple was fully built up, the glory of God came down. This means that God Himself came down as the glory to cover the temple and to fill the temple up. That was the picture of the full accomplishment of God's purpose.</P><P>But then Satan came in first to ruin and corrupt the people. The temple was built up during the glorious reign of Solomon the king. But Solomon himself took the lead to become rotten and corrupt. He was corrupted by the pagan concubines. The concubines brought in the idols, and this ruined the people. The entire nation of Israel was ruined, so God had no way to dwell among them. He had to give them up. Then the Babylonian army came to destroy the temple and the Holy City and to capture the people away to Babylon. The first forefather of the children of Israel was Abraham, who was called out of Babel, which later became Babylon. Satan came in to bring all of Abraham's descendants back to the very place Abraham was called out of. So whatever God accomplished was gone.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A HIGHER STANDARD OF QUALITY</H2><P>But after seventy years God came in to do a recovery work. God came in to recover the thing that was lost. In the recovery of God's expression the scale was not so big as the original, but the quality was higher. Humanly speaking, we pay attention to the size of something, but God cares, not about the size, but about the quality. By reading Ezra, Nehemiah, Haggai, and Zechariah you could see that the returned people were deeply dealt with by God. Their spiritual morality and character were higher than those of the children of Israel before the temple was built. In a sense Solomon was not that moral; he had many concubines. That is terrible! That is a kind of unveiling of the rottenness of that king of wisdom. He was wise, but he was rotten. His morality was too low! But after the captivity, in the recovery, the character of God's people was very much uplifted. If you considered Ezra and Nehemiah, you would have to admit that these leaders were pure and moral. Their character had a high standard. So as to quality the Lord's recovery was higher than what had been there previously.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE REAL THING IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</H2><P>The Old Testament began with the first Adam, and the New Testament began with the last Adam. The first Adam was Adam himself, and the last Adam is Christ. The model in the Bible began with the old man, but the real thing in the New Testament began with the new man. To say that Christ is the last Adam means that He ends the Adamic race. He was the last one of Adam's race. The old man was ended in Christ. He is also the second Man. The second Man means a new beginning. So the model was with the first Adam as a beginning, and the real thing was with the last Adam, the second Man, as a beginning. When you open up the New Testament you have Jesus Christ, the Son of David, the Son of Abraham. You have a new beginning. Just as the first Adam began to produce to replenish the earth, so the last Adam, Christ, began to produce many members, His believers, to replenish the entire earth. With this producing Christ, God accomplished His purpose. Beginning with Pentecost, God's temple, the church, began to be built. This time it was the real thing and not the model.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BABYLON THE GREAT</H2><P>But within a short time as he had done in the Old Testament, Satan came in among the believers to do a ruining work. He ruined the Christians and lowered their Christian character. They became exactly as the children of Israel had become in the Old Testament. They became idolatrous, leaving Christ for other things. Then Satan came in and destroyed the church and carried away the believers into Babylon. This is why you have Babylon not only in the Old Testament, but also in the New Testament. In Revelation 17 there is Babylon the Great, which includes Catholicism and all the Protestant denominations as the daughters. The Old Testament Babylon was just a model, and the New Testament Babylon the Great is the real thing. Of course this kind of word is offensive to Christendom. However, it is not we but the Bible which speaks of a Great Harlot and many daughters. There is surely such a word in the New Testament. So there must be the real persons. Who is that Great Harlot today? And who are the daughters of this Great Harlot? If this is not the Roman Catholic Church and all the denominations, to whom can this word be applied? Look at the situation. Is there not a great Harlot committing fornication all the time? Fornication in the Bible is that God's people go away from God to something other than God, just as a wife might go away from her husband to someone else. The Bible tells us that the unique husband in this universe is God Himself. His people are His wife (Isa. 54:5; Jer. 31:32). Christ came as the Bridegroom to have the Bride (John 3:29).</P><P>In 2 Corinthians 11 Paul said that he had betrothed the believers as a pure virgin to Christ. At the end of the Bible, in Revelation 19 there is a wedding of God and His people. The real fornication is that God's people would give Him up and go to something else. Catholicism has gone away from God to something else. In the same principle all the Protestant churches also have gone away from Christ the Lord to things other than Him. So in the eyes of God, Catholicism is the Great Harlot, and all the Protestant denominations and divisions are daughters of that Great Harlot.</P><P>Because of this situation there is the need of recovery. In the ancient times God's faithful people were called out of Babylon and back to Jerusalem. That was the Old Testament recovery. Today there is also the need to come out of Babylon the Great and to come back to the proper church life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RECOVERY OF DIFFERENT ASPECTS OF CHRIST</H2><P>When God's people were captured in the Old Testament, all the holy things were lost. In the Old Testament model, Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, destroyed the temple with his army, carried away the children of Israel, and also carried away all the utensils of the temple. In the recovery all the utensils were brought back from Babylon to Jerusalem (Ezra 1:7-11). All the utensils in the temple are types of the different aspects of Christ. So in the New Testament when Satan captured the New Testament saints into Babylon the Great, he also captured all the holy things, the different aspects of Christ. In Catholicism hardly anyone knows the truth concerning Christ as our righteousness, Christ as our holiness, Christ as our life, Christ as our life supply. All these things have been lost. Now the Lord wants to recover all these things. He not only wants to call His faithful people out of Babylon and back to the proper church life, but also to recover and bring back all the different aspects of Christ which have been lost. Message after message which we have given have been to bring back all the lost aspects of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A PURE TESTIMONY OF JESUS</H2><P>The Lord's recovery is really among us, and, although the scale is quite small, the standard of the character is higher than Christianity. In the Lord's recovery the high standard of the character must be kept and maintained. Some have checked with me asking, Do you mean that all the other Christians are rotten and that only the local church people are not rotten? I don't mean that. If any people have become rotten, they are no more in the reality of the Lord's recovery. Whatever and whoever is rotten is not in the recovery. The local churches are people who have been recovered out of their rottenness back to the pure church life. The local church is not a kind of organization or religious group. The local church is the pure church life as a pure testimony of Jesus. If we become rotten, we are no longer in the reality of the Lord's recovery.</P><P>This is why in the New Testament the Apostle Paul would not tolerate any kind of immorality. In 1 Corinthians 5 Paul charged the church not to associate with that immoral person. The church as a pure testimony of Christ would not tolerate any impurity, any immorality. The church has to be pure. Once the church becomes rotten, it loses its nature and standing as the Lord's testimony. When we speak of the local churches, we mean the genuine lovers of Christ, the pure seekers of Christ. These throughout all the centuries are the local church people. We have to get out of Babylon and get away from all the rottenness and corruption.</P><P>Some have asked, Do you say that there are no genuine Christians in the Catholic Church or in the Protestant denominations? My answer is that many real Christians are there. But you have to look again at the type in the Old Testament. There were many, many genuine Hebrews left in Babylon. Even Daniel was there. Daniel had no chance to go back, but don't forget that he opened his window three times a day to pray toward Jerusalem (Dan. 6:10). He was not able to leave Babylon, but he was altogether for the recovery. I do believe the recovery was brought in by his prayer. He prayed a lot in Babylon for God's people to get out of Babylon.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LINE OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>The two terms reformation or restoration are not so adequate. The proper word should be recovery. According to the human mind, Martin Luther brought the reformation in. But actually in God's eyes he was used by God to recover only a part or one aspect of Christ. He was used by God to recover the aspect of justification by faith. Actually that was the recovery of Christ as our righteousness. That "utensil" had gotten lost. That utensil in the holy temple had been carried away by Catholicism into Babylon. Then God used Martin Luther to bring that utensil back. Justification by faith is actually Christ as our righteousness. That aspect was one of the leading utensils in God's temple. But it was carried away by Catholicism and lost. Then God came in to use Martin Luther to bring this utensil back.</P><P>Actually, the recovery began when Paul was on this earth. When he wrote 2 Timothy he wrote in a sense of recovery. At that time the church had been ruined already. So Paul wrote 2 Timothy to recover and inoculate the corrupted church life with the truth. That was a recovery.</P><P>The Apostle John, who wrote his books about twenty-five years later than Paul, also wrote to recover. The Gospel of John was written to recover, his Epistles were written to recover, and Revelation was written to recover. By reading the seven epistles in Revelation, you can see that they are recovery epistles. Some of the churches had become corrupted and lost their testimony, so the seven epistles were written to recover them. From the end of the first century the recovery began, and it has not stopped to this day. By reading church history you can see that the recovery has been going on in every century. From the end of the first century until today there is a line of the Lord's recovery. This recovery has been increasing all the time. The Lord's recovery has never been in such an intensified scale as it is today. Although the Lord's recovery existed even before Martin Luther, it was not noticed by the worldly people because it was hidden.</P><P>History tells us that the Catholic Church killed more Christians than the Roman Empire did. This means that the Lord was doing a recovery work there, and the Catholic Church was killing people who would take care of the recovery. Through all those centuries under the Roman Empire and under the Roman Church the recovery was going on strongly and forcefully. The Roman Church utilized the secular rulers to kill the recovery people. The Church of England burned some faithful ones. Madame Guyon was in the recovery, and she was put into prison by the Catholic Church. John Bunyon, the writer of Pilgrim's Progress, was persecuted by the Church of England. These are examples of the recovery people.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF THE CHURCH LIFE</H2><P>The Lord's recovery of the church life began to be apparent with Zinzendorf two and one-half centuries ago. He practiced the church life as part of the recovery in Bohemia. Then later in Britain the Brethren received even more light concerning the church, and they practiced the church life in a fuller way than Zinzendorf had. Now today we also are practicing the church life. Zinzendorf practiced the church life in the 1700s, the Brethren practiced the church life in the 1800s, and today we are practicing the church life in the 1900s. We consider this as three steps: Zinzendorf's practice, the Brethren practice, and now the practice among us. Of course, the recovery is getting fuller and richer as it progresses.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE RECOVERY<br>OF GOD'S EXPRESSION</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:26a, 27; 28:16-19; Exo. 25:8-9: 40:1, 34-35; 1 Kings 7:51; 8:10-11; Ezra 1:3, 5; John 1:14; 2:19-20; Eph. 1:22-23; 2:19-22; 1 Tim. 3:15-16; Rev. 21:2-3</H1><P>In this message we want to see the matter of the recovery of God's expression. In church history there was the time of the reformation. Today even some of the denominations use this term reformation in their name, such as the Dutch Reformed Church. Some people have called the reformation a kind of restoration. In our messages, however, for the Lord's move today, we like to use the word recovery. Recovery implies that something was there originally, yet was lost. So there is the need to recover the lost thing. This is the real meaning of the word recovery in the spiritual sense. If we know the Bible we could see that the Lord's recovery is not only in the New Testament, not only today, but that it was also in the Old Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE OLD AND NEW TESTAMENTS</H2><P>These two Testaments, the Old Testament and the New Testament, actually reveal the same thing. The Old Testament reveals the model of the real thing which will be covered in the New Testament. Augustine said that the New Testament is concealed in the Old Testament, and the Old Testament is manifested in the New Testament. When I was a young man I heard this word, and I have been keeping it as a proverb to help me study and understand the Holy Word. It reminds me all the time that whatever is in the Old Testament will be in the New Testament, and whatever is in the New Testament was already in the Old Testament.</P><P>For example, the book of Exodus in the Old Testament mentions the tabernacle. In the New Testament the Gospel of John begins with the tabernacle (John 1:14), and the last book of the Bible, Revelation ends with the tabernacle (Rev. 21:3). John's Gospel says that in the beginning was the Word and the Word was God, and this Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (John 1:1,14). His dwelling among man was a kind of tabernacling. A tabernacle was dwelling among the human race. At the very end of the Bible, which is also the very end of John's writings, there is the New Jerusalem, which is the consummation of the tabernacle revealed in the entire Bible.</P><P>By this example you can see that the crucial things in the Old Testament are also in the New Testament. So the two Testaments reveal to us the same thing. The only difference is that in the Old Testament it is a model, and in the New Testament it is a reality. Sometimes in architecture people make a blueprint and then a model of the blueprint. Eventually the real building is constructed. The real building in design and in detail is absolutely according to the model. In the Old Testament we have the model, and in the New Testament we have the real thing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD'S RECOVERY</H2><P>When I was about twenty years of age I learned about this matter of recovery by reading the Bible and studying other Christian writings, especially among the Brethren. They talked about the return from the captivity. They pointed out that the children of Israel were carried away into captivity to Babylon. Then after seventy years the Lord commanded them to return to Jerusalem. That return was a genuine recovery.</P><P>When some Christians talk about the Lord's recovery, they are referring to the recovery of some doctrines. For example, they say that the doctrine of justification by faith was lost, but then it was recovered through Martin Luther. Some also have pointed out that certain practices have been recovered. Over three hundred years ago in northern Europe some of the saints saw the matter of baptism by immersion. They consider that they have recovered not only the truth concerning baptism, but also a practice. To baptize people by immersion into water is a kind of practice.</P><P>The Presbyterians consider that they have recovered the presbytery. Presbytery actually means the eldership, referring to the type of church government. They are not Episcopalian nor Congregational in their church government. They administrate the church by the presbytery, the eldership. All of these groups consider that they have recovered some truths, and eventually some practice. Nearly every Protestant denomination today is a result of the recovery either of a doctrine or of a practice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CENTRAL RECOVERY</H2><P>These are recoveries, but these recoveries are not so central. The central thing in the Bible is not baptism by immersion; it is not the presbytery. It is not any doctrine or practice. The central thing in God's revelation is that God wants to be expressed. The Triune God desires to express Himself in humanity. God is invisible; yet He wants and desires to be expressed. The invisible God desires to be seen through an instrument, through humanity, the very man created by Him. Man and the entire universe were created for this purpose. God created the heavens and the earth, the lifeless things, the vegetable life and the animal life, and eventually the human life. This means that all the other things are for man. The heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>MADE ACCORDING TO GOD'S IMAGE</H2><P>Man was made by God with a definite purpose. God is a purposeful and thoughtful God. According to His purpose He made a plan to create the universe and to create man in the universe to express Himself. Genesis 1:26 and 27 occupy a strong place in the Bible, telling us that when God was going to make man it seemed that the Triune God held a conference. Verse 26 says let "us" make man. The Bible does not record a kind of conference among the Godhead before the creation of the heavens and the earth or the vegetable and animal life. But before God made man there was a kind of conference among the Godhead. The decision was made to create man in their own image and after their own likeness.</P><P>We all have to respect ourselves because we are made after God's kind. In Genesis 1 the vegetables bring forth after their kind, and the animals bring forth after their kind. But mankind is after God's kind. Our image and our likeness is of God. Don't think that this means we are God! No! It is like a photograph. If you take a photograph of me you may say that that picture is me, and you also may say that that picture is not me. Both are right. That photograph is not the real person. Every human being is a photograph of God. God only took one photograph, but through the generations there has been a marvelous reproduction. There have been millions of copies made. We all are pictures of God.</P><P>A photograph, though, is just a picture. It has no content and no life. So in the second chapter of the Bible, after man was created in the image of God, God brought him to the tree of life. This is a strong indication that the man created by God did not have the divine life of God. So God brought him to the tree of life, indicating that God wanted him to take the tree of life in order to receive the divine life of God into himself. At the beginning of the Bible there is a man made not only by God but also according to God. God made a duplicate of Himself. But this is only in the outward appearance, without the inward content. At the beginning of the Bible there is such an expression of God. Man was made for God's expression. We should not express ourselves. We should express God because we were made in God's image and after God's likeness.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S EXPRESSION<br>IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</H2><P>The central line in the entire Bible is God's expression. In Genesis there is the record of nine great men who are landmarks in the human history: Adam, Abel, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. Adam was first, and he became fallen. Abel came back to God taking God's way of redemption and salvation. Following him was Enosh, who realized that fallen man is so weak, fragile, and good for nothing. So he had no trust in himself, but he called on the name of Jehovah. To call on the name of Jehovah means that you put your trust in Him. You realize that you are fallen and sinful and weak and poisoned and corrupted and fragile in doing anything for God. So what shall you do? You have to forget about yourself, and call upon the name of Jehovah. This is not just to call on the name of God. Jehovah is Jesus in the Old Testament. So Enosh became a landmark in human history because he began to call upon the name of the Lord. For me to call upon the name of the Lord indicates that I realize I am nothing, that I can do nothing, and that I am good for nothing. Because I have no trust in myself, I trust in the Lord. I call upon His name.</P><P>The fourth landmark in human history was Enoch, who walked with God. This indicates a little improvement. This is not just to call upon the name of the Lord, but to walk with Him. The fifth landmark in Genesis is Noah. Noah not only walked with the Lord, but he also worked with the Lord and worked for the Lord. He built the ark with the Lord and for the Lord.</P><P>Abraham, the sixth landmark, was called out of the idolatrous land. His son, Isaac, and his grandson, Jacob, continued after him. With Jacob something happened as a further development of God's expression. When he was escaping from his brother he slept in the wilderness using a stone for a pillow (Gen. 28). During the night he had a dream in which he saw a ladder reaching into the heavens with the angels descending and ascending upon it. Jacob called that place the gate of heaven and the house of God, Bethel. That was God's dwelling place. The next morning he anointed his stone pillow with oil and called it Bethel, the house of God. This is very meaningful. God gave this wanderer a dream showing him that God desired to have Bethel, a house on this earth. Humanly speaking nothing can express you so much as your house. When you look at people's dwelling places, right away you can realize what kind of people they are. God wants a dwelling place on this earth to express Himself.</P><P>The ninth landmark in Genesis was Joseph who ruled on the earth for God's expression. Eventually all of Jacob's descendants fell into Egypt. After four hundred years, God brought the children of Israel out of Egypt to Mount Sinai where He revealed the tabernacle to them. God wanted them to be His dwelling place that God might be expressed among them and through them. Later, that tabernacle was enlarged into a temple. The tabernacle was a traveling house of God, but the temple became a settled house upon this earth. This covers the entire Old Testament. First of all God had nine men from Adam to Joseph who expressed Him in a limited way. Then in the second book of the Bible, Exodus, God got a collective people who became His expression in a full way.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S EXPRESSION<br>IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</H2><P>In the New Testament the first person is Jesus Christ. He was God becoming a man, and He became a tabernacle (John 1:14). When He was on this earth, He was tabernacling among men. He was God's dwelling place. The model of the tabernacle was in Exodus, and the genuine tabernacle, Jesus Christ, is in the Gospel of John. One day this tabernacle told the Jews that if they destroyed Him, He would raise up the temple within three days. Of course, they did destroy Him by crucifying Him on the cross, and He did raise Himself up in an enlarged way. In the raised-up temple, the church, we all are there. This is God's expression.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Dwelling Place and the Fullness</H2><P>Ephesians on the one hand tells us that we are builded together into a temple of God to express God, and on the other hand that the church is the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (Eph. 2:21-22; 1:23). What is the fullness? The fullness is just the expression. If a glass has water in it, but it is not overflowing there is not the fullness. It is not until the water flows over the brim of the glass that there is the overflowing, the fullness. This fullness is the expression of the water. We are all vessels to contain God (Rom. 9:21, 23). If we have only a little bit of God and no overflowing, there is no fullness. If there is no fullness, there is no expression. The church should be a vessel that is full of God and even overflowing with God. When the church overflows God, that is the fullness. That fullness is the very expression of God. On the one hand the church is the dwelling place of God, and on the other hand the church should be the fullness of God. Just to be the dwelling place of God is not adequate. We must be the fullness of God. Then the church can express God. When we overflow God, we have the fullness of the One who fills all in all. Then we become the full expression of the all-inclusive and wonderful God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Manifestation of God in the Flesh</H2><P>Paul, in 1 Timothy 3:15-16, tells us that the house of God is the church of the living God which is the pillar and base of the truth and which also is the manifestation of this all-inclusive God in human flesh. When we come together with the fullness of God, an outsider would realize that this is the manifestation of God in the flesh. Although we are flesh, we overflow God. Among us is the manifestation of the invisible God, and this manifestation is the expression of God.</P><P>This expression which is the church today will consummate to the uttermost in the New Jerusalem, which will be the eternal tabernacle. All of God's redeemed people will be one corporate entity, the New Jerusalem, to express God for eternity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DESTRUCTION OF GOD'S EXPRESSION</H2><P>God's enemy, Satan, hates this expression. In the Old Testament not too long after God had reached His goal to have such an expression, the completion of the building up of the temple, the enemy of God came in to ruin God's people from within. When the temple was completed the glory of God came down and overshadowed the temple and filled the temple. That glory was the expression of God. God is invisible and hidden. Once He is expressed, that is glory. The temple signifies the aggregate, the collection, of all God's children as His dwelling place. God was manifested in glory in His dwelling place, but they were corrupted by Satan in their morality and behavior. They became ruined and so sinful that God had no ground to dwell there. So God left the temple. Then the Babylonian army came to destroy the temple and to bring all the utensils into captivity. Even most of the people were carried into captivity. Nebuchadnezzar, king of Babylon, put the utensils into the temple of his idols. This means that the expression of God was destroyed. So there was the need of the recovery.</P><P>The same thing happened in the New Testament. As we mentioned previously, the things in the Old Testament were a model, and the real things are in the New Testament. In the New Testament you have first of all an individual, Jesus Christ, who was God becoming a man to tabernacle among men. He was one individual as God's expression, the tabernacle. Through His death and resurrection He was increased. He was the one grain which fell into the ground and died and brought forth much fruit (John 12:24). So on the day of Pentecost, the church was there as the enlarged tabernacle. Now God's expression was not by one individual, but by a corporate body. After a short time, even while both and Peter and Paul were still living, the church was ruined from within. The glory of God left the church. Satan destroyed the church and brought the church into captivity, to Babylon again. In the New Testament at the very end you have Babylon the Great. In the eyes of God Christendom is Babylon, to which the church has been carried away. The church became a captive. So there is the need of the recovery.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EXPRESSION OF GOD BY LIFE</H2><P>God created man in His own image with the intention that man might express Him by the way of life. A photograph of a person cannot express a person fully because it does not have life. It does not have the faculty to think or to speak or to do something. A photograph needs life. It needs a person to get into that photograph to enliven it. In the Bible there is such a divine thought that God wants to be man's food and man's drink to enable man to partake of God as life. Right after the creation of man, God brought man to the tree of life, indicating that man should eat of the tree of life. That same tree of life is at the very end of the Bible. In Revelation 22:1 the river flows out of the throne of God. On the two sides of the river the tree of life grows. So the tree of life is something coming out of the Triune God to be our life and life supply.</P><P>In Exodus the children of Israel ate the meat of the lamb which had redeemed them. They struck the blood for redemption, and then they ate the meat. They also ate the unleavened bread. Both the meat of the lamb and the unleavened bread are types of Christ. This means that they ate Christ. By eating Christ, Christ entered into them. In the wilderness they ate manna every day. Manna was also a type of Christ. They also drank the living water out of the cleft rock. The living water was just the overflow of Christ. So they ate Christ and they drank Christ, and Christ got into them.</P><P>Furthermore, the children of Israel offered offerings. The meal offering and the peace offering were food for God and food for the serving ones (Lev. 2:1-3). The peace offering was food for all the clean ones (Lev. 7). These items: the lamb, the manna, the living water, and all the offerings clearly tell us that God wants His people to eat Him, to receive Him into them to become their life and life supply. So in the New Testament when the Lord Jesus came, He indicated that He was food for us to eat. He was the heavenly manna. He was the bread of life (John 6:35). He was the living bread (John 6:51). In John 6:57 the Lord Jesus said, "He who eats Me shall also live because of Me."</P><P>In the next chapter, John 7, the Lord Jesus cried, "I anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink." All these verses indicate that Christ is our life and our life supply. Then in the very last book of the New Testament, Revelation, the Lord Jesus promised that the overcomers would eat of the tree of life (Rev. 2:7) and of the hidden manna (Rev. 2:17). By these verses you can see that God. wants to get into us. It is by this that God becomes our life and we become enlivened people instead of lifeless pictures. Christ within us is not only our Savior and Master and Lord, but also our life. The Lord came that we might have life and have it abundantly (John 10:10). Hallelujah! I have His life abundantly! I am full of Christ; I am full of life.</P><P>This wonderful indwelling life unites us. Because we have the Lord Jesus within us as our life, something leaps within us when we meet one another. Although we may not understand another brother's language, something leaps within us because of the life. We have life within us, and this life unites us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE RECOVERY OF LIFE</H2><P>In the degradation of Christianity this life matter has been lost. As long as the life matter is lost, the expression of God is gone. The Lord's recovery is just to recover the expression of God. It is not to recover baptism by Immersion or other kinds of truths or practices. Those are too small. Those are not so central. The central recovery of the Lord is to recover the divine life within us that God may have His expression among His people. This is the main item, the central thing, that needs to be recovered. We are here in the Lord's recovery, in the church life, not for the recovery of certain doctrines or practices. We are here for the recovery of the divine expression of the Triune God. We are here for the central recovery of the divine life which we are possessing and enjoying and living by day and night. When we have this central recovery, we have all we need.</P><P>We don't need any regulations. This central recovery regulates and governs us everyday. In the church we don't have regulations as to what the members should wear, but surely the life within would not allow you to wear certain things. The recovery of the divine life within us for God's expression governs us. Sometimes you may be tempted to dress in a certain way, but the divine life is within you regulating. We don't have a regulation that says all the sisters in the church life should have their skirts a certain length. But sometimes sisters have burned their short skirts. Why would they do this? The living God within them who is their life required this of them!</P><P>A few days ago I went to the department store to buy a tie. I picked up the ties and looked at them. We don't have a regulation in the churches of the Lord's recovery which says not to wear fancy ties. I just simply don't have the permission to wear such a fancy tie. Who regulates me? The Lord Jesus! It is not Jesus outside of me and not even Jesus on the throne, but the very Jesus who is within me. It is the living Jesus who is my life daily. The life within me regulates. Do you like to eat bitter things? If you put something bitter in my mouth, I would spit it out. But if you put something sweet in my mouth, I would swallow it. Within us there is a taste of life. Life works, life serves, life regulates. This is the regulation today in the church life. It is not in letters.</P><P>Every one who has Christ within surely wants to be buried under the water. He wants to get rid of himself. It is not that there is a kind of doctrine and practice concerning immersion. Rather, the life within causes us to want to be buried. Among all the saints in the churches in the Lord's recovery there is no regulation at all. We only have the divine life within recovered to the uttermost. Also we have the Holy Word in our hand for the development of the inner life and for the light of our pathway. We don't have any regulations; we only have the recovery of the divine life within us for the expression of God.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CONTENTS OF GOD'S EXPRESSION<br>IN ITS MODEL</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Exo. 40:17-35; Heb. 9:2-5</H1><P>The Bible is a record of God's expression. From the first page to the last page the expression of God is revealed. In the last message we pointed out that the first time man is mentioned in the Bible it says that he was created in the image of God (Gen. 1:26, 27). This indicates that man was intended to express God. Then God put this man before a tree which is called the tree of life, showing that God's intention was for man to eat of the tree of life so that he might enjoy and partake of the divine life of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S EXPRESSION IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</H2><P>In Genesis. the first book of the Bible, there are nine persons as landmarks of the human race. The first, Adam, was the landmark of man's fall. Man got fallen in Adam. Following Adam was the second man, Abel, who was the landmark of man being brought back to God according to the divine way of salvation. The third landmark was Enosh. Not many Christians have paid attention to this person. Enosh means a fragile man, easily broken, and easily put down. Because he realized that he was weak and fragile, he began to call on the name of the One who is the great I Am, Jehovah. This is the One who was and who is. This is the One who is the To Be. This is Jesus. In the Old Testament He was called Jehovah, and Enosh was the first in human history who called upon this all-inclusive One, this great To Be. He trusted in this One for his life. The fourth landmark was Enoch who walked with God and lived a life together with God. The fifth landmark was Noah who not only walked with God but also had a common interest with God and worked with God. God's interest was his interest. From these five landmarks we can see where man should be.</P><P>In Genesis there were four other important persons: Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph. These four persons actually depict one complete person. In our Life-study of Genesis we pointed out that the three generations of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob are really three parts of one complete person. Joseph should not be considered as a fourth part but as a kind of annex to Jacob. In the father, Abraham, there was the calling by God out of the idolatrous world into the sphere of the full enjoyment of the riches of God. He was called out of Ur of the Chaldees into Canaan.</P><P>In the son, Isaac, we can see a person who inherited and possessed and enjoyed all the riches of God typified by the good land. The grandson of Abraham, Jacob, shows a person who was chosen and selected by God to a destiny, that is, to be transformed into a prince of God. By his natural birth he was a supplanter, a heel-holder. But such a one was transformed into a prince of God to execute God's government on this earth. This was fully represented by Joseph. Eventually Joseph as an annex to Jacob or Israel, the prince of God, reigned over the entire world and supplied them with food. So in this complete person you can see God's choosing, God's calling, God's redemption, and God's transformation to execute His government on this earth. The goal of all God's doing is to have man to express God.</P><P>With these nine great men you cannot see a clear view of God's expression until this transformed person, Israel, was reproduced manyfold so that his descendants formed a people. The people of Israel as a collective people were used by God to express Himself. God brought His people out of the tyranny and slavery in Egypt to Mount Sinai where they received the revelation to build up the tabernacle of God on this earth. After the tabernacle was completely built up, God's glory came down from the heavens in a visible way to dwell with man. Isn't this marvelous! On this earth there was a people among whom God had gained a dwelling place to express Himself in His expanded glory. Up to the end of Exodus God's expression was quite complete.</P><P>Consider how big the universe is. Within the universe there is a globe which is good for life. It is good for the vegetable life, the animal life, for the human life and even for the divine life to be expressed through the human life. Eventually in Exodus the divine life came and dwelt in its splendid glory among the human life, even visible to the human eyes. Again I say that by the end of Exodus God's expression on this earth was fully complete. And that expression was traveling. It traveled through the wilderness for at least thirty-eight years. A people on this earth did not live on anything from the earth. While they were traveling they lived on manna, something from the heavens. Early in the morning they gathered manna, and they drank of the living water that came out of the rock which followed them.</P><P>Among them there was the dwelling place of God. God dwelt in that tabernacle. and God overshadowed that tabernacle. In other words, God was fully expressed in that dwelling place among the human race on earth. From Exodus to Malachi there are still thirty-seven more books in the Old Testament. What is the content of those books? The content in the first stage was the tabernacle and in the second stage the temple. The tabernacle was a precursor of the temple. The tabernacle or the temple was the center of the history of these thirty-seven books from Leviticus to Malachi. And what was the tabernacle or the temple? That was the expression of God among the human race on this earth. It is so easy to remember the entire Old Testament. All you need to remember is nine great men plus the tabernacle and the temple. Eventually, those nine great men issued in God's dwelling place. This is the way to understand the Bible with a heavenly view. The Old Testament tells us about nine great men and a dwelling place of God. The dwelling place of God was just God's expression as an issue coming out of those nine great men.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S EXPRESSION IN THE NEW TESTAMENT</H2><P>The New Testament began not with nine great men but with one unique man. This man is wonderful. He is both God and man. He is God in the heavens becoming a man on this earth. So this man joined the heavens to the earth and brought the earth up to join the heavens. He was surely the ladder which Jacob saw in his dream (Gen. 28:12). This ladder is the very gate of heaven and also the house of God, Bethel. While He was on this earth He was tabernacling. The tabernacle, the first stage of God's dwelling place in Exodus, was not grounded, but was traveling. When the Lord Jesus was on this earth He also was traveling. He traveled from Galilee to Judea, from Nazareth to Bethlehem, from Jerusalem to Samaria. He was really a traveling tabernacle. But He was God's dwelling place. As God's temple He was destroyed, and He raised Himself up in the way of enlargement. In His resurrection He raised us up with Himself. Don't think that you were saved in the twentieth century. You were resurrected in the first century when Christ was resurrected. All of us were resurrected with Him and became the temple.</P><P>The temple was on a bigger scale than the tabernacle. When the Lord Jesus was the tabernacle traveling on the earth, He only traveled in a small country, the Holy Land. He was limited. He was the infinite God in eternity, yet He became a finite man. But after He raised Himself up in an enlarged way, that tabernacle became a temple. This temple today is all over the globe. This is the church. In the four Gospels, God was manifested in the tabernacle. But from Acts to Revelation God is expressed in a temple. So the New Testament is also easy to remember. It contains a unique man who was God's tabernacle and the church which is the enlargement of this unique man as God's dwelling place on the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONTENTS OF GOD'S EXPRESSION IN ITS MODEL</H2><P>The nine great men in the Old Testament issued in God's dwelling place for God's expression. But that was still not the real thing; that was just a model. In the last chapter we pointed out that the Old Testament and the New Testament reveal the same thing. The Old Testament reveals the model, while the New Testament reveals the reality.</P><P>In Exodus 40:17-33 there is a depiction of all the details of this model. In these seventeen verses one clause has been repeated seven times: "As the Lord commanded Moses." This means that the model is of seven sections. Whenever one section is completed in its rearing up, that section ends with this word, "As the Lord commanded Moses." The first section is that of rearing up or erecting the tabernacle. First the foundation was laid, not with cement blocks, but with one hundred silver sockets, each of which was made of one talent of silver. A talent weighs over one hundred pounds. It may be that at least four persons were needed to carry the sockets. This means four hundred young men were needed. They must be matured, otherwise how could they carry the silver sockets as the foundation?</P><P>Second, upon the sockets there were forty-eight standing boards plus four pillars in the front. Each of the forty-eight boards stood on two sockets, so there were ninety-six sockets for the forty-eight boards and four sockets for the four pillars. The standing boards became the walls of the tabernacle. A curtain hanging over the boards became the ceiling of the tabernacle. Above the ceiling there were three more layers of covering which were the roof.</P><P>In the second section, the ark was placed into the tabernacle, and into the ark were placed the two tablets of the Ten Commandments, which are called the tablets of the testimony, the pot with the manna, and Aaron's rod that budded. The ark was then covered with a lid, which the King James Version translates into mercy seat but which is better rendered propitiation cover. Two cherubim were upon this covering. The ark was put within the tabernacle and the veils were hung in place. This is the second section.</P><P>Then the table for the showbread was brought in and put on the north side of the tabernacle. This was to display the bread. Afterwards the lampstand was put on the south side of the tabernacle opposite the showbread table. This was the fourth section. Then the incense altar was placed in the middle of a triangle formed by the showbread table, the lampstand, and the ark. The sweet incense was burned upon the incense altar to please God. Finally the curtains were hung to close the entrance. This was the fifth section and completed the tabernacle on the inside.</P><P>In the sixth section an altar was set up. This was an altar for the burnt offering which was in the front of the court. Finally a laver was set up to wash the hands and feet of all the priests. All these things were done according to what Jehovah had commanded Moses. Once these things were finished God descended in His glory, first to overshadow the entire tabernacle, and second to enter into the tabernacle and fill it with His visible glory (Exo. 40:34) God was manifested in the tabernacle to make it the expression of God among His people on the earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONTENTS OF THE TABERNACLE</H2><P>What are the contents of the tabernacle? From God's side the rearing up of the tabernacle begins from the west end where the ark is. But from our side it begins at the east end where the altar is. When we come into the sphere of God's dwelling the first thing we have to contact is the altar. The altar deals with our sin and our sins. Here we offer the sin offering to deal with our sinful nature, our indwelling sin. Here we offer the trespass offering to deal with our trespasses, transgressions, faults, offenses, and wrongdoings. Unless the sin within you and the outward sins are dealt with, you are not allowed to go further to reach God. Where is God? God is at the ark. First you were wandering out in the world, but one day you heard the gospel and desired to contact God. Once you entered into the sphere of God's dwelling place you reached the cross typified by the altar. You heard the gospel that Jesus the Son of God died for your sins. You heard that He was the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world. There at the cross, at the altar, you said, "Lord Jesus, thank You. You are my Savior. You died for my sins. You died for me, a sinner." After such a confession you were saved, you were forgiven, you were redeemed, you were justified.</P><P>At the altar there is not only the sin offering and the trespass offering but also the burnt offering and the meal offering (Exo. 40:29). The burnt offering was only for God. It was the food to satisfy God's hunger. You are not the only one who wants to eat. Your hunger should remind you of God's hunger. You need to serve Him with some food by offering Christ. What does it mean to offer Christ as food to God? Actually, in our Christian experience we have realized this to some extent already. When we repented at the cross of Christ and received Him as our Savior and Redeemer, this was to take Him as our trespass offering and sin offering.</P><P>Simultaneously, we may realize that we can never please God and satisfy God. Then we would say, "Lord Jesus, You not only died for me and for my sins, but You also died to satisfy God. You have pleased God for me." This is to offer Christ as the burnt offering. I believe that a good number of newly saved persons had such a prayer.</P><P>Exodus 40 doesn't mention all the offerings; it only mentions the burnt offering and the meal offering (v. 29). After the burnt offering there was the meal offering which was food for God and also for the serving priests. After you have been saved you are no more sinners. Rather, you are priests serving God. Outside of the outer court we were sinners. When we got into the outer court and we experienced Christ as our trespass offering and sin offering at the cross, the altar, we got saved. Right away the sinners became priests. So we need to eat the priestly food, not the secular food. We need to eat Christ. Christ is not only for God's satisfaction, but also for our satisfaction. We eat Him, and this is the meal offering. Although you may not have received this kind of teaching in the past, you surely had the experience to some extent.</P><P>When we get saved at the cross by receiving Christ as our trespass offering and sin offering, we realize at the same time that He is the One who satisfies God and pleases God. But at the same time we also have the realization that we are satisfied. That is why we are so happy. We are happy not only because our sins are forgiven. We are happy because we have something within. That something is the meal offering. Christ as the meal offering feeds us and strengthens us to serve God. Eventually there is the peace offering which is good for fellowship. With the peace offering there is a kind of feast for the offerer and the priest who offers the offering and also for all the other parties who are there and for God. This is very much like the New Testament fellowship which we have at the Lord's table. In a sense the Lord's table is a peace offering.</P><P>Isn't this wonderful? But I am sorry to say that most Christians have only enjoyed Christ as their trespass offering and sin offering. Many don't even know what is the difference between the trespass offering and the sin offering. This is the poor situation of today's Christians. Few realize at the time of their conversion that Christ is their burnt offering to God for God's satisfaction, and Christ is the meal offering for them to feed God and to feed themselves. Very few realize how much they need the peace offering and how much they need to come into the fellowship with the saints around the Lord's table to enjoy Him with God and before God and with one another. What most Christians know is just the so-called holy communion as a kind of sacrament and form.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEED TO GO FORWARD</H2><P>Many Christians, after their conversion at the cross, enjoyed Christ for a time, but then gradually went back to the world. They wouldn't go on. They wouldn't go forward. This is where the Lord's recovery is needed. To go forward to enter into the tabernacle means to enter into God's expression. This matter of going on has been mostly lost among Christians. As long as you remain outside of the tabernacle God has no expression. You have to get into the tabernacle to have God's expression. The cross is not God's expression. The cross is just an usher to bring you into God's tabernacle, God's expression. Today very few Christians who have enjoyed the cross of Christ would go on and go forward to enter into God's expression. The expression has been lost. This is why there is the need of the recovery. God's expression should be recovered to you. That means you should go on from the cross into the tabernacle, into the expression of God.</P><P>Once we go forward into the tabernacle we will reach the showbread table which has the heavenly bread, the bread of life. On the showbread table are many rows of bread, signifying Christ as our life and life supply.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST AS OUR LIFE SUPPLY</H2><P>At the altar in the outer court you can enjoy the meal offering, but it is not so enjoyable as eating of the showbread at the table. At the altar in the outer court there was not a table, but within the tabernacle there was a table. In John 6 we are told that Christ is the bread of life (v. 35), the bread from heaven (v. 50), the bread of God (v. 33), the living bread (v. 51), and the true bread (v. 32). This means that Jesus is the bread on the showbread table for us. You must realize that it is not in the outer court. It is within the tabernacle. It is within the expression of God. Unless you are in the expression of God, you could never enjoy Christ as the showbread on the table.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST AS THE LIGHT OF LIFE</H2><P>Once you have been satisfied by eating of the bread on the showbread table, you travel further. The enjoyment of life always turns you to light and always issues in light. When you enjoy Christ, right away you have light within. "In Him was life, and the life was the light of men" (John 1:4). When you enjoy Christ as your life supply you not only get the satisfaction, but also the enlightenment, the light. During the past few months many of us have practiced every morning to take the Lord as our sin offering and trespass offering at the altar. That sin offering and trespass offering brings us to the enjoyment of Christ as our daily life supply. When we enjoy Christ as our daily supply, right away we are under a kind of enlightening. Whatever we do is not in darkness. We live our daily life under the light. This is from the inner life. The inner life within us becomes our inner light.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST AS THE ARK</H2><P>From the shining of this light we go onward to enter through the veil and to the ark, which typifies Christ Himself. Within the ark are the two tablets of stone with the Ten Commandments, the pot with the hidden manna, and also Aaron's rod which budded in resurrection This means that within Him is the divine law, the hidden manna, and the budding life. At this ark you enjoy Christ so much!</P><P>You should have had this kind of experience already. When you take Christ as your sin offering and your trespass offering at the cross in the morning, you would be ushered during the day into the enjoyment of Christ at His table. This enjoyment would issue in light, so that you are living and walking in the light. This enlightenment then brings you to the ark, to the inner Christ. This is to enjoy Christ in the inner chambers which is the Holy of Holies. At least a few times you have experienced that when you were walking and living under the light you were full of regulations within. You were regulated by commandment one, commandment two, commandment three, etc. All the Ten Commandments were within you as the law of life regulating you. On the one hand you like to be here because it is so wonderful. But on the other hand you don't like to be here because you are so restricted. When you enjoy Christ in this way you are really bound. You are not free to lose your temper and be mad with your wife. You are not free to comb your hair the way you want to comb it. Within you there are so many commandments. This is the inner Ten Commandments. In the church life we don't have even one regulation, but when you enter into the veil, you enter into the Ten Commandments. But don't consider that this is too hard, because close to the Ten Commandments as the law of life there is a pot with hidden manna to supply you. So to be bound by the Ten Commandments is a kind of enjoyment because you can enjoy the hidden manna. Also when you enjoy the hidden manna something buds. The dead rod buds in life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST AT THE INCENSE ALTAR</H2><P>This kind of deeper experience would then send you to the incense altar to join with Christ and to be one with Him in His commission to intercede for God's economy. You would experience Christ's heavenly intercession. This is not to pray for a good job or a good car or a bigger house. This is to intercede with Christ for God's move on this earth.</P><P>We have to pass through all the things and to stay with Christ at the incense altar where we intercede with Christ and where we have Christ as the sweet incense burning unto God. This not only satisfies God but pleases God. At the offering altar in the outer court we satisfy God, but at the incense altar we please God. On the altar there is food, and on the incense altar there is the sweet smell of an incense ascending to God to please Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRIUNE GOD<br>MINGLED WITH HIS CHOSEN PEOPLE</H2><P>This is the contents of God's expression. When this is the situation in the church life, the glory will overshadow and fill the church to make the church a glorious expression of the Triune God. In this expression the very Triune God makes Himself one with His chosen people. This expression is a mingling of divinity with humanity. The Triune God has been wrought into His redeemed people to make Himself one with His people and to make His people one with Him. With the boards of the tabernacle, the wood and the gold are joined together. The wood is overlaid by the gold. That means the wood gets into the gold. This shows us that the Triune God is mingled together with His redeemed people.</P><P>This expression is a mutual abode where God abides in His people, and His serving people abide in Him. This is like the Lord's word in John 15:4 where He said, "Abide in Me and I in you." This is a kind of mingling. This mingling of divinity with humanity is God's expression on this earth. Such an expression has been missed and neglected by today's Christianity. Today the Lord is going to recover the real mingling of divinity with humanity so that God might have an expression on this earth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SUBJECTIVE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST</H2><P>If we would participate in God's expression or be God's expression, we must have the full and adequate experience of Christ. At the altar our experience of Christ is mostly objective. There are some subjective aspects because at the altar we could eat part of the meal offering and part of the peace offering. But when we enter into the tabernacle and come to the table, we can experience Christ altogether subjectively. At the altar the experience is partially without and partially within. But when we enter into the tabernacle and go to the table, we enjoy Christ altogether inwardly, taking Him as our food and life supply.</P><P>From the table we go to the lampstand where there is not the outward shining, but the inward shining. It is the shining of Christ from within us. Then we go to the ark. You can see that we are progressing more and more inward. We are entering not only within the tabernacle but also within the veil. We enter even into the ark itself until eventually we have the inmost experience. Here we experience Christ in the deepest sense. We do not only have some light but also the inner law of life regulating us inwardly. We get the supply in our inner life from the manna within the golden pot. The manna is not only within the tabernacle but also within the veil, within the golden ark and even within the golden pot. So it has four layers of covering. In order to enjoy this hidden manna you have to enter into that very spot. The enjoyment of Christ as the hidden manna was promised by the Lord to the overcomers (Rev. 2:17). We must be such lovers and seekers of the Lord that we could be overcomers to enjoy His riches in such an inward way, that we may bud with life to exercise His authority.</P><P>At this point we will then be one with Him at the interceding altar to intercede for God's move on the earth. We will intercede for the move of the tabernacle as it travels through the wilderness and enters into the good land to the very spot God intends it to be. The real experience of Christ is the way for us to enter into God's expression. This is what God wants to recover today. This is the very thing that has been lost through all the centuries. God has no intention to merely pick up small things, certain doctrines, or certain practices. God wants to recover the unique item in His recovery&#151;to express Himself within His people to the fullest.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FOUR</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CONTENTS OF GOD'S EXPRESSION<br>IN ITS REALITY</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(1)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Heb. 1:3a; John 1:18; 14:8-11, 16-20, 23; 15:4a, 5a, 7a; 16:13-15; 17:21; Matt. 28:18, 19; Gal. 3:27, 28; 2:20a; 4:19; Rom. 8:9-10; Eph. 4:6</H1><P>Prayer: Lord, how we thank You for Yourself. We do worship You for Yourself. Lord, we thank You for Your Word, the living Word which You have spoken to us in the Holy Scriptures. Lord, we thank You even tonight for this gathering. We trust in Your cleansing blood. Thank You for this precious blood which cleanses us all the time. Under this blood we do claim Your full anointing, and we believe right now we are under Your anointing. Thank You for the rich anointing. Lord, give us an open spirit. We are looking to You for a clear sky. Take away all the clouds. Take away all the veils. Take away all the conditional and traditional concepts. Lord, we pray You would bind the enemy and chase away the darkness from this hall. Fill this hall with Your glory, with Your presence, with Your love and grace. Lord, we thank You. We believe You are one with us and we are one spirit with You. Lord, do speak Your word in our speaking. Be one with us in this speaking. Anoint every attendant. Oh, visit everyone! Touch everyone! How we thank You for such a gathering with Your word. In Your precious name, amen.</P><P>In this message we come to the contents of God's expression in its reality. In recent messages on the Gospel of John, we pointed out that John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings. One crucial thing we pointed out is that the entire universe was created for God's expression. The invisible God desires to express Himself, and to express Himself He needs some vessels. First, He created the universe. The heavens are for the earth, and the earth is for man. After creating the heavens and the earth with all the items, God created man. Man was made in God's image so that one day God might enter into him. Romans 9:23 indicates we are clay vessels unto glory. Surely the clay vessels are to contain Him. God made us in His own image just as a glove is made in the form of a hand with the intention that one day a hand would get into the glove.</P><P>When God created man He created a spirit within him. We have a body outwardly, and we have a spirit inwardly. Between these two is our being, our soul. We are a person with an outward organ, the body, and an inward organ, the spirit. When we touch the material world we use our body. When we touch God and the spiritual things, we use our spirit. We cannot contact God by using our body. That is the wrong organ. God made us in His image with a spirit for us to receive Him so that He might come into us to be our life and our content. Then we will be His expression.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S EXPRESSION IN GENESIS</H2><P>This expression began with individuals in the Old Testament. The expression first began with Adam, but Adam fell. Then Abel was raised up to express God. To some extent Abel was successful in expressing God. Then Enosh called upon the name of the Eternal One Who was and Who is and Who is to be&#151;the great I Am, the great To Be. Then came Enoch who walked with God. Later Noah came on to the scene, not just to walk with God, but also to work with God and to have a common interest with God. Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob depict one complete person with Joseph as an annex to Jacob. In these four persons as a complete being, God was very much manifested. But these were just individuals, and God wants a corporate expression.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD'S EXPRESSION<br>THROUGH A COLLECTIVE PEOPLE</H2><P>In Exodus God came in to save His chosen people, a collective people. He saved, not one or two persons, but several million people. He delivered a collective people out of the tyranny of Pharaoh in Egypt. They were brought first to Mount Sinai to receive the revelation of the building of a tabernacle, so that the very God in the heavens could come down to dwell and to express Himself in a material dwelling place. From Exodus through Malachi is a history of this dwelling place of God. On the surface you may say that is the history of Israel. Actually that is the history of God's dwelling place. The Old Testament is so simple and clear. It had nine great men as landmarks of the human race and a people raised up to build a dwelling place for God on the earth for His expression. The entire universe was created by God with man as the center to express the eternal God. Yet what was revealed in the Old Testament was only the model. That was not the real structure.</P><P>The reality came in the New Testament, but it was the same in principle. First, an individual came who was unique. This was God Himself becoming a man, Jesus Christ. On the one hand, He is nothing less than God. He is our Creator. On the other hand, He is a man because He took our nature, our blood and flesh, upon Himself. He became incarnated in the flesh to be a real man. He is both God and man.</P><P>This wonderful One lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. What did He do? You might say that He did a lot of miracles and gave a lot of teachings. That is right but it is a kind of apprehension on the surface. If you get into the depth of the matter, you could see that He was expressing God. His entire life and His entire living on this earth was the very expression of God. No man has ever seen God, but this One declared God (John 1:18). This One is the effulgence of the divine glory, and this One is the express image of the divine substance (Heb. 1:3). How wonderful!</P><P>On one occasion three disciples went to the mountain with Him where they saw His glory (Luke 9:28-32). One of these three later wrote the Gospel of John and said, "We beheld His glory" (John 1:14). Whether He was doing some miracle, or whether He was teaching, He was the expression of the invisible God.</P><P>So the Bible tells us that Christ is the image of the invisible God (Col. 1:15). When we see Him, we see God. He is nothing less than God. He is the expression of God. John said that when He came in the flesh and dwelt among men, that was a tabernacle (1:14). John, of course, was writing to the Jewish people, and they all surely understood what he meant by a tabernacle. They knew that a tabernacle was a dwelling place for the God in the heavens to come down to the earth to dwell in for His expression.</P><P>The Jews, though, being blind due to their traditional religion, hated this One, and tried their best to kill Him. While they were trying to kill Him, this wonderful One told them to destroy the temple, and in three days He would raise it up (John 2:19). The New Testament tells us that Jesus Christ was destroyed on the cross. But when He raised Himself up He was no more Himself alone, but with all His believers. All His believers were resurrected with Him. Do you realize that we were raised up before we were born? This is a kind of divine and mysterious mathematics. Before we were born we were resurrected. This is according to Ephesians 2:5-6. The divine spiritual fact is that when Jesus Christ raised up Himself from the dead, He included all of us. In the resurrection of Christ a bigger temple was raised up. This bigger temple is the enlarged Christ; it is Christ increased. This increased Christ, this enlarged Christ, is just Christ Himself as the Head with the church as His Body. Ephesians 1 tells us that after His resurrection He ascended to the heavens where He was made the Head over all things to the church which is His Body, and this Body is the fullness of the unlimited One, the all-inclusive One, the all-extensive One who fills all in all. The church is the Body of such a One! What an immense church this is! This is Christ enlarged and increased.</P><P>In the New Testament there is just one great individual: Christ as the Head and the church as the Body. Through His death and resurrection He brought us all into Himself. The Jews had killed one person. They did not expect that by this killing Jesus would get enlarged. The one Person's expression of God was increased to a corporate expression of God. Today it is universally corporate. Around the globe Everywhere there are many Christians, many members of Christ. As a whole the aggregate of all these members is the Body of Christ, the church. This is the corporate expression of God. By His mercy and grace we are in this expression.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THINGS OPPOSING GOD'S EXPRESSION</H2><P>Today four negative things oppose God's expression: human culture, religion, ethics, and tradition. God created man to enjoy Him. God was man's portion, but in the fall man fell away from God and lost God, so man turned to his own invention, human culture. Humanly speaking, culture is not bad, yet it is a replacement of God. God should be everything to man&#151;his pleasure, his satisfaction, his protection. But man lost God, and man turned away from God to something else, human culture. Then in human culture, man discovered that he needs God. So in the human culture another item was invented, religion. In human culture there is an invention concerning the worship of God. As long as you are in the human race you worship something. Man was created to worship God. Whether people worship rightly or wrongly they have the need to worship something. This was discovered by human culture, and the invention of religion came in.</P><P>Furthermore, man likes to be right and to be good because God created something in man's nature that is good. Of course, according to our fallen nature, there is another tendency to do evil things, but according to God's created nature there is a tendency to do good. So through all the generations ethics and morality have been promoted. In China, Confucius was the greatest promoter of ethics.</P><P>From the culture, religion, and ethics a lot of tradition came out. Many of the traditions are not bad. But all these things&#151;culture, religion, ethics, and tradition&#151;are four layers upon your eyes to veil you from seeing Christ as God's expression. It is hard to convince the Chinese people to believe in Christ because Confucius' ethical teachings have become a thick veil upon the Chinese eyes. Likewise, the Jewish religion has become a thick veil preventing the Jews from believing in the Lord Jesus. They consider that they have the typical religion, a religion founded by Moses according to the Holy Scriptures. When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, for the last three and a half years He was opposed by the Jews mainly due to Judaism. By reading John 9 you can realize that the Pharisees thought of themselves as disciples of Moses. They had their inherited religion which was so typical, so right, and so holy, yet the Lord Jesus indicated that they were blind (vv. 39-41). Judaism had become a thick veil to them.</P><P>Today if you talk to people who are in the Catholic Church you will realize that Catholicism is a thick veil upon their eyes. One brother who was an altar boy in the Catholic Church got saved while he was in high school. He was so happy, and he went back to tell his parents and grandparents that he had the Lord Jesus. They pointed to the pictures of Jesus on their walls and told him that they had had Jesus for generations. They had Jesus in the kitchen. They had Jesus in the bedroom. They had Jesus everywhere, but not within them! Surely Jesus does not like to be hung upon the wall or carved or painted. The Lord Jesus wants to be within you, in your spirit. The Lord Jesus is not an idol, nor is He an image. The Lord Jesus today is on the throne in the heavens as the Lord of all and as the Head over all things, yet at the same time He is a living Spirit who can enter into our spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ANOTHER COMFORTER</H2><P>While the Lord Jesus was on the earth He was with twelve disciples, and He had a very intimate time with them. They lived together, they ate together, they walked together, and they worked together for three and a half years. The night He was betrayed He told them to their great surprise that He would leave and go away. He told them that if He did not go away He could not be in them. He had been incarnated, and He was among them. But this was not His goal, His destination. His goal was to enter into them. His destination was not to be among them but within them. He told them that He would go to the cross to be killed, but that He would ask the Father to give them another Comforter, the Spirit of reality (John 14:16-17). They had His physical presence temporarily among them and outside of them. But until He was crucified and resurrected, they did not have Him as their reality within them. He told them that if He went away, another Comforter would come who is the Spirit of reality. He would not only be with them but also in them. The Lord Jesus as the first Comforter could only be among them. What they needed was a second Comforter, actually just Himself as the Spirit of reality, to come and enter into them. He told them that His going away was His coming to be within them. He said, "I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you" (John 14:18). He went on to say, "In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you." Verses 16 and 17 say that the Comforter, the Spirit of reality, will be in you, and verse 20 says that I will be in you. Are these two or one? No one can figure this out. In the Bible you do have the divine mathematics.</P><P>We all know that God the Spirit is one, uniquely one. But in the book of Revelation, God the Spirit is the seven Spirits (Rev. 4:5). Is God the Spirit seven or one? He is one-seven and seven-one. This is the divine mathematics. Don't try to figure this out. This is why Martin Luther indicated that if you fully know the things concerning God, you must be God. We don't know the things so clearly. They are too mysterious.</P><P>John 14:16-20 says that the second Comforter who is the Spirit of reality will come to be with them and in them. And the Lord said that His coming is My coming. So this means that the Lord Himself will come and be in them on the day of resurrection. On that day they would know that He was in the Father, and they were in Him. and He was in them. Then who is in whom? He was in the Father. They shouldn't think that He was there without the Father. Even while He was with them, He was in the Father. But they were not in Him yet. On the day of resurrection they would know that He was in the Father and that they were in Him, and He was in them (v. 20). When they are in Him, they arc also in the Father, and He is in them. When He is in them. the Father also is in them. There is not only the coexistence among the Three of the Godhead, but also the coinherence. Each is in the other. I can testify that daily and hourly I experience this coinherence. I am living in my Lord, and He is in the Father) and He is also living in me. As He is living in me, the Father is also. Hallelujah! We all are in this mystery. This is for God's expression.</P><P>You have to put aside your culture, your religion, your ethical thought, and your tradition. Take off all these layers of veils. Some condemn this matter of the coinherence because they are blinded by their religious veils. Their blindness keeps them in darkness. They talk about religion and theology and the Bible in darkness.</P><P>What about culture? Galatians 3:27 and 28 say, "For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ. There cannot be Jew nor Greek, there cannot be slave nor free man, there cannot be male and female; for you are all one in Christ Jesus." Those who have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ, and they are all one. In this oneness there is no Jew and no Greek, there is no slave and no free man. This means there is no culture.</P><P>What about ethics? In Philippians 3 Paul tells us that he pursued Christ alone. It was not a matter of his own righteousness according to the law (Phil. 3:9). That is ethics. When you keep the commandment of the law to be moral and good, that is ethics. That had been Paul's pursuit in the past, but after he was saved his pursuit was a living Person, Christ. He was not pursuing the righteousness according to the law, but the living righteousness, which is the righteousness of God by faith, that is Christ the Person Himself.</P><P>In Galatians 1:14 Paul also told us that he was exceedingly zealous of the tradition of his fathers. This means he was zealous for the Jew's inherited tradition. But one day on the way to Damascus the Lord met him and knocked him down. From that day Paul began to know, not tradition, but a living Person. Paul did not pursue culture but the living Christ. He did not care for religion but the living Son of God. He was not zealous for ethics but the very Christ as his righteousness. He was Paul's righteousness and justification and sanctification. He was everything to Paul. He did not have ethics, but he was full of Christ. He did not have tradition; he had a present Christ, a living Christ, an up-to-date Christ.</P><P>Dear saints, this is the expression of God which to some extent has been lost, missed, neglected, and even opposed by today's Christianity. I know that I came from China, but my teaching is not Chinese, nor is it something of man. My teaching is just a quotation of the Holy Word. If you honor His Word, you surely would appreciate this kind of teaching. I don't care for the American pleasures and sports and entertainment and weekends. I only care for the Triune God, for the living Christ, and for the Holy Word. I don't care for theology or any creed. I only care for the living God with His living Son and His living Word.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A MUTUAL ABODE</H2><P>In John 14:23 the Lord Jesus went on to say, "If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him." The Father and the Son of the Trinity will go to this one who loves the Lord Jesus. What will They do? Will They empower him or make him powerful and full of impact? No! They will go to make an abode. The word abode here is the noun form of the verb abide. This abode is a mutual one. The lover becomes the Son's and the Father's dwelling place, and the Son and the Father become the lover's dwelling place.</P><P>In chapter fifteen, you have the mutual abiding: "Abide in Me and I in you" (15:4). So there is the mutual abiding in the mutual abode. How wonderful! Have you ever realized that in God's economy He wants to work out the matter of your abiding in Him, taking Him as your abode, so that He may abide in you, taking you as His abode. This is not just to live according to some Scriptures such as husbands love your wives, wives submit yourselves to your husbands, or love your neighbors as yourself. Before you love your wife and before you submit yourself to your husband and before you love your neighbors, you have to abide in Him and let Him abide in you. Let Him within you love your wife. Let Him within you submit to your husband. Let Him do everything in you and through you and with you and for you. This is the Christian life. If I love my wife by myself, that is the expression of me. If a wife submits to her husband by herself, that is just the expression of her. If you love all your neighbors by yourself, that is just you. All these are ethics, not the expression of God at all. But when you would say, "I have been crucified and buried. It is no more I that lives but Christ lives in me. It is not I but Christ who loves my wife. It is not I but Christ who submits to my husband. It is not I but Christ loving the neighbors through me, in me, with me, and for me." These are not merely the real ethics, but also the expression of God. This is the reality that expresses God. This very reality has been lost in today's Christianity, but the Lord is going to recover it. The Lord's recovery is not to recover certain doctrines and practices, but to recover the Triune God being wrought into your being to express Him in your daily walk and in the church life.</P><P>When these kinds of persons who live Christ in their daily walk come together you have an aggregate. The aggregate is the church life, and the aggregate church life is the reality of the expression of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IN THE SON AND IN THE FATHER</H2><P>Now we come to John 17:1 which says, "These things Jesus spoke, and lifting up His eyes to heaven, He said, Father, the hour has come; glorify Your Son that the Son may glorify You." In verse 21 He prayed, "That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us, that the world may believe that You have sent Me." This is not a prayer for healing or for good fortune. He prayed that all the disciples would be one even as He and the Father are one. This prayer has not been answered yet in full.</P><P>So many of the real Christians today, who have been spirit-regenerated and blood-washed, do not know that the Lord's prayer was for them to be in the Son as well as in the Father. This is too deep and too mysterious! Just as the Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father, so all the believers in the Son may be in both the Son and the Father. This is deep and profound, yet it should be a fact. And this fact is just the expression of God. When we live a life that is in the Son and the Father and a life letting the Son and the Father live in us, this life is the expression of God. This is the thing that the Lord prayed for and is recovering today.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A SPIRITUAL UNION WITH HIM</H2><P>In John 20:22 the Lord Jesus breathed into the disciples and told them to receive the Holy Spirit. After forty days He told the disciples that all authority in the heavens and the earth had been given to Him and that they should go in His name to disciple the nations. Then they should baptize those into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:18-19). M. R. Vincent, in his Word Studies in the New Testament, tells us clearly that the preposition "into" implies a spiritual and mystical union. We were outside of the Triune God, but through baptism, we were baptized into the Triune God, into a spiritual and mystical union with Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>BAPTIZED INTO A PERSON</H2><P>The name mentioned here is not a vain name. Mr. Vincent goes on to say that the name is equivalent to His Person. If there is no Person the name would be empty. To baptize the believer into the name means to put them into the Person. This is confirmed by Galatians 3:27 which says, "For as many as were baptized into Christ have put on Christ." This proves that to be baptized into the name of the Triune God means to be baptized into the Person of the Triune God. We all have been baptized into Christ, and now we all wear Christ upon our being. This means that we and Christ are one. Here in this oneness there is only Christ. There is no Jew or Greek or slave or free man. There is no man of culture or man of race. All are one in Christ Jesus.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST FORMED IN US</H2><P>Galatians 2:20 says, "I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me." Furthermore, Paul was travailing until Christ would be formed in the believers (Gal. 4:19). Christ not only needs to live in us, but also to be formed in us. To have Christ formed in us means to have Christ saturate every part of our inner being&#151;our mind, our emotion, our will, our thinking. Christ may be in you, but He is still not formed in you. Christ needs to be formed within you so that you can express God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRIUNE GOD IN US</H2><P>Romans 8 tells us that the Spirit of God is in us, the Spirit of Christ is in us, and the Spirit of the One who raised up Jesus from among the dead is in us. Colossians 1:27 tells us that Christ the Son is in us, and Ephesians 4:6 tells us that the Father also is in us. So the Son is in us, the Spirit is in us, and the Father is in us. The Father is not only in us, but above us and through us. How wonderful! The Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;is in us so that we might be His expression. When we love, it must be the Triune God loving in us, with us, and through us. When we are speaking it must be the Triune God speaking in us, through us, and with us. The church life is just the Triune God doing everything in us, through us, and with us. Such a church life is the expression of God. This is the central thing that the Lord is going to recover. The Lord has no intention to recover the trivial things. The Lord is working to recover the Triune God wrought into our being and living in us, with us, and through us for His expression. This expression is just the church life.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER FIVE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CONTENTS OF GOD'S EXPRESSION<br>IN ITS REALITY</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 7:38-39; 20:21-22; 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17-18; Rom. 8:2, 9-11, 16; 1 Cor. 1:30; 3:16-17; 6:17; 2 Cor. 13:14; Eph. 1:19-23; 3:14-19; 4:4-6, 22-24; Titus 3:5-6; Phil. 1:19-21a; 3:7-11; 4:13; Col. 2:9; 3:4, 9b-11; 1 Tim. 3:15, 16</H1><P>God's eternal purpose is to express Himself fully in and through man. He created Adam for this purpose, but Adam fell. Abel was brought back to God by offering the proper sacrifices. After those two landmarks, Enosh, Enoch, Noah, Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph followed as individuals to express God. Yet what God wanted was not an expression through individuals only. He wanted a corporate expression. So after Joseph died, in Exodus God gained a collective people to express Him corporately. This people was eventually built up together to be His dwelling place. The sign of this was the tabernacle which was God's dwelling place on this earth. First it was a tabernacle, and eventually it became a temple. If you pick up these nine great men plus the tabernacle and temple you cover the entire Old Testament.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>CHRIST ENLARGED AND INCREASED</H2><P>The New Testament began with a person, an individual. This individual is a marvelous, wonderful, and all-inclusive Person who is both God and man. That is Jesus Christ. He came to dwell among man as a tabernacle to declare the invisible, unseen God (John 1:14, 18). The unseen, invisible God has been fully expressed in this man, Jesus Christ, as God's tabernacle among men. But again God was not satisfied with just one man as a tabernacle. God wanted a collective people to be His tabernacle. So the Lord Jesus told His disciples that He was going to die and be raised up that He might be enlarged and increased (John 12:24). The way for Him to be enlarged and increased was to change in form. When He was the tabernacle on this earth among man, He was in the form of flesh. But in the flesh He had no way to enter into His believers so that they could be His increase. In order to enter into so many believers, He needed to change His form from the flesh to the Spirit.</P><P>In John 1, the One who was the Word of God, which was God Himself, became flesh. This is so mysterious! He became a material flesh, which is visible and touchable. But after His death and resurrection He came back to His disciples in another form. You may say that He came back in the form of the Spirit, but He also had a spiritual body. He showed His disciples His hands and His side (John 20:20), indicating clearly that after resurrection He still had a body, but not in the natural form. It was not a natural body, but a spiritual body.</P><P>The Apostle Paul in 1 Corinthians 15:35-38 illustrated such a change in form, such a transformation, by a seed. A seed has a form, and it may be yellow or brown, and round like a little ball. If you sow this seed into the earth it dies there. Then it rises up, or it grows up. To rise up is to be resurrected from the dead. When this seed grows up, the form changes. It still has a form, but it changes from a little round yellow or brown ball into the form of a sprout, so tender and green and lovable. It is still the same seed, but in another form. This is marvelous! When it gets into this changed form, it grows and also produces. It increases from one grain to thirty or sixty or a hundred.</P><P>This is a good illustration of the Lord Jesus being crucified, being buried, and rising up. When He rose up He was no more in the original form. He was no more merely an individual grain. John 12:24 says that He was the one grain which fell into the earth. But after rising up He was no more a single grain. He rose up to grow and produce many grains. Who are the many grains? They are all the members of His Body as His increase. This is mysterious, yet we can see it in nature all the time. In the natural things such as a grain falling into the earth and rising up, we can see such a mystery. Before falling into the earth it is one grain, but after falling into the earth and rising up, it becomes many grains. The many grains are the increase of the original grain.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A MYSTERIOUS AND WONDERFUL FORM</H2><P>After His resurrection He came back to the disciples in another form. He was touchable. He had a body, yet in another form, a mysterious and wonderful form which we cannot explain. After the Lord Jesus was crucified and buried, all the disciples were fully disappointed. While they were meeting together in the night with the doors closed for fear of the Jews, the Lord Jesus appeared to them. He did not knock at the door, and they did not open the door. While they were under the threatening of the Jews and while they were so sorrowful, suddenly He appeared among them. Right away He said, "Peace be to you" (John 20:19). What a wonderful word! They had had no peace at all. They were sorrowful because of His death, they were also threatened by the Jews to the uttermost, and now they were probably even threatened by His sudden appearance. So He said to them, "Peace be to you." He showed them His hands and His side, and the disciples realized He was not a phantom, but that He was their beloved Lord. What kind of body did the Lord Jesus have? Was this a physical and material body? Surely it was because it was touchable. But if it was physical and material how could He come into the room without any opening? You cannot systematize such a wonderful, mysterious fact in your theology. He was material and physical, yet spiritual. He was spiritual, yet material. He was material because He was touchable, and He was spiritual because He came in without the door being opened.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>COINHERENCE WITH GOD FOR HIS EXPRESSION</H2><P>In John 1 the invisible God became a visible flesh. This was good because formerly God was invisible, and now He is visible. On the other hand, it was not so good because He was limited by being in the flesh. He could not enter into His disciples. He could not be one with them in a kind of coinherence. He could not live in them that they might live in Him. That was impossible as long as He was in the flesh.</P><P>How could He enter into you and take you as His abode, and how could you enter into Him and take Him as your abode? As long as He is in the flesh it is impossible. What the Lord wants is a kind of coinherence between Him and you. He wants to live in you so that you may live in Him, and you will live within one another. This is a kind of coinherence. Coinherence means this one lives in that one, and that one lives in this one. Eventually they are two and yet one. This is marvelous! This is what God wants. God wants to get into you that you may be in Him. While He abides in you, you abide in Him. He and you become one, and yet are still two. This kind of coinherence is just the expression of God.</P><P>The invisible God became the visible flesh. Yet this flesh can never enter into us, so He had to change in form to become in the form of the Spirit. This spiritual form is very mysterious. No one can figure out how it could be spiritual and yet material, material and yet spiritual. Yet our very God did become such a Spirit. When He came in, the disciples did not realize at first that it was He. But then He said, "Peace be to you." After speaking this He breathed into them and told them to receive the Holy Pneuma, the Holy Spirit, the Holy Air (John 20:22). After breathing into them He did not say goodbye, and He did not go out of the door. He simply disappeared. Isn't this wonderful? Actually He had not come to them; He had just appeared. To say that He came is not so right. He simply appeared. To say that He left is not right either. He did not leave, He simply disappeared. He was still there, but within them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE LORD'S INVISIBLE PRESENCE</H2><P>Even today He is here, but He would not appear to us. According to our weakness we all would like to see Him appear. But you have to realize that His appearing is not so good as His not appearing. The Lord Jesus came to train His disciples to realize His invisible presence because they were used to His visible appearance. They never had the experience of His invisible presence. So the Lord Jesus came to train them by appearing to them and then by disappearing. Where did He go after He disappeared? He remained in them. From that time He never left, but Peter and all the other disciples did not realize this. Soon they became disappointed again, and Peter said he was going fishing (John 21:3). When he went fishing all the others went fishing with him. They didn't realize that when they went fishing they took the Lord Jesus with them because He was in them. Suppose you go to a movie. Do you realize that when you go to a movie you take the Lord Jesus there because He is within you? While they were fishing, the Lord Jesus was suffering. It may be that the Lord Jesus did something to keep all the fish away, because they fished the entire night and caught nothing.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TWO STEPS OF BECOMING</H2><P>Through His death and resurrection He became a Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45b says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. The last Adam is not so simple as the first one. The first Adam did not have God in him, but the last Adam was God becoming flesh. This is very meaningful. The last Adam was a God-man. The good news is that after Him there is no more Adam, because He was the last Adam! You may ask then, Am I not an Adam? In Adam you are an Adam, but in this last Adam you are no more an Adam. The last Adam was the ending of Adam.</P><P>The last Adam who was God becoming a man became the Spirit. There are two "becames" with Him. The Word became flesh, and this flesh was the last Adam, and this last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. Without these two steps He could never get into us. He became flesh first to dwell among men, and then He became the Spirit to dwell in His believers. He reaches us by two steps of becoming. First, He as God became a man to be the last Adam, and second, this last Adam became a Spirit to enter into us. The last Adam in the flesh went to the cross to redeem us and to solve all the problems of sin and sins. After solving those problems He became the life-giving Spirit to impart Himself into us as life.</P><P>First, the Word became flesh and dwelt among men to be the Lamb of God to take away the sin of the world (John 1:29). After taking away the sin of the world as the Lamb of God, He took another step to become the life-giving Spirit. Today He is both the Lamb, the Redeemer and the Spirit, the life giver. He is both! Most Christians today only know a gospel of Christ as the Lamb. They do not know a gospel of Christ as the life-giving Spirit. They only know that Christ is the Lamb of God taking away the sin of the world. They do not realize that the same Christ is also the Spirit to give life. He is both the Lamb to take away sin and the Spirit to give life. If He were just the Lamb to take away sin, that would not be adequate. We may illustrate with the altar in the tabernacle. Just to come to the altar to solve your sin problem is not adequate. If you only come to the altar, you are still not in the expression of God. You must enter into the tabernacle to be in God's expression. How can you enter into the tabernacle? The Redeemer who has become the life-giving Spirit has to enter into you, and then He becomes the very way of life for you to enter into God. Today He is no more merely the Lamb, the Redeemer, to take away our sins. He is also the Spirit that gives us life. In John 10:10 He said that He came that we might have life and even have it abundantly. But if He had never entered into resurrection how could He give us life? It would be impossible. He had to enter into resurrection that He might become the life-giving Spirit. Today He is not only the Redeemer, but also the life giver. Now in resurrection He is the life-giving Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>SATURATED BY THE LORD SPIRIT</H2><P>Thus far we have seen that our Redeemer, the Second of the Trinity, has become a life-giving Spirit. So here is a verse, 2 Corinthians 3:17, which says, "And the Lord is the Spirit." Who is the Lord? From the context of 2 Corinthians chapters two, three, and four you can realize that the Lord here is Jesus Christ (4:5). After His resurrection the Lord Jesus Christ is the Spirit. Verse 17 of chapter three goes on to say that where the Spirit of the Lord is there is freedom. This means there is freedom from law, from religion, from culture, from the concept of ethics, from traditions.</P><P>After being freed you come to verse 18: "And we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit." In the last chapter we saw that we have four layers of veils: culture, religion, ethics, and tradition. But after all the veils are gone we can see the Lord Jesus with an unveiled face. We behold Him as a mirror, and at the same time we reflect Him. By this we are being transformed into His image for His expression. We are being transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another degree of glory. How could this be? It is by the Lord Spirit. First, in verse 17 it says that the Lord is the Spirit. It goes on to use the phrase, "the Spirit of the Lord," and then verse 18 uses the term, "the Lord Spirit." These are one. The Lord is the Spirit, and the Spirit of the Lord is the Lord Spirit. This means that after the Lord becomes the life-giving Spirit He enters into us to free us from all kinds of veils. Then day after day as we behold Him and reflect Him, we are being transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another degree of glory by Him, the Lord Spirit, for God's expression. We just need to let Him saturate us and permeate us. The more we behold Him and the more we reflect Him, the more He saturates and permeates us to transform us into His own image, that we might express God. This is not only the Lord mingling with us, this is also the Lord saturating us and even soaking us.</P><P>A good example of the soaking and saturating is the making of tea. To make tea you take a cup of boiling water and put a tea bag into it. The tea saturates the water until all the water is soaked with the tea. Eventually the water becomes tea-water. Even we don't call it water; we call it tea. It is actually more water than it is tea, but the water has been saturated by and with the tea. The saturating tea causes the water to become tea. The saturating tea is like Christ. When the tea is put into the water, the water is teaified. When Christ comes into us and saturates us, we are "Christified." Christ as the life-giving Spirit saturates us until we are Christified. By being Christified, we become Christ. This is why we are Christians. Christ has come into us and has Christified us so that we are now Christians. Christians are simply Christ. This is the corporate Christ as the expression of God.</P><P>This is the Lord's recovery. The Lord has no intention to recover the wearing of long skirts or long sleeves. The Lord has no intention to recover a plain face without any makeup. The Lord has no intention to merely recover immersion or speaking in tongues. These are the minor things. The Lord's intention is to recover Christification! You need to be Christified. Wonderful! What is the church life? The church life is the glorious Christification. What is the Lord's recovery? It is to Christify every believer until he has a total Christification. This Christification is just the expression of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SPIRIT</H2><P>Now let us go on to Romans 8. This chapter talks much about the Spirit. It speaks of the Spirit of life (8:2), the Spirit of God (8:9), the Spirit of Christ (8:9). the Spirit of the One who raised Christ from among the dead (8:11), and eventually the Spirit (8:16). Verse sixteen says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. What Spirit witnesses with our spirit? It is the Spirit of life, the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, the Spirit of the One who raised Christ from among the dead, and the Spirit. The Spirit is the shortest title ascribed to God's Spirit, yet it is the most meaningful one. Even John 7:39 just used the term, the Spirit. Before Jesus' resurrection, the Spirit was not yet. But after His resurrection, the Spirit of reality came. So in Romans 8 you have the Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>PUT INTO CHRIST THE SPIRIT</H2><P>First Corinthians 1:30 says that it is of God we are in Christ Jesus. This means that God has put us into Christ that Christ might be our wisdom, our righteousness, our sanctification, and our redemption. How could a person be your wisdom, your righteousness, your sanctification, or your redemption unless that person becomes one with you? God has put us into Christ. Christ is our wisdom. Christ is our righteousness. Christ is our sanctification, and Christ is our redemption. Christ is everything to us! Since God has put us into Him, He has become everything to us. For God to put us into Christ, Christ has to be a Spirit. Because Christ has become a Spirit, God could put us into this Spirit and this Spirit could be the wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption within us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TEMPLE OF GOD</H2><P>Now we come to 1 Corinthians 3:16-17 which says that we are the temple of God. Not only is Christ Himself the temple, but all of us who are in Christ and who have Christ in us are the temple to contain God and to express God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ONE SPIRIT WITH THE LORD</H2><P>First Corinthians 6:17 says that we are joined to this wonderful Lord. We are one spirit with Him. When we are speaking or doing anything, we must believe that we are one spirit with Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRIUNE GOD FOR OUR ENJOYMENT</H2><P>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." This is the Triune God for our enjoyment. With Christ the Son there is grace, with God the Father there is love, and with God the Spirit there is fellowship. This is our portion, our enjoyment. This is not just a kind of benediction. This is the grace of Christ, the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit with us for our enjoyment. This is the reality of God's expression. The Lord wants to recover this.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE DIVINE POWER WITHIN US AS A DYNAMO</H2><P>Let us go on to Ephesians 1:19-23. These verses are too profound! They tell us that there is a divine power. In Greek it means a dynamo. God exercises upon us this very power by which He raised up the Lord Jesus from the dead and exalted Him to the top of the universe, subduing and subjecting all things under His feet, and making Him the Head over all things to the church. This church is His Body, and His Body is the fullness, the overflowing, the expression of the all-inclusive One who fills all in all. This is marvelous! This is the church. This is the kind of church the Lord is going to recover. This is the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, who is in resurrection, in exaltation, in the headship. How could this be? The only way is that this One has to saturate us with His resurrection and His exaltation and His headship. When He Christifies us, by saturating us, He does it with all the attributes of the all-inclusive Christ. Christ is the motor, the dynamo in the church life. If there is no dynamo in the church life, it is dead and empty. That is not the church the Lord wants to recover. The Lord wants to recover a church with a dynamo.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>FILLED UNTO ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD</H2><P>In Ephesians 3:16-18 Paul prayed that the Father would strengthen the believers with power through the Spirit into the inner man so that Christ the Son could make His home in the believers. This is so that they might be filled unto all the fullness of the Triune God. The Father strengthens through the Spirit so that the Son could make home. This is the Triune God getting Himself fully settled in your inner being to fill your mind and emotion and will, and even to fill every corner of your conscience and heart and spirit. He wants to fill you so that every part of your entire being might be filled unto overflowing with the Triune God. This is the reality of God's expression. This is what the Lord wants to recover.</P><P>The Lord does not want to recover the trivial doctrines or practices. What He wants to recover is that the Father would strengthen us through the Spirit into our inner man, that the Son, the all-inclusive One, might make His home and get Himself fully settled into our heart, into every part of our inner being, so that our whole being will be filled unto the overflowing of the Triune God to become an expression of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EMBODIMENT OF THE TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>Ephesians 4:4-6 tells us that there is one Body and one Spirit and one hope of our calling. There is one Lord, one faith, one baptism. There is one God and Father of all who is over all, through all, and in all. With one Body and one Spirit there is one hope. The Lord is going to recover a church filled, saturated, and mingled with the Spirit, full of hope. Such a church is one with the Lord through faith in baptism that God the Father may be above them and through them and in them all the time. This is a church which is the embodiment of the Triune God, mingled with the Spirit, one with the Lord, fully mingled with the Father who is above them, through them, and in them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>RENEWED WITH A NEW ELEMENT</H2><P>Verses 22-24 of chapter four tell us that such a church which is mingled with the Spirit, one with the Lord, and saturated with the Triune God is being renewed. To be renewed is to drop the old element and to replace the old element with the new. We have to drop the elements of culture, of religion, of ethics, and of traditions. In the church life there is a kind of life metabolism causing us to drop the old and to replace the old with the new. Everyday we can enjoy something new. This is not to enjoy some new thought or new teaching, but a new element from the divine source which is the Triune God. This will saturate us to replace the old and to discharge the old. The old element will be discharged and replaced by the new element of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>WASHED AND RENEWED</H2><P>Titus 3:5 and 6 read: "Not by works in righteousness which we have done but according to His mercy, He saved us, through the washing of regeneration and renewing of the Holy Spirit, Whom He poured out on us richly through Jesus Christ our Savior." In the church life our being is washed. That washing is the washing from the regeneration. While we are being washed, we are being renewed by the Spirit. The old nature has to go. The old man has to be washed away, but the new element has to be added in by the renewing Spirit.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EXCELLENCY OF CHRIST</H2><P>In Philippians 1:19-21 Paul only cared for the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ which would turn out to his salvation. He didn't care for imprisonment or death. He only cared that Christ was being magnified in him. To him to live was Christ. This is the expression of God. In chapter three of the same book Paul indicated that formerly he had treasured certain things, especially the righteousness from keeping the law, but now he counted everything refuse, dog food. Now he had only one pursuit, to pursue after Christ. He wanted to live Christ, to live in Him, and to be found by others in Christ. He wanted to be in Christ, having Christ as his righteousness and his everything. His longing was to know Him. Just to know Him is excellent. Paul wanted to know Him and the power of His resurrection. Paul also said in Philippians 4:13 that in the One who empowers him he could do everything.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE EMBODIMENT OF GOD</H2><P>By reading Colossians 2:9 we can realize that the very Christ who is Christifying us is the very embodiment of God. The fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily. He is Christifying us with the fullness of the Godhead to make us the full expression of God. In 3:4 we have this One as our life and in 3:10 we are being renewed to be a new man in which there is no race, no social rank, and no culture. Christ is all and in all. He is all and in all the members. In every race and in every color there is nothing but Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>GOD MANIFESTED IN THE FLESH</H2><P>Finally we come to 1 Timothy 3:15-16 where we see that the church is the house of the living God. Great is this mystery. Everyone confesses that God is manifested in such a church which is the very expression of the Triune God. This is what the Lord wants to recover today.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SIX</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE PRACTICALITY AND CONSUMMATION<br>OF GOD'S EXPRESSION</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rev. 1:4-5a, 9-20; 2:7, 17; 3:12, 20; 4:5; 5:6; 21:1-3; 22:1-2, 14, 17</H1><P>In the foregoing messages we have covered the matter of God's expression beginning from the first chapter of Genesis and almost through the entire Bible. Now we come to the last book, the book of Revelation. In this book you have two main categories of things: first, you have the church with its consummation, which is the New Jerusalem. This is what God wants. Second, you have all the things other than the church in the entire universe, which will be judged, condemned, and burned. There is no third category. Everything that is in the first category is for eternity and will consummate in the new city of living water, the New Jerusalem, the eternal tabernacle, as God's full expression for eternity. Whatever is not in the church and its consummation will be burned in the lake of fire. In the Bible there are two sources, two lines, two flows, two ways, and two results.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TWO SOURCES AND TWO RESULTS</H2><P>What are these two sources? If you go back to Genesis 2 you can see that the tree of life is the positive source, and the tree of knowledge is the negative source. The tree of life brings in the line of life, the flow of life, and the way of life, and it results in the new city of living water where the tree of life grows. It begins with life, and it ends with life. And the issue is the new city, the eternal tabernacle, the full expression of God.</P><P>The other line is on the negative side. It begins at the tree of knowledge and ends at the lake of fire. From the beginning to the end there is a line of God's judgment. This began from the time that the fire came from the heavens upon Sodom and Gomorrah (Gen. 19:24) and continues to this day. In Matthew 3:10-12, 1 Corinthians 3:13, Hebrews 6:8, and Hebrews 12:29 there is the fire. Eventually and consummately in Revelation 20 and 21 there is the lake of fire. It is no more just a flow; the flow issues in a lake. The lake of fire is the result of all God's judgment. All God's judgment through the centuries brings the judged things burned by His fire into the lake of fire.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A BOOK OF LIFE</H2><P>The book of Revelation is a continuation of what John revealed in his Gospel and in his Epistles. The Gospel of John mainly reveals to us the matter of the divine life. The divine life is nothing less than the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;as our life and our life supply. The life revealed in John's Gospel is too divine, too mysterious, too high!</P><P>In John's three Epistles he reveals more mysteries of the divine life such as the divine fellowship, the divine abiding, the divine anointing, the divine birth, the divine seed. Because the Gospel of John and the Epistles of John are on the divine life, we should not consider that the Revelation of John is different. John was a writer who revealed the divine life. We must consider that his last book should also be on the divine life. For example, the entire Bible is on the tree of life. Right after God created man, He brought him to the tree of life. The Bible begins in Genesis with the tree of life and it ends in Revelation with the tree of life. This is because the entire Bible is a book of life.</P><P>We have covered many crucial verses in this message and the two previous messages. If possible you had better study those verses, remember them, recite them, and pray-read them again and again. It is better to do it each month for two years. See what will come out. I assure you that you will see something. These are the crucial verses in the Bible. You need to eat them and digest them, taking every verse into your being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A CONCLUSION TO THE WHOLE BIBLE</H2><P>Now we come to the consummation of God's expression. The book of Revelation is an issue of the entire Bible. Without the book of Revelation the entire Bible has no conclusion. If you know what is in Revelation, you could see that nearly all of the signs included in the Old Testament are here. The first sign in Revelation is the lampstands. The lampstand was mentioned in Exodus the first time (Exo. 26:31-40), the second time in 1 Kings (7:49), and the third time in Zechariah (4:2-10). If you don't have the book of Revelation you cannot know what is the real issue, the real outcoming, of the lampstand.</P><P>The last sign in Revelation is the New Jerusalem, a city built foursquare with three gates on each side. The New Jerusalem was also revealed in Ezekiel. At the end of the book of Ezekiel there is a city by the name of Jerusalem having four sides with three gates on each side, and all the twelve tribes' names written there (Ezek. 48:31-34). Between the lampstands in Revelation 1 and the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 and 22, there are the tree of life and the manna (2:7, 17). The tree of life was also mentioned in Genesis, and the manna was mentioned in Exodus 16.</P><P>Another item which was in the Old Testament and which consummates in the New Testament is the Lamb of God. John mentioned the Lamb of God in chapter one when he said, "Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!" The lamb was also mentioned in Genesis 22 when Abraham offered his son Isaac on the altar. God came in and stopped him, and when Abraham turned he saw a ram which he offered instead of his son Isaac. There is also the Passover lamb in Exodus 12. The consummation of the lamb is in Revelation 22:1, where the river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</P><P>There are also the seven lamps in Revelation. The seven lamps and the seven Spirits of God were already mentioned in Zechariah 4. The four living creatures in Revelation were in Ezekiel 1. Nearly everything in the book of Revelation can be found in the Old Testament because Revelation is a conclusion to the entire Bible. If you would understand the book of Revelation, you have to understand the entire Bible. The book of Revelation is the issue, not only of John's writings, but also of the entire Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>ITEMS OF THE ISSUE</H2><P>First of all, at the end of this age God will have local churches on this earth which are lampstands. The term local church is not mentioned in Revelation, but in 1:11 John writes to the seven churches in seven cities, indicating that seven churches are equal to seven cities. John did not write to a street church or a home church or a community church or a church on the campus. John wrote to seven churches in seven cities. Asia was an ancient province of the old Roman Empire. It was like a state. As a province it could have more than one church. But each city within this province could have only one church. According to history Ephesus was a large city at that time, but it had only one church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HIM WHO WAS, WHO IS, AND WHO IS COMING</H2><P>John's tone in his greeting to the churches is different from Paul's greetings in his Epistles. For example in Galatians 1:3 Paul says, "Grace to you and peace from God our Father and our Lord Jesus Christ." But John in Revelation 1:4-5 says, "Grace to you and peace from Him Who is, and Who was, and Who is coming, and from the seven Spirits Who are before His throne, and from Jesus Christ, the faithful Witness, the Firstborn of the dead, and the Ruler of the kings of the earth." Who is the One Who is and Who was and Who is coming? This is Jehovah of the Old Testament. This is the Jehovah who is the great I Am. When Moses asked the name of God, God answered, "I Am. that I Am." He is the verb To Be. He is the great To Be Besides Him, everything is nothing. He is the only existing One. In the past He Was, in the present He Is, and in the coming days He Will Be. He is To Be. This is Jehovah.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE SEVEN SPIRITS OF GOD</H2><P>In the book of Revelation the one Spirit of God becomes the seven Spirits (1:4; 4:5). How can the one Spirit become seven? In this book the seven Spirits are the seven lamps of fire burning before the throne (Rev. 4:5). The lampstand has two aspects. Looking from the top you may count seven lamps, but looking from the bottom there is one lampstand. This means the lampstand is seven-one and one-seven. A good illustration is a three-way lamp. If you only need a little light you turn the switch in one way. If you need more light you turn the switch again. If you need still more light you turn the switch once more. How marvelous it would be if we could buy a seven-way lamp! The shining of the lampstand in Revelation is intensified seven times because today is a day of darkness and the sight of God's people is so weak. In the Gospels God's Spirit was uniquely one, but in Revelation this one Spirit becomes seven. This is not seven in substance, but seven in function. It is still one, but its function is sevenfold intensified. The Spirit of God today is the seven Spirits.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A FAITHFUL WITNESS AND THE RULER OF<br>THE KINGS OF THE EARTH</H2><P>Revelation 1:5 also mentions that Jesus Christ is the faithful Witness. While He was on the earth He was a witness of God. He was resurrected from the dead, and today He is the Ruler of the kings of the earth. You don't need to worry about the world situation. All of the rulers of the earth are under our Ruler. This is why His calendar is the universal calendar. Even those atheistic Communist countries who are opposing Christ use His calendar. He is the King of kings. He is the Ruler of all the kings.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GOLDEN LAMPSTANDS</H2><P>By these examples you can see that the book of Revelation has a special tone. In such a tone what God wants today is a church in every city as the practicality of God's expression. Every local church in this book is a lampstand. The lampstand is the embodiment of the Triune God. With the lampstand there are three things: the substance, which is pure gold. The substance is not made of wood nor of mud, but of pure gold. In the biblical figures gold signifies the divine nature of God the Father. So in the lampstand there is God the Father as the substance. Second, the golden lampstand is not just a formless piece of gold. It is gold formed and shaped into the form of a lampstand. The form, the embodiment, of the Triune God is the Second of the Trinity. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in this Second of the Trinity bodily (Col. 2:9). Jesus Christ is the form of God. This is God the Son. So there is the substance of the Father and the form of the Son.</P><P>Third, there is the expression of the lampstand. The lampstand is for shining, and the shining is the expression. The expression is seven lamps. The Bible tells us clearly, not only in Revelation, but also in Zechariah that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits (Zech. 4:2, 6; Rev. 4:5). The substance of the lampstand is God the Father. The form and the embodiment of the lampstand is God the Son. The expression of the lampstand is God the Spirit. So the lampstand is just the embodiment of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. This is the church. The church is the lampstand which is the embodiment of the Triune God. By this you can see what a local church is. A local church is one that has God the Father as its substance, God the Son as its embodiment, and God the Spirit as its shining, its expression.</P><P>It is right to say that the Lord's recovery is to recover the local church, but it depends upon your understanding. If you simply mean that the local church is a group of Christians meeting without a name in a city, not being a denomination, not having a pastor, sitting in four directions instead of one, with everyone standing up to function, that is not adequate. Such a local church may be of the Lord's recovery, or it may not be. It all depends upon the reality. What is the reality of the local church? It is the substance of the Father, the embodiment of the Son, and the expression of the Spirit.</P><P>Suppose an outsider visits a local church and he hears the older sisters gossiping and the younger sisters murmuring. He sees the elders debating and the brothers complaining. Is this the condition of a golden lampstand? This is a muddy lampstand. When there is gossiping and murmuring and debating and reasoning, where is the substance of the Father, where is the embodiment of the Son, and where is the shining expression of the Spirit? Among Christians today it is very difficult to find the proper situation of a golden lampstand which has the substance of the Father, the embodiment of the Son, and the shining of the Spirit. If you go to most Christian groups today you mainly find politics and nice manners.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A FULL REALIZATION OF THE DIVINE LIFE</H2><P>This means that the divine life has never been realized adequately and fully by a group of Christians. When people come to a local church they must see the full realization of the divine life. They should not see a kind of behavior and a kind of performance. They should just see people living Christ. They should just see people who are in the full realization of the divine life. The divine life should be fully realized in the local church. Such a realization of the divine life swallows up all gossiping, murmuring, reasoning, and debating. It swallows up backbiting and politics. God does not want to see good manners and politics in the church life. He wants to see Himself expressed from within you. This is the golden lampstand. This is the practicality of God's expression. Today God wants to recover such a lampstand in many leading cities on this earth. He wants to have such a shining church, golden and pure. It is, no doubt, a composition of human beings, but all these human beings are saturated with the heavenly gold. The substance of the divine Father becomes their very being. Their very being is in the form of Jesus Christ. And what they express is not just a nice behavior, but the shining Spirit, a sevenfold intensified shining. This is a proper local church. This is a proper lampstand. This is what the Lord is going to recover today.</P><P>He has no intention to recover trivial matters such as long sleeves and short hair. He wants to recover the Trinity fully enjoyed, possessed, realized, and expressed in the local church. The proper local church is simply a church which possesses the Trinity, enjoys the Trinity, realizes the Trinity, and expresses the Trinity. For this we all need the sevenfold intensified Spirit. We do not need just a onefold Spirit; we need a sevenfold Spirit. This is why we have to pray unceasingly and continually. We have to pray to be filled up and saturated and permeated until we overflow. To enjoy the sevenfold Spirit simply means that the intensified Spirit floods you and fills you and overflows from within you to be the very fullness of the Triune God. This fullness is the expression, and this expression is just the shining in sevenfold intensification. This is the kind of local church that the Lord is going to recover. We are not here just to have a church according to the outward teachings of the Bible. What the Triune God wants to recover among us is a proper lampstand in all the localities. In every city the Lord wants to have such a shining lampstand as the local church.</P><P>Among such local churches the Christ whom they experience is exactly the One revealed in Revelation 1. Such a Christ has eyes as a flame of fire (Rev. 1:14). You may consider that His eyes indicate a kind of judging, but they also indicate a kind of supply. Out of His mouth proceeds a sharp two-edged sword to kill, not you, but your flesh. This is to kill your murmuring and gossiping tongue. His feet are like shining brass, judging and burning and purifying. Sometimes the messages in the Lord's recovery are just like a two-edged sword to cut and to judge, because God wants a pure golden lampstand in each locality. Pure gold is gold which has been purified by fire. The Christ today is the burning Christ for purification. He is not only washing us, but also purifying us by burning. This is the practicality of God's expression. Don't consider that the practicality of God's expression covers such matters as how many elders a locality should have or how old the elders should be. The practicality of God's expression is a matter of the divine life. It is a matter of the saturation of the Triune God into your being to be your expression.</P><P>If you see a vision of such a practicality, this vision will kill all your opinions. You would never think to have a school church or a church on your street or a church in your home. Such a vision will kill all these different views. You will be left with one city and one church. You will be left with one church which is so pure, so golden, so shining, so full of the Triune God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TREE OF LIFE, THE MANNA, AND THE FEAST</H2><P>The practicality of God's expression is not only in Revelation chapter one, but also in chapters two and three. In these two chapters the Lord Jesus as the Son of Man who is in the midst of the churches as the lampstands does not only purify the churches that they may shine with pure light, but also promises to feed them with the tree of life (2:7), the hidden manna (2:17), and the feast (3:20). Verses 2:7 and 17 are promises of rewards to the overcomers that they may enjoy the tree of life and the hidden manna in the coming kingdom. This indicates that all the seeking saints may have a foretaste of the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life and hidden manna in this age. What the overcomers will enjoy in the full taste in the coming kingdom, they should enjoy in this age as a foretaste. In the practicality of God's expression we could and should have a foretaste of the reward which the Lord promises to give us in the coming kingdom. Revelation 3:20 is a promise for this age, that the seeking saints by opening themselves toward the Lord, may enjoy the Lord's presence and feast with Him. These three promises are the fulfillment of the enjoyment of the tree of life in Genesis 2, the manna in Exodus 16, and the rich produce of the good land in Deuteronomy 12. For the practicality of God's expression in the Lord's recovery, the Lord would feed us with all these particular portions of nourishment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A WHITE STONE FOR GOD'S BUILDING</H2><P>The Lord's promise in Revelation 2:17 also implies that by enjoying the hidden manna we may be transformed into a white stone for the building of God's spiritual house for His expression (1 Pet. 2:5). And the Lord's promise in Revelation 3:12 also indicates that a seeking saint may be made a pillar in God's temple, bearing God's name and the name of the New Jerusalem for the expression of God. This should be also by the nourishment of the tree of life, the manna, and the feast. In the practicality of the local churches as God's expression today, the enjoyment of the rich Christ as our particular nourishment is needed that we may be transformed into precious stones for the building up of God's eternal dwelling place to express God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CONSUMMATE ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</H2><P>In the consummation of God's expression in eternity, the enjoyment of the tree of life and the water of life will also be a particular feature in the New Jerusalem. The tree of life and the water of life will still continue to supply God's redeemed people in the new heaven and new earth for them to express God in full for eternity. This shows that both for the practicality and the consummation of God's expression, the particular enjoyment of God's rich Christ is a prerequisite. Without such enjoyment of Christ, the church life in the Lord's recovery will be just an empty shell which has no value for God's expression.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE NEW JERUSALEM</H2><P>Now we come to the consummation of the entire Bible, the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the totality of all the past centuries, including all the positive things that were a part of God's expression. This is why there are the names of the twelve tribes on the twelve gates to let people in. Then there are the twelve apostles' names on the twelve foundation stones. The New Jerusalem is a total composition of God's redeemed people, both of the Old Testament and of the New, including both the Jews and the Gentiles.</P><P>According to the record of the Bible the New Jerusalem is like a mountain (Rev. 21:16). At the top of the mountain is the throne of the Lamb-God. This is the redeeming God. How can God and the Lamb fit upon one throne? We can understand this by realizing that the same section of the Word tells us that the Lamb is the lamp (21:23). The Lamb, the Second of the Trinity, is the lamp, and God the Father, the First of the Trinity, is the light. The Spirit, the Third of the Trinity, is the oil. This means that the three-one, the one-three, is upon the throne. Then some might point out that the Bible says Christ is sitting on the right hand of God. You have to realize that every truth in the Bible has two aspects. Without two sides nothing can exist. Even a piece of paper has two sides. One side of the truth is that the Lord Jesus is sitting at the right hand of God. The other side of the truth is that the Lamb-God is sitting upon the throne. Both are right. Don't try to reconcile it. You simply have to take what the Bible says. In the Epistles it does say that Christ today is at the right hand of God (Rom 8:34), but the book of Revelation, according to the picture, shows us that God is in Christ. God as the light is in Christ as the lamp. The Triune God is on the throne, and out of the throne, which means out of Him, a river flows down the mountain in a spiral and eventually reaches all twelve of the gates. This means the new city, Jerusalem, has only one street. No one can get lost. The New Jerusalem is the consummation, the total expression of God in full for eternity. In the past chapters we have covered the entire Bible and seen how man was created in God's image and how eventually man will be the total expression of God to express God thoroughly, fully, and eternally. In that day we shall be there, and today we are in the local churches. Today we express the Triune God, and we are His embodiment in the way of practicality. We have the Father's divine substance, we have the Son's image and form, and we have the Spirit's shining so that we may express the very God in whom we believe, whom we serve, and whom we worship. This is the expression of God. Today we are in its practicality, and in the future we will be in its consummation.</P><H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>NOT THE OUTWARD APPEARANCE,<br>BUT THE INWARD REALITY<br>A SET OF OUTWARD APPEARANCES</H1><P>In the Old Testament no other book gives us such a complete revelation of God's economy and dispensation as the book of Exodus. There is a full set of outward appearances which depict the Lord's economy or dispensation. There was the Passover (Exo. 12), and there was God's mighty salvation to deliver all the people of Israel out of Egypt. There were the outward miraculous doings of God including the smiting of all the firstborn in Egypt (Exo. 12:29). Then in the wilderness God did a lot of miraculous things. For example, for nearly forty years while the children of Israel were wandering in the wilderness, the manna came to them.</P><P>They were also brought to Mount Sinai to receive the decree of the law. Even the decree of the law was a part of the outward set of appearances. Accompanying the decree of the law was the pattern of the tabernacle and the furniture and all the things concerning the priesthood, including the offerings of the sacrifices. These things made up a full set of outward appearances.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NOT SEEING THE SPIRITUAL SIGNIFICANCE<br>OF THE OUTWARD APPEARANCES</H2><P>Although Moses was the one through whom all these outward appearances were carried out, I doubt that he realized the divine reality of all these things. The deliverance from the Egyptian tyranny was carried out through him. The miracles wrought by God in the wilderness were through him, and he was the mediator for God to give the law to the people. He was brought by God into a position to see all the heavenly designs of the tabernacle and the furniture and the things concerning the priesthood. He himself was personally infused by God to the extent that there was the divine glow on his face. But still I doubt whether he saw the divine reality and the divine significance of these things. I doubt that Moses was clear about the dispensing of the Triune God into His people to be their life and life supply, and even their nature, so that they could be His living expression. After his experience on the mountain, he surely realized something, but I doubt if he really entered fully into the divine significance of those things. I doubt that he realized the standing boards of the tabernacle, which were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold, were a type of Christ in humanity overlaid with divinity and enlarged to be the church for God's dwelling place. If Moses himself did not see the inner reality within this set of outward things, who else would have seen?</P><P>Through all their generations after Moses, the children of Israel treasured what was received through Moses. The unity of the Jewish race through the centuries has been mostly due to the things they received through Moses. They have treasured the Ten Commandments, the Pentateuch, the tabernacle, the furniture of the tabernacle, and the priesthood. But history tells us that through all these generations they have not known the spiritual significance of these things. They have not known that the tabernacle and the temple were types of Christ. They have not understood the real significance of the showbread table or even why it was in the tabernacle. They have not known why there was a lampstand or why the lampstand had seven lamps. They have not known why the lampstand came after the showbread table. They have not known the significance of the veil. They have not known the real significance of the ark which contained the law and the hidden manna and the rod that budded. They have not understood these things, but they have treasured them. Even today they would like to find the ark. But they do not realize the spiritual significance of all these outward things. Their appreciation of these outward things does not affect their living, because these things are not kept in life, but in an outward way of appearance. Of course, they realized that the glory of God was there, but even that to them was a kind of outward appearance. When the Lord Jesus who was the reality of all those outward appearances came, they did not know Him. He was all-inclusive. He was the reality of the tabernacle, the ark, the lampstand, the showbread table, etc., but they did not know Him.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE FULFILLMENT OF THE OUTWARD APPEARANCES</H2><P>In the Gospel of John the Spirit uses two things to indicate that all the things given through Moses are fulfilled in this one Person, Jesus Christ. These two things are the tabernacle in 1:14 and the Lamb of God in 1:29. The tabernacle is the central item representing the entire set of the tabernacle, including the furniture, the altar, the laver, and the outer court separation. This one word, tabernacle, indicates a whole set. The Holy Spirit did not use tabernacle as a noun but as a verb. John said that the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us (1:14). This indicates that Christ as the tabernacle is not the old one which had no life. This one has life because it can tabernacle. It does not need people to carry it; it can move by itself. It does not need people to set it up or to take it down. He Himself tabernacles. This tabernacle is a Person. This wonderful Person is actually God becoming man. This God becoming man is a living tabernacle.</P><P>In Him was life and the life was the light of men (John 1:4). In 1:29 John said, "Behold, the Lamb of God Who takes away the sin of the world!" This one item represents the whole set of the priesthood. If there is a lamb there is a need for the priests to offer. This indicates the priesthood. The entire priesthood now is a living Person. This living Person is the fulfillment of both the tabernacle and the priesthood. This is why we say that the Gospel of John is the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings.</P><P>We were born in the best age to see these things. The Lord Jesus said to the Jews that Abraham expected with exultation to see Christ's day (John 8:56). In Matthew 11:11 the Lord Jesus indicated that no one in the Old Testament age was so great as John the Baptist, because John the Baptist was born later than they were. But then the Lord went on to say that he who is smallest in the kingdom is greater than John. In the same principle we have to say that those who are born in the last days of this age are greater than those born at the beginning of this age.</P><P>Through the generations the Jewish people held the outward things. One day the reality of those things came. Christ was the reality of the tabernacle and the priesthood, yet those who treasured the tabernacle and the priesthood opposed Him. Saul of Tarsus was a top example. After the genuine One came and accomplished everything, passing through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, entering into resurrection, and even into ascension, there was one, Saul of Tarsus, who was treasuring all the outward things to the uttermost. He had learned all the things concerning the outward appearance, and yet he was taking the lead to oppose the genuine One. But while he was persecuting, the genuine One came to him purposely. That turned him, not from sin or the world, but from the types, from the appearances, to Christ Himself. While the Lord Jesus was carrying out His ministry during those last three and one half years, His opposition mainly came from those who treasured and protected the outward appearances. There was a kind of transitional period during which the outward appearances of the Old Testament were all transferred into the New Testament reality.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>TREASURING THE OUTWARD FRAME</H2><P>In the New Testament, first of all the church was set up and the New Testament writings came out to unveil the mysterious, all-inclusive Christ. You have to realize that both the setting up of the church and the writing of the New Testament to unveil Christ became the very outward frame treasured by the Christians. The real things, the genuine things, are Christ and Christ increased. Christ is the Christ of God, and Christ increased is the Body of Christ. Both are mysterious; both are divine. Both are hard for the human mentality to understand. So even while the Apostles were still living, these divine mysteries were neglected by the people who treasured the outward frame of the church and the black and white letters of the revelation concerning Christ.</P><P>Beginning in the first century, different kinds of debates over doctrines came in. Some of the debates were concerning the Person of Christ. Different teachings came in. Judaism crept in, and Gnosticism crept in. Other heresies also came in. Both the heresies and the positive doctrines put out by the early church fathers became distractions. The debates between the heresies and the proper teachings attracted and distracted the genuine believers. They kept the genuine believers away from a direct, personal contact with the genuine living Christ. These kinds of debates have continued through the centuries even until now. Today many genuine believers are distracted from Christ Himself.</P><P>Because the Christians have been distracted from Christ, organizations have come in to replace the church practice. This began from the time of Ignatius. He considered that overseers, bishops, are above the elders. He was a genuine and dear brother, but he was used by Satan to make one error&#151;that the overseers are above the elders. That was the evil root of the bishops, archbishops, cardinals, and the pope. This hierarchy came out of that little root by a genuine brother and fundamental teacher.</P><P>Constantine the Great realized that the Christian truth was a prevailing factor that could affect the people in his empire, so he made Christianity the state religion. At the Nicene Council in A.D. 325 he tried to force all the different teachers to be one. This was the first foundation stone of Catholicism. The Roman Church came out of that. By the end of the sixth century the papal system was fully established. After that the entire divine significance of Christ and the church was lost. The church became something in outward appearance. The inward reality was gone. Christ was just a name to them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>A LINE OF THE CENTRAL THINGS</H2><P>But history tells us that by God's mercy through all the centuries there was a line of the central things. There was a line of the divine reality, but it was always on a very small scale.</P><P>At the time of the Reformation, the Lord used Martin Luther to recover justification by faith, which is actually Christ being our righteousness. To recover justification by faith is just to recover one matter or one item of the doctrine, but to recover Christ being our righteousness is to recover the Person. Today the Lutheran Church strongly holds to the doctrine of justification by faith, but so many of the members are not justified. They do not lay hold on Christ the living Person as their righteousness. God's intention at Luther's time was not to recover justification by faith, but to recover His Son Jesus Christ as our righteousness. Unless Christ is our righteousness, our faith cannot justify us before God.</P><P>Most people, however, consider that the Reformation recovered a certain kind of doctrine. According to this thought, after the Reformation, other doctrines and practices were also recovered. The presbytery, the rule of the church by elders, was recovered, so the Presbyterian Church was produced. The matter of the bishop was recovered, so an Episcopalian Church was produced. Some believers in Northern Europe realized that baptism should be by immersion, not by sprinkling. So they practiced baptism by immersion and were called Baptists. This practice produced the Baptist Church. Some recovered certain teachings and practices concerning holiness, producing Holiness Churches. Since the last century some recovered the practice of speaking in tongues, producing the Pentecostal Churches. All these recoveries are just recoveries of doctrines and practices. Mostly they have left Christ aside. A century and a half ago the Brethren were raised up in Great Britain. At first they paid much attention to Christ, but later they were distracted to pay attention to doctrines and different practices more than to Christ. After them the Lord's recovery was raised up in China. In the early days even the recovery among us was quite strong in doctrines and practices and not so strong in Christ the Person.</P><P>In 1933 I began to work directly with Brother Nee in the ministry. At that time he edited a kind of church news publication. All the articles were concerning leaving the denominations, baptism by immersion, head covering, and other outward practices. All the letters that came in from the different places simply testified concerning these few things. Brother Nee was busy, and he was also physically weak. so he had assigned Sister Lee, an elderly sister, to be the acting editor. Sometimes Sister Lee traveled, and at that time I was charged to do the editing. Once while I was editing he wrote me a letter that he wanted published in the news publication which said that from now on any brother who still preaches and teaches leaving the denominations, baptizing by immersion, having the Lord's Table instead of "the holy communion," the head covering, and so forth, is not our co-worker. Following this he wrote another letter to me in which he said that due to this situation we have to terminate this paper. He advised all the brothers to turn away from the external things to the overcoming Christ. He encouraged them to experience the overcoming life of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE TRIUNE GOD DISPENSED INTO<br>HIS REDEEMED PEOPLE</H2><P>From that period of time my eyes were opened to see that the central recovery of the Lord in this age is not recovery of mere doctrines and practices. When most believers consider the Lord's recovery, however, they mostly think of doctrines and practices.</P><P>I'm afraid that unconsciously you also may still consider the Lord's recovery as the recovery of some practices and doctrines and spiritual experiences. You may not have the basic understanding that God's intention is to have a recovery purely and wholly of the Person of Christ. God's desire is to have a recovery of the Triune God dispensed into His redeemed people, so that He would become their being, and that this would issue into the church life. This means that such a church life is a golden lampstand, the very embodiment of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. We must realize that the Lord's recovery is just the Triune God dispensed into His redeemed people.</P><P>This is why in the foregoing chapters we have pointed out from the Holy Scriptures, beginning with Genesis 1 and ending with Revelation 22 that God wants to have a people as His expression. This can only be accomplished when God Himself is wrought into His people as their life and nature. Such a people mingled with the Triune God become His expression. When we are seeking to be holy, to be spiritual, to grow, and to do some spiritual thing, it is apparently right. But, actually the wrong root still remains in our being. We don't need to seek to be spiritual. We don't need to seek to be holy. We don't need to seek to live Christ. We just need to seek the living Person. When we have the living Person, we have everything. We need a clear and an all-inclusive vision to see such a Person. If you look into Paul's and John's writings you can see they did not mainly teach us to seek this or to seek that. They mainly presented us with a living Person. So many Christians today, including ourselves, are seeking after different things, but not directly after the living Person. Many evangelists today have brought a lot of souls to Christ. But we have to ask how much they experienced and gained Christ. In the same principle we may have the church life, but we have to ask how much we have experienced and enjoyed and gained Christ.</P><P>The book of Revelation has been a distraction to many Christians who have paid attention to it. Students of the Bible like to know how to interpret the prophecies and find out the different ages, etc. Very few have paid attention to the real significance of the lampstands. Very few have paid attention to the eating of the tree of life or to the eating of the hidden manna. Evangelists have borrowed Revelation 3:20 concerning the Lord knocking at the door. Rarely have they gone on to the second point in the same verse which says that the Lord Jesus will come in and dine with the one who opens the door. They don't mention the dining, because they don't have much of such an experience. They have not seen that through such a practical enjoyment of Christ, the enjoyers become the overcomers who will sit with Him on His throne (3:21). Not many readers of Revelation have paid attention to the enjoyment of Christ. Instead they pay attention to so many other things.</P><P>As we mentioned in the last chapter, Revelation covers the particular enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life, as the hidden manna, and as the feast. These are the fulfillment of the tree of life in Genesis 2, the manna in Exodus 16, and the feast of the riches of the good land in Deuteronomy 12. Even the sequence is right. First comes the tree of life, then the manna, and then the feast. This indicates that the Son of Man who is in the midst of the lampstands not only purifies the churches, but also feeds the churches with particular enjoyment of Himself as the divine nourishment. By this kind of nourishment we grow and are transformed into a white stone for the building of God's temple to be His expression (2:17). Some may even be built into pillars in the temple of God (3:12).</P><P>We also saw that in the consummation of God's expression there will still be the enjoyment of Christ as the tree of life and the water of life. In Revelation 22 there is God and the Lamb with a river of water of life. These signify the Triune God. There is God the Father, there is the Lamb, the Son, and there is the flowing river, the Spirit. This is not merely my interpretation, because the Lord Jesus in John 7 told us clearly that the flowing river is the Spirit (vv. 38-39). So even in eternity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;the Triune God&#151;will be dispensed into His redeemed people continuously. This is the divine reality. We need to pray-read all these verses concerning these revelations and to seek after them and experience them and even learn how to present them to others. Let us all be rescued from paying attention to doctrines and to practices. We should learn how to understand God's economy according to His divine revelation and His Holy Word.</P><P>When people ask us about the local churches, it is so easy just to talk about the ground and the one city and the one church. But you have to realize that this may be just an outward show. People need the inward divine reality. The inward divine reality is the most convincing and satisfying and subduing element.</P></body></html>
