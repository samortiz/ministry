   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I am concerned that in the Lord's recovery, the brothers in a certain country may consider that the work there is their work.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Then some brothers in another country may consider that the work there is their work.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus, we have many works.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This shows that our situation today is abnormal, yet probably not many of us have the sensation of abnormality in the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is a practical situation that is abnormal, and the biggest point of this abnormality is the different works.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I hope that we will consider our present situation before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Are we doing the same one work for the recovery?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If not, we should let the Lord have the freedom to adjust us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Thank the Lord that due to the riches of the truth, the Lord's recovery is being welcomed everywhere on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Lord's move in His recovery, there should only be one work, not different works.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Our situation is different from this.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have different works without any consciousness.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is dangerous.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In Paul's time, because of the lack of modern transportation and communication, it would have been logical to have the work divided.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, there was only one work.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today the globe has been made small by modern conveniences.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All the modern conveniences have made the globe just like a city.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Despite this we do not have one work but many works.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we stay in this situation, a negative result may come out eventually.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We do have an existing problem among us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I hope that we would reconsider our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The two problems that are bothering me very much concern the eldership and the number of works.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the eldership all the brothers in the different age groups have to deal with the Lord concerning their pride, their thought of being a hero, and their opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The different works also need to be eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As long as we have these two problems, the recovery cannot be that healthy or that prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must look to the Lord that these two things will be absent among us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then I assure you that the recovery will be healthy and prevailing, and the increase surely will come.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, even in life, the standard, the level, will be greatly uplifted.</S>
