 <h2 class="head2">E. Life&rsquo;s Source and Origin&mdash;God the Father</h2><p>The Lord&rsquo;s source and origin are God the Father (7:25-36; 13:3). Although His source was God the Father, He came as a man from Nazareth of Galilee (7:27, 42, 52; 1:45-46). For quite a while I was not happy with the Lord concerning what I felt was His lack of frankness in John 7. It seemed to me that He was somewhat sneaky. He told people that His source was God the Father, but He came from Nazareth. There is a vital principle here: with everything concerning the Lord, the outward appearance will never look good, but the inward content will be marvelous. This also is true of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today. If you look at the recovery according to the outward appearance, it does not look very attractive. However, the situation is entirely different inside. Do not be troubled by the outward appearance. The people who looked at Jesus outwardly saw Him as just a Nazarene. He had no form, comeliness, beauty, or attraction. But within, He is the very God. At times I told the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, why are so few of the people whom You have brought into Your recovery in this country good looking? Even some do not dress appropriately for the meetings.&rdquo; But I have come to see that there is a treasure in those earthen vessels. The Lord has told me not to care for the outward appearance. The Nazarene has an unattractive appearance but an excellent and heavenly content.</p><h2 class="head1">III. LIFE&rsquo;S CRY TO THE THIRSTY ONES</h2><h2 class="head2">A. The Last Day Signifying<br />the Ending of All the Enjoyment<br />of Any Success of Human Life</h2><p>On the last day of the feast, the great day, Jesus stood and cried out to the thirsty ones (7:37-39). The last day signifies the ending of all the enjoyment of any success in human life. Regardless of the kind of success you have, there will be a last day. For instance, although you may have a marvelous marriage, your marriage will not last forever.</p><p>The phrase &ldquo;the last day&rdquo; occurs in both chapters six and seven (6:39-40; 7:37). However, these are two different kinds of last days. The last day in chapter six is the ultimate last day in the remote future when the Lord will raise us up. The last day in chapter seven refers to the many last days during our human life. The greatest last day is in the future, but before that day, during our human life, there are many last days. There will be a last day for an article of clothing that you value; there will be a last day for your marriage. Everything has its last day. The feast of Tabernacles continued for seven days, but the seventh day was the last day of the feast. The last simply means an end. Regardless of how wealthy you are, there is an end. Regardless of how healthy you are, there is an end. There is a last day for your riches, a last day to your health, a last day with your family, a last day with your dear wife or husband, a last day with your parents, a last day with your children, a last day with all of your circumstances&mdash;in short, a last day!</p><p>When I reached the age of forty, people began to tell me, &ldquo;Life begins at forty.&rdquo; But others told me, &ldquo;Brother, you must realize that after forty, life is in the afternoon. When you were born, life began at dawn. At forty, life has reached the noon hour. After forty, life is in the afternoon. Probably sometime after sixty, life will be ended.&rdquo; Sooner or later, there will come the last day of life.</p><p>Look at the picture. Israel labored for the whole year until they harvested the corn and wine. They received everything by the labor of their hands. Finally, their labor was over, and all that was left for them to do was to come together and enjoy their harvest for seven days. The seventh day was their biggest day, yet it was the end. The last day was the day that they were all dismissed.</p><h2 class="head2">B. The Cry to Come and Drink</h2><p>While the people were being dismissed on the last day of the feast, the Lord stood up and cried, &ldquo;If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink&rdquo; (7:37). The people were not satisfied. The things that they were enjoying during the past seven days had failed to quench their thirst. If they would come and drink of Christ, they would have rivers of living water flowing out from within their innermost being. The living water is the Holy Spirit who will flow out of the smitten rock.</p><p>As we shall see, when the Lord spoke these words, the Holy Spirit was &ldquo;not yet,&rdquo; because the Lord had not yet been smitten and had not yet been glorified (7:39). What does it mean for the Lord to be glorified? It simply means that He was to be resurrected (Luke 24:26). The Lord was transfigured from His frail body into a glorious Spirit by means of His death and resurrection. Before the cross, the Lord was the rock, but He was not yet smitten or crucified on the cross. When He was crucified and resurrected, the living water flowed out of Him and into us in order to quench our thirst. At the last day of your feast&mdash;at the end of your rejoicing and enjoyment when you still feel thirsty&mdash;you must come to this Jesus and receive the living water to quench your thirst.</p><p>There was a young lady who lived in a very wealthy family. She sought enjoyment continually. Once she attended a dancing party with the highest class of people in England. She enjoyed it very much and had a wonderful time. After the party was over, she came home. As she was taking off her dancing garments, she felt so thirsty. She threw away all of her dancing garments and shoes, exclaiming, &ldquo;How can these things help me!&rdquo; After rejoicing in all of her enjoyments, she still felt very thirsty. Then an inner voice whispered within her, &ldquo;You must pray to God.&rdquo; But she said to herself, &ldquo;I do not believe that there is a God; how can I pray to Him?&rdquo; But the voice continued to whisper, &ldquo;Just try to say something to God. Say: `God, if there is a God, just satisfy me.&rsquo;&rdquo; Finally, she prayed in such a way. The very next day her whole life was changed. She was satisfied. Her thirst was quenched by the living water given by the Lord.</p><p>If you study the biographies of the saints, you will discover many other similar stories. Many people who were highly educated, very successful, and very wealthy had much to rejoice in, but eventually they felt that they had failed because everything became dry to them. But then came the call, &ldquo;Whoever is thirsty, come to Me and drink.&rdquo; Although you may be enjoying many good days, there will eventually come the last day when all of your enjoyment is over and you will feel thirsty. Remember, it is only the Lord Jesus Himself who can offer you the living water to quench your thirst.</p>
