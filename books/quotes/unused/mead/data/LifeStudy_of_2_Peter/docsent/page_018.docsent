   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THESE THINGS EXISTING IN US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND ABOUNDING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 8 Peter goes on to say, For these things, existing in you and abounding, constitute you neither idle nor unfruitful unto the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The words these things refer to all the virtues covered in verses 5 through 7, from faith to love.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Faith, virtue, knowledge, self-control, endurance, godliness, brotherly love, and love should all exist in us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Nevertheless, these are only some of the all things that have been granted to us by the divine power.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need to see that all these things are included in the seed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This seed contains the root, the trunk, the branches, the blossom, and the fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Greek word for existing is huparcho.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It denotes the existence of certain things that belong to someone from the beginning and thus become his rightful possession to the present.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This indicates that all the virtues mentioned in verses 5 through 7 are the possession of the believers and exist in them forever through their experience of partaking of the divine nature in all its riches.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Peter speaks of these virtues not only existing in us but also abounding.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The divine virtues are not only existing in and possessed by the believers, but are also abounding and multiplying in them in the development and growth of the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>All the virtues already exist in the seed, and now they are waiting for the opportunity to abound.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In order for the virtues in the seed to abound, the seed needs to be sown in the soil and then grow and develop until it blossoms and bears fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>CONSTITUTED NEITHER IDLE NOR UNFRUITFUL</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter says that if these things exist and abound in us, they shall constitute us neither idle nor unfruitful unto the full knowledge of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This indicates that the virtues of the divine life and divine nature are the constituents, the elements, of our spiritual constitution, our spiritual being, making us persons without the elements of idleness and unfruitfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Being constituted is different from trying to correct ourselves, adjust ourselves, or improve ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to be constituted we must have a certain element or constituent.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The elements, the ingredients, of the divine nature are the constituents of which we need to be constituted.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Christians are often exhorted and taught to improve themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, in the New Testament we are not exhorted to correct ourselves: we are exhorted to be constituted of the elements of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Confucius may have taught people to improve, but he certainly did not teach them to be constituted of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is a distinction between developing something and being constituted of something.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Developing a matter implies that we already have something which needs to be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But being constituted of a particular element implies that something is about to be added to us that we do not already possess.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We have faith as a seed that includes Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Actually, this seed is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have seen that we need to develop in our faith virtue, knowledge, self-control, endurance, godliness, brotherly love, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We also need to be constituted of all these elements that are developed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, our natural being needs to be reconstituted.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>From the time of our birth, we have been constituted a certain kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now that we have been regenerated, we need to be reconstituted; that is, we need to be constituted of the elements of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We were constituted once in our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Now in our new birth with our new life we need to be reconstituted of the divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The divine nature is rich in ingredients, in constituents, with which we need to build up ourselves into a God-man, into a person mingled with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are constituted of the elements of the divine nature, we shall not be idle or unfruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Literally, the Greek word rendered idle means unworking; hence, idle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One may not be idle, but may still be unfruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To be fruitful requires more growth in life and more supply of life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Idleness and unfruitfulness are constituents of our fallen being; working, the energizing of life, and fruit-fulness are the constituents of our spiritual constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Peter s use of the word unfruitful in verse 8 indicates that what is covered in verses 5 through 7 is the development of the growth of the divine life unto its maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The word idle implies many things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It seems that it is a rather insignificant word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Actually, this word is very important and implies a great deal.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may say that gossiping is a sign of idleness.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Anyone who gossips is idle.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Such a one may not spend adequate time reading the Word and praying, using the excuse that he is too busy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But such a one is not busy he is idle.</S>
