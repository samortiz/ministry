   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 4:"You are of God, little children; and you have overcome them because greater is He who is in you than he who is in the world."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We do not have to search elsewhere, for He is already in us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We overcome because the One who is in us is greater than the evil spirits.</S>

   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Herein is love, not that we have loved God but that He loved us and sent His Son as a propitiation for our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Beloved, if God has loved us in this way, we also ought to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>No one has beheld God at any time; if we love one another, God abides in us, and His love is perfected in us.</S>
