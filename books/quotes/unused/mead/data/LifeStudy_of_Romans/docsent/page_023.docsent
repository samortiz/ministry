   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Redemption</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What is the difference between propitiation and redemption?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The word redeem means to purchase back something which originally was yours but which had become lost.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This hymnal belongs to me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the hymnal becomes lost and I pay the price of buying it back, I would be redeeming the hymnal.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, redemption means to repossess at a cost.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We originally belonged to God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We were His possession.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, we were lost.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, God did not give us up.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He paid the price to have us back, repossessing us at a great cost.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even after we had become lost, He desired to regain us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, this was not easy for God to do because our being lost involved us in sins and in many other things that were against His righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because we were lost we had many problems with God in respect to His righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We were under a threefold demand, the demand of righteousness, holiness, and glory.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many requirements were laid upon us, and it was impossible for us to fulfill them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The price was too great.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God paid the price for us, repossessing us at a tremendous cost.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ died on the cross to accomplish eternal redemption for us Gal 3:13; 1 Pet 2:24; 3:18; 2 Cor 5:21; Heb 10:12; 9:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>His blood has obtained eternal redemption for us Heb 9:12, 14; 1 Pet 1:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Reconciliation</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The problem of being an enemy is even more serious than the problem that necessitates propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If I am your enemy, propitiation is inadequate.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I need reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Sinners need propitiation; enemies need reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Enmity is the greatest problem between man and God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we were enemies of God, we not only needed propitiation, but also reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Propitiation mainly deals with sins; reconciliation deals with enmity as well as sins.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, reconciliation includes propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Romans 5 tells us that before we were saved we were both sinners and enemies.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As sinners we needed propitiation and as enemies we needed reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Herein lies the difference between propitiation and reconciliation: propitiation is for sins; reconciliation is both for sins and enmity.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Reconciliation is based upon Christ s redemption Rom 5:10, 11 and was accomplished through God s justification 2 Cor 5:18-19; Rom 5:1, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Hence, reconciliation is the issue of redemption with justification.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the previous points we mainly covered the definition of various terms the righteousness of God, justification, propitiation, redemption, and reconciliation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once we have the proper definition of these terms, we can understand what it means to be justified.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Now we shall deal directly with justification.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>THE RIGHTEOUSNESS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>HAVING BEEN MANIFESTED</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What is justification?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Justification means that the righteousness of God has been manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Although the righteousness of God has existed for ages, it was not manifested to us until we believed in the Lord and called on His name.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Then the righteousness of God was revealed to us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When God s righteousness is revealed, it is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is manifested to us when we believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The manifestation of God s righteousness is mentioned twice in the book of Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Romans 1:17 says that the righteousness of God is revealed out of faith to faith.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The righteousness of God is manifested in the gospel out of our faith and to our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then Romans 3:21 says that the righteousness of God has been manifested without law, being witnessed by the law and the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>A. Without Law</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>That the righteousness of God has been manifested without law means it has nothing to do with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Never mix the righteousness of God with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They must be kept separate.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God s righteousness has nothing to do with the law.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We can never obtain God s righteousness by going to the law.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As far as God s righteousness is concerned, the law is over.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The law was the old dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Now without law, apart from the law, the righteousness of God has been manifested through faith of Jesus Christ.</S>
