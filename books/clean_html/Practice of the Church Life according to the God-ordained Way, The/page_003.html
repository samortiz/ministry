<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. For an Organism to Express God in His Trinity</H2><P>If we are going to prophesy, we must see what God's economy is. God's economy is for an organism, and this organism is not for our interest, benefit, or attainments; it is for God's expression in His Trinity (Eph. 3:16-19). Apart from His Trinity, there is no way for God to express Himself. For a human being to express himself adequately, he needs a body with every part functioning properly. He also needs a mind and an emotion. When a person speaks, he must exercise his emotion, and he also needs a considerable exercise of the mind. Before I minister the Lord's word, I often pray, "Lord, infuse me with Your riches. Infuse my mind with Your thought, with Your thinking, and infuse my emotion with Your affection, with Your feeling." Without praying in this way, it would be difficult for me to express the Lord in my speaking. It is not sufficient merely to have power or impact in our speaking. We also need to be infused with the Lord's thought and His feeling.</P><P>For God to express Himself, He needs His Trinity. Second Corinthians 13:14 says, "The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ and the love of God and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all." I sometimes wondered why this verse is so complicated in its expression. It seems to me that it would have been more brief to say, "God's grace, love, and fellowship be with you all." Why does God need to be so complicated? The grace of Christ is not simple. It involves Christ's incarnation, His humanity with His human living, His death in His humanity, His resurrection, His ascension, and His pouring Himself out on His Body. Likewise, the love of God and the fellowship of the Spirit involve many things. This is for God's expression. God is expressed in the Father's love, in the Son's grace, and in the Spirit's fellowship, that is, in His Trinity. Thus, in order to express Himself, God needs His Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. With the Unsearchable Riches of Christ</H2><P>In order to prophesy, we need to see that in the universe there is such an economy of God, and according to His economy God desires to have an organism to express God in His Trinity with the unsearchable riches of Christ. In Ephesians 3:8-9 Paul put the economy of God together with the unsearchable riches of Christ. He said that he preached the unsearchable riches of Christ for the producing of an organism, that is, the church. If we have never seen this, we will not have any aspiration to prophesy, because only prophesying can build up such an organism. If we have not seen this organism, we do not have the feeling of the need for prophesying. This is the reason few Christians have any heart to consider the matter of prophesying. They are content merely with soul winning so that sinners may go to heaven. They have no heart, no ear, and no attention to hear anything about prophesying. But when we see the economy of God, we realize that without prophesying, it is impossible to build up the church as an organism. To build up the church as a religious organization is easy, but to build up the church as an organism through prophesying, we all need to see the economy of God for an organism that is constituted with the unsearchable riches of Christ.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. TO KNOW THE BODY OF CHRIST</H2><P>Second, we must know the Body of Christ. To see is one thing; to know is another thing. To know something, we must get into it, practice it, experience it, and make it real in our knowledge. We need to know the Body of Christ in such a way. Knowing always follows seeing. First we see; then we know.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Constituted with the Divine Dispensing<br>and Transmitting of the Triune God<br>into the Believers as the Church</H2><P>The Body of Christ is constituted with the divine dispensing and transmitting of the Triune God into the believers as the church. The matters of God's dispensing and God's transmitting are seen in Ephesians 1:4, 5, 11, 13, 14, and 22. These six verses are crucial.</P><P>There is a difference between dispensing and transmitting. When we eat, we take food into our body; this is not a transmitting but a dispensing. In contrast, when a doctor gives a person a shot, this is not a dispensing but a transmitting. Thus, eating is a dispensing, whereas injecting is a transmitting. Things such as God Himself must be dispensed, but things such as power and strength should be transmitted. Electricity is not dispensed into a building; rather, it is transmitted into the building. The current of electricity is a transmission, but the current of blood within our body is a dispensing. While the blood flows within our body, it dispenses nutrients to our body. Dispensing is finer than transmitting. The Triune God is dispensing and transmitting Himself and His power into us as the church.</P>
