   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Basic Concern in the Jubilee</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the jubilee portrayed in Leviticus 25 the main thought is how to take care of people s living.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In other words, the basic concern is man s enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The primary enjoyment in human life is to be filled with good food.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A person whose stomach is empty will not appreciate money or material riches.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He would rather have food to fill his stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Suppose a rich man who owns a luxury car is starving.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Do you think he will be able to enjoy his car?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>No, he would gladly trade his car for food.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Humanly speaking, the jubilee is concerned with taking care of our eating, with filling our stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Although God is very different from worldly politicians and has not taught man any isms, we may say that He is a great statesman.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The jubilee was ordained by God as the divine statesman.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God ordained that His people be given the good land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This land was allotted to the twelve tribes of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Eventually, each family received an allotment of land as a possession.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The land was not mainly to be for their living or their lodging; the land was primarily for their eating.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The need for food is greater than the need for lodging.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One may live in the wilderness for a long time without a house, but he could not live very long without eating.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The good land, therefore, was given to God s people for their eating.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the reason the Bible refers to this land as a land flowing with milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The good land was not called a land of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What good would it be to have a land that could provide gold but could not provide food?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God created the land not for man to have gold but for man to have food.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The land is for food.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Milk and honey signify that the good land is rich in food.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some countries may have wheat and corn but no milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The good land is a land flowing with milk and honey.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Both milk and honey are produced by the mingling of two lives the vegetable life and the animal life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This mingling of the animal life with the vegetable life signifies the riches of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Loss and Return of the Land</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because God brought His people into the good land and allotted a portion of the land to every family, each family was rich in its possession of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But suppose the members of a particular family did not labor on the land.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Because they did not work on the land, they became very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Little by little they sold the land until their entire allotment was sold.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this way they lost their portion of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When land was sold in a country other than Israel, the land was sold forever.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But God s ordination did not allow the land in Israel to be sold permanently.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At most, the land could be sold only for fifty years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Leviticus 25:23 and 24 say, The land shall not be sold for ever: for the land is mine; for ye are strangers and sojourners with me.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And in all the land of your possession ye shall grant a redemption for the land.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here we see that the land was not sold forever; land that had been sold could be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The one who bought the land did not have the right to keep it indefinitely.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After fifty years at the latest, the land could be redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Leviticus 25 we are told not that the land was returned to its original owner, but that the person returned to the land.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Concerning this, verse 28 says, In the jubilee it shall go out, and he shall return unto his possession.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Actually, one did not sell the land he sold himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Eventually, it was not the land that was returned to the seller; it was the seller that returned to the land, to his possession.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>After the children of Israel received their portions of the land, some became poor and sold their allotment of the land, and others became landlords.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Was there the need of some kind of ism in order for the land to be redistributed?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>No, God s ordination concerning the land allowed that in the fiftieth year, the year of jubilee, those who lost their possession of land could return to it.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This means that in the fiftieth year every family could become rich again.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Here we see that the principle of balancing the amount of land among the people was written in the Bible thirty-five centuries ago.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What we find in Leviticus 25 is much better than the theories of statesmen, politicians, and philosophers.</S>
