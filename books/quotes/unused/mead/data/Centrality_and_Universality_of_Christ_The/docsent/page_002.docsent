   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this short book, we want to fellowship about the centrality and universality of Christ Christ as the center and Christ as everything.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ is the center, and Christ is the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The whole universe including the old and new creations, including everything in the heavens and on the earth, in the present and in the future is like a great wheel cf.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Christ is the hub, the center; Christ is the rim, the circumference; and Christ is the spokes of this wheel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Christ is everything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The centrality and universality of Christ is an all-inclusive subject.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Of course, we will not go into the details, but we will see this matter in a very subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We will spend one chapter for the objective aspect of this subject and three chapters for the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this chapter we would like to read a number of important verses from the Scripture which reveal that Christ is everything.</S>

   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Verse 15b says that He is "the Firstborn of all creation."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This tells us His position in the old creation.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 16 says, "Because in Him all things were created, in the heavens and on the earth, the visible and the invisible, whether thrones or lordships or rulers or authorities; all things have been created through Him and unto Him."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ is not only the first One of all creation, but He is everything in the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>All things were created in Him, in the power of His person, through Him as the active instrument, and unto Him for His possession.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 17 says, "And He is before all things, and all things cohere in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To cohere in Him means to subsist together in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>All things are united and compacted together in Christ because Christ is the center and Christ is the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Christ is the hub and Christ is the rim.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If you take the rim and hub away from a wheel, the entire wheel will collapse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Christ is the center and the circumference of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The scientists do not know this.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But the best scientists tell us that there is a wonderful power holding the universe together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This wonderful power is Christ Himself as the center and the circumference.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Christ is the very One in whom the whole universe, including all things, is compacted and subsists together.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Verse 18 says, "And He is the Head of the Body, the church; He is the beginning, the Firstborn from the dead, that He Himself might have the first place in all things."</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Verse 17 tells us the position of Christ in creation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 18 tells us the position of Christ in the new creation, in the Body, in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It says that He is the Head of the Body, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the old creation, in the universe, He is the first.</S>

   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is the Head and the Firstborn from the dead that He might have the preeminence, the first place, in all things.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He must be the first.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 19 says, "For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The fullness here refers to the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
