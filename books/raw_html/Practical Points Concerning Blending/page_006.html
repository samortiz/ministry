<p>My burden in this message concerns the need of the blending. Even among us who are in the recovery, not many have the realization that we need the blending, and we need it desperately. The heavy burden in the ministry that is on my heart and in my spirit is the matter of blending. In the past three months, I offered to the Lord many prayers, asking Him to do something in His recovery. At the present time, there are more than sixteen hundred local churches established by the Lord in all the six continents. I receive letters from abroad quite often telling me of the situation in different places around the globe. As I look at the whole situation of the recovery, seemingly it is quite encouraging. Apparently, the churches are going on well and are flourishing, increasing, and growing. But the more I know this and the more I feel encouraged, the deeper I am burdened. It seems that the Lord within me is saying, “Is this all that I want? Do you believe that My Body can be built up in the common situation that is among us today? Is the present situation satisfactory for Me to go on?” I feel deeply that it is not.<p>After I had remained in the United States and had spoken for the Lord for a little over thirteen years, we moved from Los Angeles to Anaheim and we changed the way of practicing the Lord’s recovery somewhat. Some people say that beginning from that time, my speaking changed. They say that after the move to Anaheim, my speaking was not as powerful as in the previous thirteen years, from 1962 to 1974. However, the people who say this do not know the burden that I received from the Lord.<p>In the first period of my ministry in this country, I traveled to many places to hold meetings and to speak mainly on the experience and enjoyment of Christ. I agree that my ministry at that time was rich and powerful and full of impact. But when we were flourishing in Los Angeles, we felt that we needed to move to a new place, and we came to Anaheim. From that time I received a burden to change from always holding conferences to conducting semiannual trainings to get into the life-study of His Word. Although I had given message after message, still the Word, the holy Scriptures, had not been opened up. For the long run there was the need for the opening up of the holy Word so that people could see the life in this book. Therefore, each year for the past twenty-one years I have conducted two annual trainings lasting ten days each. At the present time nearly the entire Bible has been finished; only a few books remain. If the Lord wills, perhaps by the end of 1995, we will finish the entire life-study of the Scriptures.<p>I have received many letters from people who appreciate all the truths that have been opened up to the church from the life-study messages. They have reached many people on this earth. They are the riches kept in storage in the recovery. Whenever you desire to know a particular truth in Genesis, you can simply open the life-study, and you will taste how sweet, how enlightening, how supplying, and how nourishing it is.<p>In approximately 1980 I began to see the truth of God’s economy. To open up the entire Bible from the first page to the last is needed, but what is the central matter in the Holy Bible? This central matter is the economy of God. The economy of God is for the Body of Christ. After seeing this, I checked with myself, “Where is the Body of Christ? You have opened the Bible book by book to the saints, and there are more than sixteen hundred local churches raised up on this earth, but where is the Body? You have the churches, but where can you see the Body?” Because of this, I became burdened. I said, “Lord, I must confess to You and admit that although I saw the Body of Christ and I preached and taught the Body of Christ for years, even I myself am not very much in the reality of the Body of Christ.” I was confessing my dullness and shortcomings to the Lord concerning this matter. Thus, the present burden has come to me. You should not pay so much attention to the spreading of the recovery, to the increase of the churches, and to the good meetings of the churches. You must realize that there is a great lack, a shortage, that is, the reality of the Body of Christ. It is for this reason that there is a need for the blending.
