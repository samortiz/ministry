<H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE CRUCIAL POINTS OF<br>THE MAJOR ITEMS<br>OF THE LORD'S RECOVERY TODAY</H1><P>The Lord's recovery is the recovery of the divine truths as revealed in the holy Scriptures, the holy Word of God (2 Tim. 3:16). The truths as revealed in the Scriptures have been lost, missed, misunderstood, misinterpreted, and wrongly taught throughout the ages. Hence, there is the need of the Lord's recovery. In the age of the early apostles, in the age of the church fathers, in the age of the church councils, in the age of Catholicism with the papal system, and in the age of the Protestant practice, the Lord has always recovered some of the lost, missed, misunderstood, misinterpreted, and wrongly taught truths through some of His saints who loved Him and His holy Word.</P><P>Among the major items in the Lord's recovery, some points are more crucial than others. In this small book we want to see the crucial points of the major items of the Lord's recovery today. These crucial points are the Triune God, the all-inclusive Christ, the consummated Spirit, the eternal life, the church, the oneness of the Body of Christ, and the local ground of the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>The first crucial point of the major items of the Lord's recovery today is the divine revelation concerning the Triune God. Among Christians the truth concerning the Triune God has been lost, missed, misunderstood, misinterpreted, and wrongly taught. Thus, there is the need to recover this truth.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Two Basic Divine Titles:<br>Elohim in God's Creation and<br>Jehovah in God's Relationship with Man</H2><P>The first time the Bible mentions God is in Genesis 1:1, which says, "In the beginning God created...." The word for "God" here in Hebrew is Elohim. In Genesis 1:1 the subject Elohim, used in relation to God's creation, is plural in number whereas the verb created is singular. The plurality of the word Elohim implies the Divine Trinity. Furthermore, Genesis 1:26a, 3:22a, and 11:7a all mention God, using the plural pronouns us and our. In Isaiah 6:8 God said, "Whom shall I send? Who will go for Us?" I is singular, but Us is plural, showing that God is "uni-plural." In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed to the Father, "That they may be one, even as We are one" (vv. 22b, 11b). He also prayed, "That they also may be in Us" (v. 21). God the Father and God the Son are "Us"; They are plural, yet They are one (Matt. 28:19; 2 Cor. 13:14). The title Elohim, denoting the unique yet triune God, is used more than two thousand five hundred times in the Old Testament.</P><P>Jehovah is another divine title of God (Gen. 2:4), which is used in God's relationship with man. This title literally means "He that is who He is; therefore, the eternal I Am." As Jehovah, He is the One who was in the past, who is in the present, and who is to come in the future. Revelation 1:4 speaks of "Him who is and who was and who is coming." For the past He was; for the present He is; and for the future He is to be. He is the great I Am.</P><P>The Lord Jesus told the Pharisees, "Unless you believe that I am, you will die in your sins" (John 8:24b). Eventually, they asked Him, "You are not yet fifty years old, and have You seen Abraham?" Jesus responded, "Truly, truly, I say to you, Before Abraham came into being, I am" (vv. 57-58). The Lord as the great I Am is the eternal, ever-existing God. Hence, He was before Abraham and is greater than Abraham (v. 53). The name Jesus means "Jehovah the Savior." Jesus is Jehovah, the eternal I Am.</P><P>When Moses was called by God, Moses asked God what His name was. Exodus 3:13 and 14 say, "And Moses said unto God, Behold, when I come unto the children of Israel, and shall say unto them, The God of your fathers hath sent me unto you; and they shall say to me, What is his name? what shall I say unto them? And God said unto Moses, I Am That I Am: and he said, Thus shalt thou say unto the children of Israel, I Am hath sent me unto you." As the I Am, He is the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob (v. 15). In His person there is the Father like Abraham, the Son like Isaac, and the Spirit like Jacob. As Jehovah, He is the threefold yet one unique God. The title Jehovah, denoting the Triune God as the One who is not only eternally existing but also eternally being, is used more than seven thousand times in the Old Testament.</P>
