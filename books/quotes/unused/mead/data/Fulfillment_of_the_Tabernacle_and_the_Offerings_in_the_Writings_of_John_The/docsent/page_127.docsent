   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-FIVE AN OVERVIEW OF THE SIGNS IN JOHN FOURTEEN THROUGH SEVENTEEN A RECORD OF SIGNS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall see an overview of the ten signs in chapters fourteen through seventeen of the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This Gospel is a record of signs.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Every chapter in this book contains certain signs.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These signs may be simple, but they are very rich in their implications.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For example, a street sign may have a simple appearance, but what it indicates may nevertheless be very important.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When John wrote his Gospel he followed the principle of writing down certain signs.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In 20:30 and 31 John said, "Many other signs therefore Jesus did before His disciples, which are not written in this book; but these have been written that you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, and that believing you may have life in His name."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The very last verse of the Gospel of John says, "And there are also many other things which Jesus did, which if they were written one by one, I suppose that not even the world itself could contain the books written" 21:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This verse, together with 20:30-31, affirms that this Gospel is the record of a selection of things that serve a particular purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is impossible to exhaust in writing the things done by the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Knowing this, John selected certain of the Lord's doings and arranged them in a record that is significant not only historically but also doctrinally.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For instance, John placed the record of foot-washing in chapter thirteen, not in chapter eleven.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have pointed out that the sequence of events in the Gospel of John is for the formation of a doctrinal frame.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Chapter one is a prologue to the entire Gospel, and in chapter two we have the principle of life and the goal of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then in chapters three through eleven we have nine cases.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The issue, the outcome, of these nine cases is the miniature of the church life seen in Bethany.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In Bethany there was the feasting on the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church life portrayed by the feasting in Bethany was marvelous, but it was too limited.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It was excellent in quality, but it was much too small in quantity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, it was necessary for the Lord Jesus to die in order for this kind of church life to be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For this reason, the Lord was not willing to receive the exaltation of the crowd, but instead told His disciples that He was a grain of wheat to fall into the ground and die in order to produce many grains 12:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>As the unique grain, the Lord is the source of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But it was necessary for this grain to be multiplied into many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Because the Lord fell into the ground and died, many have been drawn to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the reason He said, "And I, if I be lifted up from the earth, will draw all men to Myself 12:32 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 12 reveals that the Lord Jesus was ready to die in order to bring His people into God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>THE NEED OF THE LAVER</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In chapter thirteen we have the record of foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 13:10 the Lord Jesus said to Peter, "He who is bathed has no need, except to wash his feet, but is wholly clean."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>God's redeemed, saved, and regenerated people have all been "bathed," or cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Nevertheless, they are still on earth and by contact with the earth are defiled again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Hence, there is the need of the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If there were no laver, the earthly contact would annul the wonderful result of Christ being all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, there is the need of washing to preserve, to maintain, the result of Christ being the offerings to us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We may use cooking and serving food as an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A sister may prepare an excellent meal for her family.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, if she is careless, something may come in to defile the food that has been prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Knowing this, the sister will do what is necessary to preserve the food she has prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The washing in the laver preserves what has been accomplished by Christ being the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Earthly contact may not be sinful, but it defiles the result of Christ's wonderful work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because of the need to preserve this result, there is the need of the laver.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to the arrangement in the Old Testament, the laver stood between the altar and the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we study the Gospel of John with a spiritual view, we shall realize that chapters one through twelve show us all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We may say that these chapters reveal different aspects of the all-inclusive Christ, and that these aspects are related to the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Therefore, in these chapters the offerings are fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>John 1:29 says, "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!" and 3:14 says, "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Both of these verses point to Christ as the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In chapters fourteen through seventeen of John's Gospel we have the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Chapter thirteen is a turning point, a link between chapters one through twelve and chapters fourteen through seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Chapters one through twelve are at the altar, and chapters fourteen through seventeen are in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Between these sections we have chapter thirteen as a connection and turning point.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this chapter we have the laver, which is located between the altar and the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Comparatively speaking, the laver is not as important as the altar or the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The laver can be compared to a small part in a large machine.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although the machine is large and the part is small, the machine cannot function properly without it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The principle is the same with the laver in relation to the altar and the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The offerings are on the altar, and in the tabernacle are many riches: the showbread table, the lampstand, the incense altar, and the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although the laver contains only water, it should not be neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we neglect the laver, we shall not be able to enter into the tabernacle, for what was accomplished at the altar would be annulled because of defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we are defiled through earthly contact, we shall not be allowed to enter into the dwelling place of the clean and holy God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Whoever comes into the tabernacle must be clean in every way physically, psychologically, spiritually, and morally.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who enter the tabernacle must be clean in spirit, soul, and body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only when we are thoroughly clean are we qualified to enter the Holy Place, the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If we see this, we shall realize that foot-washing is crucial.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Among certain Christians today, even the altar has been polluted because there is no laver.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>According to what we have pointed out concerning the laver in previous messages, the laver is altogether lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Because there is no laver and the altar has been polluted, there is absolutely nothing of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>This is today's situation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We thank the Lord that, in His recovery, we have the Holy Place, at least to some extent.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We enjoy the church life portrayed by the miniature in Bethany.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This means that in the church life we are feasting with the Lord, with the incarnated God.</S>
