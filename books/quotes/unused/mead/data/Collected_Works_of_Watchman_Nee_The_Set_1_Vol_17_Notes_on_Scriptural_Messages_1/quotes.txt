[1]  CONTENTS NOTES ON SCRIPTURAL MESSAGES 1 Introduction to Notes on Scriptural Messages The Passover 1 Issue No.
[2]  The magazine, Notes on Scriptural Messages, was composed of notes taken from messages given by Brother Watchman Nee in meetings in Shanghai.
[3]  Although the messages did not form a series, every one of them was an exposition of scriptural passages and not a free talk.
[4]  THE PASSOVER 1 A Message Given in Shanghai on June 6, 1930
[5]  First Corinthians 5:7-8 clearly refers to a story in the Old Testament, that of the Passover recorded in Exodus 12.
[6]  The explanation here shows us three things: 1 that the slain lamb of the Passover is Christ; 2 that the leaven is malice and evil; and 3 that since our Lamb, who is Christ, has been slain, we should also keep this feast before Christ.
[7]  "Your lamb shall be without blemish, a male of the first year; ye shall take it out from the sheep, or from the goats."
[8]  "And they shall take of the blood, and strike it on the two side posts and on the upper doorpost of the houses, wherein they shall eat it."
[9]  "And ye shall take a bunch of hyssop, and dip it in the blood that is in the basin, and strike the lintel and the two side posts with the blood that is in the basin; and none of you shall go out at the door of his house until the morning.
[10]  For the Lord will pass through to smite the Egyptians; and when he seeth the blood upon the lintel, and on the two side posts, the Lord will pass over the door, and will not suffer the destroyer to come in unto your houses to smite you."
[11]  Through the blood of Jesus Christ, we are saved.
[12]  "And thus shall ye eat it; with your loins girded, your shoes on your feet, and your staff in your hand; and ye shall eat it in haste: it is the Lord's passover."
[13]  The previous passage tells us how to eat; this verse tells us what one should do besides eating.
[14]  Without striking the blood, one cannot be saved even if the leaven is removed.
[15]  If one strikes the blood but does not remove the leaven, he cannot be sanctified either.
[16]  It is very pitiful that today many Christians have struck the blood, but few have removed the leaven!
[17]  It is said that during one Jewish Passover a carpenter examined carefully every item when the Feast of Unleavened Bread was approaching.
[18]  SALVATION OF THE SOUL 1 Transcript of Lord's Day Meeting in Shanghai
[19]  The question we wish to bring up today is one to which many, as far as I know, have not paid attention.
[20]  "Whoever loses his soul-life for My sake."
[21]  This is the denying of the self and taking up of the cross spoken of above.
[22]  To lose the soul means the same as denying the self.
[23]  The Lord reckons that if a man is willing to forsake all the pleasures of the soul for His sake and suffer according to God's will, he "shall find" his soul.
[24]  This means that whoever is willing for the Lord's sake to forsake his own mind and what he takes pleasure in, to prohibit his heart from finding satisfaction in the things of the world, and to endure much pain and suffering, the Lord will cause him to gain what his heart takes pleasure in, obtain satisfaction, enjoy blessing, and become happy at another time.
[25]  The main point of this portion of the Word is that there are two kinds of disciples who have believed in the Lord and have eternal life.
[26]  One kind denies the self and takes up the cross; the other kind is not willing to deny the self and take up the cross.
[27]  The latter, seeking to gain the pleasures of the world for the self, are not willing to lose the soul; the former are willing to forsake all and lose their soul for the Lord's sake.
[28]  A disciple is a person set apart from the sinners.
[29]  But the Lord sets the self-denying disciples apart from the non-self-denying disciples.
[30]  "And even as it happened in the days of Noah, so will it be also in the days of the Son of Man: they were eating, they were drinking, they were marrying, they were being given in marriage, until the day in which Noah entered into the ark and the flood came and destroyed them all.
[31]  Likewise, even as it happened in the days of Lot: they were eating, they were drinking, they were buying, they were selling, they were planting, they were building; but on the day in which Lot went out from Sodom, it rained fire and brimstone from heaven and destroyed them all.
[32]  It will be in the same way on the day in which the Son of Man is revealed.
[33]  In that day, he who will be on the housetop and his goods in the house, let him not come down to take them away; and he who is in the field, likewise, let him not turn back to the things behind.
[34]  Verse 34: "Do not think that I come to bring peace on the earth; I have not come to bring peace, but a sword."
[35]  Verse 25: "And there were great crowds going along with Him, and He turned and said to them..."
[36]  It is because He had just preached the gospel by means of a parable vv.
[37]  Verse 31: "Or what king, going to engage another king in war, will not first sit down and deliberate whether he is able with ten thousand to meet the one coming against him with twenty thousand?"
[38]  This does not mean that ten thousand soldiers are all the king has; it means only ten thousand are mobilized.
[39]  By reading through verses 5 to 19, we know that this portion of the word also speaks concerning the salvation of the soul.
[40]  "In your endurance you will possess your souls" v. 19 . I have said before that the Bible always mentions faith when it talks about our salvation.
[41]  "He who loves his soul-life loses it; and he who hates his soul-life in this world shall keep it unto eternal life."
[42]  The Lord says here that it is possible for one to lose his soul-life.
[43]  One loses his soul-life only because he loves it.
[44]  For example, the Lord calls us to stay away from a certain matter; if we want to obey Him, we must lay down our self.
[45]  Verse 38: "But My righteous one shall live by faith."
[46]  The righteous ones here are us who have been saved through faith in Jesus.
[47]  Many have asked me, "If justification is by faith, and the justified ones still have to live by faith, are there then two faiths?"
[48]  Verses 3-4: "Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, who according to His great mercy has regenerated us unto a living hope through the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead, unto an inheritance, incorruptible and undefiled and unfading, kept in the heavens for you."
[49]  These two verses tell us that those who received this Epistle have been saved.
[50]  Verse 5: "Who are being guarded by the power of God through faith unto a salvation ready to be revealed at the last time."
[51]  Verses 6-8: "In which time you exult, though for a little while at present, if it must be, you have been made sorrowful by various trials, so that the proving of your faith, much more precious than of gold which perishes though it is proved by fire, may be found unto praise and glory and honor at the revelation of Jesus Christ; whom having not seen, you love; into whom though not seeing Him at present, yet believing, you exult with joy that is unspeakable and full of glory."
[52]  I do not know when Enoch repented, and what he did before he was sixty-five years old.
[53]  But we know that he began to walk with God at the age of sixty-five after he begot Methuselah.
[54]  Hebrews 11:5: "By faith Enoch was translated so that he should not see death; and he was not found, because God had translated him.
[55]  For before his translation he obtained the testimony that he had been well pleasing to God."
[56]  Every one of us should walk to such an extent that we become well pleasing to God, and every one of us should believe in Him to the extent that we become raptured.
[57]  A BELIEVER'S WORTH BEFORE GOD A Message Given in Shanghai on December 8, 1930
[58]  Every time the life of a person is remembered before God, he will suffer a plague if he does not have a sin offering.
[59]  "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying...then shall they give every man a ransom for his soul unto the Lord, when thou numberest them; that there be no plague among them, when thou numberest them" Exo 30:11-12 .
[60]  When David sent Joab to number Israel, God was displeased and sent pestilence upon Israel 1 Chron 21 .
[61]  But the worth of a special vow is at least six times more than that of the ransom for life because the least amount is three shekels Lev 27:6 .
[62]  In some cases there is a hundredfold difference because some have to offer fifty shekels v. 3 . Why is there such a difference? This is because Exodus talks about salvation, whereas Leviticus talks about consecration.
[63]  Consecration means that it is not a matter of how much one likes to offer.
[64]  Rather, it is a matter of how much God thinks we are worth based on our willingness to consecrate.
[65]  From the viewpoint of salvation, God considers all of us worth half a shekel; no one is worth more than another, and everyone is worth the same regardless of wealth and age.
[66]  Our natural constitution is put aside completely by God because what causes us to be saved is the Son of God.
[67]  REDEEMING THE TIME A Transcript of Lord's Day Meeting, Given in Shanghai
[68]  Today is the first Lord's Day of the new year.
[69]  Therefore, let us listen to what the Bible has to say.
[70]  Not only do we need to seek the opportunity to love the Lord, we should also seek the opportunity to do good.
[71]  Brothers and sisters, what do you think to do good means?
[72]  Many believers and many of God's children are waiting for our help.
[73]  There is one thing among us which I feel is not good.
[74]  The modernists speak much with their mouths concerning service, but they do not serve.
[75]  But for us, we have neglected too much the matter of doing good and helping others.
[76]  Not only should we seize opportunity, we should also not give any opportunity for the flesh to make provision for itself, and we should not give any place to the devil.
[77]  Besides this, we should also seek for opportunities to save men.
[78]  THE SEAL OF THE HOLY SPIRIT A Message Given in Shanghai on February 21, 1931
[79]  The two passages we just read are the only places in the whole Bible that mention the Holy Spirit as a seal.
[80]  Today I am going to talk about the relationship between the Holy Spirit and the Christian.
[81]  There is one item concerning the Holy Spirit which I would ask you to pay special attention to.
[82]  What does the last part of verse 13 tell us about the Holy Spirit?
[83]  Thank God that the Holy Spirit is like a "seal."
[84]  Second Timothy 2:19 says, "Having this seal, 1 The Lord knows those who are His, and, 2 Let everyone who names the name of the Lord depart from unrighteousness."
[85]  Now let us look at verse 14: "Who is the pledge of our inheritance unto the redemption of the acquired possession, to the praise of His glory."
[86]  First, this indicates that we belong to God and, second, it makes us like God.
[87]  What we have covered thus far is the grace of God that has been given to us.
[88]  Now we will consider the responsibility that we should bear.
[89]  Let us read Ephesians 4:30: "And do not grieve the Holy Spirit of God, in whom you were sealed unto the day of redemption."
[90]  THE TWO RESTS A Message Given in Shanghai on April 24, 1931
[91]  Although I read this long portion of the word today, now I will only pay special attention to three verses.
[92]  They are verses 28, 29, and 30, which say, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest.
[93]  The rest in verse 28 is spoken of this way: "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest."
[94]  The first rest is the rest of being reconciled with God.
[95]  Now I will speak concerning another rest to those who have believed.
[96]  "Take My yoke upon you and learn from Me, for I am meek and lowly in heart, and you will find rest for your souls" Matt 11:29 .
[97]  Not only do we have to take the yoke, we also have to learn from the Lord.
[98]  The Lord's pattern is recorded in Philippians 2:6-8: "Who, existing in the form of God, did not consider being equal with God a treasure to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men; and being found in fashion as a man, He humbled Himself, becoming obedient even unto death, and that the death of a cross."
[99]  The first is that the Lord did not stand up to speak for His own right.
[100]  THE POWER OF CHOOSING Issue No. 16 Scripture Reading: Isa 7:1-2, 10-15
[101]  We are here today for one thing only, which is to learn more concerning the Lord Jesus.
[102]  All of us know how perfect the Lord was when He was on this earth.
[103]  In reading the four Gospels, we can see how good and perfect the outward living of the Lord was.
[104]  Yet from the four Gospels, we cannot tell why the Lord had such a superb outward living.
[105]  When the Lord came out of the water after His baptism, the heavens opened, and the Holy Spirit descended upon Him like a dove.
[106]  In the end, Satan himself appeared to Him and tempted Him saying, "If You are the Son of God, speak that these stones may become loaves of bread" Matt 4:3 .
[107]  On the mount of transfiguration, the Lord manifested to God and men the highest expression of Himself as a man.
[108]  The Bible never says that we will be perfect in this life.
[109]  A SILENT TESTIMONY Issue No. 16 Scripture Reading: John 12:1-3, 9-11
[110]  In this passage we see Martha, Mary, and Lazarus.
[111]  In the Scriptures that we have just read, the portion after the phrase "let us" tells us what we should do, while the portion before it tells us what the Lord has accomplished.
[112]  Since we have obtained so much, we need to draw nigh unto God with a true heart and in full assurance of faith.
[113]  Not only in public but also during private conversations, I have met many such people.
[114]  Once when a woman discussed this matter with me, I asked if she believed.
[115]  She was not an eloquent person and did not have much knowledge.
[116]  She told me that her grandparents and her parents were all believers and that she herself was also a believer.
[117]  Read again 2 Timothy 1:12: "For which cause also I suffer these things; but I am not ashamed, for I know whom I have believed, and I am persuaded that He is able to guard my deposit unto that day."
[118]  What did Paul commit to the Lord when he believed in Him?
[119]  He committed his future eternal salvation to the Lord.
[120]  He knew very clearly and understood very well that all the matters that he had committed to the Lord would be kept and not be lost unto that day.
[121]  The few passages that we have read testify that we can know that we have eternal life and that we can know that we are saved while we are still on earth.
[122]  Friends, please do not take the excuse that we do not know whether we will go to heaven or to hell until we are judged before God in the future.
[123]  O brothers and sisters, please remember that every one who believes has eternal life.
[124]  Many years ago there was an evangelist, Mr. Chapman, who saved many souls during his preaching and was very well known.
[125]  When I am zealous I am the most zealous of all men; but when I am cold there is no one colder than I. When I am zealous, I can boldly say that I am a Christian, but when I am cold, I dare not claim that I am a Christian." Mr. Moody did not say anything but asked him to read John 5:24: "Truly, truly, I say to you, He who hears My word and believes Him who sent Me has eternal life, and does not come into judgment but has passed out of death into life." After reading the verse, he asked Mr. Chapman, "Are you a saved Christian?" Although Mr. Chapman had a doctorate degree, he responded the same way as that old widow: "I have told you that when I endeavor to do good, I am a Christian, but when I am cold and am not doing good, I am not a Christian." Moody said, "What does this verse say? What do you have after you have heard the gospel and believed in the One that sent Christ, that is, after you have believed in the heavenly Father? Does not the Bible say that this kind of person has eternal life and has passed out of death into life? Mr. Chapman, since you are a believer in the Lord, you are a saved Christian." Mr. Chapman stopped and considered doubtfully.
[126]  If a person does not understand the way to be saved, he cannot know whether or not he is saved.
[127]  A person who wants to be saved must first know the conditions and the basis of salvation.
[128]  If you do not understand the basis of salvation you cannot know whether you are saved.
[129]  Once I was in Amoy discussing the matter of salvation with a great merchant there.
[130]  We discussed it from nine o'clock in the evening to half past eleven o'clock, but the matter was still not settled.
[131]  If a person has believed in the Lord and continues to sin without any hatred towards sin, this shows that he has not yet been regenerated.
[132]  An unregenerated person does not have life and is not saved.
[133]  God has not only given us objective salvation, but He has also given us subjective salvation.
[134]  If any man thinks he has a new life and is regenerated, yet continues to sin, his faith is not genuine, and he is not really regenerated.
[135]  The above passages record incidents that happened after the Lord Jesus' resurrection.
[136]  In both instances, the Lord asked a question of the disciples.
[137]  Given in Shanghai on June 11, 1931 I. TESTIMONY BY MR. WU WEI
[138]  Today I thank God for giving me the opportunity to meet all the brothers and sisters here.
[139]  March 22nd of this year was a Lord's Day.
[140]  A few days before that, Mr. Chi and I had the intention to visit the brothers and sisters in Shanghai.
[141]  The reason for our visit was that we were co-workers in the Lord and we felt this was something we should do.
[142]  Although we have left the denominations , we are only separated from them as far as regulations are concerned.
[143]  Humanly speaking and as far as our relationship in the Lord is concerned, there is still no distinction between them and us.
[144]  We have no opinions or prejudice against those in the denominations.
[145]  THE MEANING OF BAPTISM Issue No. 19 Scripture Reading: Acts 22:16; Rom 6:3-4 THE MEANING OF BAPTISM
[146]  Today we will consider a special subject: the meaning of baptism.
[147]  We will not spend any time to find out what baptism is and is not.
[148]  Rather, we will specifically consider the meaning of baptism, the biblical teaching concerning it, and the emphasis in baptism.
[149]  Why does the Bible tell us that we should be baptized?
[150]  The Bible is most amazing in the way it is written.
[151]  I have said this before and I will say it again that there are two aspects to sin, and there are two aspects to the way God deals with sin.
[152]  The Bible tells us that there is a difference between sins and sin; one is before God, and the other is within us.
[153]  Our sins before God have to be forgiven and washed away, while sin within us must be overcome, and we must be delivered from it.
[154]  Our sins before God have been borne by the Lord Jesus, but the sin within us can only be removed through reckoning ourselves as dead.
[155]  Since there are the two aspects of sin, the aspect before God and the aspect before men, there are also two aspects of deliverance.
[156]  There is the punishment of sin and the power of sin.
[157]  This does not mean that there are two deliverances; it means that there are two aspects of deliverance.
[158]  We know that sin is very evil, and we all hope to remove sin from our body.
[159]  But we do not realize that the existence of the root of sin, like the existence of the devil himself, has nothing to do with the fruit of sanctification.
[160]  Now let us come back to our main subject.
[161]  On the one hand, it is because our sins are washed away.
[162]  THE PRODIGAL SON Issue No. 20 Scripture Reading: Luke 15:11-32
[163]  I have spoken on this passage three times already.
[164]  Today I will not speak much about it again.
[165]  I am not going to cover the whole parable but only point out a few things.
[166]  I will speak a little here and a little there in a fragmentary way.
[167]  We should see that the son thought he was not worthy to be called a son; he thought that he would only be a hired servant.
[168]  But the father told the slaves to bring the best robe out quickly and put it on him and put a ring on his hand and sandals on his feet.
[169]  This shows us that salvation demonstrates God's riches and not our poverty.
[170]  There are some preachers who have been preaching for many years, who still do not understand salvation.
[171]  When we are somewhat awakened, we are not sure if God will forgive us when we call on Him.
[172]  When we hear the Father telling us that our sins are forgiven, we have peace and joy.
[173]  If we have not yet received the freedom of forgiveness, we are indeed poor men.
[174]  All who are sitting here today have heard that their sins are forgiven; they have peace and do not need to ask anyone or look for any other evidence.
[175]  As long as God has said it, it is enough.
[176]  When He says that we are forgiven, we are forgiven.
[177]  Unfortunately, we only enjoy half of the happiness; we have not yet entered into God's happiness, enjoyed His happiness, and allowed Him to enjoy His happiness over us.
[178]  WAS NOT DISAPPOINTED Issue No. 21 Scripture Reading: John 4:13-14; 2:23-24; 6:15; 7:3-4, 6, 9; 12:24; 13:37-38; 16:31-33
[179]  Our Lord did everything well when He was on earth.
[180]  There is one verse in Mark that says that He has done all things well Mark 7:37 .
[181]  On the negative side, we should not cherish any hope concerning the world.
[182]  If we do not expect any fame, glory, help, comfort, or support from this world, we will never be thirsty.
[183]  We should take care of the way we view the water of this world.
[184]  Our view concerning the world will surely determine our hope towards those in the world.
[185]  "Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed into His name when they saw the signs which He did.
[186]  In particular, the workers of the Lord should learn this lesson.
[187]  Although men may turn their face towards us today, they may kick their heels at us tomorrow.
[188]  The ones who cried, "Hosanna," to the Lord one day were the same ones who cried, "Take Him away," the next day.
[189]  The Lord was not discouraged or disappointed by them.
[190]  The three passages we have just read help us see how Christ served us in the past, still serves us in the present, and is going to serve us in the future.
[191]  Let us consider the first passage: "For even the Son of Man did not come to be served, but to serve and to give His life as a ransom for many" Mark 10:45 .
[192]  They were so frightened that they cried out, but immediately the Lord spoke to them, "It is I. Do not be afraid" Mark 6:45-51 . The Lord might have said to them, "It is your Lord," or, "It is the Son of God." Instead, He said, "It is I." What is meant by this? Suppose someone knocks at the door, and the host of the house responds with: "Who is it?" If the knocking one answers, "It is I," we can be assured that the host must be familiar with the one who knocks at the door because the host can distinguish the voice of "I." The Lord came to help the disciples with such a dear and intimate voice.
[193]  Today I am going to focus on verse 19, which says that the Lord sanctified Himself for the disciples' sake.
[194]  The Lord's desire that His disciples be sanctified required Him to first sanctify Himself for their sake.
[195]  Once in the wilderness, there were four thousand people following Jesus, not including women and children, and it was late in the day.
[196]  He said, "I am moved with compassion for the crowd, because for three days now they have remained with Me and they do not have anything to eat" Matt 15:32 .
[197]  It indicates that the Lord had not eaten for three days either.
[198]  THE WORK IN SHANGHAI A Record of Mr. Nee's Speaking after a
[199]  When there is no believer in a locality, God's workers work to lead men to salvation.
[200]  After some are saved, there is a church in that place.
[201]  Are there then no specific responsible ones and no specific positions in a local church?
[202]  Someone may then be misled to think that those who have not been publicly announced by us cannot break bread with us.
[203]  An announcement does not have the authority to allow the announced ones to break bread.
[204]  Some may say, "Did you not say only those who have been publicly recommended can break bread?"
[205]  Rather, there is the need of two or three brothers or sisters to recommend a person to us by telling us that this brother or sister has really been born again, and that they are now recommending him to break bread with us.
[206]  The meetings in which we break bread to remember the Lord are not times for us to listen to messages.
[207]  They are actually times for us to praise the Lord and serve Him.
[208]  The singing of hymns and praying in these meetings should have such as their center.
[209]  However, there are those who wonder what we are doing and come in to observe us; there are those who bring others in to observe; there are also those who come in by accident.
[210]  According to the Bible, the offerings made by the believers in the meetings should be used for: 1 the local expenses, for example, rent, etc., 2 the relief of the brothers and sisters who are in poverty and want, and 3 the assistance of the workers and the expenses for the work, as commanded by the Bible.
[211]  Actually, the workers of a locality should be supported by the believers of that locality.
[212]  The funds of the meetings should be used in such a manner.
[213]  The individual believer still has a responsibility towards relieving the poor and assisting the workers and the work.
[214]  THE BETTER BLOOD Issue No. 24 Scripture Reading: Gen 4:8-11; Heb 12:24; 1 John 5:6, 8
[215]  These verses mention the blood of the Lord and the blood of Abel.
[216]  Hebrews 12:24 tells us concerning the Lord's blood that "the blood...speaks something better than that of Abel."
[217]  The blood of the Lord Jesus speaks something better than that of Abel.
[218]  THE LOVE OF CHRIST Issue No. 25 Scripture Reading: Rom 8:35-39; 2 Cor 5:14-15; Eph 3:14-19
[219]  These three passages have one identical phrase, which is "the love of Christ."
[220]  The Bible mentions the love of Christ many times, but only in these three cases does it specifically use this phrase.
[221]  The rest of the time it speaks of the love of God.
[222]  Strictly speaking, the love of Christ is the love of God.
[223]  For example, in Romans 8:35 it says, "Who shall separate us from the love of Christ?" while in verse 39 it concludes, "Nor...will be able to separate us from the love of God."
[224]  Hebrews 11 mentions Abel, Enoch, and many other men of old and tells us how they did many things "by faith."
[225]  Here we are shown one very important thing that is indispensable to every Christian.
[226]  Let us consider first the putting away of sin.
[227]  A violator will not be allowed to run the race but will be taken out of the race.
[228]  To "run" means to not stand still, it means to not walk slowly.
[229]  It means to run forward fast and finish the longest distance within the shortest time.
[230]  Jesus, the One we look unto, is such a Jesus.
[231]  He "for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God" Heb 12:2 .
[232]  In principle, the process should be the same for us too.
[233]  Shame was given to Him by men, and He despised it.
[234]  The cross was given to Him by God, and He endured it.
