<P>The contents of the outlines in this book are from notes and printed publications of Brother Witness Lee that have been released by him from 1964 through 1990. Our brother points out that the Lord's table meeting is the most important meeting of a local church. We pray that these outlines will uplift our vision and practice of the Lord's table meeting as we remember Him and display His death until He comes (1 Cor. 11:26).</P>

it is for remembering the Lord with the remembrance of the Lord as its center for the Lord's enjoyment.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Everything done in the meeting&#151;whether the singing and speaking of the hymns, prayer and praise, Bible reading, or words of inspiration&#151;should take the Lord as the center.</li>		<li>The attendants in the meeting should speak concerning the Lord's person and work, His love and virtues, His living and suffering on the earth, or His glory and honor in heaven, that others may consider or realize these things in order to remember the Lord Himself.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The Lord's table meeting of a local church must be proper and adequate.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>A poor meeting exposes the weakness of the saints in a local church.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>An improper meeting shows that the church has not received the necessary training.</li>			<li>An inadequate meeting shows that the church is immature.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>A strong meeting indicates that a local church bears a prevailing testimony of the Lord.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li><li>First Corinthians 11 deals with the Lord's supper (v. 20); the Lord's table is dealt with in 1 Corinthians 10 (v. 21).	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>When we eat the Lord's supper, the emphasis is on the remembrance of the Lord.</li>	<li>Attending the Lord's table is for the fellowship of Christ and for the members of His Body to fellowship together in the Lord, the stress being on the fellowship among the saints.</li>	<li>The Lord's supper does not include the Lord's table, but the Lord's table includes the Lord's supper.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>When we eat the Lord's supper, we remember Christ.</li>		<li>When we gather for the Lord's table, both aspects are included&#151;we remember the Lord and we fellowship with Christ and His members.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>The Lord's supper is for the Lord's enjoyment and satisfaction; the Lord's table is for our participation, enjoyment, fellowship.</li>	</ol></li></ol><ol class="upper-roman" start="3"><li>There are two major aspects of the Lord's table meeting.	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Eating the Lord's supper is for the remembrance of the Lord&#151;1 Cor. 11:24-25.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>This could be called the vertical aspect of the Lord's table meeting.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>It is a remembrance of the Lord's person, not His work.</P>			<li>Our prayer and praise rendered to the Lord should be concerning the Lord Himself.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>First Corinthians 11:24 speaks of breaking the bread "unto the remembrance of Me."			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>We come to the Lord's table not to remember the Lord's death,</li>			<li>But rather Christ Himself.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>First Corinthians 11:25 speaks of drinking the cup "unto the remembrance of Me."			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>We come to the Lord's table not to remember the Lord's work,</li>			<li>But rather Christ Himself.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>To attend the Lord's table meeting and automatically eat the Lord's supper in remembrance of the Lord's death is a natural concept; to remember Christ Himself, we need a vision regarding His person.</li>		<li>We should remember the person much more than the work.</li>		<li>By eating the Lord's bread and drinking the Lord's cup, we eat the Lord's supper in remembrance of the Lord.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Attending the Lord's table is for us to have the fellowship with all the members of the Body of Christ&#151;1 Cor. 10:16-17.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>This could be called the horizontal aspect of the Lord's table meeting.</li>		<li>We have this fellowship because of the Lord's body, which He gave for us on the cross and the Lord's blood which He shed for us on the cross.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>The cup, which we enjoy together and which symbolizes the blood of Christ, removes all barriers between the saints; the bread, which we partake of together and which symbolizes the individual body of Christ, comes into us to make us one bread, signifying the corporate Body of Christ.</li>			<li>Our eating and partaking of one bread and drinking and sharing one cup imply mutual fellowship.</li>			<li>Such a fellowship becomes the fellowship of the blood of Christ and the fellowship of the body of Christ&#151;1 Cor. 10:16.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>In 1 Corinthians 10:16-17 and 21, both the vertical and horizontal aspects of the Lord's table are seen&#151;the fellowship with Christ and the fellowship with the Body of Christ.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>When we eat and drink together, sharing in the Lord's bread and the Lord's cup, "we partake of the table of the Lord."</li>			<li>We must partake of the Lord's table with other saints; otherwise, we would only have the vertical aspect.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol<ol class="upper-roman" start="4"><li>How do we remember the Lord and fellowship with the members of His Body?	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>How do we remember the Lord?		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The breaking of the bread is that we may eat it&#151;Matt. 26:26; 1 Cor. 11:23-24.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Concerning the bread the Lord said, "This is My body, which is for you; this do unto the remembrance of Me"&#151;1 Cor. 11:24; Luke 22:19.</li>			<li>The Lord also said, "Take, eat, this is My body"&#151;Matt. 26:26.</li>			<li>We remember the Lord by eating the bread&#151;1 Cor. 11:24.				<ol class="none">				<li>1) To remember the Lord is to feed on Him, to eat Him&#151;John 6:57b.</li>				<li>2) The more we receive, eat, and feast on Him, the more we remember Him.</li>				</ol></li>			</ol></li>		<li>The partaking of the cup is that we may drink it&#151;Matt. 26:27; 1 Cor. 11:25.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Concerning the cup 1 Corinthians 11:25 says, "Similarly also the cup after supper, saying, This cup is the new covenant in My blood; this do, as often as you drink it, unto the remembrance of Me."</li>			<li>The Lord also said, "Drink of it, all of you; for this is My blood of the covenant"&#151;Matt. 26:27b-28a.</li>			<li>We remember the Lord by drinking the cup&#151;1 Cor. 11:25.				<ol class="none">				<li>1) To remember the Lord is to drink of Him, to drink Him.</li>				<li>2) The more we drink Him, the more we remember Him.</li>				</ol></li>			</ol></li>		<li>The real remembrance of the Lord is to eat the bread which signifies His body and drink the cup which signifies His blood.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>When we eat the Lord's body and drink His blood, we not only receive but also enjoy the Lord Himself and all that He has accomplished by giving His body and shedding His blood; this is to receive, to participate in, to enjoy, the Lord who has given Himself to us through His redeeming death.</li>			<li>To eat the bread and drink the cup is to take in the redeeming Lord as our portion (Psa. 16:5; Lam. 3:24; Col. 1:12), as our life and blessing.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>To receive and enjoy the Lord in this way is to remember Him.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>How do we fellowship?		<ol class="decimal">		<li>We fellowship with all the members of the Body of Christ by partaking of the same bread&#151;1 Cor. 10:16-17.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>We all partake of the same loaf.</li>			<li>A piece of bread enters into me and a piece enters into the other brothers and sisters.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>We fellowship with all the members of the Body of Christ by drinking of the same cup.</li>		<li>Christ and the disciples ate of the same bread and drank of the same cup&#151;Mark 14:22-23.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>When we come to the Lord's table meeting, we should come to receive the Lord into us.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>For this we must learn how to exercise our spirit to eat and drink Him; we should not only consider the Lord in our heart, but also receive Him and what He did for us as our enjoyment in our spirit.</li>		<li>By feeding on and drinking of Christ in spirit we have both aspects&#151;the remembrance of the Lord and the fellowship with all the members of Christ.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol>
<ol class="upper-roman" start="5"><li>There are two minor aspects of the Lord's table meeting:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To display the Lord's death&#151;1 Cor. 11:26.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>First Corinthians 11:26 says, "You declare [show, display, proclaim, announce] the Lord's death."</li>		<li>The Lord's supper is to display the death of the Lord, rather than to remember it.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>We remember the person of the Lord, but we announce, proclaim, His death.</li>			<li>We declare His death to the entire universe: to the demons, to the angels, and to human beings.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>While we remember the Lord, the two elements, the bread (body) and cup (blood), are displayed separately on the table.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>This shows that the blood is separated from the body, signifying death.</li>			<li>With this display of death we proclaim and announce Christ's all-inclusive termination of twelve items on the cross&#151;the angelic life (Col. 1:20), the human life (Gal. 2:20), Satan (Heb. 2:14; John 12:31), the kingdom of Satan (Col. 2:15; John 12:31), sin (2 Cor. 5:21; Rom. 8:3), sins (1 Pet. 2:24; Isa. 53:6), the world (Gal. 6:14; John 12:31), death (Heb. 2:14), flesh (Gal. 5:24), the old man (Rom. 6:6), self (Gal. 2:20), and all things, or creation (Col. 1:20).</li>			</ol></li>		<li>By the death of the Lord all negative things have come to an end, and their end is displayed openly; this is the negative aspect.</li>		<li>The table also shows we can receive the Lord, symbolized by the bread and wine, into ourselves; this is the positive aspect.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>On the one hand, the old creation is ended, but on the other hand, His new creation has begun.</li>			<li>Now He mingles Himself with us and we live by Him.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	<li>To express our hope&#151;1 Cor. 11:26.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>According to 1 Corinthians 11:26, we are to declare the Lord's death "until He comes."</li>		<li>We take the Lord's supper for the remembrance of Him by declaring His redeeming death without ceasing until He comes back.</li>		<li>We are declaring a glorious matter, but we also have a glorious hope.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>In a sense we are satisfied, but there is still a hope within us&#151;Col. 1:27.</li>			<li>One day He will return and change our body (1 Cor. 15:51-54); we are waiting for this.				<ol class="none">				<li>1) Our body will be transfigured at His coming&#151;Phil. 3:21.</li>				<li>2) Our redemption will be complete&#151;Rom. 8:23.</li>				</ol></li>			</ol></li>		<li>The words "until He comes" point to the coming kingdom&#151;Matt. 26:29.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>In Matthew 26:29 the Lord told us that He would not drink of the fruit of the vine until He drinks it new with us in the kingdom of His Father.</li>			<li>The coming kingdom is a matter of God's universal administration.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	<li>These two minor aspects of the Lord's supper point to the two comings of Christ.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In His first coming we have His death to carry out an all-inclusive redemption&#151;the goal of His first coming.</li>		<li>His second coming will be after His having received the kingdom (Dan. 7:13-14; Luke 19:12-27), at which time He will establish this kingdom to be God's universal administration&#151;the goal of His second coming.</li>		<li>The death of Christ in His first coming produced the church, and the church will bring in the kingdom with His second coming; to declare the Lord's death until He comes is equal to declaring the existence of the church for the bringing in of the kingdom.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>The church connects the Lord's death with His coming back; the church is a highway from one side to the other.</li>			<li>The church continues the Lord's death and brings in His coming back.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><H1 CLASS=MSG>OUTLINE TWO</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE REMEMBRANCE OF THE LORD</H1><H1 CLASS=PAREN>(2)</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: John 6:33-35, 48;

the bread of life refers to the nature of the bread, which is life.</li>			<li>When we see or receive the bread that we break, we should consider how the Lord became flesh for us, how He died for us in the flesh, and how His body was broken for us and given to us that we may have His life.</li>			<li>This is the meaning related to eating the Lord's supper; the Lord's body being broken to be given as bread to us means that He gave His body for us that we may have His life.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>Bread in the Scriptures also signifies corporateness.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>In 1 Corinthians 10:17 the bread is a symbol of an organic composition&#151;a corporate body: "For we who are many are one bread, one Body."</li>			<li>The bread in this aspect signifies something that issued from the Lord in resurrection.				<ol class="none">				<li>1) Before His death, the Lord Jesus was a single grain of wheat&#151;John 12:24.</li>				<li>2) But what issued out of His death in resurrection was much fruit, a corporate entity, a loaf, the bread, a corporate Body&#151;1 Cor. 10:17.</li>				</ol></li>			<li>All the believers, the grains (John 12:24), are ground into fine flour and then blended together to form one loaf (1 Cor. 10:17).</li>			<li>In the one loaf, we see that all the children of God are one.</li>			<li>On the one hand, we remember the Lord and enjoy Him by receiving the body which He gave for us on the cross in His death; on the other hand, we enjoy the mystical Body which He produced through His resurrection from the dead by fellowshipping with all the saints in this mystical Body and by testifying of the oneness of this mystical Body.</li>			<li>This is the meaning related to attending the Lord's table; the bread refers to the Lord's corporate Body, which He constituted with all the regenerated saints through His resurrection from the dead.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	<li>What is the meaning of the cup?		<ol class="decimal">		<li>In the Scriptures the wine is called the cup.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>The bread, however, is not called the plate.</li>			<li>Why then does the Bible call the wine by its container?</li>			</ol></li>		<li>The cup in the Scriptures signifies the "portion."			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Psalm 16:5 says, "The Lord is the portion of...my cup."</li>			<li>Psalm 23:5 says, "My cup runneth over."</li>			<li>In Psalm 116:13 we have the cup of salvation; this is God's portion allotted to His people.</li>			<li>In Revelation 14:10 we have the cup of God's wrath; this is God's portion allotted to those who deny Him.				<ol class="none">				<li>1) The portion of a sinner's cup is the "cup of His wrath," full of the "wine of the fury of God."</li>				<li>2) Christ drank this cup for us&#151;John 18:11.</li>				</ol></li>			</li>When Christ drank the cup of wrath, His blood was poured out, and this brought salvation to us, bringing us a new cup.				<ol class="none">				<li>1) In the New Testament, in 1 Corinthians 10:16, this new cup is called the cup of blessing.</li>				<li>2) In the Old Testament, in Psalm 116:13, this cup was called the cup of salvation.</li>				</ol></li>			<li>In the Lord's table meeting, we should consider the Lord and what He did for us not only when we see or receive the bread, which we break, but also when we see or receive the cup, which we drink.</li>			</ol></li>		</ol></li>	<li>What is the cup of blessing?		<ol class="decimal">		<li>The blood of Christ is signified by the fruit of the vine within the cup (Matt. 26:29), but the portion is not the blood.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>The blood is the essence of Christ, but the Lord is the portion of the cup.</li>			<li>The blood did two things for us.				<ol class="none">				<li>1) It washed away our sins.</li>				<li>2) It brought God Himself to us.</li>				</ol></li>			</ol></li>		<li>Whenever we drink of the cup, we should consider how the Lord partook of flesh and blood for us (Heb. 2:14), how He shed His blood for us, and how He bore our sins, was made sin for us, and was judged and cursed for us; all this was accomplished that we might have the topmost blessing, that is, to be delivered from sin and obtain God and all that is of Him as our cup of blessing.</li>		<li>When we receive the cup, we should also consider how we have been redeemed, forgiven, sanctified, justified, reconciled, and accepted by God through the Lord's blood; how it now cleanses us from our sins and washes our conscience so that we may come to God with boldness; how it speaks better things before God; and how it resists the attacks from the evil spirits for us so that we may overcome the devil who accuses us.</li>		<li>In Luke 22:20 the cup is the new covenant or title deed which was enacted by the blood of Christ and testifies of the portion we receive from God.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>His blood instituted a new covenant, a better covenant (Heb. 8:6-13), which became the new testament after His resurrection (Heb. 9:16-17).</li>			<li>The blood Christ shed on the cross has become a covenant, and this covenant has become a cup, a portion, which is God Himself as a blessing for our enjoyment; God is allotted to us in this cup.				<ol class="none">				<li>1) This new covenant became the base for God to become one with His redeemed and regenerated people in the dispensation of grace.</li>				<li>2) In this covenant, God gives us forgiveness, life, salvation and every heavenly, divine, and spiritual blessing.</li>				<li>3) When this new covenant is given to us, it is a cup (Luke 22:20); in this cup are all the blessings of God and even God Himself as our portion.</li>				</ol></li>			</ol></li>		<li>The Lord shed the blood, God established the covenant, and we enjoy the cup in which God and all that is of Him are our eternal, blessed portion.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Thus, the bread signifies our participation in life and the fellowship of the Body of Christ, and the cup signifies our enjoyment of the Triune God Himself as our unique portion and blessing (Num. 6:23-27; 2 Cor. 13:14).</li>	</ol></li></ol><ol class="upper-roman" start="7"><li>Each time in the Lord's table meeting with the bread and the cup, we receive the life supply of the Lord and review the redemption through His blood.</li>	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>On the cross the Lord's body was broken for us so that He could be distributed as bread to us.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>This signifies His giving His body on the cross that we may obtain Him as our life.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>Through the breaking of His body on the cross, he released the life of God from within Him to impart it into us.</li>			<li>When we receive His broken body, we partake of His life.</li>			</ol></li>		<li>Christ gave His body as the bread of life for our life supply and our enjoyment.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Furthermore, on the cross Christ not only gave His body for us but also shed His blood for us.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>He shed His blood to accomplish redemption for us that we may be forgiven of our sins; on the cross He took away our sin (John 1:29).</li>		<li>God's eternal purpose is to dispense, in the Lord Jesus, His life into us, but because of our fall we became sinful before God; therefore, Christ shed His blood for us.</li>		</ol></li>	<li>Thus, whenever we eat the bread and drink the cup, we enjoy this life, we receive this life supply from the Lord, and we review the redemption accomplished by the Lord's precious blood.</li>	</ol></li><li>The revelation concerning the order or arrangement of the bread and the cup in the Scriptures.	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Why is the order or arrangement different in chapters ten (v. 16) and eleven (vv. 24-25) of 1 Corinthians?</li>	<li>In 1 Corinthians 11:24-25 the bread is mentioned first and then the cup.		<ol class="decimal">		<li>First Corinthians 11:24-25 deals with the Lord's supper.</li>		<li>In 1 Corinthians 11:24-25 the bread is first because the Body is the original and ultimate purpose of God.			<ol class="lower-alpha">			<li>God wants a Body to express Himself and defeat His enemy.</li>			<li>However, before this was realized, man fell; thus, redemption was needed.				<ol class="none">				<li>1) Man needed to be recovered to the original purpose of God.</li>				<li>2) This recovery was accomplished by the cup.</li>				</ol></li>			</ol></li>		<li>The bread (the Body) is the original purpose of God, so it is spoken of first;
