<P>In this message I would like to present an extract of the basic divine revelation in the Holy Scriptures. The seven points of this extract may be regarded as an extract of our theology. If you study all these points, you will see that the theology in the Lord's recovery is much different from all the theologies in today's Christianity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. TO KNOW THE PROCESSED<br>AND CONSUMMATED TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>First, we need to know the processed and consummated Triune God (Matt. 28:19).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Incarnated to Be the Flesh</H2><P>The Triune God was incarnated to be the flesh (John 1:14). Through incarnation He became the first God-man, the Lord Jesus, and as such He expressed God in His humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Anointed to Be the Christ</H2><P>God was incarnated to be a God-man, and this God-man was anointed to be the Christ, the anointed One of God, to accomplish God's plan in His eternal economy (Luke 4:18). Actually, it was God Himself who came to accomplish what He had planned in eternity according to His eternal economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Consummated to Be the Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>The Triune God has been consummated to be the life-giving Spirit to apply what Christ has accomplished (1 Cor. 15:45b). God the Father planned; God the Son accomplished what God the Father planned; and God the Spirit applies what God the Son has accomplished according to God the Father's plan.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. TO KNOW THE ALL-INCLUSIVE CHRIST</H2><P>Next we need to know the all-inclusive Christ in many different aspects.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Mystery of God</H2><P>We need to know the all-inclusive Christ as the mystery of God to be the reality of the Triune God (Col. 2:2). Christ is both the mystery of God and the reality of God. Embodied in Christ is all that God is and has. All that God intends to do is related to Christ. If we do not know this Christ, we do not know God. We may say that Christ is the key that opens up the way into God. When we have Christ, God is open to us. Through Him we know God and even are brought into God.</P><P>In Colossians 2:2 Paul speaks of "the mystery of God, Christ." The fact that Christ is the mystery of God indicates that He is not simple. On the contrary, He is immeasurable and mysterious. To be sure, God is not simple. He is unlimited, infinite, eternal. How, then, could Christ, the mystery of God, be simple? As the mystery of God, Christ is the immeasurable, infinite, and eternal God.</P>
