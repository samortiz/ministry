   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE PROPER ATTITUDE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>DURING THE DESOLATION OF THE CHURCH 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As those who live during the desolation of the church, we need to realize that the desolation manifests our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>DESOLATION MANIFESTING EACH ONE S CONDITION</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First Corinthians 11:19 says, For there must even be parties among you, that those who are approved may become manifest among you.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Those who are approved can also be translated those who are approved by testing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that when there are parties in the church, those whom God approves are manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>During the desolation of the church, the different kinds of confusion, errors, and corruption function to manifest the ones approved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whoever passes through the tests and is approved by God will be manifested through the desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God does not desire the desolation, but in His hand it functions to manifest those who can pass the tests.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Without desolation, confusion, errors, corruption, and darkness, we would not be able to see each individual s condition.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In other words, during a time of peace and security, we cannot tell whom God approves and who passes the test.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>However, when situations of desolation arise, our condition is manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are manifested with respect to what kind of person we are, including our situation before the Lord, the lessons we have learned, and our motives.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These matters cannot remain hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Desolation tests us and manifests what we are before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Thank the Lord that at present in Taiwan we do not have contentions among us; however, no one can guarantee that in six months or a year the church will still be without some desolation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When there is desolation, our real situation will be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Desolation exposes people; corrupt things expose people.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the church is peaceful and secure, everyone is the same; we do not feel that we are any different from others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when desolation comes in, our situation cannot be hidden, and all things are manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE PROPER ATTITUDE</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>DURING A PERIOD OF DESOLATION</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In facing the desolation of the church, we should ask ourselves, Where do I stand?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Is my intention proper?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Is my motive pure?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Is there any area in which I am disobedient to God?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Have I been dealt with by God to a sufficient extent?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If our inward condition is improper, we will be unable to control ourselves when desolation comes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 1942 there was a storm in the church in Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I was not there and did not understand the real situation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Later, I went to Shanghai, and gradually I learned what had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Very few brothers and sisters stood firm during that storm; only a handful passed through the storm and were approved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The storm manifested the real condition of their hearts and fulfilled the word in 1 Corinthians 11:19.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The storm was like a flood, sweeping away many and leaving only a small number who passed the test and were approved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Desolation has its usefulness, but we should be careful when desolation comes, because it will expose us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When desolation or corruption comes into the church, it is a test to all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Holding a Good Conscience</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First Timothy 1:19-20 says, Holding...a good conscience, concerning which some, thrusting these away, have become shipwrecked regarding the faith; of whom are Hymenaeus and Alexander.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The books of 1 and 2 Timothy contain the most practical speaking in all the Bible regarding the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In both 1 and 2 Timothy Paul emphasizes the conscience because it is very much related to the desolation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When the church is in desolation, those who follow the Lord and live before Him must hold a good conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Paul commands Timothy to war the good warfare of the faith 1 Tim 1:18 and to guard the good deposit 2 Tim 1:13-14 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>However, Paul s commands to Timothy concerning holding a good conscience are stronger than his words concerning holding the faith.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In a sense, the main reason the church became desolate was because of problems in people s conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Some deviated from the faith, and some spoke differently from the apostles, because they did not care for the feeling in their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we consider carefully we will realize that all the confusion in the church comes from people quenching and ignoring the feeling of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>A person may hold the faith and yet have a problem in his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, he cannot hold a good conscience without holding the faith, because if he does not hold the faith, his conscience will condemn him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>During the desolation of the church, the opinions, ideas, and assertions of others cannot be our guide; the speaking of our conscience within us is our guide.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order to hold a good conscience, we must avoid doing anything that causes the conscience to lose its peace.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We do not need to argue about whether or not our conscience is good.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When I was in northern China, some people rebuked me, saying that I was causing trouble in Christianity, and they carelessly made false accusations against me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I did not argue with them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I only said, I have peace in my conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>May you, too, have peace in your conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many times when I spoke in this way, their expressions would change, and they would be unable to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What we say does not mean anything; the conscience is our standard.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we are at peace in our heart, everything is all right.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>During the desolation of the church, the function of the conscience is crucial, just as lights are crucial in a time of darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once some people fiercely rebuked Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He said softly, You have One within you who is speaking on my behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This influenced me greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Excuses, debates, and arguments are useless; the conscience is our standard.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Therefore, we should not reason with others or with ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Rather, we should simply check whether our conscience is at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In all things we need to ask ourselves about our conscience; only the voice of our conscience can be our standard.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When people rebuke us, we do not need to argue with them.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the midst of outward difficulties we should seek inward peace.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When God first touches us, He touches our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is both the beginning and the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Regardless of how deep or high our experience of the Lord is, the conscience is still the primary part.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>One of the main factors in the desolation of the church is that the brothers and sisters have problems with their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Because they did not care for the sense in their conscience, some veered off from the faith, and others opposed the apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>To deal with desolation, we must deal with our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Once our conscience has been dealt with, the desolation is almost behind us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Consider the example of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When the church is in a proper condition, there is only one teaching regarding baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>However, when the church is in desolation, there are many questions.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Someone may ask, Should I be baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>How should I be baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>These are typical questions.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We do not need to argue; we can simply say, Whatever you have the peace in your heart to do is fine.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Do whatever you have the peace to do.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This will touch his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Once a brother told me that he had the peace not to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>I answered, Fine.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Then do not be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The next day he came to me again because he had no inward peace.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>He admitted that he was wrong and asked to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is more effective to touch someone s conscience than to speak ten messages to him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>As Christians, we must act in a way that takes care of the peace within.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>It is useless to argue about doctrines with people; rather, we should touch the feeling in their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>If God has not touched our conscience, we will be unable to touch someone else s conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Because the Lord Jesus had a pure conscience, He could touch other people s conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If His conscience had condemned Him, He could not have said to the crowd in John 8:7, He who is without sin among you, let him be the first to throw a stone at her.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Because His word touched their conscience, they walked away one by one, from the oldest to the youngest.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Lord touched their conscience, because His conscience was pure.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>My intention is not to show how to deal with others during the desolation; I am begging the Lord that we would see a principle that we can apply to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>During the desolation of the church, there are many different interpretations and arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>If we follow a certain interpretation, we will be shaken; if we follow a certain argument, we will be confused.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The standard is our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>First John 3:21 says, If our heart does not blame us, we have boldness toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>This word was spoken during the desolation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In some things God condemns us according to the feeling of our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>We may be wrong in certain matters, but if our conscience has no feeling, our responsibility toward God in these matters is not as great.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>However, God will not be loose concerning any matter that He has shined on and touched in our conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>We must bear responsibility before God for these things.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If we have received mercy from God, we can say, Other people may do this, but I cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Other people may have the peace to do something, but God prohibits us from doing it.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>It does not matter whether it is right or wrong; rather, it is a matter of whether or not our conscience allows us to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Some have asked me if it is right to advertise our gospel meetings as some groups do, using newspaper advertisements to promote a professor or world-famous evangelist.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The question should not be whether this is right, but whether our conscience is at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>We do not criticize others, because they are responsible for their actions before the Lord, just as we are responsible for our actions before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>They may not be condemned in this matter because their conscience has no feeling about it.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>However, if we have a feeling, then we are responsible.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Thus, there is no outward regulation or standard.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>In the desolation of the church, everything depends on whether our conscience is pure before God.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We must do our best to keep this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The conscience is the key.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>While the church is in desolation, we must learn the lesson of the conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Then we will avoid many arguments and criticisms.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We should never place doctrines and teachings before others, telling them what they should or should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>When the church was in extreme desolation, Paul wrote to Timothy, but he did not tell Timothy what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>He did not require Timothy to adhere to regulations and doctrines but asked him to hold a good conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>If we practice this and lead others in this way, then we will learn not to criticize others or to override their conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>If a brother s way of bringing people to salvation causes us to lose peace, we should not criticize him.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>We should allow his conscience to bear the responsibility before God.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>If we speak something to him, it should not be in the way of criticism.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>We should only testify regarding the Lord s care for us.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>If the Lord touches and enlightens his conscience through our testimony, it is enough.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>In the midst of the desolation of the church we should hold a good conscience and should not override the conscience of others.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>We should not speak doctrines to others, nor should we make excuses for ourselves.</S>
