   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jacob probably realized that this man was God, so he would not let Him go unless He blessed him v. 26 . If God had remained only in His divinity, there would have been no possibility for a man to deal with God in this way.</S>
