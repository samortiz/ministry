<h2 class="head1">THE TREE OF THE KNOWLEDGE OF GOOD AND EVIL<br />
SIGNIFYING SATAN JOINED TO MAN</h2>
<p>We cannot deny that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan joining himself to man. The tree of life signifies God being mingled with man, but the tree of the knowledge of good and evil signifies Satan joining himself to man. The tree of life is God mingled with man, and it issues in life. The tree of the knowledge of good and evil is Satan joined to man, and it issues in death. The tree of life is of life and gives man life. Likewise, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is of the knowledge of good and evil, and it gives man good and evil, which issue in death. The result of evil is death, and the result of good is also death. As long as either good or evil has a place in man, Satan has a place in man. The issue of this is death.</p>
<p>The line of the tree of life runs from the beginning to the end of the Bible. The line of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil also runs from Genesis 2 to Revelation 20. This line includes both good and evil. When I began reading the Bible, I thought that Cain&rsquo;s killing of Abel was evil (Gen. 4:8); that is, it was of Satan. Afterward, I read that a descendant of Cain, Lamech, took multiple wives and was arrogant (vv. 19, 23-24). I thought that was also evil, of Satan. However, I did not have the concept that good is also of Satan. Later, the Lord showed us that our relationship with Him is based on life and that our relationship with Satan is based on good and evil. Every time we contact God, He operates in us, and the result is life, not good or evil. In contrast, when Satan operates in us, the result is good or evil. We usually regard only evil as being of Satan, but we do not regard good as being of Satan. We need to see that just as evil behavior is not life, so also good behavior is not life. Any behavior that is not life is of Satan. Anything we do without contacting God or without taking Him as our food is of Satan. Even preaching the gospel without contacting God or taking Him as our food is of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, that is, of Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONLY TWO TREES AND TWO PATHS<br />
BEING IN FRONT OF MAN</h2>
<p>In the book of Job God asked Satan, &ldquo;Have you considered My servant Job? For there is none like him on the earth, a perfect and upright man, who fears God and turns away from evil&rdquo; (1:8). Was God pleased with Job&rsquo;s fearing Him and turning away from evil? This is a profound question. If God had wanted Job to fear Him and to turn away from evil, Job would not have needed to suffer many blows. This shows that Job&rsquo;s fearing God and turning away from evil were not what God wanted.</p>
<p>The Bible is one book, and Job is a part of this one book. At the beginning of the Bible God put man in front of two trees (Gen. 2:8-9). Man is faced with a choice involving only these two trees; there is no third tree. In other words, there are only two paths before man. One path is of life, and the other path is of the knowledge of good and evil. The path of life leads to the eternal life, but the path of the knowledge of good and evil leads to death. This principle is consistent from Genesis to Revelation. Therefore, Job is not an exception in relation to these two paths. By fearing God and turning away from evil, was Job on the path of life or on the path of the knowledge of good and evil? Undoubtedly, he was on the path of the knowledge of good and evil. There is no third path, because there is no third tree. There are only two trees and two paths. Man either partakes of the fruit of the tree of life and thereby takes the path of life, or he partakes of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and thereby takes the path of the knowledge of good and evil. Job&rsquo;s fearing God and turning away from evil were not his partaking of the fruit of the tree of life, nor were they his taking the path of life. Rather, they were his partaking of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and hence taking the path of the knowledge of good and evil.</p>
<p>The fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is of Satan. Hence, for Job to eat of the fruit of this tree was for him to receive something of Satan. Why would God boast in what Job had eaten? Why would Satan ask God to deal with something of himself that Job had eaten? Was God pleased with Job&rsquo;s fearing Him and turning away from evil? Some may be confused by these questions. The human concept is that God boasted in and praised Job for fearing Him and turning away from evil. However, this may not necessarily be the case. If we read Job in the light of the vision in Genesis 2, we will realize that Job&rsquo;s fearing God and turning away from evil did not please God, for they were something injected by Satan. We must realize that God will tear down even the best things that Satan injects into man.</p>
