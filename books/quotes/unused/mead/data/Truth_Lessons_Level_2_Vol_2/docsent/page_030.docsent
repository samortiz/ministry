   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>And this new covenant is the woman.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, these six items the woman, the wife, the new covenant, the grace of the new covenant, the Jerusalem above, and our mother are all matters of the spiritual life that pertain to the union of the Triune God with man to produce the believers for the constituting of the church.</S>

   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus she became a positive, spiritual model.</S>
