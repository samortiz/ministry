   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE DIVINE TRINITY 1 THE ESSENTIAL TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE ECONOMICAL TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus far, the two main aspects we have seen concerning the divine Trinity are the essential Trinity and the economical Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the essential Trinity, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist and coinhere at the same time and in the same way with no succession.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There is no first, second, or third.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>However, in God s plan, in God s administrative arrangement, in God s economy, the Father takes the first step, the Son takes the second step, and the Spirit takes the third step.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Father planned, the Son accomplished, and the Spirit applies what the Son accomplished according to the Father s plan.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is a successive procedure or a succession in God s economy to carry out His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The essential Trinity refers to the essence of the Triune God for His existence; the economical Trinity refers to His plan for His move.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is the need of the existence of the divine Trinity, and there is also the need of the plan of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Modalism</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Modalism teaches that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are not all eternal and do not all exist at the same time, but are merely three temporary consecutive manifestations of the one God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Modalism says that the Father was there and then when the Son came the Father was over.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, when the Spirit came, the Son was over.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Modalists say that the three are one, but their interpretation jeopardizes the existence of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They do not have a clear view concerning the difference between the essence and the economy of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In essence, the three of the Godhead exist equally at the same time and coinhere equally at the same time from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Father s Plan, the Son s Accomplishment,</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>and the Spirit s Application</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In addition, God, the Triune God, has a purpose, so He made a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He made an administrative arrangement to carry out His purpose, so He has an economy.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this economy the three of the Godhead are in succession.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is economical, not essential.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Furthermore, to carry out the plan there is the need of much work.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Father accomplished the first step of the plan, of the economy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He worked in choosing us and in predestinating us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The work of selection and the work of predestination were done by the Father, not by the Son or by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We must be careful, though, to realize that the Father did the selection and the predestination, but He did not do them alone.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Father of the Triune Godhead did the choosing and the predestinating in the Son and with the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we say that the Father chose us and selected us alone, we jeopardize the coinherence and the coexistence of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The coinherence and the coexistence of the Triune God are from eternity to eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After the plan was made, there was the need for the Son to come to carry out the plan.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Son came to be incarnated, to be flesh, to be a man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He came to live a human life for thirty-three and a half years, to die an all-inclusive death, and to resurrect from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Son came to do all the works, but He did not do these works alone.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He did them with the Father and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Son came to do His all-inclusive redemptive work, which includes incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection, with the Father and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If the Son had come by Himself alone, this again would have jeopardized the coexistence and the coinherence, the essence, of the divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After the accomplishment there was the need and there still is the need of application.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this third step of application more fine works are needed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the first step the Father had only to make a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the second step, the Son had to accomplish the plan with much work.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Spirit s application in the third step needs a great deal of continuous work.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We need the Spirit to lead us and to guide us not only day by day but also minute by minute in all the details of our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Spirit needs to be applied in your talk to your wife and even in your attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We can see how fine and how detailed is the work to carry out this application.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Spirit is doing this application work not alone by Himself, but as the Son with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Otherwise, this application would also jeopardize the divine existence of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the work of the Father s plan we can say that the Father did the works in the Son and with the Spirit, but we cannot say that the Son did that work with the Father and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Neither can we say that the Spirit did the works of the plan as the Son, with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Also, in the second step of God s economy, the step of accomplishment, the Son did all the works.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We cannot say the Father did the accomplishing work with the Son and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Neither can we say that the Spirit accomplished the Father s plan as the Son, with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We can only say that the Son did all the works to accomplish the Father s plan with the Father and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Also, we cannot say that the Father became flesh and that the Father lived on this earth in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Furthermore, we cannot say that the Father went to the cross and died for our redemption, and we cannot say the blood shed on the cross is the blood of Jesus the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must say that the blood was shed by Jesus the Son of God 1 John 1:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We can neither say that the Father died on the cross nor can we say that the Father resurrected from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the third step of God s economy, the step of the Spirit, all the works were surely done by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In the third step, however, the Son became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, whatever kind of work is done by the Spirit is the work done by the Son as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the third step, all the works are done by the Spirit as the Son with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We cannot say, though, that all the works in the third step are done by the Father with the Son and through the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need a sober mind to see this.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In the third step all the works are done by the Spirit as the Son with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We can also say that all the works in the third step are done by the Son as the Spirit with the Father because after the second step was accomplished, the Son as the Accomplisher, with the Father, became the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Therefore, the Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God in His economy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Every work that is done by the Spirit is done by the Son as the Spirit with the Father.</S>
