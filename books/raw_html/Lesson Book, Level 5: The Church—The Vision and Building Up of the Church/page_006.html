<h1 class=msg>Lesson Two</h1><h1 class=msg>GOD’S PURPOSE FOR THE CHURCH</h1><h2 class=head2>Scripture Reading</h2><h1 class=scripture>Eph. 1:4-5, 9-11; 3:9-11; 1 Pet. 1:2-4; 2:2; 1 Cor. 3:6; 2 Cor. 3:16-18; 4:16-18; 1 Thes. 5:16-18, John 2:19</h1><h2 class=head2>Outline</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>To express God through the sonship</li><li>To make God’s wisdom known to the enemy</li><li>To head up all things in Christ</li></ol><h2 class=head2>Text</h2><p>[Nearly all of the things revealed about God’s eternal plan for the church are found in the two books of Ephesians and Colossians. The book to the Ephesians is the revelation of the Body, and the book to the Colossians is the revelation of the Head. When put together, these two books reveal a universal man, composed of Christ the Head, and the church the Body!<p>In Ephesians 1:10 and 3:9, the words “dispensation’’ and “fellowship’’ should be translated “economy.’’ They are both the same word in the Greek. The church is something of God’s economy, and this word “economy’’ is very important. It means dispensation, arrangement, stewardship, and administration. God has something to dispense, so He needs an arrangement and an administration in order to carry out this dispensing. The very substance that God is going to dispense is Himself. God is going to dispense Himself into man, so He arranged and administered the church. The church is the central matter in God’s economy. Putting it into human terms, the church is God’s business.<p>We all know that business is the key to any economy. Such a large corporation as General Electric has an economy in order to do business. In other words, business reveals the economy of this large corporation. In a similar way, God Himself is a corporation with an economy, and in this economy God’s divine business is the church.<p>Many Christians do not have such an awareness of the church. Their thought is that the church is a group of fallen people who are saved and who come together to worship God. This is right, but it is a concept far below God’s economy. The heavenly and eternal view of the church is much higher than this. It is the very central matter of God’s economy. In God’s dispensation, in God’s administration, in God’s arrangement, in God’s governmental stewardship, He has eternally planned the church.]
