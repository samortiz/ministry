GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>My concern is that many of you have never gotten into these things and that you do not have any interest or any burden to teach people these things. Instead you may pick up one small item of the recovery and make it a big item. We must realize again that &ldquo;the thing&rdquo; in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is the content of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy&mdash;the Triune God embodied, realized, and consummated and taking the seven steps of incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, breathing Himself into His believers, ascension, and pouring Himself out to dispense Himself entirely into His people as a Body. In the finalization of His New Testament economy in the book of Revelation He is the seven Spirits, out from the eternal One, of the Redeemer, the intensification of the Triune God in the overcoming church, consummating in the golden lampstands and the New Jerusalem. We have to see this and we have to learn how to minister these things.</p>
<p>Justification by faith is not &ldquo;the thing,&rdquo; but it is one item in the Lord&rsquo;s progressive recovery of the basic truths. The matters related to the inner life are wonderful but even the inner life is not &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; Sanctification, the brotherhood, or the presbytery are not &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; Because some lovers of the Lord saw the light concerning the presbytery, they gave up the episcopal system and set up the presbytery to administrate the church. This is why we have elders in the church and not bishops. Even though the truth concerning the presbytery is wonderful, this is not &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; I am for baptism by immersion, but immersion is not &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; Even the church practice is not &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I do not oppose the gifts, including the speaking in tongues. What I am against is the overemphasis of the so-called miraculous gifts. To overemphasize is wrong. This overemphasis can become a cancer in the Body. If the cells in a human body are balanced and dispensed properly, this is altogether healthy. But when the cells are &ldquo;over-emphasized&rdquo; in a certain spot of the body, that spot becomes a cancer and kills the body. The overemphasis of the so-called miraculous gifts becomes a cancer to the Body of Christ. A cancer is not a sickness of any germs. It is not a sickness of wrong things. Cancer is a sickness of &ldquo;right things.&rdquo; John 2:23-24 tells us that the Lord would not trust in the seekers of miracles. To exalt the miraculous gifts to the uttermost and to overemphasize them in the way of Pentecostalism is wrong and is a cancer to the Body which we cannot take.</p>
<p>The second thing that I am against is the falsehood of today&rsquo;s tongue-speaking. Most of today&rsquo;s speaking in tongues is not a genuine dialect. As one who ministers the Word and who speaks for God, I feel burdened about this matter. I have been studying this matter for over fifty years. Most of today&rsquo;s tongue-speaking is humanly manufactured because many people were taught to speak in tongues. I am not opposed to the genuine tongues, but I am against the speaking in tongues that is humanly manufactured. Many of the tongue-speakers reconcile themselves by saying that there is no need to speak a genuine dialect when one speaks in tongues. Acts 2:4 and 8 tell us, however, that the disciples who were Galileans spoke the different foreign dialects of the attendants who came from various parts of the world. This is strong proof that tongue-speaking must be an understandable language, not merely a voice or sound uttered by the tongue.</p>
<p>One writer of a certain Christian publication said that he had contacted two hundred tongue-speakers. After checking with all of them, they all said that they doubted as to whether or not the tongue they were speaking was genuine. There was not one exception to this among these two hundred. The writer of this article, who was a promoter of tongue-speaking, then indicated that you should not doubt but believe that whatever you say is a genuine tongue. Surely the ones who spoke in tongues on the day of Pentecost did not have any doubt that what they were speaking was a genuine dialect, an understandable language. Can we preach, teach, or minister something false? Surely we cannot!</p>
<p>Although I do not agree with the falsity of many of the miraculous things in the Pentecostal movement, we must be clear that the Lord&rsquo;s recovery is all-inclusive. It includes tongue-speaking. Do not make an issue of it. If you say we would not take tongue-speaking, this is wrong. If you do this, you make an issue of tongue-speaking and you are sectarian. Neither should the brothers who are for tongue-speaking make an issue of it. Even the proper, most genuine tongue-speaking is just one little item in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It is not &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; If you make any one item such as the presbytery so big and overemphasize it, I am against this. But I am not against the presbytery.</p>
<p>The saints in one certain locality did not practice taking the Lord&rsquo;s table. However, we did not reject them because they would not take the Lord&rsquo;s table in our way. We still loved them and recognized them as a local church. Even the way of the Lord&rsquo;s table according to the Bible was a small discovery. But we should not uplift the Lord&rsquo;s table as &ldquo;the thing.&rdquo; In spite of our way of having the Lord&rsquo;s table, this certain locality still recognized us as local churches and we recognized them as a local church. Recently, this particular locality began to practice the Lord&rsquo;s table according to what the Bible reveals. We rejoice in this, but we would never make this practice an issue. If you exclude those who speak in tongues or if you make an issue of speaking in tongues, you are sectarian. For some saints or even some churches to speak in tongues is not sinful. Even if what they speak is not the genuine tongue, it should be only considered as wrong, but not sinful. Whether you speak in tongues or whether you do not speak in tongues, you should not make an issue. Romans 14 teaches us that we should receive one another according to God&rsquo;s receiving and not according to doctrinal concepts. Whatever we do we should do it unto the Lord. We have to receive each other and we have to respect and regard each other. What I am against is the overemphasis of minor points and the neglecting of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy.</p>
<p>Throughout church history, many missionaries were sent out by the Lord and some of them did much wonderful work. These particular missionaries preached the gospel and taught the Bible. One of them, Hudson Taylor, the founder of the China Inland Mission, was not related to the Pentecostal movement, but he did a marvelous work in China to bring the gospel and the Lord&rsquo;s name there. Some among the Pentecostals say that if you do not speak in tongues, you have never been baptized in the Holy Ghost. I do not believe this according to the pure word of the Bible and according to my experience. Although Hudson Taylor and many others were quite powerful in the Lord&rsquo;s work, they never spoke in tongues. I also am not an advocate of the so-called baptism in the Holy Spirit according to the Pentecostal understanding, but in the past sixty years, by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, the Lord has raised up approximately six hundred churches through the ministry the Lord has committed me with. This is why I am strong against any overemphasis of minor doctrines and practices. Cells are good and necessary. Our body needs the cells, but if a certain cell becomes exalted and enlarged it becomes a cancer. We should not have any exaltation of small items in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The only exaltation should be given to the New Testament economy of God. We can never overly exalt or overemphasize God&rsquo;s New Testament economy because His economy is all-inclusive. I do have a heart for all the saints, so I must be frank and faithful to them. I do not like to see any of you led astray. As one who ministers the Lord&rsquo;s Word in His recovery, I have to take care of the saints and bear the burden for them. This is why I want you to &ldquo;regulate your driving.&rdquo; If you &ldquo;go across the white line&rdquo; you will either kill yourself or kill others. You need the vision to control you and restrain you.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STUDYING, SPEAKING, AND TEACHING THE THINGS<br />
CONCERNING GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>I would encourage all the saints, especially the young ones among us, to spend time to get into the contents of the vision of the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, which is the New Testament economy of God. You need to get into how the Triune God is embodied, realized, consummated, intensified, and finalized. You need to study all the seven major steps of the divine move: incarnation, human living, death, resurrection, breathing, ascension, and pouring out. You need to study the intensification of the Triune God in the book of Revelation finalizing His New Testament economy by bringing the degraded church back to the enjoyment of Himself. You need to get all these things into your being thoroughly. Then you need to labor on them to help all the saints. This is my burden. From now on I hope that in all the church meetings nothing is talked about but the content of the New Testament economy of God. The leading ones need to teach God&rsquo;s economy to all the members in their locality. Even the young ones among us can speak these things concerning God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Then the Lord will have a way to really carry out His all-inclusive recovery for the building up of His church. If you merely stay in one of the items you have experienced even in a genuine way, you miss the mark. You should not stay with any item. You should only stay with this central thing, &ldquo;the thing&rdquo;&mdash;the content of the New Testament economy of God. I hope this is clear to all of us.</p>
<p>Before the Lord, I can say honestly that I love each one of you brothers. You do not know how much I pray for you when I am concerned for you. I have no intention of condemning or offending any one of you. I really love all of you because you have left so many things for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and you have even designated yourself for the Lord&rsquo;s move in this country. Although I treasure this, I cannot be silent when I see the things you are getting involved in leading you astray from God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. I must sound the trumpet. You have to take care of the &ldquo;white line&rdquo; while you are driving. Without the vision we may run wild. We may unconsciously cast off the restraints. Thank the Lord, though, that His Word is with us. If there were no Bible, no holy Word, on this earth, where would we be? We have to come back to His holy Word. The controlling, restraining vision is conveyed to us through the holy Word.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> </body></html>
