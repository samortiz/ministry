AND USE IT FOR THEIR SHARINGS IN THE MEETING</h2>
<p>We should also help the new ones to read the Bible daily and use it for their sharings in the meetings. There are two ways for us to help the new ones read the Bible. We may teach them in a formal way, but this is a killing way. Instead we should teach them in a spontaneous way in our talk, our fellowship, with them. If we help them in a spontaneous and informal way, they will begin to read the Bible daily. When we see them after a couple of days, we can informally check with them to see if they are reading the Bible. By talking to them, we can find out whether they have read the Bible or not. In the home meetings we should not do anything formal or legal.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HELPING THE NEW ONES<br />
TO CALL, SPEAK, OR SING A HYMN</h2>
<p>We should help the new ones to call, speak, or sing a hymn without any formality. We should set the example by calling a hymn first, but we should do it in a wise, proper, and living way. Otherwise, our calling can offend people. We should set up a proper pattern for them, and then lead them into this practice.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HELPING THE NEW ONES TO PRAY,<br />
NOT ONLY IN THE MEETINGS<br />
BUT ALSO IN THEIR DAILY LIFE</h2>
<p>You need to help the new ones to pray, not only in the meetings but also in their daily life. Again, you have to carry out this kind of teaching in a spontaneous way. Do not exercise yourself as a teacher who is teaching them something crucial. That is wrong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HELPING THE NEW ONES<br />
TO FOLLOW THE LORD&rsquo;S ANOINTING WITHIN THEM<br />
 AND THE FLOW OF THE MEETING</h2>
<p>We also have to help the new ones to follow the Lord&rsquo;s anointing within them and the flow of the meeting. This is something deeper. We still can impart this truth by conversing with them in a spontaneous way. We can tell them that we Christians all have the Lord within us and that the Lord is the anointing. If they do not understand the word <em>anointing,</em> we can tell them that this is the same as <em>oiling.</em> If a piece of machinery is too dry, we oil it. We can tell them that the Lord is within us, and He is always oiling us to make us run so smoothly. We may even check with them, &ldquo;Before you called on the name of the Lord, did you ever have this inward feeling?&rdquo; When they say &ldquo;no,&rdquo; then we can say, &ldquo;How about today?&rdquo; They may say that they do have a good feeling within them now, and they may also tell you that they feel at times that something within is rebuking them. They may say, &ldquo;I have the feeling that a living person is in me.&rdquo; We can tell them that this is very good and that they now have the real experience of a Christian, but we should not teach them too much.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HELPING EVEN THE CHILDREN<br />
TO CALL, SPEAK, OR SING A HYMN AND<br />
TO QUOTE OR SPEAK THE WORD OF THE BIBLE</h2>
<p>In the home meetings, we need to help even the children to call, speak, or sing a hymn and to quote or speak the word of the Bible. Suppose that you have baptized a couple, and they have a nine-year-old boy and a three-year-old girl. If you go to help them have a home meeting, you must train even the three-year-old girl. You can tell her that it is easy for her to call a hymn in the meeting and that it is even easier to sing a hymn. You may say, &ldquo;You know when you are going to have a home meeting and that some brothers will come to help you. Before we come, you can sing a hymn.&rdquo; If you tell the little girl this, she may be singing when you enter the home. Take her song as the start of the meeting. All the little ones like to sing. You may not need to help the little girl sing a whole verse or stanza of a song. If you can help her to sing one line, she may be happy. The little ones can be a very good help to the home meetings. You also can help them to pray. They can pray a simple prayer such as, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, You are so good. I love You and I know that You are with me.&rdquo; You can instruct the nine-year-old boy to speak some verses, to read some portion of the Word. In this way all the members of the family participate in the meeting. If we do this week after week with this family, they will accumulate many divine riches.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_036.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_038.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Speaking Christ for the Building Up of the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 37</div><br></body></html>
