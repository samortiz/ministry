   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. THE THREE THE FATHER, THE SON,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND THE SPIRIT BEING ONE A. The Son Being the Father</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Isaiah 9:6 says, Unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...The mighty God, The everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In this verse, the mighty God matches the child, and the everlasting Father matches the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yes, He is a child, yet He is the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The child who was born in the manger of Bethlehem was the mighty God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Just as the child and the mighty God are one, so also the Son and the everlasting Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Son is the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is indeed difficult to fully explain this matter, yet the Scriptures have said so.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Unto us a son is given and his name shall be called everlasting Father.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Does this not plainly say that the Son is the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the Son is not the Father, how could the Son be called the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we acknowledge that the child of which this verse speaks is the mighty God, then we must also acknowledge that the Son of which this verse speaks is also the everlasting Father; otherwise, we are not believing the clearly stated revelation of the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But we do deeply believe that according to the words here, the Lord Jesus who became the child is the mighty God; and the Lord Jesus who is the Son is also the eternal Father.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our Lord is the Son, and He is also the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 14:7-11 says, If you had known Me, you would have known My Father also; and henceforth you know Him and have seen Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Philip said to Him, Lord, show us the Father and it suffices us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Jesus said to him, Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He who has seen Me has seen the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>How is it that you say, Show us the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Believe Me that I am in the Father and the Father in Me. In these verses the Lord clearly reveals to us the mystery that He and the Father are one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He is in the Father and the Father is in Him; when He speaks, it is the Father who works; when men see Him, they see the Father; when they know Him, they know the Father, because He is the Father; He and the Father are one John 10:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>B. The Son the Last Adam</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Becoming the Life-giving Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>First Corinthians 15:45 states, The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The last Adam, of course, is the incarnated Lord Jesus, and the life-giving Spirit, of course, is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There can never be another life-giving Spirit besides the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, this verse also tells us clearly that the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord was made flesh and became the last Adam, and later, after death and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The words spoken by the Lord in John 14:16-20 also confirm this point.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Here the Lord tells us that He will pass through death and resurrection to become another Comforter, that is, the Spirit of reality, who will come to abide with us and dwell in us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In verse 17, the Lord says that the Spirit of reality abides with you and shall be in you.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then in verse 18 He says, I will not leave you orphans; I am coming to you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Over thirty years ago in Shanghai, when Brother Watchman Nee was explaining this passage to us, he pointed out emphatically that He the Spirit of reality, or the Holy Spirit in verse 17 is I the Lord in verse 18.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Lord said in effect, When He comes I come.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He is I; I am He.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Holy Spirit is the Lord Jesus, and the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Also, in verse 17 the Lord says, The Spirit of reality...shall be in you, and then in verse 20 He says, I in you.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This also proves that the Holy Spirit who is in us is the Lord who died and rose and now lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>C. The Lord the Son Being the Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, And the Lord is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord spoken of here, of course, is the Lord Jesus, and the Spirit, of course, is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Does this not clearly and definitely tell us that the Lord Jesus is the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our Lord is the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He is the Father, and He is also the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is everything!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE REASON FOR GOD BEING TRIUNE</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Second Corinthians 13:14 says, The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit be with you all.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Here three things are mentioned: grace, love, and fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This sets forth the reason why God is triune: it is thus that He can dispense Himself into us, work Himself into us for us to enjoy, and be our all.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The love of God, that is, the love of the Father, is the source.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The grace of Christ, that is, the grace of the Son, is the flowing out of the love of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>And the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the flowing into us of the grace of the Son, together with the love of the Father, for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This can be confirmed by our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The fellowship of the Holy Spirit within us is the transmitting of the grace of the Son into us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>And the grace of the Son within us is simply the practical tasting and enjoying of the love of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The love of the Father is the source, the grace of the Son is the expression, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit is the transmission, transmitting the grace of the Son, with the love of the Father, into us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The result is that everything that is of the Three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit becomes the enjoyment within us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You have the fellowship of the Holy Spirit within you, and the more you live in this fellowship, the more you will have of the grace of Christ; then, the more you have of the grace of Christ, the more you will enjoy the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The fellowship of the Holy Spirit brings the grace of Christ, and in the grace of Christ there is the love of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, the love of the Father, the grace of the Son, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit are not three different things, but three aspects of one thing for us to possess and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Likewise, the Father, Son, and Spirit are not three Gods but one God with the aspect of three for us to possess and enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>God is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The one, unique God has the aspect of three the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are all God and are eternal, coexistent, coinherent, and inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To the believers, the Father is the source, the Son is the manifestation, and the Spirit is God reaching and entering into them.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Thus, the Triune God is dispensed into their being to be their life, enjoyment, and complete supply.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>QUESTIONS Give three verses to prove that God is only one.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Enumerate the Bible passages to explain the matter of God having the aspect of three the Father, Son, and Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Cite one verse each to prove that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit all are God.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit all are eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Substantiate this by citing Bible verses.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Give two verses to prove that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit coexist simultaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Use John 14:26 and 15:26 to prove that the Father, Son, and Spirit cannot be separated.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Which verse says that the Son is the Father?</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Which verse says that the Son is the Spirit?</S>
