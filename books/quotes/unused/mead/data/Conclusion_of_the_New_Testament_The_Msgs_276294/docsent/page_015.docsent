   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In John 7 we have Christ as the Feast of Tabernacles and as the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>a. The Feast of Tabernacles</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Verse 2 says, Now the Jews Feast of Tabernacles was near.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The Feast of the Passover is the first of the Jewish annual feasts, and the Feast of Tabernacles is the last Lev 23:5, 34 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Feast of the Passover, being the first feast of the year, implies the beginning of man s life cf.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Exo 12:2-3, 6 , which involves man s seeking for satisfaction and results in man s hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Feast of Tabernacles, being the last feast of the year, implies the completion and success of man s life cf.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>23:16 , which will end and will result in man s thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the scene of the Feast of the Passover in John 6, the Lord Jesus presented Himself as the bread of life, which satisfies man s hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the scene of the Feast of Tabernacles in John 7, the Lord Jesus promised that He would flow forth the living water, which quenches man s thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God ordained the Feast of Tabernacles so that the children of Israel would remember how their fathers, while wandering in the wilderness, had lived in tents Lev 23:39-43 , expecting to enter into the rest of the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Hence, this feast is a reminder that today people are still in the wilderness and need to enter into the rest of the New Jerusalem, which is the eternal tabernacle Rev 21:2-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob also lived in tents and looked forward to this eternal tabernacle Heb 11:9-10 , in which there will be a river of water of life proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb to quench man s thirst Rev 22:1, 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>At the end of such a feast, which had such a background, Christ cried out the promise of the rivers of living water, which will satisfy man s expectation for eternity John 7:37-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1 The Reaping of the Harvest</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>of the Good Land Given by God</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the full harvest of their crops, the Jewish people observed the Feast of Tabernacles to worship God and enjoy what they had reaped Deut 16:13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Feast of Tabernacles, therefore, was held at the time of the reaping of the harvest of the good land given by God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>For us today, the reality of this good land is the Spirit Gal 3:14; Phil 1:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The physical aspect of the blessing that God promised to Abraham was the good land Gen 12:7; 13:15; 17:8; 26:3-4 , which was a type of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Since Christ is eventually realized as the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45; 2 Cor 3:17 , the blessing of the promised Spirit corresponds to the blessing of the land promised to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, the Spirit as the realization of Christ in our experience is the good land as the source of God s bountiful supply for us to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>2 For God s People to Enjoy and Be Satisfied before God</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Feast of Tabernacles was a feast for God s people to enjoy and be satisfied before God Lev 23:40b; Rom 14:17b .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As the last feast of all the feasts ordained by God for His people Lev 23:34, 39-43 , the Feast of Tabernacles is for their enjoyment of the rich produce of the good land at its harvest time for their satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Christ as the reality of the Feast of Tabernacles is such a feast for our experience and enjoyment today.</S>
