   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SUBMITTING TO THE AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE BODY OF CHRIST Submission Bringing In Benefits</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first thing we have to see concerning coordination is God's arrangement in the church see 1 Cor 12 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1 Corinthians 12, coordination is a Body matter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If you hit me with your hands, you are offending my head.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For anyone to offend the Body of the Lord is to offend the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We have to realize that those brothers and sisters ahead of us have their authority.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We should know and realize this authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we know this, we will see that nothing is more serious than offending God's authorities on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>A brother who causes such an offense can never serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>One member cannot become angry with another member or be separated from another member.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If one member is separated from the other members, and if he refuses to receive the supply from others, he will become isolated.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some older brothers and sisters are ahead of us; they have much more knowledge concerning the Lord than we do.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The other members should therefore receive their supply from these ones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But many people feel that to submit to them is very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, you have to realize that they are a help to you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They render you the supply and enable you to fulfill your ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The arm receives blood for the hand.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The members ahead of us receive supply for the benefit of the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The work may be done by the hand, but the supply comes from the arm.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Body is not merely an illustration, but a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If the arm is gone, the hand cannot work even if it has the capacity to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The arms should not try to be the hands, and the hands should not try to be the arms.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Here we see the Body in its many different levels, with each member having its own work that it ought to do.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is not an organization.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, this is something organic.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Submission Being</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>without Any Choice of Your Own</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If I hit you or kick you, who is it that is hitting or kicking you?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Is it my members that are doing it, or am I the one who is doing it?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>For my members to do it is for my whole body to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Consider the action of sweeping the floor; it is not the work of one member, but the work of the whole body.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The blood in my whole body supplies the member that is doing the work.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The body is organic.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the hands, the feet, or the face is in motion, the blood in the whole body directs its supply to these working members.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>There is the need on the one hand to submit to authority, and on the other hand for others to submit to you.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It is difficult to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is more difficult to have others submit to you.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You must first be dealt with yourself, and you must first learn to listen to others, before others will listen to you and submit to you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who are rebellious cannot expect others to listen to them.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>I know one sister who has changed maids twelve times.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Every time she changed maids, it was because she could not tolerate the maid.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What this sister has done was a proof that she has never learned the lesson of listening to others.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am afraid that when such people come to serve in the church, they will cause problems.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is like your mother asking you to buy her some sugar and ginger, and you keep the sugar, while giving her only the ginger.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the way many people obey God; their obedience is a selective obedience.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If I receive the order to buy ginger, I only need to obey and to buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Obedience and Listening to Others</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Bringing In Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Let me ask you: if it is not enough that we listen only to the Lord's word, how then should we listen to man's word?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Whose word should we listen to?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Perhaps you will say that we should listen to those whom we trust and love.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But this is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not be selective in our listening.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If there is a group of people here who are willing to listen, this place will experience a big change; Swatow will see thousands of people saved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the window is open, the sunshine will come in. There may be clouds today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But tomorrow or the day after, blessing will come.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Here the older ones listen to the younger ones, and the younger ones listen to the older ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>To listen to others means to be related together in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we talk about mutuality day after day, yet never listen to others, the coordination of the Body will be but an empty term.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We may not be fighting with one another, but neither are we coordinated together.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Men on the streets do not fight with each other day after day, yet there is absolutely no coordination or relatedness among them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The book of Acts shows us that there is no such thing as serving the Lord alone.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Service is something in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In Acts Paul charged Timothy to come and go; he did not leave any ground for Timothy to pray or to seek for God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many people are very capable in the church, yet this is not necessarily a good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In the coordination of the Body, we need to work by listening to others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If you want to open the window, you have to check first with the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you want to close the window, you also have to check with the responsible brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>A good work is one that is done through fellowship and in coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the church in Shanghai, we have an elders' meeting once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Everything is decided by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I admit that during the past year, many things were first proposed by me.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>But when it comes to making a decision in one accord, I also put myself as one among those who are under orders.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is how we handle everything, including affairs such as the service office record-keeping, and the receiving of saints for fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Here we see no dictatorship or usurpation of authority.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>All the brothers and sisters can put forth their views and suggestions, and all can go on in the Body.</S>
