   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>OUR GOAL IN PRACTICING THE BIBLICAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Keep in mind that in practicing the biblical way our goal is to arrive at one of the major items in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>What we are dealing with now may be the last item, the concluding item, of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It seems that we are now very close to the end of this age, the conclusion of the ages, which will bring the Lord back.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, we should not say that this new way will definitely bring the Lord back.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The New Testament teaches us that no one can know the day and the hour of the Lord s return Matt 24:36 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the past century, certain ones prophesied concerning the time at which the Lord Jesus would come back.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some went out with white robes to wait for His return, but nothing happened.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We should not make the same mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, according to our knowledge of the Bible, it seems that this new way may be the last and concluding recovery of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This new way is crucial, it is important, and it is just in time to meet our present need.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I feel that I have come to a point that without such a change I just cannot go on in my ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This compels me very much.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Furthermore, the ministry is altogether related to our living.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If I would not know how to minister, it would be hard for me to know how to live.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Our living must have a purpose; it must be for the purpose of the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If I would not be here for this change, I would not know how to minister and what the purpose of my living should be.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I would be lost.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is why I am endeavoring and am so desperate.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the years since October of 1984, many have seen the same thing I have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, we all must endeavor to carry this out with much patience, gradually yet positively.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To practice the biblical way is not merely to change a way.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is to fulfill the Lord s heart s desire according to His word concerning the building up of His Body Matt 16:18; Eph 4:12-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is not merely to fulfill some of the prophesies in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is to accomplish the unique, central thing in the entire universe the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have not yet seen the accomplishment of such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Where has this building been in the past, and where is it today?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the whole universe there is not yet such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The building up of the Body of Christ has not yet been completed.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With many Christians this building has hardly begun.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps even among us over the last sixty years, this building has barely begun.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a great and crucial matter prophesied by the Lord and the Apostle Paul in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is crucial; it must be fulfilled and completed, and we are here for this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE LORD S DAY MORNING MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The saints and the elders in all the churches must consider what we should do with the Lord s Day morning meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To have one speaker designated to speak to a great audience is traditional and should be condemned.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Whether a particular meeting should be accepted or renounced does not depend on the day or time at which it occurs but on the nature and reality of that meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Today most nations on the earth consider the Lord s Day to be a holiday.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We call this day the Lord s Day, whereas the nations call it Sunday.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sunday is a name according to pagan religion, meaning the day of the sun.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a superstitious title, and, strictly speaking, we should not use it.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Around the world, regardless of their religion, most countries have this day as a holiday.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is a convenient time for people to do many things.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In a good sense, if we do not utilize this day, we will miss something.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore it is better to hold an important meeting on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we set up an important meeting on a weekday, most people will be busy at work.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They may not even be free to come to the meetings in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord s Day is the best time for a large number of the saints to be gathered together.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We may not need to change the day or the time of our present meetings, but we surely need to change the nature of the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>By doing so we will take advantage of this day.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To set up a meeting on this day will be convenient, not only to the Christian believers but also to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It will accommodate their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, this does not mean that we still should keep the Lord s Day morning service in the traditional way.</S>
