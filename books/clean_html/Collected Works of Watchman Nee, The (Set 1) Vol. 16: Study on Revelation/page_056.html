<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Revelation 16:13-14</H2><P>"And I saw, out of the mouth of the dragon and out of the mouth of the beast and out of the mouth of the false prophet, three unclean spirits as frogs; for they are spirits of demons doing signs, which go forth to the kings of the whole inhabited earth to gather them to the war of the great day of God the Almighty." </P><P>"Unclean spirits" are in opposition to the Holy Spirit. "Frogs" denote something nonsensical. The goal of these kings is just to go to war for the sake of war. They go to war because of the devil's instigation. Eventually, the Lord will come down to destroy them.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Revelation 16:15</H2><P>"(Behold, I come as a thief. Blessed is he who watches and keeps his garments that he may not walk naked and they see his shame.)" </P><P>There is still something to say to the Christians. The garment here is not the garment on the physical body. "I come as a thief" is a word from the Lord to the church. The word here may be to those who are about to be reaped in Revelation 14:14-16. It may also be for those Christians who are left behind. The reaping of the grapes in 14:17-20 is the war of Armageddon in 16:16. Revelation 16:15 is before the war of Armageddon, pointing to the Christians at the time of harvest, but it can also be considered as being spoken after 14:14-16 and before 16:16, in which case it refers to those Christians who are left behind.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>G. The Seventh Bowl<br>(Revelation 16:17-21)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Revelation 16:17</H2><P>"And the seventh poured out his bowl upon the air; and a loud voice came out of the temple from the throne, saying, It is done."</P><P>"It is done" can also be translated "It is sufficient." "The air" is the sphere in which Satan exercises his authority. It may be that up until this point Satan still has some authority in the air. Therefore, God still needs to give him one last punishment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Revelation 16:18</H2><P>"And there were lightnings and voices and thunders; and there was a great earthquake, such as had not been since man appeared on the earth, such an earthquake, so great."</P><P>Concerning the great earthquake see Ezekiel 38:20.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Revelation 16:19</H2><P>"And the great city was divided into three parts, and the cities of the nations fell. And Babylon the Great was remembered before God to give her the cup of the wine of the fury of His wrath." </P><P>"The great city" refers to the city of Jerusalem. "Nations" means Gentiles in the original language. "Babylon" here refers to the material Babylon. (In 14:8 "Babylon" refers to the Babylon which was fallen before the Battle of Armageddon. It corresponds to the Babylon in chapter seventeen. The one in chapter sixteen refers to the material Babylon, which is after the Battle of Armageddon. This corresponds to the last half of chapter eighteen.) Sketches of these two Babylons are recorded in 14:8 and 16:19; the details are given in chapters seventeen and eighteen.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>4. Revelation 16:20</H2><P>"And every island fled, and the mountains were not found."</P><P>This time the earthquake is severe. However, according to the Psalms, the sea, the islands, and the mountains will all be here in the millennium (Psa. 72:3, 10; 97:1).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>5. Revelation 16:21</H2><P>"And great hail, every stone about the weight of a talent, came down out of heaven upon men; and men blasphemed God for the plague of the hail, because the plague of it is exceedingly great."</P><P>One Greek talent equals fifty-six English pounds. One Jewish talent equals one hundred fourteen English pounds. In addition to the hail striking down from above, the earth is shaken out of place.</P>
