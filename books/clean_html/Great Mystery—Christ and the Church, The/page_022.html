<h1 class="title">THE SPIRIT WITH OUR SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 6:11-18</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, we worship You from the depths of our being. We worship You as God, as the Lord, as the Spirit, and as the Word. We worship You because You are the mystery, and You have made us Your mystery. We worship You because You have opened up Your mystery to us, setting us apart from all men. We worship You because You have equipped and filled us with Yourself to make us Your testimony. We worship You because You have the church on the earth, and we are Your church. Lord, we worship You; there are thousands of hearts here, each of which loves You and turns to You. We worship You because You desire to gain and fill us. We offer thanks to You from the depths of our being. May You speak the words on Your heart; speak the words that bind and destroy the enemy. Speak to us again. In such a speaking You are one spirit with us. We praise You as the Spirit and as the Word. Your word is the Spirit, and Your Spirit is the word. We tell You again that we love You. We thank You. We worship You. Amen.</p>
<p>The first five chapters of Ephesians speak extensively of the church being the mystery of Christ, of the building up of the church, and of the church being the Body of Christ, the new man, and the counterpart of Christ. Although Paul knew Christ as the mystery of God and the church as the mystery of Christ, he also knew that our old man and our living in the old man, the self, and our natural constitution are against the church. Therefore, in chapters 4 and 5 he speaks of these things in order to deal with them and to show how to put off the old man and put on the new man.</p>
<p>Chapter 3 speaks of the unsearchable riches of Christ becoming our content and of Christ making His home in our hearts so that we may be filled unto all the fullness of God. Chapter 4 speaks of putting off the old man and putting on the new man by being renewed in the spirit of our mind. Chapter 5 speaks of Christ giving Himself up on the cross in order to release His life, which is embodied in the word of God. In the word of God there is the water of life, which is the life of Christ containing all the riches of Christ. When we contact the word of God in our spirit, we are washed by the water in the word and nourished and cherished by the rich supply in the word. By enjoying this water of life, we become His counterpart.</p>
<p>However, Paul does not forget that the Lord has an enemy, the devil. Therefore, in chapter 6 Paul speaks of this enemy, including the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies. On the one hand, they operate in man&rsquo;s heart to corrupt man and resist man, thus nullifying the Body of Christ; on the other hand, they try to frustrate the will of God from being carried out. Consequently, in chapter 6 Paul tells us how to deal with the power of darkness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT BEING THE WORD</h2>
<p>Ephesians 6:17 says, &ldquo;Receive the helmet of salvation and the sword of the Spirit, which Spirit is the word of God.&rdquo; In the Gospels the Lord Jesus said that His words are spirit (John 6:63). In Ephesians 6:17 Paul says that the Spirit is the word of God. Hence, the word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the word. Many Christians know that the Bible is the word of God, but very few Christians know how to receive the word of God. We must understand that the word of God is not merely letters but the Spirit. We cannot separate the word of God from the Spirit of God. The word of God is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the word of God. In other words, the word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the word. When the word enters into us, it becomes the Spirit; when the Spirit comes out of us, He is the word. The word in the Bible is the word; the word entering into our spirit is the Spirit. These two are one.</p>
<p>We should never forget two verses in the New Testament: John 6:63&mdash;&ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit&rdquo;&mdash;and Ephesians 6:17&mdash;&ldquo;Which Spirit is the word of God.&rdquo; The Spirit is within and the word is without. The word entering into our spirit is the Spirit, and the Spirit coming out of our spirit is the word.</p>
<p>All the riches of Christ are in the word, and this word is the Spirit, which can only be contacted by the human spirit. Ephesians 6:18 says, &ldquo;Praying at every time in spirit.&rdquo; Therefore, verses 17 and 18 show us several key items: the Spirit, our human spirit, and prayer. The Spirit is the word, and the word is the Spirit. In order to contact the word and the Spirit, we need to pray at every time in our human spirit, not in our mind or emotion.</p>
