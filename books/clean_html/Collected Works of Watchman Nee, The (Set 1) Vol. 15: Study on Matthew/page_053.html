<P>"Gathering from every species" refers to all the Gentiles (see Ezek. 47:10). "Species" here means "race" (see Mark 7:26). That the net "was filled" means that the gospel has been preached enough and the time also is sufficient. "Brought onto the shore" means that they were gathered by the word of God, and everyone was forced to leave his own place. "Sat down" means having authority (it does not imply rest, since there cannot be rest while fishing and selecting—1 Kings 1:13, 20; Matt. 5:1; 20:21) and executing judgment (Exo. 18:13; Judg. 5:10; John 19:13), the good ones being kept in the vessels and the foul ones being cast out (according to the distinction in Lev. 11:9-13). Here we see a separation of categories; this is different from the bundling of the wheat and the tares. "Furnace of fire." See Ezekiel 22:18-22 (cf. Isa. 31:5-6, 8-9; Mal. 3:18; 4:1; Isa. 30:33; 66:20, 23-24). The net was cast from the land, and it returned to the land (the earth signifying the Jews). The seashore signifies the area between the Jews and the Gentiles.</P><P>The good fish here are the "sheep," and the foul fish are the "goats," as mentioned in Matthew 25:31-36. The Gentiles who fear and glorify God, do good, and take care of the godly Jews and Christians will be the citizens in the millennium. The citizens in the millennium include the godly Jews and Gentiles. The righteous and the evil here are the righteous and the evil there.</P><P>Verse 51:"Have you understood all these things? They said to Him, Yes." (Matthew 1—13:51 constitutes the first major section, and 13:52 through chapter fourteen constitute the second major section.) The Lord asked this question because in speaking the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens, He specifically desired that the disciples understand and that the blasphemers not understand at all (see Matt. 13:11-16). Therefore, the question asked here is a conclusion of verses 11-16.</P><P>Verse 52:The "scribe" refers to those who are familiar with the Old Testament. From this we know that the kingdom of the heavens is surely not the kingdom of the Messiah; otherwise, the scribes would have participated in it. "Every scribe discipled" means that the scribes were taught concerning the mysteries of the kingdom of the heavens. (The kingdom of the heavens here refers to the church on the earth today.) The "householder" is the scribe. A house has a boundary, not in the open air but in the inner chamber (see S.S. 1:4). "Old" refers to the Old Testament, and "new," to the New Testament. There is authority in the house to bring forth new and old things, that is, the New Testament and the Old Testament. A "treasure" denotes a storehouse. What we speak should also be brought forth out of the treasure.</P><P>The main subject of the second major section (13:52—14:36) is the four things that the Lord accomplished after His rejection. Yet these things are still spoken in a hidden way. Within the second major section, we can further divide it into four smaller sections.</P><P>The first subsection of the second major section focuses on the rejection of the Lord by two kinds of people—the common people (the men of Nazareth) and the rulers (Herod).</P><P>Verses 53-54:The people of Nazareth acknowledged that the Lord's speaking was with wisdom and was accompanied by works of power, and they greatly admired Him. However, they were wrong when they asked, "Where did this man get ...?" If they acknowledged that the Lord had wisdom and did works of power, then they should have known that He came from God and should not have asked "Where did this man get...?"</P><P>Verse 55:"Is not this the carpenter's son? Is not His mother called Mary, and His brothers James and Joseph and Simon and Judas?" Because of their doubting in the preceding verse, they were led by the evil one into more erroneous thoughts. Because of the turn in this verse, such people became hopeless.</P><P>Verse 56:"And His sisters, are they not all with us? Where then did this man get all these things?" The names of the sisters are not revealed. Some confess the Lord in the flesh; they know the Lord's parents, brothers, and sisters. Hence, they reject Him. Human beings like people or things that are mysterious; they think that someone who is powerful must also be mysterious. If someone is known by everyone, then he becomes common, having nothing extraordinary. This was the situation with the people of Nazareth. They thought that Christ must be mysterious and different from them. "But we know where this man is from; yet when the Christ comes, no one knows where He is from" (John 7:27).</P><P>Verse 57:"And they were stumbled because of Him. But Jesus said to them, A prophet is not without honor except in his own country and in his own house." The Lord was rejected by the Jews not only because He was too familiar to them, but also because He was not in a territory where prophets would be honored.</P><P>Verse 58:"And He did not do many works of power there because of their unbelief." This is an unfortunate word. Many people hindered the power of God because of their unbelief. God's works of wonders are limited only by our faith. God delights to perform works of power in us; unfortunately, our faith is insufficient. Our faith is like a water bucket, whereas God's power is like water in the well. Without the bucket, we can have no water. Today our faith is like a wicker basket that leaks out the power of God.</P>
