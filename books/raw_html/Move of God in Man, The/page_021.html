<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Divinity Unveiled in Humanity</H2><P>It is wrong to say that humanity was unveiled in divinity. Rather, divinity was unveiled in humanity. If your Christian life is an unveiling of your humanity, that is wrong. If this is the case, you get the glory and the exaltation. You are the one manifested. The Christian life is a life of divinity unveiled in humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Divine Attributes Shown<br>in the Human Virtues</H2><P>In Christ's human living, the divine attributes were shown in the human virtues. When He loved people, that was a display of His human virtue, yet within that human virtue was the divine attribute as the reality. We can illustrate this by considering a glove and the hand within it. The glove may be likened to the human virtues, and the hand to the divine attributes. The real contents of the glove is the hand, just as the real contents of the human virtues of Christ are the divine attributes. God has many attributes. One attribute is love, another attribute is light, and another attribute is kindness. All these are His attributes, and they were lived out of the man Jesus as His virtues. All of God's attributes became the virtues of the man Jesus.</P><P>The Gospels show us the man Jesus loving people, but actually this was God's love expressed in Christ's love. The inward reality is the divine attribute and the outward appearance is the human virtue. First Peter 2:9 speaks of the virtues of our Lord, not His attributes. In His nature are the attributes, but in expression the attributes become the virtues. The attributes are of God, and the virtues are of the man Jesus.</P><P>The virtues of the man Jesus are filled, mingled, and saturated with the attributes of God. We should not love anyone without the inward attribute of God's love. Otherwise our love for people is an empty love. It is a virtue in appearance but there is no reality within it as an attribute.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Divine Life Mingled with the Human Life<br>to Have One Living without a Third Entity</H2><P>In Christ's human living, the divine life was mingled with the human life to have one kind of living without a third entity. Christ's virtues were a mingling of divinity with humanity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In Mercy, Love, and Grace,<br>and Not in the Condemnation of the Law</H2><P>In His human living, Christ was God manifested in the flesh to express God in mercy, love, and grace and not in the condemnation of the law (John 3:17). Mercy is the source of God's love. Without God's mercy there is no source for God's love. This is because the ones whom God loves are pitiful. We are pitiful, yet He loved us because He is merciful to us. Mercy is the source of God's love, and grace is the instrument of God's love, so mercy, love, and grace are actually one thing.</P>
