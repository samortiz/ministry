<h1 class="title">ISSUE NO. 9</h1><h2 class="head4">P. O. Box 84, Hankow, July 1938</h2><h2 class="head1">NEWS CONCERNING THE WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">From Tibet to Sikang,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>At present Brother Hsu and I are still conducting evangelistic work around Yeh-Ji. Since January of this year, both rain and snow have been heavy. Even birds have disappeared from the mountains. The route through which we will travel into Sikang and Tibet is blocked, and trade caravans have been halted due to the rebellion of the Yi tribesmen in Deh-Chin County. (Deh-Chin is also called Ah-Dun-Chi; it is a five-day journey from Yeh-Ji in the northernmost county of Yunnan province, with a population consisting entirely of Sikang natives.) We dare not advance now because preparations are not fully ready. The upper tributary of the Nu River goes through the west side of Yeh-Ji, climbing over the mountain to Gung-Shan County. This was an area where I did some evangelistic work last year, with over a thousand people saved. If one travels upstream along the Nu River for five or six days, he will come to Cha-Wa-Rung, which is under Tibetan jurisdiction. I estimate that we will not be able to cross the snowy mountain ranges until the fifth month of the Chinese calendar. Brother Hsu and I intend to take this route to enter Tibet first. From there, we will travel to Sikang. Our departure is getting nearer. Presently, my family is at peace through the Lord's grace. The construction of the house will soon be complete. If other brothers come and visit us, we will have a place to lodge them.</p><p>A brother in the Lord,<br />Hu Yi-min and wife, Yang Shu-jen<br />May 9 in Yeh-Ji</p><h2 class="head2">Letter from Brother Hsu Jung-jieh,<br />Yunnan Province</h2><p>It would be wonderful if Brother Chang Tze-jieh could come and work together with us here. I hope that he can come soon. I have written him a letter but have not received his reply. I am making some progress in learning the Tibetan language. By the time I go with Brother Hu to preach the gospel in Sikang, I believe this labor will reap a reward. My wife and two children are often sick because of maladjustment to the environment. They may have to go to K'un-ming, or they may go with me. I look to the Lord for His arrangement. If I go with Brother Hu on our evangelistic travel, it will take at least two or three months, or even half a year, before we can come back to see our family. Hence, it will be more or less the same for them if they stay here or move to K'un-ming.</p><p>Your brother in the Lord,<br />Hsu Jung-jieh and wife, Sien-yun<br />May 9</p><h2 class="head2">Some Experience of Pioneering<br />in the Border Regions, Yunnan Province</h2><p>Brother Chen Hsi-wen and I left Shi-Ping on May 2, arriving in Mong-Tze on the third. We conducted outdoor evangelistic work for half a day on the fourth. A shopkeeper, coolie, and railway worker were particularly touched to receive the Lord. On the afternoon of the fourth, we traveled from Mong-Tze to Bi-Se-Zhai (north of Mong-Tze at the junction of the Yunnan-Vietnam Route and the Ku-Bi-Shi Road). We unexpectedly met Brother Yin and his family. Brother Chou Hung-bao and Brother Lin Yau-huei's mother also arrived from Ho-Kou. We took the train together and arrived in K'un-ming in the afternoon. In our travels, we found many difficulties in the pioneering work in the remote border regions. Except for the Lord's special grace, we would have had no way to start any work. Some of the difficulties included:</p><p>(1) Traveling: There is the danger of robbers and bandits. (The train along Ku-Bi-Shi Road was raided not long ago, and quite a number of people died or were wounded.) Entering into the inland regions is not only difficult but also time consuming. Most of the brothers and sisters living in the villages are poor, and it is advisable to bring more cash when traveling. There is a constant threat of robbers. Hence, there is the need for faith in the Lord.</p><p>(2) Preaching: Other than outdoor evangelistic preaching, it is difficult to gather a congregation because the folks here do not have the habit of meeting. Most of the audience are farmers and illiterate people. They do not understand Mandarin easily. As soon as we use more sophisticated terms, they become lost. The meetings of the local church are not conducted on a punctual basis because most of the believers do not have watches or clocks. There are delays from one to two hours. It is difficult to explain the deeper truths unless we find suitable, simple words or parables from the Lord. (Some think that it does not take any great gift to work in the villages or the inland regions. Actually, it takes as much gift and power to preach to illiterate sinners as it does to preach to believers.) According to my experience, working in the villages is more difficult than working in the cities. The co-workers who have been working in the cities should come to the rural areas to learn about rural life and to make friends with the rural folks. Otherwise, it will be very difficult to see any result. (This, of course, refers to the practical aspects of human affairs.)</p><p>(3) The church: Most people are illiterate, and it is difficult for them to read the Bible. Most of the residents in the inland regions are also prejudiced against outsiders. They often disrupt us using a variety of means.</p><p>(4) Outdoor evangelistic meetings: When we pioneered in different places, the Lord gave us the strength to have the boldness to engage ourselves in outdoor evangelistic preaching in the markets and populous places. According to our natural constitution, we are shy. Many people thought that we were native medicine men or street magicians. Whenever we went out, we prayed for the Lord to give us the strength to speak His gospel boldly. We saw evidence of the Lord's grace every time, proving that the gospel has the power to save all those who believe. We witnessed some immediately receiving the Lord every time.</p><p>The following are the advantages of outdoor preaching: (1) It enables sinners to hear the gospel who otherwise could not come or would not have the opportunity to come to the meeting place. It affords them a chance to hear and receive the gospel. (2) Those who are moved can be quickly introduced to the meetings of the local church. (3) It is economical. Any vacant land under the sky can serve as our preaching ground. There is no need for rent or seating. According to our experience, most people can stand for an hour without walking away. We can conduct these meetings any time and in any place; there is no limitation of time and space. This time we prepared many gospel charts and short choruses. As soon as we hung up the charts and sang the choruses, many sinners were attracted to us and listened to us. (Trumpets, accordions, or bells are also good for attracting the crowds.) Usually two or three of us take turns speaking, and the audience also rotates. We have started this kind of work in K'un-ming already. The co-workers here had the first co-workers' meeting in my house on the eleventh of last month. We encouraged and edified each other in the Lord, discussed matters related to the work, considered the problems, and gave ourselves to prayer. We have set aside every Wednesday afternoon at two o'clock for this kind of meeting.</p><p>K. H. Weigh<br />June 6 in K'un-ming</p>
