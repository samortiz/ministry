[1]  CONTENTS Seven Mysteries The Divine Revelation The Divine Purpose Sonship for the Body The Focus of the Divine Economy
[2]  This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Anaheim, California, in April and May 1978.
[3]  According to the New Testament, there are many mysteries.
[4]  In this message we shall consider, in an introductory way, seven of these mysteries: God, the universe, man, Christ, the Spirit, the church, and the future.
[5]  On the one hand, the Bible says that no one has ever seen God, but on the other hand, it says that Moses saw God.
[6]  This brings us to the second mystery, the mystery of the universe.
[7]  One day a wonderful person named Jesus Christ appeared on earth.
[8]  He was a mystery to everyone, not only to those who were close to Him at that time but to all of human society for the nearly two thousand years since.
[9]  If you know Christ, you know God, but if you do not know Christ, you do not have the key to understand God.
[10]  If you say that you are the church, I will say that you are not, but if you say that you are not the church, I will say that you are.
[11]  We have pointed out that everything in the universe is a mystery.
[12]  God, creation, man, Christ, the Spirit, the church, and the future are mysteries.
[13]  The basic revelation in the Scriptures is that God in eternity past had an eternal purpose to have a church to express Christ so that God Himself might be expressed for eternity through His chosen people.
[14]  Among today's Christians there is one legality after another.
[15]  In the past some dear saints have argued with me about the church.
[16]  Some said that they were not the church and that we were not the church either.
[17]  If we are in the vision, the Bible will no longer be closed to us.
[18]  I can testify that in the Lord's recovery the Bible is an open book, not simply a book of black and white letters.
[19]  Romans 16:25 says, "Now to Him who is able to establish you according to my gospel, that is, the proclamation of Jesus Christ, according to the revelation of the mystery, which has been kept in silence in the times of the ages."
[20]  In the foregoing messages we have covered seven mysteries and the divine revelation.
[21]  In this message we need to consider what is the basic revelation of the mystery of God.
[22]  In the past we have used the term the eternal purpose of God, but not the term the divine purpose.
[23]  Now we need to find out how dusty man can be holy, how man with the nature of dust can be the same as God in His holy nature.
[24]  The only way this can take place is for God to work Himself into man's nature.
[25]  After God created man, He placed him in front of the tree of life in order that His holy nature could enter into man through man's eating of the fruit of this tree.
[26]  God has not only selected us, but also marked us out beforehand.
[27]  We have seen that the only way for us to be holy is for God to come into our being.
[28]  The first aspect of the divine purpose is that we are being made holy, and the second is that we have been marked out for sonship, that is, to have the life of God, to express God, to have the position to inherit whatever God is, and to become divine as the Father is divine.
[29]  According to the books of Ephesians and Romans, the Body of Christ is composed of the sons of God.
[30]  If you do not have the life of a son of God, you cannot be a proper member of the Body.
[31]  In this message we shall cover the matter of sonship for the Body.
[32]  Ephesians 1:5 says that God has predestinated "us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His will."
[33]  The second significance of a son in the Bible is that a son expresses the father.
[34]  Thus, the Son of God is the expression of the Father.
[35]  Notice that we do not express God the Creator, but we express God the Father.
[36]  At this point, we need to consider Romans 8.
[37]  Many Christian teachers have spoken a great deal about Romans 8, often pointing out that it is a chapter on the Spirit.
[38]  For example, Romans 8:14 says, "For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God," and the next verse says, "For you have not received a spirit of slavery bringing you into fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father!"
[39]  Romans 8 mentions Christ and the Spirit; it also mentions "all things."
[40]  Along with Christ and the Spirit, we need "all things" to work together for us so that we may be "sonized."
[41]  How I worship the Lord that by His mercy and through His grace many of us are living not by our natural life, the life of the sons of men, but by the divine life, the life of the sons of God!
[42]  Many of us have been Christians for years, but we have never heard a message on God's economy.
[43]  THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT AND THE SPIRIT OF JESUS CHRIST
[44]  First Corinthians 15:45 says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.
[45]  This Spirit must refer to the Spirit of God, for besides the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, there is not another Spirit who gives life.
[46]  In the universe there is just one unique divine Spirit who gives life.
[47]  Before Jesus was crucified and resurrected, the Spirit of Jesus Christ was not yet, although the Spirit of God was there already.
[48]  This means that the Son with the Father is realized in the Holy Spirit.
[49]  The fact that this Spirit is the Spirit of Jesus Christ indicates that Jesus and Christ are realized in this Spirit.
[50]  The reason the supply of this Spirit is bountiful is that the Spirit includes God, the riches of the Father and the Son, the element of Jesus' humanity, and the element of Christ, the anointed One of God.
