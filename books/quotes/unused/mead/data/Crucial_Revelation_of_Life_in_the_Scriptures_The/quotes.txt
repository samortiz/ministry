[2]  CHAPTER ONE LIFE AS SEEN IN GENESIS 1 Scripture Reading: Gen 1:1-31 THE EARTH BECOMING WASTE AND VOID
[3]  Genesis 1, strictly speaking, is not a record of creation.
[4]  GOD'S WORK OF RESTORATION AND FURTHER CREATION FOR THE PRODUCING OF LIFE
[5]  Verse 3 says, "And God said, Let there be light: and there was light."
[6]  Genesis 1 reveals that the higher light always comes in for the higher life.
[7]  The starting light was for the unconscious life, the bigger light was for the conscious life, and the biggest light was for the divine life.
[8]  CHAPTER TWO LIFE FOR IMAGE AND DOMINION Scripture Reading: Gen 1:21, 26-28, 31; Matt 6:10; Col 1:15; Rom 8:29; 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18; 1 John 3:2; Luke 10:19; Rev 2:26-27; Gen 2:10-12, 18-24 GOD'S DESIRE TO EXPRESS HIMSELF AND DEAL WITH HIS ENEMY
[9]  There is the need of life because God's intention is to express Himself, and life is the means to express God.
[10]  In creation all the lower lives are for the higher lives, all the higher lives are for the highest created life, and this highest life is for the divine life.
[11]  God's Intention for Man to Express Him in His Image
[12]  Genesis 1:26 tells us that man was made in the image of God.
[13]  On the one hand, the Bible tells us clearly that God is invisible, yet on the other hand, the Bible tells us also that God has an image.
[14]  We were made according to Christ, and we have received Christ into us that we may actually be transformed and conformed into the image of Christ to eventually express Christ in His image in eternity.
[15]  We have seen that God's desire is for man to be filled with His life that man might express Him in His image and rule in Him with His dominion.
[16]  God's desire for man to express Him and for man to have dominion over His enemy can be realized only by God's life.
[17]  Genesis 2 also says that a river went out of Eden to water the garden v. 10 , showing that when we partake of God as life, we are brought into the fellowship, the flow, of this life.
[18]  On the one hand, we have the blood of Christ to cleanse us, and on the other hand, we have the life of Christ secreting all the time into us and upon us to make us pearls for God's building.
[19]  In Genesis 2 there is the picture of how the bride of Christ comes into being.
[20]  This life is the tree of life, the river of life, the very life that supplies us and that flows within us to transform us.
[21]  CHAPTER THREE THE LAMB, THE MANNA, AND THE PRODUCE OF THE LAND FOR EATING Scripture Reading: Exo 12:2-11; 13:4; 16:13b-15, 31, 35; Num 11:7-8; Josh 5:10-12
[22]  Genesis is a book of creation, and Exodus is a book of redemption.
[23]  We have seen in the first two chapters of Genesis that from the very beginning God's intention was that man would partake of the tree of life.
[24]  The tree of life signifies God Himself as life to us in the form of food.
[25]  The more that we eat of Him, enjoy Him, partake of Him as our life, the more He will be assimilated into us to be one with us in the way of mingling.
[26]  The Gospel of John tells us that in the beginning was the Word 1:1a , the Word was God 1:1b , the Word became flesh 1:14 , and this Word become flesh, this God-man, is the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world v. 29 . John 15 unveils the vine tree, which is the tree of life that supplies life.
[27]  The Lord told Moses and Aaron that they had to make the month of their redemption the beginning of months, the first month of the year to them Exo 12:2 .
[28]  Related to the eating of the meat of the lamb, there are a few things that need to be taken care of.
[29]  In John 6 the Lord Jesus told us that He is the bread of life v. 35 . He also told us that His blood is drinkable and that His flesh is eatable v. 55 . In John 6:51 the Lord said that the bread which He will give is His flesh.
[30]  Exodus 12 also tells us that they ate the lamb with their loins girded, with their shoes on their feet, and with their staff in their hand v. 11 . The children did not eat the lamb in a sloppy or a slow way.
[31]  Christ as our life and our life supply is so pure, so white.
[32]  CHAPTER FOUR ASPECTS OF DRINKING IN THE OLD TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: Exo 15:22-27; 17:1-7; Num 20:1-13; 21:16-18; 1 Cor 10:3-4
[33]  We saw in the last chapter that the history of the children of Israel was one of eating.
[34]  In this chapter we want to see that the history of the children of Israel is not only one of eating but also one of drinking.
[35]  In Exodus 15 the children of Israel enjoyed the sweet waters and in chapter sixteen they ate the heavenly manna.
[36]  SPEAKING TO THE ROCK TO DRINK THE LIVING WATER
[37]  Numbers 20:1-13 tells us that after a certain time, the children of Israel came back again to Massah or Meribah.
[38]  The truth is that Christ was smitten and cleft on the cross once for all.
[39]  There is no need for Him to be smitten again.
[40]  DIGGING AWAY THE DIRT TO ENJOY CHRIST AS THE WELL
[41]  The fourth occasion of the children of Israel's drinking is recorded in Numbers 21:16-18.
[42]  The Lord Jesus tells us in John 4:14 that if we drink of Him, we will have a spring or a well of water within us.
[43]  CHAPTER FIVE THE FLOW OF LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: Psa 36:8; 46:4; Joel 3:18; Zech 14:8; Ezek.
[44]  When we get into God's house, the flow is constant.
[45]  In the New Jerusalem, the holy city and the tabernacle of God Rev 21:2-3 , the river of water of life flows constantly 22:1 .
[46]  All of us who are in the practical church life can testify of the difference regarding the inner flow of life before and after we came into the church life.
[47]  Ezekiel 47:1 says, "Afterward he brought me again unto the door of the house; and, behold, waters issued out from under the threshold of the house eastward: for the forefront of the house stood toward the east, and the waters came down from under, from the right side of the house, at the south side of the altar."
[48]  All of us need to be measured by the man of brass.
[49]  The Lord Jesus as the measuring One, the testing One, the possessing One, needs to come in to measure us.
[50]  We must allow Him to judge us, to test us, in order to possess us.
[51]  In chapter five, we saw that we need to be those who experience the constant flow of life in God's house and that we need to be measured by the Lord for the increase of the flow of life.
[52]  In order for the flow of life to increase within us, within the house, the Lord as the man of brass has to measure us.
[53]  OUR NEED TO BE MEASURED FOR THE LORD'S MOVE
[54]  The main point for us in Ezekiel 47 is that we all need to be willing to be measured.
[55]  CHAPTER SEVEN LIFE VERSUS KNOWLEDGE Scripture Reading: John 1:1-4, 29; 3:36; 5:21, 39-40; 10:10b; 11:25a; 14:6a; Col 3:4a; Heb 7:16; Acts 5:20; 1 Pet 1:23; 1 Cor 4:15; 8:1; 2 Tim 4:3; 2 Cor 3:6
[56]  In the previous chapters, we have seen the matter of life in the Old Testament with the tree as the food and the river as the drink.
[57]  In the New Testament we can see not only the reality of the tree of life but also the reality of the tree of knowledge.
[58]  Hebrews 7:16 tells us that Christ has been constituted the High Priest "not according to the law of a fleshy commandment, but according to the power of an indestructible life."
[59]  If we are careless, we may touch the tree of knowledge instead of the tree of life; we may think that we are touching the tree of life because the tree of knowledge is so close to the tree of life.
[60]  In 1 Corinthians 8:1 Paul tells us, "Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up."
[61]  THE NEED TO DISCERN THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN KNOWLEDGE AND LIFE
[62]  The verses we have looked at thus far show us that knowledge is very close to life.
[63]  CHAPTER EIGHT EATING AND DRINKING IN THE NEW TESTAMENT Scripture Reading: John 4:14; 6:35, 57, 63; 7:37-39; 1 Cor 3:2; 10:3-4; Heb 5:12b-14a; 1 Pet 2:2-3; Rev 2:7b; 3:20; 7:16-17; 21:6b; 22:1-2, 17; Matt 22:2-3; Luke 14:16-17; 15:22-23; 1 Cor 10:21; Rev 19:9 EATING AND DRINKING THE CENTRAL THOUGHT IN GOD'S ECONOMY
[64]  The Lord's table is also a feast to us.
[65]  The eating and drinking of Christ is also revealed in the Gospel of John.
[66]  Throughout the Gospel of John, the Lord Jesus speaks of Himself as life to us 10:10; 4:14; 6:35; 7:38; 14:6 .
[67]  In the first chapter of the Gospel of John, a book showing how the Lord Jesus as life can meet the need of every man, there are five major items: God, the Word, the flesh, the Lamb, and life.
[68]  While chapter three is about a highly cultured, very religious, God-seeking, God-fearing, moral person, chapter four is about an immoral woman.
[69]  Although she was quite evil, having had five husbands and living with a sixth who was not her husband, she still tried to speak about religion.
[70]  The thought and the concept of eating and drinking is not only in the Gospels, but also in the Epistles of the Apostles Paul and Peter and in the book of Revelation.
[71]  CHAPTER NINE THE BREATH OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Gen 2:7; Ezek.
[72]  37:1-14, 26-28; John 20:22; 3:8; Acts 2:2, 4; 2 Tim 3:16; Rev 11:11; 2 Thes 2:8 THE FOOD IN THE WATER AND THE WATER IN THE AIR
[73]  In the previous chapters we have seen that the Lord is our life supply as water for us to drink and as food for us to eat.
[74]  In Ezekiel 47 is the house of God, the building of God, but in chapter thirty-seven the Lord's children are pictured as disjointed, dry bones.
[75]  THE BREATH OF LIFE COMING INTO THE DRY BONES TO ACCOMPLISH GOD'S PURPOSE
[76]  These bones needed a further prophecy so that the breath of life could come into them.
[77]  CHAPTER TEN THE SEED OF LIFE Scripture Reading: Gen 1:11, 12, 29; Luke 8:5-8a, 11-15; Matt 13:4-8, 19-23, 24, 31, 33, 37-38, 44-46; 1 Cor 3:6-9, 10-12; 1 Pet 1:23; James 1:18; Rev 14:4b, 15
[78]  THE SEED BEING THE WORD OF GOD, THE SONS OF THE KINGDOM, AND CHRIST HIMSELF
[79]  In the Gospels, the Lord Jesus likened Himself to a sower sowing the seed.
[80]  THE SEED OF LIFE, THE GROWTH IN LIFE, AND THE TRANSFORMATION IN LIFE IN MATTHEW 13 AND 1 CORINTHIANS 3
[81]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE SPIRIT OF LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: John 6:63a, c; 2 Cor 3:6c; 1 Cor 15:45b; Rom 8:2a; John 3:5-6b; 4:24; Matt 28:18-19 THE SPIRIT THAT GIVES LIFE
[82]  We have covered the tree of life, the river of life, the breath of life, and the seed of life.
[83]  In this chapter we come to the ultimate point, the highest point the Spirit of life.
[84]  There are three places in the New Testament that refer to the Spirit as the Spirit that gives life.
[85]  The Spirit of God today is the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit of life, and this Spirit of life is the breath of life.
[86]  We may also say that the Father is the Son and that the Son is the Spirit.
[87]  In Isaiah 9:6 the Son is called the everlasting Father, and 2 Corinthians 3:17 says that the Lord is the Spirit.
[88]  In the last chapter, we saw four aspects of the divine Spirit, the all-inclusive Spirit of life, for the dispensing of God Himself as life into our being.
[89]  In this chapter, we want to see more aspects of the Spirit of life.
[90]  The Spirit of life brings Christ with the divine life into us, and we are born again.
[91]  The Spirit of Christ dwells within us not only as God but also as Christ and comprises the divine nature of God and the human nature, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ.
[92]  Romans 8:15 tells us that we "have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father."
[93]  You may say that you have the life of the Son of God, but this life has not been developed in you to its fullness.
[94]  Second Corinthians 3:17 tells us that the Lord is the Spirit and "where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom."
[95]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE SPIRIT OF LIFE 3 Scripture Reading: Titus 3:5; Eph 4:23; 2 Thes 2:13; 1 John 2:27; Gal 5:22, 25; John 14:17; 16:13-15; 2 Cor 13:14
[96]  In chapter twelve we saw something concerning the Spirit of life in Romans, 1 Corinthians, and 2 Corinthians.
[97]  In this chapter we want to continue our fellowship concerning the Spirit of life.
[98]  A good illustration of dispositional sanctification is the making of tea.
[99]  When a tea bag is placed into plain water, it "teaifies" the water.
[100]  Ephesians 3:16 says that we need to be strengthened into our inner man through the Spirit.
[101]  We trust in the life-giving Spirit because this Spirit works to liberate us, transform us, renew us, sanctify us, and anoint us, bringing Christ into us and adding Christ into us little by little and day by day.
[102]  As we cooperate with the work of the life-giving Spirit, we are increasing in the riches of Christ, and we are gaining more life so that we can grow in life.
[103]  To live by the Spirit is to have our life dependent upon and regulated by the Spirit.
[104]  To live by the Spirit, to walk by the Spirit, is a matter of life.
[105]  Second Corinthians 1 tells us that God has anointed us with this Spirit v. 21 ; chapter three tells us that this Spirit is the Spirit that gives life, liberates, and transforms; and the conclusion of 2 Corinthians tells us that this Spirit is the Spirit of fellowship.
[106]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN SAVED BY LIFE 1 Scripture Reading: John 1:4; 10:10b; 11:25; 1 John 5:12; Col 3:4a; Rom 5:10, 12, 17-19, 21; 6:4; Phil 3:10a
[107]  There are four categories of life in Genesis 1 and 2: the vegetable life, the animal life, the human life, and the divine life.
[108]  With all the other categories of lives there is a beginning and ending because they are created lives, but only one category of life, one unique life, the divine life of God, is eternal and uncreated with no beginning or ending.
[109]  The human life was created according to the likeness of the divine life so that God could dispense Himself as the divine life into the human life.
[110]  Life is God Himself; life is God in Christ; life is God in Christ through the Spirit; life is Christ with God; and life is the Spirit with all the riches of Christ in all the fullness of the Godhead.
[111]  The One in whom there is life is the One who was the Word in the beginning, who was with God in the beginning, who was God in the beginning, and through whom all things came into being.
[112]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN SAVED BY LIFE 2 Scripture Reading: Rom 5:10, 12, 17-19, 21; 6:4; Phil 3:10a SIN AND DEATH IN ADAM VERSUS RIGHTEOUSNESS AND LIFE IN CHRIST
[113]  Romans 5 shows us two persons Adam and Christ.
[114]  The disobedience of one man is versus the obedience of the One v. 19 . Adam is the first man, and Christ is the second Man.
[115]  The four Gospels unveil the marvelous humanity of the Lord Jesus.
[116]  Much more, we shall be saved in His life from death.
[117]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIFE Scripture Reading: 2 Pet 1:1-11; 3:18
[118]  In the previous chapters we have seen something concerning the matter of life in the writings of John and Paul.
[119]  John's writings occupy the beginning and end of the New Testament; the Gospel of John is at the beginning and the book of Revelation is at the end. John stresses life and opens the way for life in his Gospel.
[120]  Furthermore, because God has called us to His own glory and virtue, He has given us His precious and exceedingly great promises to assure us, encourage us, strengthen us, and speed us on our way toward this goal.
[121]  The third category of great things given to us by God is the precious and exceedingly great promises.
[122]  Peter's word is very mysterious, yet in this mysterious word are the secrets of life.
[123]  The first secret is that all things relating to life and godliness are given to us as the seed of faith 2 Pet 1:1, 3, 5 .
