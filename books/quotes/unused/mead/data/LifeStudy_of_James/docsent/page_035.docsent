   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AWAITING THE LORD S COMING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH LONGSUFFERING</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>After the parenthetical section in 5:1-6, we have a word concerning awaiting the Lord s coming with longsuffering 5:7-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This also is a practical virtue of Christian perfection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Awaiting the Lord s coming back is not an Old Testament matter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, this is fully a New Testament matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This indicates that after speaking to Jews in 5:1-6, James now speaks to Christians, to believers, in 5:7-11.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First he talks to the rich among the Jews, and then he speaks to Christians about waiting for the Lord s coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I find it difficult to believe that James could write in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Nevertheless, this is what we find in 5:1-11.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 5:7 James says, Therefore, be longsuffering, brothers, until the coming of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Behold, the farmer awaits the precious fruit of the earth, being longsuffering over it until it receives the early and late rain.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Greek words for longsuffering in these verses are makrothumia noun, as in Heb 6:12; Rom 2:4; 2 Tim 4:2; 1 Pet 3:20 and makrothumeo, as in James 5:7-8.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Longsuffering expresses patience toward persons, as toward those who persecuted the prophets v. 10 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Greek word for coming in 5:7 is parousia, presence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ s coming will be His presence with His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This parousia will begin with His coming to the air and end with His coming to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Within His parousia, there will be the rapture of the majority of the believers to the air 1 Thes 4:15-17 , the judgment seat of Christ 2 Cor 5:10 , and the marriage of the Lamb Rev 19:7-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 8 James continues, You also be longsuffering; establish your hearts, because the coming of the Lord has drawn near.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>While we are awaiting the Lord s coming with longsuffering, He, as the real Farmer Matt 13:3 , is also awaiting with patience our maturity in life as the firstfruit and harvest of His field Rev 14:4, 14-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our maturity in life can cut short the period of our longsuffering and His patience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Verse 9 says, Do not complain, brothers, against one another, that you be not judged; behold, the Judge stands before the doors!</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This verse indicates that the Lord will come back not only as the Bridegroom to meet the bride Matt 25:1, 6; Rev 19:7-8 , but also as the Judge to judge all peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, the Lord will judge His believers at His judgment seat 1 Cor 4:4-5; 2 Cor 5:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to pursue maturity in life to meet the Lord and be prepared to be judged by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In verse 10 James continues, Take as an example, brothers, of suffering evil and of longsuffering, the prophets, who spoke in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is a further development of verses 7 and 8 concerning the suffering and longsuffering of the faithful believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>James uses the prophets as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The prophets spoke in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Speaking in the name of the Lord indicates that the prophets were one with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, their suffering and longsuffering were with the Lord and for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The suffering and longsuffering of the faithful believers should be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In verse 11 James says, Behold, we count those blessed who endured.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You have heard of the endurance of Job, and you have seen the end of the Lord, that the Lord is very compassionate and full of pity.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In this verse endured and endurance are translations of the Greek words hupomeno, verb, and hupomone, noun, as in Romans 5:3 and 2 Corinthians 1:6.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This endurance expresses patience toward things, such as the things which afflicted Job</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our Need to Grow in Life</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In 5:7 James uses the illustration of a farmer awaiting with longsuffering the precious fruit of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have seen that the Lord Jesus is actually the real Farmer, the unique Farmer.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As we are awaiting His coming, He, as the real Farmer, is awaiting our maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We may pray, Lord, come back quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, He may say, My children, mature quicker.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>While you are awaiting My coming back, I am awaiting your maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Do you know why it has been nearly two thousand years and I have not yet come back?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The reason is that My people are not yet matured.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Only your maturity can hasten My coming back.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You exercise your longsuffering, and I exercise My longsuffering.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is a great help for us to realize that if we are serious about awaiting the Lord s coming back, we need to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Most Christians today view the Lord s coming in an altogether objective way, in a way that has nothing to do with our spiritual condition or spiritual growth.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Their expectation is that one day the Lord will suddenly come, and that His coming will have nothing to do with their maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It may be that the concepts many Christians hold regarding the Lord s coming back are actually causing Him to delay His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The illustration of the farmer in 5:7 implies that the farmer is waiting for the crop growing in the field to ripen.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to Revelation 14, the Lord is also waiting for the harvest to be ripe.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When the harvest in the field is ripe, He will come back.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This harvest will be the issue, the outcome, of the Lord s sowing of Himself as a seed.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This was accomplished during the Lord s first coming, and it is described in Matthew 13.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to realize that it is the ripening of the harvest that will hasten the Lord s coming back.</S>
