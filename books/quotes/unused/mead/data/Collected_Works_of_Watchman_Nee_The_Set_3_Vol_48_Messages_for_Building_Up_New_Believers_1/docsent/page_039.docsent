   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SEVEN THE LAYING ON OF HANDS Scripture Reading: Heb 6:1-2; Acts 8:14-17; 19:5-6; Psa 133; Lev 1:4; 3:2, 8, 13; 4:4, 15, 24, 29, 33</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Bible clearly shows us that a man needs to be baptized.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bible also clearly shows us that a man needs to receive the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can see this in two instances in Acts in Samaria and in Ephesus.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In both cases baptism was followed by the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This was clearly the apostles' practice in their days.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Today, if God's children are only baptized without experiencing the laying on of hands, their experience is not complete.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Bible clearly contains both the teaching and the pattern for this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I. THE LAYING ON OF HANDS A FOUNDATIONAL TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hebrews 6:1 tells us that we should leave the word of the beginning of Christ and be brought on to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are several truths in the Christian life which should never be compromised.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They are the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A believer does not need to lay this foundation again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, it does need to be laid.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is the word of the beginning of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is repentance, faith, baptism, the laying on of hands, resurrection, and judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Bible shows us clearly that the foundation of the word of Christ includes baptism and the laying on of hands.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we have received baptism without receiving the laying on of hands, we are short of this foundation in our pursuit of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The error of the church today is altogether different from the error the Hebrew believers fell into at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Hebrew believers already had laid the foundation, yet they wanted to lay the same foundation again and again, thus going about in circles.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What about the church today?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It has made some progress, but its foundation is not well laid.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The apostle told the Hebrew believers to leave the word of the beginning of Christ and strive to be brought on to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the case of Christians today, they move forward too fast without laying this foundation at all.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is too hasty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You have to see that the laying on of hands is part of the foundation of the word of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Those who have laid this foundation need to move forward, whereas those who have not must do so.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Our teaching today is different from the apostle's teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He admonished people to leave something behind, whereas we exhort people to turn back to pick up these things.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If you have to build a house with six rocks as the foundation, you cannot afford to miss one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If one is missing, a problem will occur someday.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Anything that serves as a foundation is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If baptism, as one part of the foundation, is missing, trouble will arise in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If the laying on of hands, as another part of the foundation, is missing, trouble will also arise down the road.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One cannot be careless about the foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>One cannot build a house upon a poorly laid foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If part of the foundation is missing, it must be completed before he can proceed with the rest of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE SIGNIFICANCE OF THE LAYING ON OF HANDS</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have covered baptism and what it does for us.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Baptism delivers us out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Through baptism a man is saved and delivered out of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>At the same time, baptism puts one into Christ and entitles him to a share in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But what does the laying on of hands do for us?</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>What does the laying on of hands mean?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The answers to these questions can be found in Leviticus 1, 3, and 4.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>These passages most frequently refer to the matter of the laying on of hands in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What is the meaning of a person laying his hands on the head of an animal in the Old Testament?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There are two meanings.</S>
