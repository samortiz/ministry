THE TRIUNE GOD&#151;<br>THE FATHER, THE SON, AND THE SPIRIT&#151;<br>DISPENSING HIMSELF INTO OUR BEING</H2><P>In Ephesians 3:14-19, we can see that the Father hears the prayer and works to answer the prayer. Then the Spirit strengthens, and Christ makes His home to settle Himself in our hearts. The result is that we are filled unto all the fullness of God. Again, this is the functioning of the Triune God&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;to dispense Himself into our being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. THE DISPENSING FUNCTION OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br>ISSUING IN THE SENSE OF LIFE</H2><P>Actually, the sense of life comes from the dispensing function of the Triune God. Without the dispensing function of the Triune God, we would not have the sense of life. We would have only a deadened conscience. The sense of life is the issue of the Triune God functioning within us to dispense Himself as life into our whole being. We must show the saints how the sense of life is related to God's dispensing. Today we have the sense of life from the dispensing function of the Triune God in a living way, because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit cooperate together to function within us.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Through the Law of Life</H2><P>The dispensing function of the Triune God issues in the sense of life through the law of life (Heb. 8:10-11). When the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, functions in us to dispense Himself into our being through the law of life, this issues in the sense of life.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. By the Teaching of the Anointing</H2><P>The issue of the sense of life by the dispensing function of the Triune God is by the teaching of the anointing (1 John 2:27). We have to build the saints up that they may know all these terms. They should become very familiar with all these terms.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. In Our Spirit Mingled<br>with the Life-giving Spirit</H2><P>Romans 8:16 says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. Then verse 14 says that as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God. This shows that the dispensing function of the Triune God issuing in the sense of life is in our spirit mingled with the life-giving Spirit.</P><P>Thus, the sense of life is through the law of life, by the teaching of the anointing, and in our spirit which is mingled with the life-giving Spirit. These three points are very crucial. This is the real scientific study of the inner life. If we do not experience these things, they are hard to understand. We need to tell the saints that this needs experience. We should not merely exercise our mind to analyze these things. Without experience we cannot understand them. We have to prove the matters of life by our experience.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_058.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_060.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Basic Lessons on Life &nbsp; pg 59</div><br></body></html>
