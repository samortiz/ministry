<h2 class="head2">The Picture of the Ark and the Tabernacle</h2>
<p>The contents of the tabernacle can be used to illustrate the difference between riches and fullness. The Ark is inside the tabernacle, and the Ten Commandments given by God are inside the Ark. The Ark typifies Christ, and the Ten Commandments are the explanation and expression of God. According to typology, the Ten Commandments&rsquo; being inside the Ark indicates that everything God is, is in Christ, and this is the riches of Christ. God has put all that He is and has into Christ, and all that God is and has are the unlimited, boundless, and inexhaustible riches of Christ.</p>
<p>Moreover, the tabernacle is the enlargement of the Ark. The tabernacle is the fullness of the Ark. If we exchange the word <em>Ark</em> with <em>Christ,</em> then the tabernacle is the fullness of Christ. The Ten Commandments, which are hidden inside the Ark, are the riches of the Ark, and the tabernacle as the enlargement of the Ark is the fullness of the Ark. When the Ark arrived at the house of Obed-edom (2 Sam. 6:11), there was no problem with the riches of the Ark because the Ten Commandments were inside the Ark. However, there was a problem with the fullness of the Ark because there was no tabernacle. The Ark is made of acacia wood overlaid with gold, and the tabernacle is also made of acacia wood overlaid with gold. Therefore, the enlargement of the Ark is the tabernacle, and the tabernacle is the fullness of the Ark. This picture shows that the riches of the Ark are the Ten Commandments within the Ark. However, if the Ark has merely the Ten Commandments but no tabernacle, it would merely have the riches but no fullness. The issue of the Ark is the tabernacle, just as the issue of Adam is Eve. Eve is not the riches of Adam but the fullness of Adam. This means that Eve is the enlargement of Adam. From this picture we can say that what is within Christ is the riches of Christ and that by entering into us, Christ has been expanded, making us His one Body, His tabernacle, and His counterpart, as His fullness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BUILDING THE CHURCH WITH THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In Ephesians Paul says that he announced the riches of Christ (3:8) so that those who receive the riches of Christ would become the fullness of Christ (1:23). The fullness of Christ is the church. There have never been any problems with the riches of Christ, but there can be problems with the fullness of Christ. If the church has problems, the fullness of Christ has problems. In the Old Testament, when the tabernacle had problems, lost its position, or was damaged, the fullness of the Ark had problems. When the tabernacle had problems, the Ark possessed only riches; it lost its fullness. In order for Christ to have a fullness, the church must be built up. This is a great matter. We need to see that we announce the riches of Christ. What we announce as the gospel is the riches of Christ, and the issue of our announcing the riches of Christ is the fullness of Christ.</p>
<p>In Ephesians 4 Paul says that the gifts are for the perfecting of the saints unto the building up of the Body of Christ so that we all may arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. The measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ emphasizes the church becoming a full-grown man. Verse 13 says, &ldquo;Until we all arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.&rdquo; In this verse the word <em>at</em> occurs three times, but it refers to the same thing. When we arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, we arrive at a full-grown man, which also is our arriving at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. We must note that Ephesians does not speak of individuals but of a corporate entity. The new man in 2:15 and the dwelling place of God in verse 22 are corporate, not individual, and the warfare in chapter 6 is by a corporate entity, not an individual. The work of the apostles is to perfect the saints unto the building up of the Body of Christ so that the church can mature until it is full-grown. Then the church will have the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</p>
<p>Chapter 1 says that the fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ (v. 23). By the time we come to chapter 4, the fullness of Christ refers not merely to the Body of Christ but to the Body of Christ having a full stature. Our work is to announce the riches of Christ to men and to perfect them with the riches of Christ so that they become the fullness of Christ; that is, they become the church. This means that we are bringing out the riches of the Ark to build the tabernacle.</p>
<p>The Ark in the Old Testament was not empty; it was rich in its contents. Inside the Ark are the riches, and when the Ark is enlarged into the tabernacle, the tabernacle becomes the fullness of the Ark. This is a type of Christ. The Ark typifies Christ, and the tabernacle typifies the fullness of Christ. All that God is, is in Christ (John 14:10). When the riches of Christ are ministered, Christ expands into us, and we become His Body, the church. Hence, the church is the fullness of Christ. Christ is the embodiment of God, and the church is the expression of Christ. Within Christ are the riches, and the enlargement of Christ is the fullness. This is the blueprint, and our work is to build according to this blueprint. We announce and minister the riches of Christ. As a result, we use the riches of Christ to make men the fullness of Christ, that is, the church as the Body of Christ.</p>
