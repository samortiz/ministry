   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THIS MYSTERY BEING HIDDEN AND IMPLIED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN GOD S CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Christ was originally a mystery in God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today when He as the mystery comes into us, He becomes a mystery in us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is very personal to us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It took four thousand years for this mystery of God to be worked into us and become the mystery in us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I am afraid that some of you have never heard this.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From the time God created Adam to the incarnation of the Lord Jesus was four thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When God created Adam, He created him according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For Adam to be created according to the image of God means that he was created according to Christ, because the Bible says that Christ is the image of God 2 Cor 4:4; Col 1:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, when we say that man was created by God according to His own image, we mean that man was created by God according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This shows us that in Genesis 1 this mystery was already there.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some people have been in Christianity for years but may not have heard such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Man being created according to God s image is the literal fact, but its intrinsic meaning is that God s creation of man was according to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God created man in this way because His intention was for man to contain Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man must be according to Christ because one day Christ will enter into him and dwell in him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Christ dwells in a man, He is comfortable and fits in, because man was created according to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may illustrate this with a rectangular box and a round object.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we put the round object into the box, it will feel uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if we put in something the same size and shape as the box, it will be very comfortable and fit well.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When Adam was created in Genesis 1:26, God spoke forth the intrinsic meaning of His mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From Adam to Abraham was two thousand years, and from Abraham to Christ was another two thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was after four thousand years that God became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the beginning God created man according to Christ, but the created man did not know for what purpose he existed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>No one knew, including Adam, Moses, and even the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Only God Himself knew.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was a mystery hidden in God and kept in silence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Abraham appeared, God called him and said to him, In your seed all the nations of the earth shall be blessed Gen 22:18 , but even though Abraham received that promise, he did not know anything about this seed nor did he know who this seed would be.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>GOD BECOMING FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>BEING THE MYSTERY ENTERING INTO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was the case until one day among the seed of Abraham there was a woman named Mary, who gave birth to a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, this wonderful person, Jesus, was a man, but on the other hand, He was also Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Therefore, He was Emmanuel, God with man Matt 1:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It was at that time that the mystery in God began to enter into man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Through the journey of four thousand years, from Adam to Abraham and all the way to Christ, God was not idle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Rather, He was very busy.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He created the universe with all the things in it, and He created man.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Later He operated many things in human history.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Then one day this God with His mystery entered into a woman among mankind and was conceived, and afterward He came out from her womb.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This was the man recorded in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was so wonderful and mysterious that no one could know Him or speak of Him thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He was both man and God, both Jesus and Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Moreover, He was also life, light, love, the sun, and the morning star.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was beyond man s description because He was truly a wonderful and rich One.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When He was on the earth, people surrounded Him, dwelt with Him, and walked and lived with Him, but no one truly knew Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The disciples who were with Him for three and a half years observed Him every day.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>They touched Him, and John even reclined on His bosom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Still, not a single person knew who or what He was.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This was because at that time the mystery in God had entered into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Due to the incarnation, the mystery that was originally in the God of the universe was now found in a man in this universe.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The mystery in this person was the same as the mystery in God.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, not only do people in the world not know this, but even many in Christianity do not realize it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>At the time of the apostle Paul, different philosophies, particularly Greek philosophy, flourished around the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Two thousand years ago the inhabited land on the earth was centered around the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The ancient Babylonian and Egyptian cultures, and especially the Greek culture, had all reached the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In addition, the Jewish culture was also there.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These four cultures were mixed together, and the result was a certain philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, even in this philosophy no one knew that the mystery originally in God had now entered into a person and had become the mystery in man.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption, the gospel was preached to people of the nations around the Mediterranean Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>However, no matter how much people heard it, they still did not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Even the Gnostics, who had a high reputation at that time and whose philosophical theories were very mysterious, had no vision of this mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Nevertheless, the One in whom the mystery was, was not restrained or put to rest.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Rather, He was ready to increase and multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>He was a grain of wheat that became one hundred grains.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Then the one hundred became ten thousand, and the ten thousand went on to become countless grains.</S>
