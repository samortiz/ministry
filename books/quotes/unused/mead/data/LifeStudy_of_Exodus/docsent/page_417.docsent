   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EXODUS MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-SEVEN THE PRIESTLY GARMENTS 12 Scripture Reading: Exo 28:30; Lev 8:8; Num 27:21; Deut 33:8-10; Ezra 2:63; 1 Sam 23:6, 9-12; 28:6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we shall continue our study of the Urim and the Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Exodus 28:30 says, And you shall put in the breastplate of judgment the Urim and the Thummim, and they shall be upon Aaron s heart when he goes in before Jehovah, and Aaron shall bear the judgment of the sons of Israel upon his heart before Jehovah continually.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I believe that the Urim and the Thummim are the most mysterious parts of the garments worn by the high priest.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we would understand the Urim and the Thummim, we should study the Old Testament and also consider our spiritual experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>TYPES OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In studying the Urim and the Thummim, we need to follow the principle that the types in Exodus, Leviticus, Numbers, and Deuteronomy are types of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In these books there are types of the individual Christ and also of the corporate Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that in the Pentateuch there are types of Christ Himself and types of Christ with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For example, we have the ark typifying Christ, and the tabernacle, made of forty-eight boards, typifying the church.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, with the priestly garments we have types of Christ and the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The ephod typifies the expression of Christ, and the breastplate worn by the high priest typifies the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the breastplate on the ephod is a type of the church borne by Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I would encourage the saints to take the time necessary to study the types of Christ with the church in the Pentateuch.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I am very grateful to the Lord that during the years I was with the Brethren I learned biblical typology.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many of the types are not new to me.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, understanding the application of these types to our experience requires further study.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In this message let us study the Urim and the Thummim according to the Old Testament and also try to apply this type to our experience according to today s need.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>THE APPLICATION OF THE URIM</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>AND THE THUMMIM IN THE OLD TESTAMENT</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In addition to 28:30, there are a number of references to the Urim and the Thummim in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Leviticus 8:8 says, And he put the breastplate upon him: also he put in the breastplate the Urim and the Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>According to Numbers 27:21, the Lord said to Moses concerning Joshua, And he shall stand before Eleazar the priest, who shall ask counsel for him after the judgment of Urim before the Lord: at his word shall they go out, and at his word shall they come in, both he, and all the children of Israel with him, even all the congregation.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Ezra 2:63 and Nehemiah 7:65 speak of the Urim and the Thummim with respect to the same historical situation.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Ezra 2:63 says, And the Tir-shatha said unto them, that they should not eat of the most holy things, till there stood up a priest with Urim and with Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Urim and the Thummim are also referred to in Deuteronomy 33:8-10 and in 1 Samuel 23:6, 9-12 and 28:6.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Concerning the Urim and the Thummim, we have been helped by an appendix in David Baron s book The Ancient Scriptures and the Modern Jew.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Urim and the Thummim were two items placed into the breastplate in addition to the twelve precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Hebrew the word Urim means lights, illuminators, and Thummim means completers, perfecters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The placing of the Urim and the Thummim into the breastplate caused the breastplate to become the breastplate of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Aaron</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to the history in the Old Testament, the Urim and the Thummim were placed upon a number of different persons.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first application was to Aaron Lev 8:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Although Aaron bore the breastplate with the Urim and the Thummim, it is doubtful that he ever made use of the Urim and Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>During the time Aaron was high priest, Moses was still alive.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moses was an extraordinary person, and the Bible tells us that God spoke to him directly, without any means, instrument, or intermediary.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Exodus 33:11 says, And the Lord spake unto Moses face to face, as a man speaketh unto his friend.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Numbers 12:8 indicates that the Lord spoke with Moses mouth to mouth, even apparently, and not in dark speeches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Because the Lord spoke to Moses in such a direct and intimate way, there was no need during his lifetime for the Lord to make His will known to Aaron by means of the Urim and the Thummim.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Aaron died before Moses did.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, even though Aaron wore the ephod with the breastplate and the Urim and the Thummim, he did not use them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In other words, during the time of Aaron s priesthood, God did not speak to His people through the Urim and the Thummim, for He had a person, Moses, with whom He spoke face to face.</S>
