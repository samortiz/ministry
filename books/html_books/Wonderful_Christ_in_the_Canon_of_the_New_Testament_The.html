<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p> These messages by Brother Witness Lee give us a picture of the wonderful person of Christ. The first eight messages were given in Houston, Texas. The next nine messages were given in Atlanta, Georgia, and the last seven messages were given in New York City, New York. They were originally published in <em>The Stream,</em> volumes 13 and 14, in May, August, November 1975 and February, May, August 1976.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE SEED, THE ROOT, THE BRANCH,<br />
AND THE FRUIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 3:15; 22:18; 2 Sam. 7:12-14a; Isa. 4:2; 11:1-2, 10; 53:2; Jer. 23:5-6; Zech. 6:12-13; Matt. 1:17, 20-21, 23; 16:13-17; 18:20; 28:19-20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">A WONDERFUL PERSON WITH WONDERFUL NAMES</h2>
<p>The Bible is a wonderful book with a wonderful person. We should never consider this divine book as being wonderful in anything else. Some think that the Bible is wonderful in doctrines and teachings. We do admit there are good teachings in this wonderful book. But we must all realize that it is wonderful because it portrays to us a wonderful person. This wonderful person is Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>I am afraid that we know far too little about this wonderful person. There is no need for me to mention His depth and His unsearchable riches. Simply His name is wonderful!</p>
<p>Many of us do not know anything about His name. Have you ever heard that Jesus is called the Branch? &ldquo;And speak unto him, saying, Thus speaketh the Lord of hosts, saying, Behold the man whose name is The Branch; and he shall grow up out of his place, and he shall build the temple of the Lord&rdquo; (Zech. 6:12). This is one of the wonderful names of Jesus. Along with the branch, Jesus is called another name in Jeremiah: &ldquo;Behold, the days come, saith the Lord, that I will raise unto David a righteous Branch, and a King shall reign and prosper, and shall execute judgment and justice in the earth. In his days Judah shall be saved, and Israel shall dwell safely: and this is his name whereby he shall be called, THE LORD OUR RIGHTEOUSNESS&rdquo; (Jer. 23:5-6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEED OF WOMAN</h2>
<p>Jesus also has another name: the Seed of a Woman. This is seen in Genesis 3:15. &ldquo;And I will put enmity between thee and the woman, and between thy seed and her seed; it shall bruise thy head, and thou shalt bruise his heel.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Why is Jesus called the Seed of Woman? To see this we must realize that in order to fulfill His purpose God created man as the center of the universe. It is not a small thing that we have been created in God&rsquo;s image. Adam was made in the image of God. But God said that it was not good for man to be alone. So He took a part of the man and built this part into a woman. This is God&rsquo;s economy. Many times those of us who are husbands wish that we did not have a wife. Yet, on the other hand, we simply cannot go on without a wife. God&rsquo;s economy destines us in this way. Hence, God prepared a wife for man.</p>
<p>But not long after God made a help meet for man, Satan entered. He did not make his first approach to mankind through the man, but through the woman. The husband may be likened to the front door, and the wife to the back door. He came in from the woman&rsquo;s direction, not from the man&rsquo;s. This may seem terrible, but it is really wonderful.</p>
<p>Forty years ago I heard a message by Brother Watchman Nee in which he said that in the entire universe God has an enemy, who may be likened to a mouse running loose in our house. How can we get rid of him? The best way is to set a trap. With the trap, there is always a little door. The door to the trap is the woman. The trap-maker made the door. Then one day Satan came into mankind through this door. He thought that he had captured man, but God had caught the enemy in a trap. This is why in Genesis 3 God told the enemy that the seed of the woman would bruise his head.</p>
<p>So eventually we see that the woman is not so bad. Eventually she is glorious. Though Satan came in through the woman, the Seed who would bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head also came in through the woman. Hallelujah! Jesus was not the seed of a man; He was the seed of a woman. All the sisters should be proud of this. Since the day Jesus came in through woman, there is the wonderful story of woman in the New Testament. Not long ago I fellowshipped with the sisters in Los Angeles about the six Marys recorded in the New Testament. Of course, the first Mary was the woman through whom Jesus was born. With Mary there is the seed of woman, and Jesus&rsquo; name is her seed.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SEED OF ABRAHAM</h2>
<p>Then we have another verse which speaks about the seed of Abraham: &ldquo;And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed&rdquo; (Gen. 22:18). In the seed of Abraham, all the nations, not only Israel, shall be blessed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BRANCH, THE FRUIT, AND THE ROOT</h2>
<p>Now we must see that this seed, Jesus, eventually becomes the branch, and this branch is called &ldquo;the Lord our righteousness.&rdquo; We have already seen this in Zechariah 6 and Jeremiah 23. Isaiah 4:2 then tells us that this branch is &ldquo;the branch of the Lord&rdquo; and also &ldquo;the fruit of the earth.&rdquo; &ldquo;In that day shall the branch of the Lord be beautiful and glorious, and the fruit of the earth shall be excellent and comely for them that are escaped of Israel.&rdquo; Jesus on the one hand is &ldquo;the branch of the Lord,&rdquo; and on the other hand He is &ldquo;the fruit of the earth.&rdquo; Jesus is the branch that bears the fruit, and He is also the fruit that is brought forth by the branch. The branch is to bring forth the fruit, and the fruit is for our enjoyment.</p>
<p>We also see that this branch is the root. &ldquo;And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people; to it shall the Gentiles seek: and his rest shall be glorious&rdquo; (Isa. 11:10). This verse shows us that the branch is also the root, and this root is an ensign, a banner, or a standard for all the people of the earth. And the Gentiles, including you and me, will seek after Him. And His resting place is full of glory.</p>
<p>Not only is this One the root of Jesse, but also the seed of David. &ldquo;And when thy days be fulfilled, and thou shalt sleep with thy fathers, I will set up thy seed after thee, which shall proceed out of thy bowels, and I will establish his kingdom. He shall build a house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever. I will be his father, and he shall be my son&rdquo; (2 Sam. 7:12-14a). He is the seed of David, but on the other hand He is the son of God. God said that He would be His Father, and He would be His son. He will build a house for God, and God will establish the throne of His kingdom forever.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE SEED AND HUMAN SOIL</h2>
<p>Who is this wonderful person who has all of these names and who will accomplish the building of God&rsquo;s house? It is Jesus! But now we are clear that He is much more than we thought. First of all, Jesus is a kind of seed. This seed is God in the Son to be sown into mankind. Man is the fertile soil to this seed. For this seed to grow, we need the soil. God in the Son as the embodiment of life is the seed, and we are the soil. We are God&rsquo;s soil for God&rsquo;s growth.</p>
<p>This is not my thought or concept. Matthew 13 shows us that Jesus came as the seed of God Himself and sowed this seed into the human heart. Thus, humanity is the soil for the divine seed to grow. Did you ever see this in the Bible? God in the Son is a divine seed, and we are the soil for Him to grow in us. It is easy to gather the doctrines and stories in the Bible, but to enter into the depth of the Bible is not easy. To know the teaching of the Bible is not difficult, but to realize the life that is conveyed in the Bible requires divine revelation. Jesus is the divine seed that has been sown into our heart. We are the soil in which Jesus can grow. The seed is sown and something has sprung up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BRANCHING OUT OF GOD TO BEAR FRUIT</h2>
<p>After the seed, we see that Jesus is also the branch. The verses we have read show us that He is the branch of the Lord. By this we can realize that this man Jesus was the very branching out of God. God branches out in Jesus. Jesus is the branch of God, and we are the branch of Jesus. Jesus branches out God, and now we are branching out Jesus. John 15 tells us that Jesus is the vine, and we are the branches. Hallelujah! Jesus is the branching out of God.</p>
<p>To say that Jesus is the Savior and Redeemer is altogether right, but too shallow. Jesus is not merely our Savior and Redeemer, He is the branching out of God. And He has branched out to us. We all have been caught by Jesus. One day God branched Jesus into us. Eventually this branch bears the fruit. Jesus as a branch is not for a column or beam of a building. Jesus is the branching out of God to bear fruit for our enjoyment. And now we are the branches of Christ to branch out Christ for others&rsquo; enjoyment.</p>
<p>Jesus today is not only the seed, but also the branch, and this divine branch bears the fruit of the earth. This means that Jesus is the branching out of the Lord into us as the earth. Divinity branches out into our humanity. And through humanity, this branch bears fruit for man&rsquo;s enjoyment. This is Jesus. It is this Jesus that builds God&rsquo;s temple. The Bible shows us that today God&rsquo;s temple is a group of living persons framed together and built up as God&rsquo;s habitation in the spirit. The only one that can build this temple is Jesus, and the way that He builds it is by being the seed, the branch, and the fruit.</p>
<p>Hence, Jesus as the seed is the branching out of God to bear fruit for our enjoyment. This seed will also bruise the head of the serpent, and in this seed shall all the nations be blessed. It is the branching out of this seed that will build God&rsquo;s temple, and it is this branch that bears the priesthood and the kingship. &ldquo;Even he shall build the temple of the Lord; and he shall bear the glory, and shall sit and rule upon his throne; and he shall be a priest upon his throne: and the counsel of peace shall be between them both&rdquo; (Zech. 6:13).</p><h2 class="head1">THE SUBJECTIVE SEED</h2>
<p>This is Jesus, and as the seed, the branch, and the fruit, He is so subjective to us. All these points are fully revealed in the Old Testament, but not merely in an objective way. Jesus as a seed is altogether subjective to us. He is the seed, and we are the earth. The seed must get into the earth subjectively. How can the seed do anything in the earth unless it is sown into the earth?</p>
<p>There is much teaching today among Christians concerning Christ in an objective way. We all know that Jesus was crucified on the cross for us, and now He is resurrected and sitting on the throne in the third heavens as the Lord of all. This is indeed right, but it is only the objective side. He must get into us. On the cross, He bruised the head of Satan, objectively, and now as the seed this bruising One is within us subjectively. When He comes into us, He flows His bruising life into us. Today, Jesus bruises Satan within us. Many times when the enemy begins to rise up within us against the building of God&rsquo;s house, this bruising life defeats him.</p>
<p>Today most of the Christian teachings are too objective. When I first came to this country, I immediately began to tell the Christians to turn to their spirit within them. Then I was asked why my teachings were always so subjective. I do not deny that there is the objective aspect. Jesus is really there in the heavens. But subjectively, He is in my spirit. Undoubtedly the electricity is in the power plant. But it is also installed in our homes. If the electricity were merely objective, we would be in darkness. If it were only in the power plant, it would not benefit us. We would have no way to apply the electricity. The application of the electricity is altogether involved with its entrance into our home. It has to be subjective.</p>
<p>If Jesus were only in the heavens, He would have nothing to do with us. But our Jesus is not only that kind of Jesus. On one hand He is in the heavens, but on the other hand He is within us. I can boldly say that my Jesus is within me. I can even boast that Jesus is within me! Jesus is within me as a seed to grow. Then He grows into a branch, and as a branch He branches God into me and bears fruit for others&rsquo; enjoyment. Hallelujah! It is this Jesus who builds God&rsquo;s temple, who builds up the church. He does it not in an objective way, but in a very subjective way, by sowing Himself into us, branching God into us, and bearing fruit for others&rsquo; enjoyment within us. This is the Jesus that is prophesied in the Old Testament.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FORTY-TWO GENERATIONS FOR DIVINE SOWING</h2>
<p>Now we come to the first page of the New Testament. &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham. So all the generations from Abraham to David are fourteen generations; and from David until the carrying away into Babylon are fourteen generations; and from the carrying away into Babylon unto Christ are fourteen generations&rdquo; (Matt. 1:1, 17). Forty-two generations are mentioned. This is quite meaningful. We have seen that Jesus is God in the Son as the divine seed to be sown into us. This sowing has not been easy. It needed forty-two generations as a preparation from Abraham through Isaac, through Israel, and through Judah, through many generations unto David, and through David&rsquo;s sons and grandsons, even through the Babylonian captivity. Then, eventually, Jesus came. It took forty-two generations for this divine sowing, for Jesus to arrive here.</p>
<p>According to many hymns, it seems that Jesus merely descended from the heavens to the earth. But it was not like that. Matthew says that it required forty-two generations. Genesis says even more. Matthew counted from Abraham, but Genesis counted from the seed of the woman. The seed was mentioned in Genesis 3, but from that day it took a long period of time for this seed to enter into human soil. This is why the birth of Jesus was not merely a birth. It was the sowing of the divine seed into the human soil.</p><h2 class="head1">JESUS AND EMMANUEL</h2>
<p>When the divine seed entered into human soil, the issue was a person who is the mingling of divinity with humanity. His name is both Jesus and Emmanuel. &ldquo;She shall bring forth a son, and thou shalt call his name Jesus: for he shall save his people from their sins. Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us&rdquo; (Matt. 1:21, 23). On the one hand, as a man, He is Jesus. But on the other hand, as God, He is Emmanuel, God with us.</p>
<p>Now we may realize what a wonderful person Jesus is! I simply do not have the utterance of what is within me, but I look to the Lord that He will reveal something to all who are reading this message. Our Jesus is such a wonderful person! This wonderful person is the mingling of divinity with humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRIST, THE SON OF GOD</h2>
<p>After Jesus as such a wonderful person had dwelt with His disciples for a period of time, He asked a question: &ldquo;Whom do men say that I the Son of man am?&rdquo; They answered, &ldquo;Some say that thou art John the Baptist: some, Elias; and others, Jeremiah, or one of the prophets.&rdquo; Then He asked, &ldquo;But whom say ye that I am?&rdquo; And Simon Peter answered, &ldquo;Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (Matt. 16:13-16).</p>
<p>This is the problem among men today. Who is Jesus? However, even to know that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God, is not so unveiling. We all have received help from Peter&rsquo;s word. Little did we know that Jesus is the branching out of divinity and the fruit of humanity that comes from the branching of divinity. We did not realize so clearly that this Jesus is the divine seed sown into us as human soil, and that we must be so subjectively one with Him. We must go on to see more of this wonderful Jesus.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JESUS IN THE MIDST</h2>
<p>After Matthew 16, Jesus goes on to reveal more concerning Himself in chapter eighteen. &ldquo;For where two or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of them&rdquo; (Matt. 18:20). In Matthew 1, the Lord&rsquo;s name is not only Jesus, but also Emmanuel, God with us. Now in Matthew 18, He promises that whenever we meet, He is in the midst. But how is He in the midst? We must realize that He is in our midst not in an objective way, but in a very subjective way. He is within us. When I come in, Jesus comes in. When you come in, He comes in. When we all come in, Jesus comes in. When we say, &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; He is amening within us and within our amen. If Jesus is not within us, and therefore not in our midst, why do we come together? We have no other reason. Jesus is here! Jesus is within us, and therefore, He is in our midst. We all come together with Jesus. When we come, He comes. That is why His name is Emmanuel, God with us.</p>
<p>Our Jesus is such a person! He is God with us. The Bible is not mainly a book for teaching and instruction, showing us how to do this and that. The Bible is a portrait showing us such a wonderful person. He is the branching out of God and the fruit of human soil. He is so subjective to us, because He has sown Himself into us, and now He is growing up within us. He is branching God into us, and He is also branching God out from us. Eventually, in this way, He will build the church as the temple of God. He sets up God&rsquo;s kingdom, and He bears the priesthood and the kingship. Hallelujah! He does it not by teaching or outward correction and adjustment, but altogether by the inward sowing, the inward branching, the inward growing, and the inward bearing of fruit. It is always inward. This is why, when we come together, He is in our midst.</p>
<h2 class="head1">WITH YOU ALL THE DAYS</h2>
<p>The first chapter of Matthew says that His name shall be called Emmanuel, God with us. In the middle of the book (18:20), He says that He will always be in our midst. Then at the end, He says that He will be with us forever. &ldquo;And lo, I am with you all the days, even unto the completion of the age&rdquo; (Matt. 28:20, Gk.). He is not only with us today, but all the days. He is with us until the completion of this age. But even the completion of this age is not the completion of His presence. He is with us now in this way. In the next age He will be with us in another wonderful way. His being with us could never be terminated. Hallelujah! This is because He is Emmanuel, God with us.</p>
<p>For God to be with us does not mean that we are sitting around Him, and He is among us in our midst. Emmanuel means that this divine seed has been sown into us. Divinity Himself has been sown into us. Divinity is the seed, and humanity is the soil. This divinity must then be wrought into the human soil, and some of the element of the human soil must be brought into the divine element. Eventually we will see that what is brought forth by this mingling of divinity with humanity is the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LOVABLE JESUS</h2>
<p>Hallelujah for such a wonderful person! Don&rsquo;t you love Him? I love Him. Since I was a little boy, I learned to sing that little hymn, &ldquo;Jesus Loves Me, This I Know, For the Bible Tells Me So.&rdquo; At that time I was taught to love Him because He died for me. That is good, but we must not merely love Him because He died for us. That is not sufficient. Oh, we love Him because He is so lovable! If He would throw me into hell, I would still love Him, because He is altogether lovely. I care more for what He is! I just love this person.</p>
<p>If we love Jesus merely because He has done so many things for us, our love is imperfect. I have heard many stories of wives loving their husbands because they had money. But once their husbands lost their money, the love was gone. Why do we love Jesus? It is not only because of what He has done, but more because of what He is. Hallelujah! He is wonderful! He is far, far beyond our description.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WONDERFUL PERSON</h2>
<p>I hope that you will pray-read all the above verses that you may see all the things He is. He is the seed of the woman that bruised the head of the serpent. He is the seed of Abraham that all the nations may obtain the blessing. And He is the branch, branching out God into us. This branch, then, even mingles with us to produce the fruit. He is in us, and we are in Him. He and we become one people. Where I am, there He is. I simply cannot get away from Him. He is such a wonderful person. Then when we all come together, He is there; and we become the church with Him. It is really wonderful.</p>
<p>Eventually it is difficult to say who we are. We are parts of this wonderful person. And this wonderful person is not only within us, but growing in us, branching in us, bearing fruit in us, and causing us all to be the church. Isn&rsquo;t this wonderful!</p>
<p>And He is our righteousness. It is not a matter of behavior, because it is not our righteousness. He Himself as such a subjective One in us becomes our righteousness. Martin Luther fought for the doctrine of justification by faith, but today we do not need to fight for the doctrines. Jesus is the reality of all the doctrines. When we have Him, we have everything, including righteousness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CORPORATE CHRIST</h2>
<p>Therefore, if you would ask me who I am, I would at least say that I am part of Christ. In Philippians 1:21, Paul said, &ldquo;For to me to live is Christ!&rdquo; And he said in Galatians 2:20, &ldquo;I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.&rdquo; Hallelujah! We are the corporate Christ. Any seed is not only for that seed itself. It is for multiplication and reproduction. Now Jesus is no longer just a seed. We are now His reproduction and multiplication. So we are the corporate Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE ALL-INCLUSIVE BREAD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 7:14; 9:6; 32:2; 40:5, 9; 53:2; Matt. 1:20b; John 1:1, 14; 14:10; 6:53, 57, 63</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Since the fall of man, Christ began to be revealed in a very strange and wonderful way. In Genesis 3:15, immediately after the fall, He is revealed as the seed of a woman. Then He is later revealed as the root, which, as we know, issues from the seed. Moreover, He is further revealed as the branch. He is the seed, the root, and the branch. Fourthly, out of the branch, He is revealed as the fruit. Any kind of fruit, according to God&rsquo;s economy, is for man&rsquo;s enjoyment. We do not enjoy the seed, the root, or the branch directly, but the fruit. Our Christ is the seed, the root, the branch, and the fruit!</p>
<p>We need to know all the verses that tell us of this divine revelation. The seed is in Genesis 3:15. The root is found in Isaiah 11:10. Here we see that Christ is the root of Jesse. Isaiah 53:2 tells us further that Christ is a root out of dry ground. Then there are several verses concerning Christ as the branch. Isaiah 4:2 declares Jesus as the branch of the Lord. He is the branching out of Jehovah! Then Jeremiah 23:5 tells us that out of David God will raise up a branch. This is the branch of man. Christ is not only the branch of God, but also the branch of David. He is not only the branching out of God, but also the branching out of a proper man. Isaiah 11:1 says that Christ is the branch of Jesse. He is the branch of David because Jesse is the father of David. The fourth verse concerning Christ as the branch is Zechariah 6:12. Here we see the man whose name is The Branch. In this universe there is a man who is called The Branch. He is the seed, the root, and the branch.</p>
<p>The verse which speaks of Christ as the fruit is Isaiah 4:2. Here it says that Christ is the branch of Jehovah and the fruit of the earth. It speaks of the birth of Christ and the humanity of Christ. According to His divinity He is the branching out of God, and according to His humanity He is the fruit that comes out of the earth. Earth here represents humanity. When God branches out into humanity as the earth, He brings forth fruit. This is the food for us, food which infuses very much into us. Jesus is the most delicious fruit for man to enjoy. He is the food for man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEED PLUS THE SOIL</h2>
<p>In John 6, Jesus is presented as the bread of life. But we must realize that the bread comes from the grains. If there are no grains ground into fine flour, there is no bread. The bread issues from the grains, and the grains come from the seed. Moreover, no seed can grow by itself. For the growth, the seed needs the soil. Sometimes I boast to the Lord, &ldquo;Lord, You cannot grow without me.&rdquo; Certainly, I need the Lord, but He also needs me. Without the Lord I am poor soil. I can grow nothing, and eventually I become a desert. I do need the Lord as the seed. He is the wonderful, heavenly, divine seed. But the seed also needs me as the soil. Praise the Lord that He is the seed, and we are the soil.</p>
<p>Genesis tells us that God made man out of the ground. Man is the earth. We don&rsquo;t like the earth, but God likes it. Humanity as the earth is sweet to God. He needs man as the soil. The seed without the soil can produce no bread. Bread requires the seed plus the soil. This seed is not merely added to the soil, but mingled with the soil. When a seed is planted, it stretches out its element into the ground, and at the same time absorbs some element of the ground into itself. This is the mingling of the seed with the soil which brings the growth. The growth is just the mingling of divinity with humanity. Jesus is not only divine; neither is He merely human. Jesus is both divine and human. He is the mingling of divinity with humanity.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD BECOMING FLESH</h2>
<p>&ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (John 1:1). But this is not all. It is wonderful, but we should not stop here. We must go on to John 1:14. &ldquo;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth&rdquo; (Gk.). The Word became flesh. This means that God became something else. He was God, but at a certain time He became something else. Have you ever considered that God became something else? Our God today is no longer merely God. If some Jewish friends were here, I would tell them that they lack something. They only have God, but we have God become flesh. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>The term &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; in our thinking is not good. But here in John 1:14, the word &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; is really glorious. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God, and the Word became flesh. That means that God became flesh. It is only by His becoming flesh that He could tabernacle among man. This is the mingling of divinity with humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FULL OF GRACE</h2>
<p>When God became flesh and tabernacled among man, He came full of something. He did not come full of teachings and doctrines, regulations and forms. Neither did He come full of religion. No, God became flesh and tabernacled among us full of grace and reality. What is grace? Some Christians think that if we have a good car, that is really God&rsquo;s grace. Then they give a testimony thanking the Lord for His grace. Others think that a good wife or a good family is God&rsquo;s grace. But that is not grace. Grace is God Himself given to us freely for our enjoyment. This is grace.</p>
<p>But for God to give Himself to us is not so simple. It does not mean that one day God came down from heaven and said to man, &ldquo;I give Myself to you.&rdquo; If He were to do that, we would be extremely fearful, and we would dare not contact Him. His glory would consume us. But, praise the Lord, all His burning glory was concealed in the flesh. He came to us in exactly the same form as we are. And He came to us in this way to such an extent that it was difficult to recognize or discern that He was God. This is why the Pharisees had such a problem with Him. They wondered how He could be God. Was He not a poor man from Nazareth? Did they not know His mother, His brothers, and His sisters? He was a poor man, from a poor country, from a little town called Nazareth. How could He be God? But He was God. He was the Word become flesh. He was God in such a humble human form.</p>
<p>It is for this reason that Isaiah 9:6 is such a precious verse to us. &ldquo;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulders: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The eternal Father, The Prince of Peace.&rdquo; A child is born unto us, but His name is not called a wonderful man. His name is called The Mighty God. And a son is given to us, and His name is called The Eternal Father. Is He the Son or the Father? Is He the child or the mighty God? Now we are clear. He is both a child and the mighty God. He is both the Son and the Father. That little child born in a manger at Bethlehem was the Mighty God. The Jewish people believe in God, but they do not believe that child born in a manger at Bethlehem was God.</p>
<p>But we believe! Hallelujah! That little child was God. He was not God in divine form, but He was God taking a human form. His purpose in doing this was that He might be sown into mankind. He took man as the soil to produce something for our enjoyment. Hence, the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us, full of grace (enjoyment) and reality. He came full of the riches of divinity for us to enjoy. This is grace.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROCESSED JESUS</h2>
<p>Now we must see that for God to be our enjoyment, there was the need of the process of incarnation. If God was not incarnated, He could never have been our food. When Jesus said that He was the bread of life, He was already processed. He was God who was processed to become flesh. The second step of the process was after He had become flesh: He became the life-giving Spirit. As God, He became flesh. Then as the flesh, He became the life-giving Spirit. &ldquo;The last Adam was made a life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:45b). Jesus as God became flesh, and as the flesh, He became the life-giving Spirit. Can you see the process?</p>
<p>This is why we say that our Jesus is a &ldquo;processed&rdquo; God. Our God today is not a &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God. He is fully processed. Now He is on the &ldquo;dining table&rdquo; for us to eat. All good food is processed food. The cooking is a process. Praise the Lord that He passed through all the &ldquo;cooking&rdquo;! Now He is on the table. Everything is ready. We only need to come and dine.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRISTOLOGY</h2>
<p>Our Jesus is indeed wonderful. He is the seed, the root, the branch, the fruit, and the bread for eating. In the theology of today&rsquo;s Christianity, there are many studies concerning Christology. This is the study of who Christ is. Throughout all the centuries, there have been many disputations regarding the person of Christ. All the different concepts have caused great division. Some have said that Christ was only divine, without any humanity. There were some so-called Christians even in the first century who did not believe that Christ was man as well as God. They could not believe that Christ as God became flesh. Some others believed that Christ was merely human, without any divinity. Church history shows us that in the first four or five centuries there was much dispute among the great teachers of Christianity concerning the person of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL IN ALL</h2>
<p>The Bible gives us an all-inclusive revelation of Christ. Christ is not only one thing, neither a few things. Christ is everything! He is all in all. He is the Father, He is the Son, and He is the Spirit. I realize that this offends the theology of Christianity, but I have some verses from the pure Word as the ground to say this. We have already read Isaiah 9:6, which clearly says that a Son is given to us, yet His name is called the Eternal Father. Is He the Son or the Father? It is so clear that He is not only the Son, but also the Father.</p>
<p>In John 14, Philip said, &ldquo;Lord show us the Father, and it will satisfy us&rdquo; (v. 8). His request really surprised the Lord. &ldquo;Jesus saith unto him, Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me, Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, show us the Father?&rdquo; (v. 9). It is just as if someone came to Brother Benson this morning and said, &ldquo;Brother Benson, please show us Benson Phillips and we&rsquo;ll be satisfied.&rdquo; But if you have seen Brother Benson, you have seen Benson Phillips. The Lord said to Philip, &ldquo;Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works&rdquo; (v. 10). The Lord was saying, I speak, but the Father works. It is equivalent to saying that Brother Benson speaks, and Benson Phillips works. This simply proves that Brother Benson and Benson Phillips are one. It is the same with the Son and the Father. For the Son to speak and the Father to work means that the Son and the Father are one. From these verses we see that Christ is both the Son and the Father.</p>
<p>Now we must look at the verses which show us that Christ is also the Spirit. We have already read 1 Corinthians 15:45b which says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. We must also read 2 Corinthians 3:17. &ldquo;Now the Lord is that Spirit.&rdquo; These verses tell us clearly that the Lord Jesus is now the Spirit. After His death and resurrection, He has become the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>I realize that there are some who will argue with me by asking, &ldquo;If the Son is the Father, how then could the Son pray to the Father?&rdquo; But this is just mental analysis. We have already seen in Isaiah 9:6 that a child is born to us and His name is called the mighty God. This means that He is the mighty God. Then Isaiah 40:9 says, &ldquo;O Jerusalem, that bringest good tidings, lift up thy voice with strength; lift it up, be not afraid; say unto the cities of Judah, Behold your God!&rdquo; All Bible students agree that this verse speaks of Christ. When Christ comes there will be the announcement and declaration, &ldquo;Behold your God!&rdquo; It is clear that the coming Christ is God. Then Isaiah 53:2 tells us that Christ shall grow up in the presence of God. If He is God, how can He grow in the presence of God?</p>
<p>Moreover, Isaiah 32:2 says, &ldquo;And a man shall be as an hiding place from the wind, and a covert from the tempest; as rivers of water in a dry place, as the shadow of a great rock in a weary land.&rdquo; How can a man be rivers of water in a dry place? It is because this man is also God. In our mental concept we think that if He is God, He is God; if He is man, then He is man. To say that He is both God and man is not reasonable or logical. But this is why Jesus is wonderful. He is all in all. He is everything. You can never analyze Him according to logic or reason.</p><h2 class="head1">A HYBRID</h2>
<p>There is a word which I do not like to use, but for lack of a better one I will use it. That is, a hybrid. Jesus is a hybrid. A hybrid, we know, is two things grown into one. When a branch of an apple tree is grafted into a peach tree, the fruit produced from that branch will be a hybrid. It looks like an apple, and it also looks somewhat like a peach. Which is it, an apple or a peach? We have to say that it is an apple-peach or a peach-apple. It is both! It is the same with Jesus. Is He God or is He man? He is both. He is the God-man, and the man-God. We should never use our limited, mental capability to try to analyze Jesus. This is the problem with so-called theology today.</p>
<p>How could Jesus be the root and also the branch? To our thinking it is illogical. If you are the root, you are the root. If you are the branch, you are the branch. How can someone be both the root and the branch simultaneously? Yet we must remember that Jesus is everything. He is not only the seed, but also the root. He is also the branch and the fruit. In the same principle, He is not only the Father, but also the Son. And He is not only the Son, but also the Spirit. He is everything! If you have Jesus, you have the seed, the root, the branch, and the fruit. And this is not all! If you have Jesus, you have the Father, you have the Son, and you have the Spirit! Jesus is all in all! He is truly wonderful.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BREAD OF LIFE</h2>
<p>In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God. And this Word became flesh. Now, as the Word become flesh, He is not only the Son, but also the Father. And He is also the Spirit. Such a One comes and presents Himself to us as bread. He said in John 6:35, &ldquo;I am the bread of life.&rdquo; We can realize now that this bread is not so simple. He is full of ingredients. All kinds of divine and human elements are in this bread. And this bread is fully processed and cooked. It is ready for eating.</p>
<p>When I was a child, I was taught much concerning Jesus coming and dying on the cross for us. This is right, but if you stop here, it is very superficial. Jesus passed through death and resurrection not only to redeem us, but also to put Himself into us. So again I say that Jesus must be so subjective to us. He said that He was our bread of life. Could any food be our nourishment if that food remains objective to us? As long as it remains on the shelf or in the refrigerator, however much we love it, it has nothing to do with us. But though we hate it, as long as we eat it, we have it, and it is being wrought into our being.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SUBJECTIVE FOOD</h2>
<p>It is for this reason that Jesus presented Himself to us as food. Nothing is so subjective to us as food. Eventually the food becomes so subjective to us that it becomes one with us. We all know the saying that says we are what we eat. Everything we eat becomes us. The chicken, oranges, apples, and meat that we eat become us. We are the composition of all that we eat. Our weight at birth was about seven pounds. But now we may weigh one hundred and seventy pounds. All the varieties of food that we ate added the weight, not in an objective way, but in a very subjective way. The food was swallowed, digested, and assimilated. It became our cells and our tissues. Hence, we are simply a composition of what we eat.</p>
<p>Now we can understand why Jesus said, &ldquo;As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father; so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me&rdquo; (John 6:57). It is only by eating Jesus that we can live by Jesus. He is the all-inclusive bread. When this all-inclusive bread enters into us, it becomes so subjective to us and even becomes us. This is absolutely not a religion. Religion merely teaches others to serve God in an outward objective way. This is not God&rsquo;s economy, and this is not God&rsquo;s divine purpose. God&rsquo;s economy is that this Jesus should enter into us to become our very being. He will come into us and grow in us and transform us into something different. Then we will be shining with Jesus! This is the branching out of Jesus!</p>
<p>Teachings, doctrines, instructions, degrees will not help us. We can talk about a chicken, study it, and know everything about it, but unless we take the chicken into us, it does us absolutely no good. The Bible does not reveal to us merely an objective Christ. There is the objective aspect, but the Bible reveals more of the subjective aspect. This is why Jesus said that He is our food. Nothing could be so subjective to us as food, for it becomes us. Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the bread of life. He that eats me shall live by me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>If I did not eat breakfast this morning, it would be difficult for me to speak here. But since I ate that breakfast, I am now living by what I ate. This is why I am so energetic. Likewise, if we eat Jesus, we will live by Jesus. Jesus is the all-inclusive meal. He is whatever we need. He is full of the finest ingredients. This is why He is the all-inclusive food. He is not simple bread; He is all-inclusive bread. In this bread are all the attributes of divinity and all the virtues of humanity. What a bread He is to us!</p>
<p>No words can tell what Jesus is in a full way. We can never exhaust telling what He is. He is truly marvelous! He is both God and man. He is the One that prays, and He is also the One that answers. He is the One that sows the seed, and He is also the One that grows. He is the small root, and He is also the branch. He is the root that came out of the dry ground, and He is also a tender plant. He is the seed, the root, the branch, and the fruit. Now He presents Himself to us as the bread of life. If we eat Him, we will live by Him. All the divine, spiritual ingredients are in Him. Hallelujah for such a Jesus!</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE BRIDEGROOM<br />
COMING FOR THE BRIDE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 9:15; 25:1, 6; 28:19-20; John 3:29; 14:17-20; 15:5; Gal. 3:27; 1 Cor. 12:13</h1>
<p>In the past two chapters we have seen some exhaustless matters concerning Christ. This is why we have four Gospels, or four biographies, to tell us who Christ is, and what kind of person He is. The first Gospel is by Matthew, and the last is by John. In this message we will not cover anything from the Gospels of Mark and Luke, but we will look a little into the first and last Gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN THE BEGINNING</h2>
<p>The Scriptures are the breathing out of God. Furthermore, we must realize that not only the composition of the Scriptures is God&rsquo;s breathing, but also the arrangement of the books. For Matthew to be first and John last is very meaningful. Every book in the Scriptures opens in a particular way. For instance, Genesis commences with &ldquo;In the beginning, God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; However, Matthew opens another way: &ldquo;The book of the generation of Jesus Christ, the son of David, the son of Abraham&rdquo; (Matt. 1:1). John opens with: &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (John 1:1). Matthew says that Jesus was the son of David and the son of Abraham. That is, He was the son of some human being. But John tells us that Jesus Christ was the One from the beginning. Matthew started from Abraham, and then David, and then Jesus Christ. This is easy to understand. But John says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Matthew goes back, and John comes forth. Matthew goes back from Jesus to David and then to Abraham, whereas John comes forth from the beginning.</p>
<p>When was the beginning? Many Christians today like to study the Bible, but not one can tell us when the beginning started. We all desire to know the Bible. I began to study the Bible fifty years ago because I loved the Lord. Once when I was reading the Bible, I came to John 1:1. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word.&rdquo; Immediately my young mentality attempted to understand. What is the beginning? I looked into a concordance. It referred me to Genesis 1:1. There I read, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; I still could not understand. So it is better not to be too concerned about our understanding. Rather, we should pray-read the Word: &ldquo;In the beginning...Amen Lord. In the beginning was the Word. Amen! O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; This is the best way to receive God&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<p>After trying to understand the beginning, I tried to understand what the Word is. It was very difficult for me. Furthermore, it said that the Word was with God. Immediately I was clear. There were two, the Word and God. But then it continued by saying that the Word was God. Then I asked, Are there one or two?</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT TO UNDERSTAND, BUT TO ENJOY</h2>
<p>Do you think that you can understand the Bible? I can tell you that you do not even understand yourself. Do you know how many hearts you have? You have two hearts. One is your physical heart, and the other is your psychological heart. Jeremiah 17:9 says, &ldquo;The heart is deceitful above all things, and desperately wicked: who can know it?&rdquo; I would tell Jeremiah that my heart is in good condition. I have just had a medical examination. But this is not what Jeremiah means. He is not talking about the physical heart, but the psychological heart. It is this that is corrupted. You see, you do not understand yourself. Tell me, where is our heart, and where is our conscience? We cannot say. So we really do not understand ourselves well.</p>
<p>In a much greater way, the Bible is far beyond our understanding. But the Bible is like food. We may not understand it, but we can eat it. In the Far East, they do not have what you call in this country &ldquo;grapefruit.&rdquo; When I first heard this term, I simply did not understand. Then I thought that it must mean some kind of fruit of the grape. One day, however, I ate some grapefruit. Then I realized that it was not something of the grape. I really did not know what it was, but I ate it and enjoyed it! Even today, my mind does not fully comprehend it, but my body benefits from it.</p>
<p>The same principle applies to the reading of the Bible. It is not so much to be understood as it is to be enjoyed. When we open to John 1:1, we should not try merely to understand it, but rather enjoy it by pray-reading. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word. Amen. O Lord Jesus. In the beginning, Amen, was the Word, Amen. And the Word was with God. Oh, the Word, Amen, the Word was with God. Hallelujah! And the Word was God! Amen, the Word was God. Oh, the Word was with God, and the Word was God. Amen! Hallelujah!&rdquo; When we take the Bible in this way, it is similar to our eating of food. We may not understand much, but we really enjoy something. And we will be nourished within.</p><h2 class="head1">ALL-INCLUSIVE</h2>
<p>If we try to understand Matthew and John with our limited mentality, we will only be confused. Matthew wrote a book about Christ in which he tells us that He is the son of David and the son of Abraham. But John tells us that He is the Word, and the Word is God. John makes it clear that He is the Son of God. So what is He? Is He the son of David, or the Son of God? Praise the Lord! He is all-inclusive. We cannot analyze, and we cannot systematize Christ. There is no <em>-ology</em> with Him. There is just the pure Word. We should learn not to analyze, but to simply take the true Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LAMB AND THE BRIDEGROOM</h2>
<p>Matthew goes back to Abraham, but John starts from the beginning. Before the foundation of the world, before creation, the Word was there. And the Word was God! Then one day, this Word who was God became something else. &ldquo;And the Word became flesh&rdquo; (John 1:14). He became flesh to dwell among us full of grace and reality. He is a wonderful person! Then John continues by telling us that He is the Lamb of God. &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world&rdquo; (John 1:29). Following that, in chapter three, he tells us that Jesus is the bridegroom. &ldquo;He that hath the bride is the bridegroom&rdquo; (John 3:29).</p>
<p>Jesus is so wonderful! He is not only the Lamb, but also the Bridegroom. He has many aspects. For redemption, He is the Lamb. Mankind is fallen, and full of sin. Therefore, He must be the Lamb to take away the sin of the world. But He is the Bridegroom for the marriage. Redemption is not the goal; redemption is just the procedure. Marriage is the goal! In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was God. Then the Word became flesh. So He is the Word, God and then the flesh. And the flesh is the Lamb. He must be the flesh to shed His blood as the redeeming Lamb. And He is also the Bridegroom.</p>
<p>In just the first three chapters of John we see that He is five things: the Word, God, the flesh, the Lamb, and the Bridegroom. He is so much. As the Word and God He became flesh. This means He became a man, a human being. Then this human being is the Lamb of God to redeem man. Hallelujah! But this is not all. He is also the universal Bridegroom. In the whole universe, the most pleasant person is Jesus as the Bridegroom. John the Baptist tells us that He that has the Bride is the Bridegroom. So He comes for the Bride.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SO MANY THINGS</h2>
<p>Then in the following chapters of John we are told that He is the bread of life. Moreover, in John 10 we are told that He is the door, not the door to heaven, but the door out of religion! God&rsquo;s people in John, chapter ten, were confined in the Jewish religion, and Jesus came to be the door that they might come out. He took the lead to come out of that Jewish religion. Peter followed, John followed, and the blind man of John 9 came out also. Eventually, even Saul of Tarsus followed. He came out of that religion. Jesus is the door out of religion! This is still true today. Jesus is the door for religion, not for people to enter, but for them to leave. Then, when we come out of religion, He is our Shepherd. And under His shepherding, He is our green pasture. We read furthermore that He is the life, the truth, and the way. He is the light, and even the living air for us to breathe. He is so many things!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPIRIT OF REALITY</h2>
<p>John in his Gospel makes us clear that for Jesus to be so many things to us He must become the Spirit. In chapter fourteen the Lord says, &ldquo;And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you forever; even the Spirit of truth; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you. I will not leave you as orphans. I am coming to you. Yet a little while, and the world seeth me no more; but ye see me: because I live, ye shall live also. At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you&rdquo; (John 14:16-20).</p>
<p>He said that He would ask the Father to send us another comforter. But we should not consider this other comforter as another one besides Himself. No, this comforter is the Lord as the Spirit of reality. This is why He told the disciples that He was not going to leave them. He was coming to them. His going away for three days was for His coming. Those three days would be a kind of process to transform Him through death and resurrection into the Spirit. After the resurrection, the Lord came back to the disciples. He had been fully processed through crucifixion, burial, and resurrection. Now He is not merely God; neither is He only God in the flesh. Now He is God in the flesh crucified, buried and resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Now it is so easy to take Him in. This is why we read in John 20:22, &ldquo;And when he had said this, he breathed into them, and saith unto them, Receive ye the Holy Spirit.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIVING AIR</h2>
<p>As the Spirit, He is so available that we may breathe Him in, and we may receive Him so easily. Then how do we breathe? The Bible says in Romans 10:12 that the Lord is rich unto all that call upon His name. So the way to breathe Him in is to call on Him: &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; This is why, whenever there is a person who will call on the name of the Lord Jesus, something happens. If you too will only call on His name, you will never be the same. It is not that you decide to correct yourself, but something happens within you, and you have some change. Sometimes the change occurs immediately. Sometimes it comes after a few hours or a few days. This is not a religion, and it is not something psychological. This is Jesus! When you call on His name to breathe Him in, He comes as a living Person into you. If the electrical waves in the air are real, Jesus is more real. Today, on the entire earth, Jesus as the life-giving Spirit is so real. Whenever a person anywhere on the earth says, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; he breathes in the living air. This is our wonderful Jesus!</p>
<p>Some may ask, &ldquo;Is not Jesus in heaven?&rdquo; Yes He is. But we must all know that the Jesus who is on the throne in the third heavens at the right hand of God is now so real as the Spirit on the earth. He is omnipresent. We cannot limit His location. He is everywhere, just like the air. And He is as available as the air to us. Right now, wherever we are, if we will call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; something will happen, and we will get something. And this something can never be rejected by us. Hallelujah! Jesus is so real, so living, and so available.</p>
<p>We have seen in the Gospel of John that in the beginning He was the Word who was God. Then He became flesh to be the Lamb of God to bear the sins of the world. And this He did. He accomplished redemption on the cross almost two thousand years ago. But that was not His ultimate purpose. His ultimate purpose was to get the bride. Yes, He did come to save us as sinners, but that was not His goal. His goal was the bride.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE FIRST PRINCIPLE OF THE BRIDE</h2>
<p>According to the Bible, the first mentioning of anything sets up a principle. The first mentioning of marriage is in Genesis 2. Here we have the marriage between Adam and Eve, and the first principle concerning the bride. It is so clear in this portion of the Word that the bride must come out of the groom. Eve was made with something taken out of Adam. A rib was taken from him; that was her source. With that rib, God builded a woman. Then this woman went back to Adam, and they two became one. This is the principle of the bride.</p>
<p>How then can Christ as the last Adam obtain His bride? When God created Adam, He brought all the animals to him. Adam looked at them and even named them, but he could not find his counterpart. Not one could match him. Not one was in his image. Then God put Adam to sleep, and out of his side He took a rib and builded a woman. Then when Adam awoke he looked at the woman and it seemed that he said, &ldquo;This is my counterpart. She is something out of me. She has my nature, she has my life, and she also bears my likeness.&rdquo; Now Adam was complete. Without Eve, he was only a half. When the two halves were put together, there was a whole. If as a man you don&rsquo;t have a wife, you are not complete. You are just a half. You need a wife to match you. A horse cannot match you; a bird cannot match you. It must be someone from the same origin as you are, having the same life and nature that you have. This is a principle.</p>
<p>Do you think that by our natural life we could be the other half of Christ? I cannot match Christ, and you cannot either. Then how will Christ get His bride? It must be something out of Him. We know that when He went to the cross, His side was broken, and out came blood and water: blood for redemption, and water for imparting life. It was through this that something out of Christ came into us. And it is by this element within us that God will build us up to be the bride of Christ. Something of Christ has come into us to make us His bride. We are one thing, but by Christ coming into us, we are made something else. Hallelujah! We all have something within us that has come out of Christ, and it is by this that we will be builded up and return to Christ as His bride.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BUILDING OF THE BRIDE</h2>
<p>How can Christ come into us? He died on the cross for our sins and shed His blood. Then He was resurrected, and by resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). This life-giving Spirit is symbolized by the water. In typology in the Old Testament, the living water came out of the cleft rock. Today Christ is the cleft rock. Out of Him has come the living water, the Spirit which is just Himself. When we believe in Him and call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus,&rdquo; whether we understand justification or not, we are justified. Now Christ as the Spirit has come into us, not as a power or an influence, but as a living person. Now we are not only saved, but also regenerated. And this living person in us will make us the bride. It is a mystery. But this is what the Bible tells us.</p>
<p>The ultimate consummation of the Bible is a bride. The New Jerusalem, in Revelation 21 and 22, is called the wife of the Lamb. The Bible closes with the bride of the Lamb of God.</p>
<p>Today, Christ is working within us in the churches to build His bride. This is His ultimate purpose. This may be new to you. Some of these terms and even this whole concept may be strange to you. But don&rsquo;t be bothered by this. Many specific points of God&rsquo;s revelation have been missed by Christians. Today, in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, He is recovering all of these things. He is opening all the mysteries to us. All these truths are based upon the pure Word.</p>
<p>Now, I believe, we are all clear about the Gospel of John. In the beginning, Christ was the Word who was God, and this Word became flesh to be the Lamb of God. Then, on the cross, He took away our sins, and by resurrection and in resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. When we believe in Him and call on His name, our sins are forgiven and He Himself comes into us. By His life working within us, He will build His bride. This is why He is eventually revealed in the book of John as the Holy Breath. (The Greek word for spirit and breath are the same.) After His resurrection He came back to His disciples to breathe upon them and said, &ldquo;Receive ye the Holy Breath&rdquo; (John 20:22). This is all made clear to us in John&rsquo;s Gospel.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BRIDEGROOM</h2>
<p>Now we must return to Matthew. Matthew tells us that Jesus is the son of David and the son of Abraham. John starts from the beginning. But regardless of how John starts, or from whom Matthew begins, eventually they both tell us nearly the same thing. Matthew also tells us that Jesus is the Bridegroom. &ldquo;And Jesus said unto them, Can the children of the bridechamber mourn, as long as the bridegroom is with them?&rdquo; (Matt. 9:15). The disciples of John the Baptist came to Jesus to ask Him about religion. But Jesus told them that He was the Bridegroom, caring nothing for religion.</p>
<p>Then in Matthew 25, He tells us that He will come back as the Bridegroom. &ldquo;Then shall the kingdom of heaven be likened unto ten virgins which took their lamps, and went forth to meet the bridegroom. And at midnight there was a cry made, Behold, the bridegroom cometh; go ye out to meet him&rdquo; (Matt. 25:1, 6).</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO ASPECTS</h2>
<p>However, Matthew still differs somewhat from John. John tells us that the Bridegroom will come into us to make us His bride. But Matthew says that the bride must be put into Him. The Gospel of John closes with Jesus coming as the life-giving Spirit in resurrection to come into His bride. But Matthew closes with Jesus coming after His resurrection to tell His disciples to baptize people into Himself. &ldquo;Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19, Gk.).</p>
<p>Have you seen these two aspects? One aspect is that Christ comes into us. The other is that we are baptized into Him. It is so wonderful that we have one verse that covers both aspects: &ldquo;For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 12:13, Gk.). On one hand we have been put into the Spirit, and on the other hand we must drink the Spirit into us. Eventually, it is rather difficult to say who is in whom. This is why Jesus said in John 14:20, &ldquo;At that day [the day of resurrection] ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST</h2>
<p>In the translation of Matthew 28:19, there is a real problem. The King James Version says, &ldquo;baptizing them in the name.&rdquo; So many Christians think that this means to baptize others in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. And as they are baptizing them they say, &ldquo;I now baptize you in the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; But the Greek word for the preposition &ldquo;in&rdquo; is &ldquo;into.&rdquo; It is the same Greek preposition used in Galatians 3:27, where it is properly translated by the King James Version. &ldquo;For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; It is just like the water into which we are baptized. When we are baptized into the water, we are put into the water. So the real baptism is to put people into the Triune God, with the water as a symbol. Whenever we baptize others, we should not do it in a formal way. We need to exercise our faith that we are putting them into the Triune God. As they have believed in the Lord Jesus and called on His name, we baptize them into Him as the Spirit. It is not a formality; it is a reality. &ldquo;For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; Then after we have been baptized into Him, we must drink of Him. We all need to drink of the one Spirit. So eventually we are in Him, and He is in us.</p>
<p>This is the two Gospels of Matthew and John. John concludes with the fact that Jesus gets into us. Matthew ends with the fact that we are put into Jesus. Hallelujah! We all have been baptized into Him, and now we all are drinking of Him as the Spirit. He is such a wonderful person, yet He is so one with us. May the Lord remove all the veils from our background and from our concepts that we may see the vision from the pure Word. In these two Gospels it is so clear that the main purpose of the gospel is for Christ to be the Bridegroom to obtain His bride. He is the wonderful Bridegroom, and He is everything to us that we might become His bride as His counterpart for eternity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE PRODUCING OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 2:19-23; 3:15; 4:1, 3, 4, 12-16; 11:19, 25-30; 12:6, 8, 19-20, 41b, 42b; 13:55-57; 16:18; 18:17; 21:42; 28:19</h1>
<p>The Scriptures are a record of a wonderful person. I believe that in the past three messages, we have seen what a wonderful person the Lord Jesus is. This wonderful person is for the producing of the church, and eventually He becomes the Head of this entity. He is the Head, and the church is the Body. This is what is called in the New Testament, the New Man. This New Man is the Body of Christ. Before producing the church, He was the individual Christ, but after producing the church, this wonderful person becomes the Body-Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DEPTHS OF JESUS</h2>
<p>Christians have seen that the Lord Jesus was incarnated to be a man. And they have seen that He died on the cross for our sins, was buried, resurrected, and is now in the third heavens at the right hand of God. Moreover, they believe that He is coming again. All of these things are true, but they are very elementary.</p>
<p>For example, on the outside of a man we see his nose, his ears, his eyes, and his mouth. We see his two shoulders, his arms, and his hands. It is easy to speak about all of these things. But this is not the real person. This is just the framework, the superficial exterior and structure of his being. His real person is something else. To see his exterior framework is easy, but it is not so easy to know what is inside of him.</p>
<p>In the same way, we should not think that it is easy to know the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus said in the Gospel of Matthew that only the Father knows the Son. &ldquo;All things are delivered unto me of my Father: and no man knows the Son, but the Father; neither knoweth any man the Father, save the Son, and he to whomsoever the Son will reveal him&rdquo; (Matt. 11:27). Only the Father knows the Son, and only the Son knows the Father. It is not easy to know Jesus in a deep way.</p>
<p>What is really in Jesus? This is a vast, deep, unsearchable, immeasurable, and unlimited ocean. But we do have some terms in the Bible. In the one book of the Gospel of Matthew, there are many terms regarding Christ. However, I am afraid that most Christians read this Gospel with colored glasses. They read it according to the traditional knowledge that they have received from the past. Not many have seen that Jesus is the greater Solomon, the greater Jonah, and even the greater temple.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DIFFERENT NAMES OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew, there are many names attributed to Christ. Of course, the first is Emmanuel, God with us. We have seen something about this in the previous messages. Moreover, He is not only the son of David and the son of Abraham; he is also called the carpenter&rsquo;s son. &ldquo;Is not this the carpenter&rsquo;s son?&rdquo; (Matt. 13:55). He is also called the greater temple (Matt. 12:6), the greater Jonah (Matt. 12:41), and the greater Solomon (Matt. 12:42), the Lord of the Sabbath (Matt. 12:8), the great light (Matt. 4:16), and the stone rejected by the builders (Matt. 21:42).</p>
<p>He was also ascribed with some bad names. Did you know that Jesus was called a gluttonous man and a wine-bibber? He was also called the friend of sinners. We like to hear this now, but it was not good in those days. &ldquo;The Son of man came eating and drinking, and they say, Behold a man gluttonous, and a wine-bibber, a friend of publicans and sinners&rdquo; (Matt. 11:19). Jesus had all kinds of poor names. He would eat anywhere with anyone, especially with publicans and sinners. He did this because His sole purpose was to dispense Himself into man. Regardless of whether they were a sinner, a publican, or a Pharisee, He did whatever He could to impart Himself to them. He was not for eating. His eating gave Him the opportunity to impart Himself into a publican by the name of Matthew. It seems that Matthew invited Jesus to come and eat with him, and He went. The Pharisees condemned Him for it, but Jesus did not care. By His eating, Matthew was fully caught, and in time one of the foremost publicans became one of the foremost disciples.</p>
<p>Jesus was not legal or religious. He was very flexible. As long as He could dispense Himself into someone, He did not care what He had to do. If it was eating, He would eat. Whatever Jesus was, and whatever He was called was only for the purpose of dispensing Himself in God&rsquo;s chosen people, that they might be converted and transformed into His Body, the church. His only purpose was to produce the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO BUILD THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Eventually in the Gospel of Matthew, He says, &ldquo;I will build my church.&rdquo; &ldquo;And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). What is the way to build the church? It is by Jesus getting into you and me. To build the church is not simply to bring people to the Lord, that they may obtain some kind of church membership. No, to build the church is to dispense Christ into people. Then, once Christ is in us, He will transform us from our natural being into something else. Old things will pass away, and all things will become new. We are transformed from our old being into something new. Then we are part of the New Man, the church. Whatever Jesus did and whatever He was called were for the purpose of dispensing Himself into a group of people that they might be transformed from their old natural being into something new to be the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEGLIGENCE OF RELIGION AND POLITICS<br />
TO THE NAZARENE</h2>
<p>In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is wonderful. He is the son of David, a king. And He is the son of Abraham, the first generation of the Hebrew race. He is also Emmanuel, God with us. And He is Jesus, Jehovah the Savior. In chapter one He is the son of David, the son of Abraham, Jesus, Emmanuel, Jehovah the Savior.</p>
<p>But in chapter two, we immediately see the negligence of religion and the persecution from politics towards this wonderful person. Religion did not pay attention, but politics came in to persecute. Jesus is such a wonderful person for the producing of the church, but if we really mean business with the Lord for His purpose, our destiny today will be the same. If He has come into us and we are one with Him, our experience will be the same as His.</p>
<p>The influence of religion and the power of politics constitute almost the whole of human society. If we mean business with the Lord for Him and for His church, religion will neglect us, and politics will persecute us, just as they did to the Nazarene. Then we will become Nazarenes. This is what happened to Jesus, even as a young child. &ldquo;But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene&rdquo; (Matt. 2:22-23).</p>
<p>To be a Nazarene is to be a person under the negligence of religion and the persecution of politics. The religious will say that we are very little, and the political people will say that we are nothing. Praise the Lord! We are nothing, and we are nobody. This is what it means to be a Nazarene. The Nazarene life is for the church. The church is produced by a Man who is called a Nazarene.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FULFILLING ALL RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2>
<p>This wonderful person is despised, opposed, and persecuted by man, but He is perfect in the eyes of God. In everything related to God, He is right. &ldquo;And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness&rdquo; (Matt. 3:15). Righteousness is simply to be right with God. Suppose you park your car in a no-parking zone. That is unrighteousness. We should realize that we have Jesus as our life, and Jesus is righteous in everything. If there is no righteousness, there is no church life. Suppose you give a dollar for a forty-five cent hamburger, and you are given three quarters in change. What shall you do? You may consider that you got a cheap hamburger. You may gain twenty cents, but if so, you lose Jesus&rsquo; life. Jesus is right in everything. If you are taking Him as your life, you will return the twenty cents. &ldquo;For thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Perhaps you are working in an office. Many office workers take the company&rsquo;s paper, pencils, and erasers home for their own use. Of course, you may say that this means nothing. But if it means nothing, why don&rsquo;t you buy some paper, pencils, and erasers and bring them to the office for the company to use? You would never do that. Jesus would never take anything away from the office. He is right in everything. It becomes Him to fulfill all righteousness.</p><h2 class="head1">A LIFE FOR FEEDING ON GOD&rsquo;S WORD</h2>
<p>In Matthew 4 Jesus was led of the Spirit into the wilderness to be tempted of the devil. &ldquo;And when he had fasted forty days and forty nights, he was afterward an hungred. And when the tempter came to him, he said, If thou be the Son of God, command that these stones be made bread. But he answered and said, It is written, Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God&rdquo; (Matt. 4:2-4). The tempter talked with Jesus when He was hungry. But Jesus answered that man lives not by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God. If we mean business to have the church life, we will be hungry all the time. Hence, we must learn to feed on the Word of God. Jesus&rsquo; life is a life that is always feeding on God&rsquo;s Word. Only this life is the proper life for the church life. Jesus as a man on this earth was a good eater of God&rsquo;s Word, and today the Jesus within us is the same. If you say that Jesus is within you, yet you do not daily eat the Word of God, that is not Jesus, that is you. Jesus lives by feeding on the Word of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GREAT LIGHT</h2>
<p>Then Jesus came as a great light. &ldquo;The people which sat in darkness saw a great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up&rdquo; (Matt. 4:16). If we would be a Nazarene, neglected by religion and persecuted by politics, fulfilling all righteousness by taking Jesus as our life and daily feeding on the living Word of God, we will become a light. Wherever we go, people will be under our shining. Men may be in darkness, but our presence will bring the light. People will simply see the light. Sometimes, without us, our family may be in darkness. But since we take Jesus as the Nazarene and our life within, and we are willing to suffer persecution and be right in everything by feeding on the Word of God, our family will be full of light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GREATER TEMPLE, THE GREATER JONAH,<br />
AND THE GREATER SOLOMON</h2>
<p>Jesus is also the greater temple. &ldquo;But I say unto you, That in this place is one greater than the temple&rdquo; (Matt. 12:6). He is the greater temple and the greater Jonah. &ldquo;The men of Nineveh shall rise in judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: because they repented at the preaching of Jonas; and behold, a greater than Jonas is here&rdquo; (Matt. 12:41). And He is the greater Solomon. &ldquo;The queen of the south shall rise up in the judgment with this generation, and shall condemn it: for she came from the uttermost parts of the earth to hear the wisdom of Solomon; and, behold, a greater than Solomon is here&rdquo; (Matt. 12:42).</p>
<p>Jesus is the greater temple with the presence of God, the greater Jonah with the power of God, and the greater Solomon with the wisdom of God. If we are those who take Jesus as our life, we will be the temple with the presence of God. Wherever we are, others will sense that God&rsquo;s dwelling is with us. They will also sense the power of God and the wisdom of God with us. I believe that many of us have had this kind of experience. We may be the youngest in the family, yet the whole family senses that we are so powerful, so wise, and so much in God&rsquo;s presence. This is because the greater temple, the greater Jonah, and the greater Solomon is within us. This should be the life of the people in the church. They must have the greater temple, the greater Jonah, and the greater Solomon. Others may not like it, but they cannot deny it. They must admit that the presence of God, the power of God, and the wisdom of God are with us.</p>
<p>I know of a brother who worked in a telegraph company. All those working there called him Jesus in a despising way. But one day they needed someone to care for a large sum of their money. They all agreed that they should entrust their money to the one they called Jesus. They realized that he was the most trustworthy person in the whole company. This is the way the church people should be in the world. We should have the wisdom and the power with the presence of God.</p><h2 class="head1">NO CHANGE IN RELIGION</h2>
<p>We do have such a wonderful person living in us! He is the greater temple, the greater Jonah, and the greater Solomon. But regardless of how wonderful the One who indwells us is, religion will never change, and politics will never agree. When Jesus came to His own country, all the religious ones were offended. &ldquo;And when he was come into his own country, he taught them in their synagogue, insomuch that they were astonished, and said, Whence hath this man this wisdom, and these mighty works? Is not this the carpenter&rsquo;s son? is not his mother called Mary? and his brethren, James, and Joses, and Simon, and Judas? And his sisters, are they not all with us? Whence then hath this man all these things? And they were offended in him&rdquo; (Matt. 13:54-57).</p>
<p>Furthermore, in Matthew 14, Herod had John the Baptist killed. Because of this, Jesus realized that He must leave. &ldquo;When Jesus heard of it, he departed thence by ship into a desert place apart: and when the people had heard thereof, they followed him on foot out of the cities&rdquo; (Matt. 14:13).</p>
<p>Religion and politics will never take the proper Christ, and they will never accept the proper church. This is the destiny of Jesus, and this is also the destiny of today&rsquo;s church. The church way is not a way that is welcomed by religion and politics. Rather, the church way will always be neglected by religion, even by today&rsquo;s Christianity, and the church way will be persecuted and troubled by politics. But this will not stop the Lord. The Lord is going to build His church, and the gates of Hades can never prevail against it. &ldquo;And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18).</p>
<h2 class="head1">QUALIFICATIONS FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>Today, many people talk about Christ building the church. But if we would know the way Christ builds His church, we must realize all the things that have been mentioned in this message. If we would let Him build His church, we must learn to take such a wonderful person as our life. We all have been put into such a wonderful person, and now He has come into us that we may live by Him. Only in this way will we have the life that is qualified for the church building.</p>
<p>Nearly all Christians today are not qualified for the building of the church. They are qualified for other things, such as certain Christianity movements, free groups, organizations, and denominations, but not for the proper church life. The proper church life is built with those who take Christ as their life. They live in the life of Christ, and they walk by the life of Christ. To have the church life, we need to be qualified with this wonderful person. In other words, we must be the real Nazarenes, the real fulfillers of righteousness, and the real feeders on God&rsquo;s Word. We must also be a light shining over the people where we are, and have the greater temple, the greater Jonah, and the greater Solomon. This is the very life that qualifies us for the church life.</p>
<p>When Jesus said that He would build His church, He did not say it in the second or third chapter of Matthew, but in the sixteenth chapter. It was after He became the Nazarene, the fulfiller of righteousness, the One who daily feeds on the Word of God, the great light, the greater temple, the greater Jonah, and the greater Solomon. After He had been revealed in such a way, He said that He would build His church. May the Lord open our eyes that we may see the reality in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It is not a new way to meet together. It is the reality of taking Christ as such a wonderful person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;TELL IT UNTO THE CHURCH&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Matthew eighteen also tells us something about the church. In this chapter we read that if we have some problem, we must go and tell the church. &ldquo;And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the church: but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen and a publican&rdquo; (Matt. 18:17). This is the proper church life. There must be a place where we can &ldquo;go and tell.&rdquo; Many people talk about the universal church in Matthew sixteen, but they miss the words of Jesus in Matthew eighteen. This is not the universal church. This is the local church in a practical place to which you can go and tell your problems. Praise the Lord! There is a place where we can &ldquo;tell it unto the church.&rdquo; So we see that eventually Matthew becomes a book of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REJECTED CORNERSTONE</h2>
<p>In Matthew twenty-one, we see that Jesus was rejected not as the Savior or Redeemer, but as the building stone. &ldquo;Jesus saith unto them, Did ye never read in the scriptures, The stone which the builders rejected, the same is become the head of the corner: this is the Lord&rsquo;s doing, and it is marvellous in our eyes?&rdquo; (Matt. 21:42). Many Christians think that Jesus was rejected by the Jewish people as the Savior and Redeemer. But Jesus tells us that He was rejected not as the Redeemer, but as the cornerstone for God&rsquo;s building. His main purpose was not merely to be the Redeemer, but to be the cornerstone for building up God&rsquo;s house. The whole book of Matthew is for this purpose. He said that He would build His church, but the religious ones rejected Him as the cornerstone for God&rsquo;s building. Therefore, they could never be a part of the building of God, for they rejected the cornerstone.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DISCIPLE THE GENTILES</h2>
<p>But, Hallelujah, we accept Him! We not only accept Him as the Savior and Redeemer, but also as the cornerstone. This is why the Lord told His disciples to go to the Gentiles and baptize them into His name. &ldquo;Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations [Gentiles], baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19, Gk.). (In Greek, the word for &ldquo;nations&rdquo; and the word for &ldquo;Gentiles&rdquo; is the same.) The Jewish religious ones rejected Him, so He told His disciples to take Him to the Gentiles. They would receive Him. By being discipled and baptized into the Triune God, they would become a part of the church, learning to take Christ as their life and thus being qualified for the building up of the church. All of this has been missed by most Christians, but the Lord is recovering all of these things.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord that we have such a wonderful person in us! By taking Him as our life, He will fully qualify us for God&rsquo;s building, because everything He is, is for the producing of the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">A SKETCH OF CHRIST<br />
IN THE GOSPEL OF MATTHEW</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 11:25-30; 12:19-20; 22:41-46; 26:39, 41; 27:41-43; 28:16-20; 5:3; 10:19-20</h1>
<p>The record that Matthew gives us of Christ is not superficial. It is altogether deep. Most Christians simply realize that Matthew tells us Christ was born of a virgin to be our Savior, He was crucified for our sins, He was buried and resurrected, and now He is our redeemer. This is indeed what Matthew tells us, but only what is on the surface. There is something much deeper than this superficial record.</p>
<h2 class="head1">JEHOVAH PLUS</h2>
<p>Therefore, we need to see the real structure of this book. The first chapter tells us that Christ was the son of David and the son of Abraham, and He was born of a virgin, Mary, and given the name Jesus. Yet, His name shall be called Emmanuel. Jehovah is included in the name Jesus, and God is included in the name Emmanuel. So in both of the names of Christ, Jesus and Emmanuel, Jehovah God is included. This indicates that this wonderful son of David and Abraham is not simply human, but also divine. He is God Himself plus something more. The Jewish people have God, but they do not have God plus. They have Jehovah, but they do not have Jehovah plus. But we have God with us, and we have Jehovah the Savior. This is something in addition to what the Hebrews have, and this is Jesus. Hallelujah for such a wonderful One!</p>
<h2 class="head1">A LONG JOURNEY</h2>
<p>For Jesus to be Jehovah plus and God plus, there was the need of a long, long journey. He started this journey from Genesis 3:15, just at the time Satan came into humanity. The incarnation of Jesus was purposeful, planned by God in eternity past, even before the heavens and earth were created. In eternity past God made a plan with Himself. Then He came to accomplish His plan firstly by creation. &ldquo;And God said, Let us make man in our image&rdquo; (Gen. 1:26). It seems that God had a conference. There is only one God, yet this mysterious one God is triune! He had a conference with Himself in order to make man in His image.</p>
<p>Why did God make man in His image? It is because man was made to be God&rsquo;s container, and the container must be in the form of the content. If something is square, we would not make a round container. A glove is made according to the image of a hand, because a glove is made for a hand to be put into it. Praise the Lord, man was made in God&rsquo;s image with the intention that one day God would be put into him. Romans 9:23 tells us that we are vessels. We are God&rsquo;s vessels; we are God&rsquo;s container.</p>
<p>God purposed that one day He would be incarnated. Then He created man in His image and built a wife for him. But the wife became the back door through which the subtle one came into humanity. He thought that he had caught man, but he did not know that he was the one that was caught. Humanity eventually became a trap to Satan. He got into man, but he was also caught in man. Therefore, immediately after Satan came into man, the prophecy concerning the incarnation of Christ began. Genesis 3:15 says that the seed of woman will bruise the serpent&rsquo;s head. Therefore Hebrews 2:14 tells us that Christ in the flesh through death destroyed the devil.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FORTY-TWO GENERATIONS</h2>
<p>Now we can see the purposeful plan of the incarnation. In Genesis 3:15 the incarnation was prophesied. After many generations it was repeated to Abraham. Then from Abraham to Mary, after forty-two generations, it was fulfilled. Forty in the Bible means temptation, trials, and sufferings. Israel was in the wilderness for forty years. The Lord Jesus fasted in the wilderness for forty days. Whenever this number is used, there are always sufferings, trials, and temptations. The number forty-two means that the trials and the temptations are over! In Revelation we see the prophecy of the last three and a half years of the tribulation. Three and a half years are forty-two months. When the forty-two months are past, Christ will come and the tribulation will be over. That will usher in the rest of the kingdom. From Abraham to Mary is forty-two generations. Then Christ comes! Before Mary, the previous forty generations were all trials, sufferings, and temptations. There was no rest. But when Christ comes, forty is over, and the rest begins.</p>
<p>The incarnation was not an accident. It was planned and scheduled from eternity past. And, praise the Lord, it was accomplished! And by the accomplishment of incarnation, a wonderful Person came.</p>
<p>As soon as He was born religion rose up against Him, and He was forced to go to Galilee of the Gentiles (Matt. 4:15) to settle in a small, poor, and lowly town by the name of Nazareth. This is why He was called a Nazarene according to the Scriptures. He was a wonderful Person, yet He became a Nazarene (Matt. 2:23).</p><h2 class="head1">ABSOLUTELY RIGHTEOUS</h2>
<p>This wonderful Person fulfilled all righteousness (Matt. 3:15). There is nothing wrong with Him in any aspect. When we look at Him, we see that He is righteous in every way. In fact, righteousness is His very substance. His very name is, &ldquo;The Lord Our Righteousness&rdquo; (Jer. 23:6). He is our righteousness because He is so righteous. He absolutely fulfills all of God&rsquo;s divine, glorious, holy, and righteous requirements. He is so righteous. Our rightness is not absolute. We may be righteous in one aspect, yet unrighteous in another. But Jesus is absolutely righteous in every aspect.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEED OF WOMAN TO BRUISE SATAN</h2>
<p>As the righteous One, He was tempted by Satan in the wilderness (Matt. 4:1-11). But Satan&rsquo;s temptation was God&rsquo;s test. God put this righteous One under Satan&rsquo;s temptation. God seemed to say, &ldquo;Satan, try this One. You tried Adam, and Adam failed. Now try this One.&rdquo; Satan tried, but this time he failed! Satan tempted Him to abandon His standing of being a man. He said, &ldquo;If thou be the <em>Sonof God,</em> command that these stones be made bread&rdquo; (Matt. 4:3). If you or I were the Lord, we would probably have answered his challenge, and turned the stones into bread. But listen to how the Lord Jesus answered. &ldquo;It is written, <em>Man</em> shall not live....&rdquo; (Matt. 4:4). It seems that the Lord was telling Satan, &ldquo;I am a man. Yes, I am the Son of God, but I take the position of a man. Don&rsquo;t you remember what God said in Genesis 3:15? He said the seed of the woman would bruise your head. Now I have come as the seed of woman. Don&rsquo;t tempt Me to act as the Son of God. I am the Son of Man, and I have come to bruise you!&rdquo; Hallelujah! This is Jesus, the seed of woman!</p>
<p>In His answer to Satan, He also told us how He lived by feeding on the Word of God. &ldquo;Man shall not live by bread alone, but by every word that proceedeth out of the mouth of God&rdquo; (Matt. 4:4). The word that proceeded out of God&rsquo;s mouth was His nourishment. He was a man who lived by feeding on God&rsquo;s Word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ATTRACTING LIGHT</h2>
<p>It was such a man that eventually became the great light. &ldquo;The people which sat in darkness saw a great light; and to them which sat in the region and shadow of death light is sprung up&rdquo; (Matt. 4:16). Before this man came, the whole situation was in darkness. But He came as a great light, shining over all the darkness. Then this great light attracted the disciples (Matt. 4:18-22). When I was young I could not understand why Peter and Andrew, James and John left their fishing and mending works so quickly to follow the Lord. Jesus just asked them to follow Him, and immediately they came. If you or I were to say this, no one would follow us. But the disciples abandoned their works, gave up their father, and their boat, and followed Jesus. Why? It must have been some kind of attraction. This man Jesus was really an attraction. Once Jesus appears, you will be attracted; you cannot escape. He is the great light, and by His shining so many were attracted.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONE WITH GOD</h2>
<p>Following this, we have Matthew 5&mdash;7, where Jesus gives the teaching on the mount. When He came down He began to travel through the promised land. In all those travelings He behaved in a marvelous way. On the one hand He suffered persecution, but on the other hand He was approved by the religion that existed. However, He was always one with God. There was no discrepancy between Him and God. When the circumstances were poor, He would still thank the Father (Matt. 11:25). When we are in good circumstances, it is easy to thank the Lord, but it is not so easy otherwise. To build up the church, we need such a life. We need a life that is one with God the Father. We need a life that has no discrepancy with God&rsquo;s work. Our life is not this kind of life. Therefore, we are not qualified for the church building. There is only one life that is qualified, the life of Jesus. Jesus is the life that is absolutely one with the Father. There is no discrepancy between Him and the Father.</p><h2 class="head1">GREATER THAN EVERYTHING</h2>
<p>During this time Jesus revealed Himself to the people as the greater Temple (12:6), the greater Jonah (12:44), the greater Solomon (12:42), and the Lord of the Sabbath (12:8). Many Christians love the Gospel of John because it tells us that Jesus is the life, the truth, the way, the door, and so many other things. But some of the things Matthew revealed, John never touched. John did not tell us that Jesus was the greater Solomon. Neither did he tell us that Jesus was the Lord of the Sabbath. In Matthew, we see that Jesus is greater than everything, because He is everything! If we have Him, we have God&rsquo;s dwelling place. If we have Him, we have God&rsquo;s prophet, God&rsquo;s insight, and God&rsquo;s wisdom. If we have Him, we have God&rsquo;s authority and kingship. And if we have Him, we have the real rest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BROKEN REEDS AND SMOKING FLAX</h2>
<p>Jesus is such a wonderful person! He is not only wonderful with God, but also with man. He never breaks a bruised reed, and He never quenches smoking flax (Matt. 12:20). In ancient times, the Jewish children made the reeds into a kind of musical instrument. Whenever the reed was bruised, it would not emit the proper sound, so the children would break it. But Jesus never breaks any bruised reed. Sometimes we are just as these bruised instruments. We should give forth a good sound, but we do just the opposite. As a rule we should be broken, but Jesus would never do that. He would come in to rearrange us that the beautiful music might come forth.</p>
<p>In those days the Jews used burning flax when they traveled at night. When the oil ran out, the flax would begin to smoke, so they would quench it and cast it away. Many times we are just as smoking flax. We should be shining, but rather we are smoking. As a rule, the Lord should quench us and cast us away. But He will never do that. Jesus knows why we are smoking. It is because we are short of oil. Therefore, instead of quenching us, He supplies us with oil. When the flax gets the oil, it burns. We should not be disappointed in some of the smoking brothers and sisters. We only need to supply them with oil, that they might burn to give the light.</p>
<p>Jesus is such a wonderful person! He is not a breaker or a quencher; He is a rearranger and a supplier. Do not say that you are a hopeless case. Nothing is hopeless with Jesus. He is very capable at rearranging. He can rearrange us for the church life. In ourselves we are not qualified, but Jesus qualifies us with His life. Regardless of how bruised or smoking we are, Jesus can rearrange us and supply us. Hallelujah for such a One!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERIOUS JESUS</h2>
<p>While Jesus was traveling and saying so many wonderful things, the religious ones were continually questioning Him. The Pharisees, the ancient fundamentalists, and the Sadducees, the ancient modernists, joined together with the political parties to question Him (Matt. 22:15-40). They tried their utmost to pin Him down, but they just could not. He is the wisest of all men; He answered all of their questions. When they finished, He asked them a question. &ldquo;What think ye of Christ? whose son is he?&rdquo; (Matt. 22:42). The religious ones who had the knowledge of the Bible quickly answered that He was the son of David. Then Jesus answered, &ldquo;How then doth David in spirit call him Lord, saying, The Lord said unto my Lord, Sit thou on my right hand, till I make thine enemies thy footstool? If David then call him Lord, how is he his son?&rdquo; (Matt. 22:43-45). They could not answer Him. And from that time they asked Him no more questions.</p>
<p>What does this mean? It simply means that Jesus is a mystery. They only knew one aspect, but there is another aspect. They knew Christ as the son of David, but they did not know Him as the Lord of all. Even David, who was before Him, called Him Lord. He is a mystery. We should never think that we know Jesus fully. We may only know a fragment. He is too full and unsearchably rich. We can know Jesus, but we cannot know Him to the uttermost. This is why He said, &ldquo;No man knoweth the Son, but the Father&rdquo; (Matt. 11:27). Praise the Lord that Jesus is such a mystery! In the last twelve years in this country we have seen more things about Him. But even in eternity, we will have more and more discoveries of Jesus. He is so rich! We all must open ourselves continually to know Him in a deeper and richer way. I do believe that in the coming years we will see something more, something deeper, something higher, something fuller, and something richer about Christ. He is so wonderful and unsearchable.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CROSS-BEARING LIFE</h2>
<p>Another point about Christ which we must see is that He saved others, but He would not save Himself. &ldquo;Likewise also the chief priests mocking him, with the scribes and elders, said, He saved others; himself he cannot save. If he be the King of Israel, let him now come down from the cross, and we will believe him&rdquo; (Matt. 27:41-42). To be qualified for the church life we must have such a life. Never save yourself. When others put you on the cross, you must remain there. This is the right place for you to be. Let others say that you can do so many things to save others, but you cannot save yourself. You have to say, &ldquo;Amen!&rdquo; This is the cross-bearing life. We can save others, but we cannot save ourselves. This is the life that bears the cross all the time.</p>
<p>Many times God would allow circumstances to put us on the cross. We should not try to escape; we should stay there. This cross-bearing life is the life that is good for the church building. So many husbands are just the cross to the wives, and the wives are the emotional crosses to the husbands. Many times the husbands are crucified by the wives&rsquo; emotions. But thank the Lord we have so many crosses. The husbands are the crosses to the wives, and the wives are crosses to the husbands. We don&rsquo;t need to buy a cross; the Lord has prepared a lot of crosses for us. Let others say that we can save others, but we cannot save ourselves. This is right. The life of Jesus is such a life. By His life we can save others, but we cannot save ourselves.</p>
<p>But, praise the Lord, the cross brings in the resurrection. Christ is on the other side of the cross, not on this side. If we stay on this side of the cross, we will miss Christ. If we would reach Christ, surely we must pass through the cross. On the other side of the cross, we have the resurrected Christ. This is wonderful.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESSED GOD</h2>
<p>To reach the resurrected Christ, we have traveled from chapter one to chapter twenty-eight of Matthew. Before the incarnation in chapter one, the promise of the seed of the woman traveled four thousand years from Genesis 3:15. Then the seed of woman came in chapter one and from chapter one to twenty-eight, He was fully processed to become the resurrected Christ. Now He is no longer just God, but the God who has traveled through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, burial, and resurrection. He is God, plus so many items. He is God, who after being made flesh took a further step by death and resurrection to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). This is the processed God. The resurrected Christ is the processed God. Before the incarnation He was the &ldquo;raw&rdquo; God, but now He has been fully processed. For God to be incarnated was a real process. For Him to live thirty-three and a half years on this earth, raised by a poor family, persecuted by religion, and finally crucified on a cross was also a real process. Then He passed through death and went into resurrection. By resurrection He was fully processed to become the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST</h2>
<p>After He had been fully processed, the Lord came to the disciples and said, &ldquo;All authority is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Matt. 28:18-19, Gk.). Today we must preach the gospel with such an authorization. We have been authorized to disciple the nations. Then we must baptize them into the name of the Triune God. In Galatians 3:27, Paul says that as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ. If we compare this verse with Matthew 28:19, we can see that to be baptized into the Triune God is to be baptized into Christ. This Christ into Whom we have been baptized is the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit is just the processed God for us to participate in. We all have been baptized into such a Christ.</p>
<p>When I was young I tried to discover how I could get into Christ. The Bible told me that I was baptized into Christ and that I was in Christ. But I was also taught that after His resurrection, Christ ascended to the heavens. He was there, and I was here. How could I be in Him? I was told that it was through the Holy Spirit. But what does that mean? Then after years of studying the Word and experiencing Christ as life, we found the answer. Yes, Jesus is in the heavens, but both Ephesians 1:23 and 4:10 tell us that Christ today is filling all in all. The resurrected Christ fills the heavens and the surface of the earth. He is omnipresent. Now He is the all-inclusive, life-giving Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). So we must be baptized into Him. This is why baptism should not be a formality, but a reality. When we baptize others, we must exercise our faith to realize that we are putting them into Christ, the life-giving Spirit, the Triune God.</p><h2 class="head1">&ldquo;INTO&rdquo; THE NAME</h2>
<p>In Matthew 28:19 the Lord tells us to baptize the nations into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. The Greek preposition translated &ldquo;in&rdquo; should be &ldquo;into.&rdquo; Therefore, we should baptize them <em>into</em> the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. To understand this, we must also read Galatians 3:27, &ldquo;For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; By these two verses we can see that to be baptized into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit is equivalent to being baptized into Christ. The Father is in the Son, and the Son by resurrection became the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, today, if we touch the Spirit, we touch the Son. And when we have the Son, we have the Father. This is the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROCESSED TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Before Matthew 28:19, the Triune God was never revealed in such a clear way. The name of the Father, the Son, and the Spirit is one name of three persons. This one name is the fully processed Triune God. After His resurrection He was fully processed in order to be dispensed into us. The Spirit who comes into us is the Son with the Father. This is proved in Romans 8:9-10. In these verses we see that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself. Then there are many verses in the New Testament which tell us that the Father is in us, the Son is in us, and the Spirit is in us. We all know that there are not three in us, but only one. This is because the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are just one. This is the processed, Triune God.</p>
<p>In order to be processed, God firstly became flesh. Then, after living on this earth as a man, through death and resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. This is our living Christ today. He is in the heavens, and He is also on the earth. He is omnipresent; we do have Him within us. In Him we have the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In Him we also have our Redeemer, our Creator, and our Savior. In Him we have everything, because He is everything. He is our all in all. He is our life, our light, our power, our strength, our holiness, our righteousness, our love, our kindness, and our peace. All the divine attributes and human virtues are in Him. Hallelujah! He is everything! This is the processed Triune God who is the all-inclusive Christ. When we baptize people, we baptize them into this One. Baptism should not be a formal ritual, but the real putting of people into the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A MYSTICAL UNION WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>To baptize people <em>into</em> the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit really has a deeper meaning than most have realized. For years I had seen that this verse signifies the putting of people into the Triune God, but I did not have the confirmation of any other record. Therefore, I hesitated to say this. Then one day I obtained a set of books entitled, <em>Word Studies of the New Testament,</em> by M. R. Vincent. In one of these books, Mr. Vincent comments about baptizing <em>into</em> the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit as recorded in Matthew 28:19. He says, <em>&ldquo;Into</em> denotes union or communion with, as in Romans 6:3. Baptizing into the name of the Holy Trinity implies a spiritual and mystical union with Him. The name is the expression of the sum total of the divine being. It is equivalent to His person. His name is of no avail detached from His nature. When one is baptized into the name of the Trinity, he professes to acknowledge and appropriate God in all that He is and all that He does for man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Isn&rsquo;t this wonderful? Now we can understand what it means to be baptized into the name of the Triune God. It is to be put into this mystical union with Him, and to appropriate whatever God is into our being. The purpose of this is to produce the church.</p>
<p>Now we have seen a sketch of Christ in the Gospel of Matthew. He was the son of David and the Son of Abraham, born of a virgin with the names of Jesus and Emmanuel. Eventually He passed through all the processes to become the life-giving Spirit. Now we are to be baptized into Him, into the Triune God.</p>
<p>Having been baptized into Him, we can partake of all that He is, for He is in us. To do this we must exercise our spirit. &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit&rdquo; (Matt. 5:3). We have a willing spirit (Matt. 26:41). Our flesh is weak, but our spirit is strong. So we must exercise our spirit and call Him Lord as David did (Matt. 22:43). We can call Him Lord in spirit. When we do this, He becomes so practical to us in our daily life. This is for the building up of the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE KINGDOM OF THE HEAVENS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 2:1-2; 4:17; 5:3, 20; 7:21-23; 9:35; 13:3; 15:26-27; 16:18-19; 18:17-18; 21:4-5; 27:37; 28:18-19</h1>
<p>The Gospel of Matthew is a book of mystery. Bible teachers hardly have any debates concerning the Gospel of John. But for centuries there have been many debates among Bible teachers regarding the Gospel of Matthew. This is because this book is a book of mystery. In Matthew there is something so mysterious.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE &ldquo;SUSPENDED&rdquo; KINGDOM</h2>
<p>Many Christians know that Matthew speaks of Jesus as the King. In Matthew 2:2, the wise men asked, &ldquo;Where is he that is born King of the Jews?&rdquo; When He was crucified there was a sign placed over Him that said, &ldquo;The King of the Jews&rdquo; (Matt. 27:37). But what does it mean that Jesus is the King? The kingdom of Jesus is revealed in this book, but it is really difficult for anyone to understand it properly. Many Bible teachers have held different concepts concerning the kingdom in Matthew. The Brethren teachers say that Jesus came as a king to present the kingdom of God to the Jewish people, but since they rejected Him, the kingdom was suspended. Then they say that Jesus began to build the church while the kingdom was suspended, and one day, when the church age is over, the suspended kingdom will be brought back. Some of the dispensational teachers say that the book of Matthew is for the Jews, not for us. Hence, we see that there are different concepts concerning the Gospel of Matthew. It is because this book is a book of mystery. We need heavenly, spiritual insight in order to read this book.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOSPEL OF THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>In this book Jesus preached the gospel of the kingdom. What is this? It is not the gospel of grace or the gospel of forgiveness, but the gospel of the kingdom. It is easy to understand the gospel of grace, but it is not so easy to understand the gospel of the kingdom. The Gospel of Matthew speaks of the gospel of the kingdom. Jesus preached and also predicted that this gospel of the kingdom would be preached to the uttermost part of the earth, and then the end would come. The gospel of grace has been preached to every part of the earth, but not the gospel of the kingdom. If you were to go to Africa today, you would find many Christians who know and accept the gospel of grace. But if you were to ask them concerning the gospel of the kingdom, they would say that they have never heard of such a thing. There is the need of a further preaching of the kingdom, not only in Africa, but also in America. Do you believe that Christians in the United States know what the gospel of the kingdom is? The Gospel of Matthew as a book of mystery speaks something hidden and mysterious.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KINGDOM SEED</h2>
<p>Let me tell you something else about this Gospel. Jesus is the King, but He is also the kingdom. In the entire world there is not a book that tells us of a certain king being the seed of His kingdom. This is really a foreign, heavenly language. It says further that when this seed grows, the kingdom comes forth. No wonder it is difficult to understand this book. Matthew tells us that the King Jesus came as a sower. &ldquo;And he spake many things unto them in parables, saying, Behold, a sower went forth to sow&rdquo; (Matt. 13:3). Yes, Jesus came as a King, but not as a King in our natural concept, in our definition, or in our understanding. He is a wonderful and mysterious King.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A MEEK KING</h2>
<p>Have you ever heard of a king coming into office riding on a baby donkey? &ldquo;All this was done, that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophet, saying, Tell ye the daughter of Sion, Behold, thy King cometh unto thee, meek, and sitting upon an ass, and a colt the foal of an ass&rdquo; (Matt. 21:4-5). Suppose the president of the U.S.A. came into office in this way. I do not believe that he would be accepted. Jesus is a king in a completely different way than we would think according to our natural concept. According to the above verse, He came as a meek king. Our concept is that a king is one who exercises authority to rule over everyone in an outward way. But we must put down this concept. Jesus was never such a king.</p><h2 class="head1">FALLEN, REBELLIOUS MAN</h2>
<p>What kind of king then is Jesus? To understand this, we must first of all comprehend God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. In eternity past God made a plan to express Himself. So He created the heavens and the earth. Then God created man in His own image with the intention that this corporate man would be His expression and would exercise His authority over all the earth. But through the fall, mankind became rebellious toward God. Man today is altogether in rebellion. Even his loving of others is rebellion to God. It is because he does it by himself and with himself. Even our kindness and patience are a kind of rebellion. Not only are the bank robbers rebels to God, even the most moral people are also rebels. Whatever man is after the fall is a rebellion.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A KING ACCORDING TO GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE</h2>
<p>Then God became a man by the name of Jesus. God Himself came to the earth in the form of a little man to preach the gospel of the kingdom. &ldquo;From that time, Jesus began to preach, and to say, Repent: for the kingdom of heaven is at hand&rdquo; (Matt. 4:17). He did not say that man should repent to enter the heavens, but to repent for the kingdom of the heavens is near. The word &ldquo;repent&rdquo; means to have a change of mind. The rebellious people need a turn in their concepts. Jesus came as a king, but not in their concept. He came as a king according to God&rsquo;s purpose. He came not to rule over us in an outward way, but as a king to enter into us in order to consume all our rebellious element. Jesus came as a king to impart Himself into us that He might discharge all our rebellious element, and replace it with Himself. Regardless of how good we think we are, God would say that we are rebellious. Our good nature is altogether a rebellion to God. We may be good in many things, but we are not good in obeying God. Therefore He came into us as a king to replace all our rebellious element. Now we will have His ruling element within us as a seed. When this seed grows to a certain extent, it becomes the kingdom. This is the way Jesus is the king.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRESENT KINGDOM</h2>
<p>Many Christians today hold a pitiful concept concerning Jesus&rsquo; kingdom. According to their concept, it seems that Jesus today is not the king. This is not true! There are some on earth today to whom Jesus <em>is</em> the king. Then is His kingdom here now? If you were to ask me, I would say, &ldquo;Yes, His kingdom is here!&rdquo; Let me prove it to you.</p>
<p>Perhaps you were saved two years ago. I do believe that at least several times before you were saved you stole some things. Perhaps it was just a small amount of change from your mother or father, but it was still stealing. Since you have been saved, Jesus the king has come into you. Now it would be really difficult for you to steal anything. Jesus has come into us to rule over us. He is not only troubling us, but reigning over us. Therefore, we are now in His present kingdom. This kingdom is a living person living with us. No lexicon or dictionary would ever give us such a definition. Our King Jesus is not a king in an ordinary category. He is something extra. I can testify that hour after hour Jesus is my king, and I am in His kingdom. This reigning One rules in life right within me. He is a king ruling over me. It is not that He will be a king or that he should be a king, but that right now He is a king. He is here and now the king in his kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KINGDOM AND THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The Brethren teachers say that the kingdom was suspended, and that Jesus brought in the church to replace it until the time of the kingdom. But Romans 14:17 proves that the church life today is the kingdom. By reading Romans 14 carefully, we see that it deals with the proper church life. While Paul is speaking about receiving the saints in the church life he says, &ldquo;For the kingdom of God is not meat and drink; but righteousness, and peace, and joy in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Romans 14 deals with the church, but it speaks of the kingdom. The kingdom has never been suspended. The kingdom is here and now.</p>
<p>The Gospel of Matthew itself also proves this. In chapter sixteen we have two verses which are linked together. &ldquo;And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my <em>church;</em> and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it. And I will give unto thee the keys of the <em>kingdom</em> of heaven and whatsoever thou shalt bind on earth shall be bound in heaven; and whatsoever thou shalt loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18-19). In Matthew 16:18 the Lord says that He will build His <em>church.</em> Then in the following verse He says that He will give the keys of the <em>kingdom.</em> Here we see that the kingdom and the church are used interchangeably. The church mentioned in verse 18 surely is the kingdom in verse 19. This proves that the church today is the kingdom. This is also confirmed in Matthew 18:17-18. &ldquo;And if he shall neglect to hear them, tell it unto the <em>church:</em> but if he neglect to hear the church, let him be unto thee as an heathen man and a publican. Verily I say unto you, Whatsoever ye shall bind on earth shall be bound in heaven: and whatsoever ye shall loose on earth shall be loosed in heaven.&rdquo; In these verses the Lord gives the same authority to bind and loose to the church as He did to Peter when He spoke of giving him the keys of the <em>kingdom</em> of the heavens.</p>
<p>In the world, there certainly is no kingdom of the heavens. The world is full of robbers. But in the church all the robbers are converted into good citizens of the kingdom of heaven. The church today is the kingdom, and Jesus is the king. When Peter on the day of Pentecost brought people into the church, that was the time he used one of the keys of the kingdom for opening the way for the Jews to enter. This kingdom into which they came was the church. Then in the house of Cornelius he used another key of the kingdom to open the way for the Gentiles to enter. How can anyone say that the kingdom has been suspended!</p>
<p>After resurrection, we are told in Acts 1:3 that Jesus spent forty days speaking to the disciples about the kingdom. &ldquo;To whom also he shewed himself alive after his passion by many infallible proofs, being seen of them forty days, and speaking of the things pertaining to the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Jesus never suspended the kingdom. This verse tells us clearly that after resurrection Jesus returned to His disciples to speak to them about the kingdom. So whatsoever the early disciples were doing, it was the opening and establishing of the kingdom. At the same time we are clear that what they did was to establish the church. The church life today is the kingdom.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF THE KINGDOM</h2>
<p>What is the way to open the kingdom and establish the church? It is by imparting King Jesus as the seed of the kingdom into others. Jesus is the king, and He is the seed of the kingdom. When we were saved, this kingly seed was sown into us. None of the kings in the world could rule over our family and home life. The president of the U.S.A. would never come into our kitchen. But King Jesus not only comes into our kitchen, He comes into every corner of our house. He cares about every little detail. He is such a king in detail. Hallelujah, Jesus is our king! And as our king He is on one hand the sower, and on the other hand the seed. The king came as the sower to sow Himself as the seed of the kingdom into our very being. This is the king, and this is also the kingdom. The king, the kingdom, and the seed of the kingdom all are Jesus. Isn&rsquo;t this wonderful?</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE POOR IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>How can we take this kingdom into us? The answer is in a verse fully missed by today&rsquo;s Christians. &ldquo;Blessed are the poor in spirit: for theirs is the kingdom of heaven&rdquo; (Matt. 5:3). Most Christians do not know what it means to be poor in spirit, therefore the kingdom is not theirs. The spirit mentioned here in Matthew 5:3 is not the Holy Spirit, but our human spirit. &ldquo;God is Spirit: and they that worship him must worship him in spirit&rdquo; (John 4:24). If we would touch Him, we must exercise our spirit.</p>
<p>Most people are filled with worthless things. They are full of religious concepts, human concepts, and dead knowledge of the Bible. This was the case with the Pharisees and the Sadducees. They were full of religious refuse and had no room in their spirit for Jesus. What does it mean to be poor in spirit? It means we are clear that religion, science, culture, philosophy, and dead Bible doctrines are all refuse, and we should not be preoccupied with any of these things. To be poor in spirit we need to pray in this way: &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, all the doctrines mean nothing to me. Regardless of what I have learned in the past years, I am still poor, I am still hungry. I need You, Lord Jesus. I don&rsquo;t need anything but You.&rdquo; When we begin to pray like this, something deep within is flowing, living, working, watering, enlightening, strengthening, and reigning. This is Jesus as the seed of the kingdom. Once we call on Him in this way, we can never be the same. Then we realize that all the things which we have held onto in the past are refuse. Religion, doctrine, dead Bible knowledge, philosophy, and science all are refuse! Only Jesus is worth anything.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A MATTER OF RIGHTEOUSNESS</h2>
<p>When Jesus came to preach the kingdom, He did not preach to the Gentiles, but to those who knew the Scriptures. They had the scriptural knowledge, but they did not have the King Jesus, and they did not have the kingdom. So Jesus came to sow Himself as the seed of the kingdom into the people. The growing up of this seed becomes the kingdom. This kingdom is altogether a matter of righteousness. Jesus said that if our righteousness does not exceed the righteousness of the Scribes and Pharisees, we are finished as far as the kingdom is concerned (Matt. 5:20). But, praise the Lord, we have Jesus within us growing as our righteousness; so we are in the kingdom.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FULFILLING GOD&rsquo;S WILL</h2>
<p>The kingdom is also something which absolutely fulfills God&rsquo;s will. There is no more rebellion, because there is no discrepancy between God&rsquo;s will and the kingdom. In fact, the kingdom is just God&rsquo;s will. &ldquo;Not every one that saith unto me, Lord, Lord, shall enter into the kingdom of heaven; but he that doeth the will of my Father which is in heaven.&rdquo; (Matt. 7:21). Many Christians have done things in the name of the Lord, but the Lord will never own or approve that kind of thing. &ldquo;And then will I profess unto them, I never knew you [<em>or,</em> allowed you]: depart from me, ye that work lawlessness (Matt. 7:23 Gk.). In the Lord&rsquo;s eyes, even prophesying and casting out demons in the name of the Lord not according to God&rsquo;s will is lawlessness. The kingdom is absolutely a matter of righteousness, a matter of God&rsquo;s will.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKE JESUS IN</h2>
<p>How can we do God&rsquo;s will in the kingdom? There is no other way but to take Jesus in. We should not try to do the will of God ourselves. We will only fail. The way to fulfill God&rsquo;s will is to take in the One who obeys God all the time. Jesus is the kingdom of obedience. We simply need to take Him in, to eat Him as the children&rsquo;s bread. We may be the Gentile dogs, but we all have our portion under the table (Matt. 15:22-28). We all can eat King Jesus and take Him into us. All the kingly elements are in this bread. The more we eat Jesus, the more the royal ingredients will get into us. Hallelujah! Praise the Lord for such a ruling element within. This is the mysterious kingdom that is mentioned in the Gospel of Matthew.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KINGDOM PEOPLE</h2>
<p>Now we are clear why Jesus told the disciples at the end of this book, &ldquo;All authority is given unto me in heaven and in earth. Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Matt. 28:18-19). We are to disciple the nations and baptize them into the Triune God. When we baptize people into the Triune God, we baptize them into Christ, into the kingdom seed, and into the kingdom! Hallelujah! When we baptize people, we must exercise our faith to put them into the King and into the kingdom. This is why all the people in the churches are the kingdom people.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE PREPARATION OF THE BRIDE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:42, 51; 2:19-21; 3:29-30; 10:16; 12:24; 15:1, 5; 17:21-23</h1>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;WITH US&rdquo; AND &ldquo;AMONG US&rdquo;</h2>
<p>In this message, we must come to the Gospel of John. The Gospel of Matthew is at the beginning of the Gospels, and the Gospel of John is at the end. Apparently they are quite different from one another. Matthew says that Jesus is the King, and John says that Jesus is the Son of God and even God Himself. It seems that these two Gospels are very different, but they are nearly the same in two points. Both of them tell us that Jesus eventually will be with us. &ldquo;Behold, a virgin shall be with child, and shall bring forth a son, and they shall call his name Emmanuel, which being interpreted is, God with us&rdquo; (Matt. 1:23). Here Matthew tells us that Jesus is God with us. Then John says: &ldquo;And the Word [who was God] became flesh, and tabernacled among us&rdquo; (John 1:14 ASV). To be among us equals to be with us. The first chapter of Matthew tells us that this One is going to be with us, and the first chapter of John tells us that this One is going to be among us. In this point, these two books are the same.</p>
<p>This is not all. Matthew chapter one tells us that Jesus is the very God. His name is not only called Jesus, but Emmanuel, which means God with us. And John chapter one tells us that Jesus as God was made flesh. So we can see that these two books are alike. Both tell us something of the incarnation of this wonderful Person.</p>
<p>Many Christians believe that the incarnation of Jesus was mainly that He might be our redeemer. Jesus indeed was incarnated as a man in order to be our redeemer. But not many Christians pay much attention to the fact that Jesus was incarnated to be with us. His incarnation was not only for Him to redeem us, but also that He might be with us. A Savior that redeems us and then leaves us is not Jesus. Jesus came with the purpose of being with us. Emmanuel means God with us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROCESSED TO BE IN US</h2>
<p>Then in John 14, Jesus tells us that the Spirit of reality not only dwells with us, but shall be in us. &ldquo;Even the Spirit of reality; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not, neither knoweth him: but ye know him; for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you&rdquo; (John 14:17).</p>
<p>I may be with you while I am giving this message, but I could never be in you. The only way for me to be in you is for you to eat me. Praise the Lord, Jesus came to be with us, and even the more, to be in us. But the way for Him to be in us is by being killed, &ldquo;cooked,&rdquo; and then eaten. Jesus was killed, was &ldquo;cooked,&rdquo; and now He is the processed Jesus, good for eating. When we eat Him He gets into us.</p>
<p>Before this process, He was with Peter, John, and so many of the disciples. But He could not get into them until He was killed, and resurrected. Then He breathed Himself into them. At that time He became the Spirit of reality. Now He was no more simply God in the flesh, but the Spirit of reality.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO STEPS FOR INDWELLING</h2>
<p>In order for Jesus to get into us, He has taken two steps. The first was to become flesh, and the second was to become the life-giving Spirit. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (John 1:1). This is a wonderful verse, but there is nothing in it for us. But praise the Lord for verse 14! &ldquo;And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.&rdquo; The Word became flesh to tabernacle among us. This was Jesus with the blood and flesh. If He had no blood, there would be no redemption. Our Jesus as the Word became flesh with blood. This is why in the same chapter there is another verse: &ldquo;The next day John seeth Jesus coming unto him, and saith, Behold the Lamb of God, which taketh away the sin of the world&rdquo; (John 1:29). This flesh is the Lamb of God with the blood for our redemption.</p>
<p>After three and one half years with the disciples as the Word become flesh, He told them that He was going to leave them. That really troubled them. They wanted Him to stay with them. But He told them that if He did not go and die, He would not be so profitable to them. In order to make Himself more profitable to them, He had to go and die.</p>
<p>But, praise the Lord, He said that His going was not His leaving. Instead, His going was His coming. Now He was with them, but He could not be in them. Therefore, He had to take a further step that He could be in them. That step was death and resurrection. Through death and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). The first step was for Him to become flesh, and the second was for Him to become the life-giving Spirit. As God, He became flesh. Then as flesh, through death and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>Most Christians today have not seen that Jesus took the second step to become the life-giving Spirit. A good number of Christians even today are still opposing us because we say that the Bible teaches this matter. They say that Jesus is the Son of God, He is not the Spirit. But whatever they may say, 1 Corinthians 15:45 tells us that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>In several places, after I shared that Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit, some dear ones asked me if I believed in the Triune God. I told them that I believed in the Triune God more than they did, but they need to know that Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit. It is so clearly revealed that Jesus through His death and resurrection has become the Spirit of reality. The Lord took two steps in order to dispense Himself into man. As God He became flesh. Then, through death and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit. Now as the Spirit of reality He is not only with us, but also in us. The Spirit of reality dwells in us!</p>
<p>Matthew, in the last verse of his Gospel, tells us that the Lord Jesus will be with us forever. &ldquo;And lo, I am with you all the days, even unto the completion of the age&rdquo; (Matt. 28:20 Gk). Now we see how the two Gospels of John and Matthew are the same. They both tell us that this wonderful Person is with us and within us.</p><h2 class="head1">NO ASCENSION IN MATTHEW</h2>
<p>There is also another similarity in these two Gospels. Neither John nor Matthew mention the Lord&rsquo;s public ascension. Almost all Christians have common knowledge that the Lord Jesus went to the Father after His resurrection. There is no record whatever in Matthew of Jesus going to the Father. This Gospel ends by the Lord telling us that He will be with us unto the completion of the age. Suppose you were to go to Mongolia to preach the gospel with only one book of the Bible, and that book was Matthew. After the Mongolians read this book, they would be certain that the Lord Jesus was with them forever. Not one Mongolian would know that Jesus went to the heavens unless you brought them this doctrine. There is not such a thing as Jesus going to the heavens in Matthew. It is mentioned, of course, in other Gospels, but not in Matthew. Why? Because in this book Jesus came to be Emmanuel. He came to be God with us, and He promised that He would be with us unto the completion of the age. Jesus is still here, and He is with us all the days. This means He is with us every day until this age is completed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A SECRET ASCENSION IN JOHN</h2>
<p>Is the ascension mentioned in the Gospel of John? In Matthew it is certain that there is no record of Jesus&rsquo; ascension, but in John we must be careful. There is no public ascension, but there is a secret ascension which lasted less than a day. It is found in John 20. In this chapter, Mary saw Him early in the morning after His resurrection. She attempted to touch Him, but He forbade her, saying that He had not yet ascended to the Father (John 20:16-17). He must present the freshness of His resurrection to the Father for the Father&rsquo;s satisfaction. The Father must be the first to enjoy the firstfruits of resurrection (1 Cor. 15:20). So early in the morning of the day of resurrection Jesus went to the heavens. This was not the public ascension which was forty days later. This was a secret ascension. Jesus went to the Father on that day in a secret way. On the evening of the same day He came back and showed Himself to His disciples. After this it was permissible to touch Him (John 20:27). Before His secret ascension He told Mary not to touch Him, but afterward it was allowed. This was because between the time He appeared to Mary and the time He came back to the disciples He ascended to the heavens to present the freshness of His resurrection to the Father for His enjoyment. After He presented Himself to the Father, He returned to the disciples and never left them. He went up secretly, and He came back secretly. Therefore, in the Gospel of John there is no public ascension. Why? Because the Gospel of John tells us that Jesus will be in us as the Spirit of reality. In the Gospel of John He asks us to abide in Him and He will abide in us. How could He go away if He is in us in such a way. This is why His going away was only for a short time. It was not more than seventy-two hours altogether. This going away was to take a further step for His coming. He had to become the Spirit through death and resurrection in order to come into us.</p>
<p>The Gospel of Matthew and the Gospel of John both tell us that this wonderful Person, Jesus, is with us, and neither one of them mention the public ascension of Christ. The reason they do not mention this is because they both tell us that He is going to be with us and in us all the time. Praise the Lord!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PURPOSE OF THE LORD<br />
 BEING WITH US AND IN US</h2>
<p>What is the reason that Jesus is with us and in us? What is the purpose? We must all see that Jesus is with us and in us for the preparation of the Bride. The Lord has come into us in order to build up the Bride. Some say that Jesus is in us to sanctify us, to be our life, to comfort us, to strengthen us, and to lead us. All of these things are true. But they are all for the producing of the Bride, which is the building up of the temple of God.</p>
<p>We must all see that His goal is not simply to be our life, our comfort, our strength, and so many other things. All of these things are procedures that we may reach the goal. The goal is the producing of the proper church, which is the building of God&rsquo;s temple and the preparation of the Lord&rsquo;s Bride. Praise the Lord that He is doing it!</p>
<p>It is wonderful to be saved, and it is really wonderful to be sanctified, to be spiritual, and to have abundance of life. But they are not the goal. We should not be for any one of these things in a separate way. We must be for the church life, the preparation of the Bride, and the building up of God&rsquo;s temple. God&rsquo;s temple, the Bride, the church, this is the goal!</p><h2 class="head1">STONES FOR THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>In the first chapter of John, the Lord Jesus was introduced to the people by John the Baptist. After this, two of John&rsquo;s disciples followed the Lord Jesus. One of these was Andrew, Simon Peter&rsquo;s brother. Then Andrew brought his brother to meet the Lord. &ldquo;And he brought him to Jesus, and when Jesus beheld him, he said, Thou art Simon the son of John: thou shalt be called Cephas, which is by interpretation, A stone&rdquo; (John 1:42). It is remarkable that when Jesus looked at Simon, He gave him a new name. This meant that He was going to change him and rearrange him to make him something else. The Lord was going to make him a stone for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>What a difference there is between the clear words of Jesus and the concept of today&rsquo;s Christians. We are not saved for some minor things. We are saved to be stones for God&rsquo;s building. We are stones, and we need to be built up into God&rsquo;s building. It is certain that Simon Peter did not forget this word. This is why he tells us in his epistle that we are living stones to be built up as a spiritual house. &ldquo;Ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:5).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOUSE OF GOD</h2>
<p>There is also another matter related to God&rsquo;s building in the first chapter of John. Nathanael was brought to the Lord by Philip, and the Lord told him: &ldquo;Verily, verily, I say unto you, Hereafter ye shall see heaven open, and the angels of God ascending and descending upon the Son of man&rdquo; (John 1:51). Jacob in Genesis 28:12-19 had a dream, and in that dream Jacob saw a ladder on the earth rising into the heavens. And the angels were ascending and descending on the ladder. This meant that the ladder was the connection between the heavens and the earth. Jacob called the name of that place Bethel, which means the house of God. Jesus told Nathanael that he would see the angels of God ascending and descending on the Son of man. This means that Jesus Himself is the ladder that connects the earth to the heavens, and He is going to make all of us stones for the building up of Bethel, God&rsquo;s house on the earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A TEMPLE RAISED IN RESURRECTION LIFE</h2>
<p>In John 2, the Lord told the Jews, &ldquo;Destroy this temple, and in three days I will raise it up. Then said the Jews, Forty and six years was this temple in building, and wilt thou rear it up in three days? But he spake of the temple of his body&rdquo; (John 2:19-21). Jesus meant that the Jewish people would kill Him, but He would raise Himself in resurrection. They killed one Jesus, but in resurrection millions were resurrected with Him. One was killed on the cross, but millions were raised up in resurrection. When Jesus was resurrected, we were all resurrected in Him and with Him (Eph. 2:6), and it is by this resurrection that Jesus will build up a spiritual house for God. It is in resurrection life that we are built together as Bethel, the house of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REGENERATION FOR THE BRIDE</h2>
<p>John chapter three is a most familiar chapter. Everyone knows that it speaks of the matter of regeneration, but very few Christians realize that this chapter reveals that regeneration is for the producing of the Bride. After Jesus was recommended by John the Baptist, people began to follow Him. Yet John the Baptist still practiced his ministry of baptizing. Because of this there were two groups: one following Jesus, and the other following John the Baptist. This caused some trouble. There was no problem as far as John was concerned, for he fully understood what he was doing, but his disciples did not understand. Therefore, they came to John and complained that Jesus was getting a bigger following than he. They were jealous for John (John 3:22-27). Then John said, &ldquo;Ye yourselves bear me witness, that I said, I am not the Christ, but that I am sent before him. He that hath the bride is the bridegroom: but the friend of the bridegroom, which standeth and heareth him, rejoiceth greatly because of the bridegroom&rsquo;s voice: this my joy therefore is fulfilled. He must increase, but I must decrease&rdquo; (John 3:28-30). John was clear that all the people should go to Jesus. He was the Bridegroom. He was the One who came for the Bride. Everyone must go to Him. In this way we see that regeneration in John 3 is for the producing of the Bride. I am afraid that many people today are not clear why they are saved, why they are regenerated. The reason we are saved and regenerated is for the purpose of being built into His Bride. The Lord is preparing us for the Bride. He is the Bridegroom, and we are the Bride under preparation.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s preparation of His Bride is not outward. It has nothing to do with outward teaching, instruction, adjusting, or improving&mdash;this is not the way of the Lord&rsquo;s preparation. The Lord prepares us by being in us! He is unsearchably rich within us, and this rich One is doing a transforming work. He is not changing us outwardly, but inwardly. It is a kind of metabolic change. Something of His element is wrought into our being to replace all our oldness. Then we will be renewed and transformed for the building of His Bride. This Bride which the Lord has prepared will be so glorious. It will not be prepared by teaching or adjusting, but by an inward metabolic change.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE FLOCK</h2>
<p>Now we must go on to John 10:16. Here Jesus tells us about the one flock. &ldquo;And other sheep I have, which are not of this fold: them also I must bring, and they shall hear my voice; and there shall be one flock, and one shepherd.&rdquo; The flock is a corporate matter. We are not individual sheep; we are a flock! So we must be flocked together. The real togetherness is the church. The church is the togetherness of the flock. As individual sheep we will be killed. We must be in the one flock, and this flock is the proper church life. Praise the Lord for one flock and one shepherd!</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONE LOAF</h2>
<p>In John 12:24, the Lord tells us something more of the corporate Bride. &ldquo;Verily, verily I say unto you, Except a grain of wheat fall into the ground and die, it abideth alone: but if it die, it bringeth forth much fruit.&rdquo; The Lord was the one grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying that He might produce many grains. But these many grains are not individual. They are to be ground into fine flour to make one loaf. This one loaf is the church (1 Cor. 10:17). The church is one body, one loaf, coming out of the mass production of the one grain. Jesus fell into the earth and died, but in His resurrection we were all raised up as grains to be made into one loaf. Strictly speaking, there is no such thing as an individualistic standing. We must be in the one flock and the one loaf.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MANY BRANCHES, ONE TREE</h2>
<p>Then in John 15 we see the one vine tree with all the branches. &ldquo;I am the vine, ye are the branches: He that abideth in me, and I in him, the same bringeth forth much fruit: for without me ye can do nothing&rdquo; (John 15:5). This is still the church, the corporate Bride. There are many branches, but there is only one tree. Do not think that you can be a separated branch. If so, you are withered, because you have been cut off from the vine tree. Praise Him that we are the many branches in the one vine tree! This is the proper church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PRAYER FOR ONENESS</h2>
<p>We all must realize that everything is for the Body. The church is not simply a group of individual believers; it is the built up Body of Christ. This is why the Lord prays in John 17 that we all may be one. &ldquo;That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us: that the world may believe that thou hast sent me. And the glory which thou gavest me I have given them; that they may be one, even as we are one: I in them, and thou in me, that they may be perfected into one; and that the world may know that thou hast sent me, and has loved them, as thou has loved me&rdquo; (John 17:21-23). The Lord Jesus prays in this prayer for the oneness, and this oneness is the church life. All Christians should be one! This is why we are against any kind of division. We should not be divided by any kind of doctrines or ordinances. If you speak in tongues and I don&rsquo;t, we still should be one. If you are immersed and someone else is not, you must all still be one. Regardless of what we like, we must be one!</p>
<p>To have the oneness and to be built up into one body is far from the concept and practice of today&rsquo;s Christianity. Everyone forms their own group according to their taste. But as long as we all believe in the Lord Jesus and have been regenerated, we are one! Believe me, the Lord today is gathering all the seeking Christians to be one. So many seeking Christians are coming together to be built up into this oneness. This is happening not only in the U.S.A., but on the entire earth. Many seekers of Christ are for this oneness today. I do not mean a kind of unification. That is of the devil. We are one already, we do not need to be unified. We are one in Him. We all have His life in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONE IN THE GLORY</h2>
<p>The Lord also prayed concerning our oneness in the glory. What is the glory? It is just the expression of Christ. Jesus as the Son of God has the glory to express God. Now this glory to express God has been given by Jesus to us. Now in this glory, in this expression of God, we are one! We are not for the expression of immersion, sprinkling, tongue speaking, or anything else. All of these things divide the saints. We are for the expression of Christ. To this very day the Lord&rsquo;s prayer in John 17 has not yet been fully fulfilled. Satan has used all of his divisive schemes and elements to divide the saints. Many people have come into our meetings and said that they do not like this or that. But who are they? They may not like it, but the Lord does! As long as there are no idols, no fornication, and no division, and as long as we all recognize the divine person of Jesus and His redeeming work, we are one. We should not oppose anything from others, neither should we impose anything on others. As long as we all express the Lord Jesus, that is sufficient.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John, we see that Jesus is everything to us for the purpose of producing the Bride. This Bride is the temple of God, the building. It is also the vine tree, the one flock, and the one loaf. This Bride is the proper church life with the oneness of all the believers. Praise the Lord! This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It is not by teaching, but by taking Christ as our life and as our everything.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE DISPENSING<br />
OF THE TRIUNE GOD<br />
FOR THE PRODUCING OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 4:32, 34; 5:19, 30; 7:18; 15:5; 6:38-57; 14:19-20; 17:21-23</h1>
<p>Matthew and John are different in many aspects, but as we have seen in the last message, they are also very much alike. One reveals that Jesus is the king, and the other shows us that Jesus is the very God. Both of them, however, tell us that this wonderful person is going to be with us and within us. This is His purpose. Whether He is this kind of person or that kind of person, His purpose is the same&mdash;to be with us and within us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>In this message we need to see another point which is covered by both of these books. This is the matter of the Triune God. There are sixty-six books in the Bible, but none are so clear on the Triune God as Matthew and John. In the last chapter of Matthew it is revealed that the Triune God is the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. &ldquo;Go ye therefore, and disciple all nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19).</p>
<p>From the Hebrew text, we see that in Genesis 1:1, the word &ldquo;God&rdquo; as the subject of the sentence is in plural number. &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth.&rdquo; But the word &ldquo;created&rdquo; as the predicate of the sentence is in the singular. This is quite meaningful. The subject is plural, but the predicate is singular. In the first verse of the Bible the Triune God is revealed in a secret way. It is not so clear unless you know the numbers of the Hebrew language.</p>
<p>Then in Genesis 1:26, God uses the plural pronouns &ldquo;us&rdquo; and &ldquo;our&rdquo; to denote Himself. &ldquo;God said, let <em>us</em> make man in <em>our</em> image, after our likeness.&rdquo; This really causes a problem. Is God singular or plural? If we say that God is singular, why does He use the plural pronoun for Himself? And if we say that God is plural, it is the greatest heresy. We know that we do not have three gods, but only one God. Yet how can we understand these verses? It is very difficult to understand this matter completely. In a sense, the Triune God is one of the greatest mysteries in the universe.</p>
<p>From Genesis 1, we go on to Genesis 3. After the fall of man, God again uses the plural pronoun for Himself. &ldquo;The Lord God said, Behold, the man is become as one of <em>us,</em> to know good and evil&rdquo; (Gen. 3:22).</p>
<p>In Genesis 11, men had become so rebellious against God that they built the tower of Babel and the city of Babel. Then God said: &ldquo;Go to, let <em>us</em> go down, and there confound their language, that they may not understand one another&rsquo;s speech&rdquo; (Gen. 11:7). Again we see that God uses the plural pronoun in referring to Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RELATED TO MAN</h2>
<p>When God uses the plural pronoun for Himself, it is always related to man. When God created man, He used the plural pronoun for Himself. When God took care of fallen man, He used the plural pronoun again. And when God came to deal with rebellious man, He used the plural pronoun. This means that the Triune God is for God&rsquo;s dealing with man. In Genesis 1, when God was creating all the other things, He never used the plural pronoun for Himself. It seems that to all the other creatures, God was just God Himself. But whenever God is related to man, He is Triune.</p>
<p>There is another occasion in the Old Testament when God uses the plural pronoun for Himself, and it is also related to man. It is found in Isaiah 6:8. Isaiah saw God on the throne, and then he heard God ask the question, &ldquo;Who will go for <em>us</em>?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Hence, we see that whether God created man, took care of fallen man, came to deal with rebellious man, or sent someone to proclaim something to man, He was Triune. God&rsquo;s relationship to man was almost always related to His being Triune.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FATHER, THE SON, THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the New Testament, there are two books that reveal that God is Triune more clearly. In the first book of the New Testament, Matthew, we see how God became incarnated, born of a virgin, to be a man called Jesus (Matt. 1:21-23). The very God through the incarnation became a man. Then, after He died and resurrected, He became the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). This is why in the last chapter of Matthew, the Lord told His disciples to go and disciple the nations, baptizing them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19).</p>
<p>It is at this point in the Bible that the Triune God is clearly revealed. Now we know that the &ldquo;Us&rdquo; in Genesis 1:26 is revealed in Matthew 28:19 as the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Does this mean there are three gods? No, there is only one God, because Matthew 28:19 speaks of three persons, but only one name. The Lord told them to baptize the nations into the name, not the names. Strictly speaking, the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; is not adequate to describe the Triune God. If you press the word &ldquo;persons&rdquo; too far, you will have three gods. The Father, Son, and Spirit are one God revealed in the Bible. </p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD FOR DISPENSING HIMSELF INTO MAN</h2>
<p>Why must God be the Father, the Son, and the Spirit? As we have seen in the Old Testament, it is for God to deal with man. In the New Testament it is further revealed that it is for God to dispense Himself into us. The Triune God is for the dispensing of Himself into man.</p>
<p>We should not think that the Son of God is separate from God Himself. The Son of God is God expressing Himself (John 1:1, 14, 18). The Son of God is the expression of God Himself. And God is the Spirit to reach us and get into us. This is our Triune God. In the Gospel of Matthew, the Trinity is clearly revealed not as a doctrine, but as a dispensation. He is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Now He charges us to baptize people into the name of the Father, and the Son, and the Holy Spirit, that is, to baptize them into this Triune God. This is for dispensing Himself into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ONENESS OF THE FATHER, SON, AND SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the Gospel of John, it is the same. John does not mention the Father, the Son, and the Spirit all in one sentence as Matthew does. But John does mention the Father, the Son, and the Spirit many times. In this Gospel, the Lord Jesus speaks of how He was sent by the Father, and that He can do nothing of Himself: &ldquo;I can of mine own self do nothing:...I seek not mine own will, but the will of the Father which hath sent me&rdquo; (John 5:30).</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus also mentions in the Gospel of John that when the Son speaks, the Father does the works: &ldquo;Believest thou not that I am in the Father, and the Father in me? the words that I speak unto you I speak not of myself: but the Father that dwelleth in me, he doeth the works&rdquo; (John 14:10). How could one speak and another do the works? But the Lord Jesus says that He speaks and the Father does the works, because He and the Father are one. John 14:10 is a big verse! Here the Lord says that He is in the Father, and the Father is in Him. The words that He speaks to us are not of Himself, but the Father that dwelleth in Him does the work. In brief, the Lord is saying that He speaks and the Father does the works, because He and the Father are one.</p>
<p>Then in the same chapter, the Spirit is also mentioned. &ldquo;And I will pray the Father, and he shall give you another Comforter, that he may abide with you for ever; even the Spirit of reality; whom the world cannot receive, because it seeth him not. neither knoweth him: but ye know him: for he dwelleth with you, and shall be in you&rdquo; (John 14:16-17, Gk.). So we see that John tells us about the Father, the Son, and the Spirit, and yet they are One. The Father is in the Son, and the Son becomes the Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) in order to be in us forever. This is why the Lord prays in John 17, &ldquo;That they all may be one; as thou, Father, art in me, and I in thee, that they also may be in us&rdquo; (John 17:21).</p><h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD IN THE EPISTLES</h2>
<p>The Triune God is clearly revealed in the Gospels of Matthew and John more than any other books in the Bible. Of course, there are some verses in the Epistles which show us the Trinity. One such verse is Ephesians 2:18. &ldquo;For through him we both have access by one Spirit unto the Father.&rdquo; It is through the Son that we have access by the one Spirit unto the Father. This clearly reveals the Triune God. But it is not for doctrine; it is for dispensing God into us. The Trinity is for the application of the rich God to us. Through the Son, by the Spirit, we have access unto the Father.</p>
<p>There is another verse in 2 Corinthians 13:14 that shows us the purpose of the Trinity. &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit, be with you all. Amen&rdquo; (Gk.). The grace of Christ is the grace of the Son. The love of God is the love of the Father. And this comes to us through the fellowship of the Holy Spirit. There is the Father with love, the Son with grace, and the Spirit with the fellowship. And this is for us all! It is clear that this is not something of doctrine. This is for application! This is for dispensing! Love is of the Father, grace is of the Son, and fellowship is of the Spirit. Love, grace, and fellowship are three in one. Love is the source, grace is the course, and fellowship is the application.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SENDER AND THE SENT ONE</h2>
<p>The Gospel of John really speaks of the Father as the source. The Lord says, &ldquo;I can of mine own self do nothing&rdquo; (John 5:30). This is because He is not the source. The Father is the source. The Father sends the Son, and the Son lives by the Father (John 6:57). Suppose I send a brother over to a certain place. I send him there, but I am here. In no way could he say that he lives by me. In this way the sent one cannot live by the sender, because the two are separate. But it is different with the Son and the Father. The Son is the sent one and the Father is the sender. Yet the sender is always one with the sent one. Hence, the Son can say that the Father sent Him, and He lives by the Father. The Father goes in His sending. He goes in the sent one. The Father is always with the Son (John 8:29; 16:32).</p>
<p>The Father, Son, and Spirit are for dispensing and application. For dispensing Himself into us, the one God needs to be the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. The two Gospels of Matthew and John are very much alike in the way of the Trinity, because both these books tell us that the Triune God is with us and going to be in us. Hence, He must be in three persons in order to come into us and be with us for ever.</p>
<p>Most people only believe in the Trinity as a doctrine. But we believe in the Trinity for application and for dispensing. &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the fellowship of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This should not be merely a doctrine or a teaching. The Triune God is for the dispensing.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A LIVING ORGANISM</h2>
<p>Now we need to see that the dispensing of the Triune God is that Christ may be our life supply for the producing of the Bride. This is for the building up of the church. Christ is our life, our light, our food supply, our water, our air, our everything! He is everything to us for producing the Bride. The church is a collection of believers. But, essentially speaking, the church is not an organization, but an organism. A chair is an organization of pieces of wood, but my body is built up together by the organic life. All the members of my body are together, not by being organized, but by something of life within.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON</h2>
<p>The Body of Christ is not a religious organization, but an organism in life, and the only way such an organism can be produced is by Christ being life to us. He is our life, and He is everything to us. This is why He must be our person. We have our own personality, but if we mean business with the Lord for the church life, we must take Him as our person. The most successful marriage is when the wife takes her husband as her person. In all weddings, whether ancient or modern, Eastern or Western, the bride always puts something on her head. This means that to have a successful marriage, the wife must be covered by her husband; she must take her husband as her person.</p>
<p>There are so many divorces today because there are two heads in one marriage life. The man likes to be the head, and the woman likes to be the head upon the head. Eventually, they divorce. All the married sisters must realize that on their wedding day their head was replaced. This is the principle of the Bible. It is not a kind of ordinance or regulation; it is the only way a marriage can stand.</p>
<p>In the church life, Christ is our real husband. Therefore, we must put aside our person, and take Him as our person. When He was on the earth, although He had a personality, He never lived by Himself; He always lived by the person of the Father. He said that He spoke nothing of Himself. Whatever He spoke, He spoke by the Father. He was not the source; the Father was His source. He had a person, but He did not live by His person. He lived by another person, the Father. He had a will, but He said that it was not His will, but the Father&rsquo;s will that must be done (Matt. 26:39). His will was always subdued to the Father&rsquo;s will. He did everything by the will of God.</p>
<p>This must be typified in the marriage life. The wife must not do anything by her own will. She must always act and live by the person of her husband. She must put off her likes and dislikes, and take him as her person. Sometimes we try to pray when we already know what the Lord wants. If we take the Lord as our person, we do not need to pray that much. It is possible to pray many prayers, yet never take the Lord as our person.</p>
<p>In the Gospel of John, we see a man who is the expression of God. Yet this man does not live by Himself, but by another person. In the church life, as individuals, we all must put aside our person and take the very Lord within us as our person. If we all do this, we being many are one body. We are one new man with one unique person. This corporate man does not express anything of the different individuals. Everything is of the one person. In this way the church is the expression of Christ, because the whole church takes Him as her person.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD FOR THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>There is another portion of John which we must see. &ldquo;Howbeit when he, the Spirit of reality, is come, he will guide you into all reality: for he shall not speak of himself; but whatsoever he shall hear, that shall he speak: and he will show you things to come. He shall glorify me: for he shall receive of mine, and shall show it unto you&rdquo; (John 16:13-15). The Lord Jesus says that the Spirit will speak nothing of Himself, just as the Son spoke nothing of Himself. The Spirit will make all that the Son is real to us. All that the Father has is in the Son, and all that the Son is, is realized by the Spirit. So here we see the matter of the Triune God again. The Spirit reveals to us all the matters of life and makes all the things of the Son real to us. This is the application. This is the dispensation of the Triune God into us. The Father is in the Son, and the Son is now the speaking Spirit, reaching us, indwelling us, making everything of the Son so real to us, and applying all the Son is to us.</p>
<p>The only thing we must now do is to put aside our person, our way of life, and take Him as our person and His will as our will. Then we will live only by Him. The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;As the living Father hath sent me, and I live by the Father: so he that eateth me, even he shall live by me&rdquo; (John 6:57). This is living by Christ, taking Him as our person. If we live this kind of life, we are qualified for the church life. There will be no division, no disputations, and no quarrels among us, because there will only be one person living in the new man and expressing the Triune God. This is the church life.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus also said, &ldquo;Because I live, ye shall live also. At that day ye shall know that I am in my Father, and ye in me, and I in you&rdquo; (John 14:19-20). This is the Triune God living as one within us, and we all are one, living in the Triune God. The church life is the Triune God living in all the believers, and all the believers living by the Triune God. He is within us, and we are within Him. He and we, we and He, are one corporate entity composed of the mingling of divinity and humanity. We are all one in the Triune God, taking Christ as our unique person. This is absolutely different from religion. This is the reality of a living person taken by us in our daily life. It is in this unique person that we are one and have the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A NEW MAN WITH ONE PERSON</h2>
<p>In John, the Lord Jesus was revealed as the very Son of God, the very expression of the Father. He did nothing of Himself and spoke nothing of Himself. He denied His person and took the Father as His person. He took the Father&rsquo;s will as His will. He did not express Himself, but the Father. This is the church life, a group of Christians forgetting their own person and taking another one as their person. Thus, the whole church becomes a new man with one person. The new man is the church, and the person of the new man is Christ. We all must put aside our person and take Christ as our person. Then we are one.</p>
<p>Christians today talk much about oneness. But as long as we do not take Christ as our person, there is no real oneness. The real oneness among us is the person of Christ being applied by us all. We must not live, walk, or do things by our own person, but rather take Christ as our person. In this way, simultaneously, we are all taking the same person, and we will be one. There are many beings, but only one head. This is the only way to have oneness and unity. It is not a kind of agreement among many individuals. The unity among the church is the one Christ taken by all His members as their one person. They all take Him as their unique person. They are many, yet their person is one. The oneness of this one person is the real unity of the church life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE INAUGURATION OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:9-11; 2:22-24, 32-36; 3:13-15; 4:10-12; 5:30-32; 7:55-56; 10:36b; Heb. 1:2-3; Phil. 2:9-11; Eph. 1:20-23; 4:7-12</h1>
<p>Our burden in these chapters is to continue to see the wonderful Person of Christ. In the previous chapters we have seen Christ in the four Gospels. That brought us from the incarnation to the resurrection of Christ. We have seen how Christ was the incarnated one, and eventually He became the resurrected one. Now we want to continue to see the wonderful Person of Christ in the Acts and Epistles.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>After the four Gospels, we have the book of Acts. In the first chapter of Acts, the main thing is the ascension of Christ. Here we see how the disciples saw Christ ascending up to heaven. &ldquo;And when he had spoken these things, while they beheld, he was taken up; and a cloud received him out of their sight. And while they looked stedfastly toward heaven as he went up, behold, two men stood by them in white apparel; which also said, Ye men of Galilee why stand ye gazing up into heaven? this same Jesus, which is taken up from you into heaven, shall so come in like manner as ye have seen him go into heaven&rdquo; (Acts 1:9-11).</p>
<p>Many Christians know that Jesus ascended to the heavens after His resurrection, but not many know the real meaning of the ascension of Christ. We all know the meaning of His crucifixion and His resurrection. However, it would be very difficult for us to explain the real meaning of the ascension of Christ. In the Bible, the ascension of Christ is a great thing. In all of the above verses, there are some main points concerning the ascension of Christ. By putting them together, we will see the significance of Christ&rsquo;s ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HIS EXALTATION</h2>
<p>First of all, the ascension of Christ means His exaltation. After He was resurrected, God highly exalted Christ. Man had killed and even buried Christ in the tomb. But God raised Him up. Moreover, He not only raised Him up from the grave, but highly exalted Him. &ldquo;Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; and that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father&rdquo; (Phil. 2:9-11). Through His ascension, Christ has become the One Who is far above all. He has been exalted far above all principalities, powers, might, and dominion, and above every name that is named. This is true not only in this age, but also in the age to come. &ldquo;Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come&rdquo; (Eph. 1:20-21). This means that in the whole universe, nothing is above Christ. Everything is under Him. He is far above all! Hallelujah! We all must see that Christ is the One Who is far above all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LORD AND CHRIST, PRINCE AND SAVIOR</h2>
<p>Another point is that by being exalted far above all, He was made the Lord and Christ. &ldquo;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom you have crucified, both Lord and Christ&rdquo; (Acts 2:36). He was also made the Prince, which means the Leader and the Author. And He was made the Savior. &ldquo;The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (Acts 5:30-31). By being exalted, the Lord Jesus was made the Lord, the Christ, the Prince, and the Savior. Of course, we may say that He was the Savior already. Why then was He made the Savior by being exalted? We must realize that before His ascension, He was the Savior, but not officially. He was officially made the Savior by being exalted. By His ascension, He was made the Lord, the Christ, the Prince or the Author, and the Savior.</p><h2 class="head1">A NAME ABOVE ALL NAMES</h2>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s ascension and exaltation to the highest, He was given a name that is above all names, a name to which every knee shall bow and every tongue shall confess. The name is Jesus. Some may argue that the name Jesus was given to Him at the time of His birth. Why at His ascension is He given the same name, the name to which every knee should bow and every tongue should confess? Again, the name given to Him at His birth was not so official. At His ascension, the name Jesus was made more official. Before His ascension, officially speaking, &ldquo;Jesus&rdquo; was not a name that is above all names. It was by His ascension that God declared to the whole universe that the name of Jesus is above all names. &ldquo;Wherefore God also hath highly exalted him, and given him a name which is above every name: that at the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of things in heaven, and things in earth, and things under the earth; And that every tongue should confess that Jesus Christ is Lord, to the glory of God the Father&rdquo; (Phil. 2:9-11). This is a kind of declaration, announcement, and proclamation to the whole universe. All the universe has to know that God has officially made the name Jesus above all names.</p>
<h2 class="head1">POSITIONED TO RECEIVE THE GIFTS</h2>
<p>The fourth point is that in His ascension Jesus was positioned to receive all the gifts from the Father and to give the gifts to His believers. This is for the building up of His Body. &ldquo;But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men. And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of the ministry, for the building up of the body of Christ&rdquo; (Eph. 4:7-8, 11-12).</p>
<p>Before the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, He could give the gifts, but in a sense, He did not have the official position to do it. By His ascension He was officially positioned to receive all the gifts from the Father and pass these gifts on to His members for the building up of His Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HEAD OVER ALL</h2>
<p>The last point which we must see concerning the Lord&rsquo;s ascension is that all things were put under His feet, and He was made the Head over all things to the church. &ldquo;Which he wrought in Christ when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all&rdquo; (Eph. 1:20-23).</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S INAUGURATION</h2>
<p>By considering all these points which we have mentioned, we see the real meaning of the ascension of Christ. The ascension of Christ is really the inauguration of Christ. When a president of the United States is elected, he does not officially take office until the day of his inauguration. According to the legislature, he must be inaugurated. Before his inauguration, he has been elected the president, but it is not official. It is not until the day of his inauguration that he officially becomes the president of the United States.</p>
<p>On the day Jesus was born, He was our Savior, but it was not official. There was no inauguration. Even after Christ was crucified and resurrected from the dead, it was not announced to the whole universe. Not until the day Jesus was exalted by the right hand of God to the highest place in the universe did God make the declaration. It was at this time that God inaugurated Christ into His post.</p>
<p>Before this inauguration date, and even before the forty days when the Lord was with His disciples following His resurrection, Jesus had a secret ascension. In the morning of His resurrection He went to the Father. John 20 tells us that on the resurrection morning Mary Magdalene began to touch Him, but the Lord told her, &ldquo;Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father; and to my God, and your God&rdquo; (v. 17). Then on the evening of the same day He openly showed His disciples His hands and His side and bid them to handle Him (Luke 24:39). Therefore, He must have had a secret ascension to the Father on that same day. This is why He told Mary to tell His brethren that He ascended to His Father. But this was an ascension in a secret way. Nobody saw it.</p>
<p>Forty days later, Jesus had the public ascension. It was universally open. All the disciples saw Jesus ascending, and the angels declaring that He would return in the same manner. It was this declared ascension which was the inauguration of Jesus. By His ascension, Jesus was inaugurated into His post. Then everything became official. He became the official Savior.</p><h2 class="head1">A MAN MADE LORD</h2>
<p>Now we know the meaning of the ascension of Christ. It was His official inauguration. First of all, He was made the Lord. As God, before His incarnation, the Lord Jesus was the Lord already. But after His incarnation, this very God became a man. God was the Lord, but man was not. Yet the Lord became a man, and this man was crucified on the cross, buried, and resurrected from the dead. It was at this time that the man Jesus became the Lord. For God to be the Lord, there is no need of any kind of inauguration. But for a small man from a lowly town in a despised country to be made the Lord requires a real inauguration. He was not made the Lord as God. As God He was Lord already. Now this man from Nazareth was inaugurated to be the Lord of all.</p>
<p>Peter, preaching on the day of Pentecost, said, &ldquo;Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ.&rdquo; Peter not only preached Christ as the Savior, but also as Lord of all. He never realized that Jesus was so great before the ascension. By the ascension he realized that the very man Jesus, whom he had been following for three and a half years, had been inaugurated to be Lord of all!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRIST</h2>
<p>Peter also declared on the day of Pentecost that Jesus was the Christ. He was made both Lord and Christ. In Matthew 16 Peter had said that Jesus was the Christ. &ldquo;And Simon Peter answered and said, thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (Matt. 16:16). However, at that time, Jesus was not officially the Christ. The word &ldquo;Christ&rdquo; means the anointed one, and the anointed one in the Bible means the appointed one. God anointed this man, which means God appointed Him. Christ was God&rsquo;s anointed and appointed one. This appointment was made official by the ascension of Christ. By the ascension, God officially appointed Jesus as the Christ.</p>
<p>Christ was anointed and appointed to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, which is to build up His temple, the New Jerusalem. Praise the Lord! God appointed Jesus to do this, and this appointment was made official by His ascension. When Jesus ascended on high, God made the appointment official. In this way God told the whole universe that this is the very one whom He has appointed to accomplish His eternal plan. So Jesus became God&rsquo;s Christ officially at His ascension.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ORIGINATOR</h2>
<p>But this is not all. He was also made the Prince, which means the Author, the Originator. All the things of the old creation had become old and useless to God. Now God has a new creation where everything is new. By His ascension Jesus was inaugurated to be the Author and Originator of everything new. He is not only the Author of life, but of everything.</p>
<p>Suppose we went to Jeremiah and asked him to tell us the meaning of a member of Christ. He would say that he simply did not know. If we were to ask the same thing of Moses, he also would not know. And if we were to ask Adam the meaning of an apostle, he would not know what we were talking about. This is because an apostle is something new. An evangelist is something new. A member of Christ is something new. They did not have any of these things in the Old Testament.</p>
<p>So many things in the church life today are new. These new things have been originated by Christ. God inaugurated Christ into a post to originate so many new things. Ephesians has many terms pertaining to many new things. Elijah, David, Moses, and Adam did not know any of these things, but today the smallest one among us knows them all. This is why Jesus told His disciples that the least in the kingdom is greater than those in the Old Testament (Matt. 11:11). We are bigger than Moses, David, or Elijah. They were in the Old Testament before the coming of the new Originator. After them, Jesus was inaugurated as the Originator, the Author, to originate so many new things. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>One day Andrew brought his brother Peter to the Lord Jesus. Immediately the Lord Jesus told Simon that his name was Cephas, meaning a stone. This was something new. In God&rsquo;s old creation, every man was made of clay. But in God&rsquo;s new creation, something more is originated by Christ. We must be a stone because Christ Himself is a stone. Later, Peter said, &ldquo;This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other: for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved&rdquo; (Acts 4:11-12). Jesus was a stone, so He made all of us stones. This is something new. He is the Author. He is the Originator.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, we cannot find a verse telling us that we must take Christ into us as our everything. But Jesus came with something new. He said that He was the bread of life, and the one that eats Him will live by Him (John 6:35, 57). This is really new. From Adam through John the Baptist, no man was edible. But now Jesus comes and tells us to eat Him. He is the real Originator. He not only told us to eat Him, but also to come and drink of Him: &ldquo;In the last day, that great day of the feast, Jesus stood and cried, saying, If any man thirst, let him come unto me, and drink&rdquo; (John 7:37). This is also entirely new.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus originated all the new things and passed them on to the church. But the church became degraded and eventually lost everything. So the poor church went back to the old things of the Old Testament, mainly the doctrines and prophecies. But today in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we must come back to the origin. The Lord Jesus is the Author of His recovery. He is the Originator. We did not start the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. He did!</p>
<p>Today the Lord is telling us to come back to eat, drink, and breathe of Him. These things are not only new to Moses and Elijah, they are even new to today&rsquo;s Christians. In some places where we have shared these things, we have been rebuked. Some felt that it was terrible to say the Lord wants us to eat Him today. But this is altogether originated by the Lord Jesus. He was and still is the Originator, and this Originator was inaugurated at His ascension. He was made the Lord, the appointed One, and the Originator or Author.</p><h2 class="head1">THE OFFICIAL SAVIOR</h2>
<p>It was also by the ascension that Jesus became the official Savior. God declared to the heavens, to the earth, and even to the unbelieving Jews that Jesus of Nazareth has been officially appointed by God to be their Savior. Therefore, He was authorized by God to give repentance to Israel and forgiveness of sins. &ldquo;The God of our fathers raised up Jesus, whom ye slew and hanged on a tree. Him hath God exalted with his right hand to be a Prince and a Savior, for to give repentance to Israel, and forgiveness of sins&rdquo; (Acts 5:30-31). Hallelujah! Our Savior is not a secret Savior. Our Savior today is an official Savior. He was officially inaugurated in the whole universe.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HEAD OVER ALL TO THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Jesus was inaugurated to be the Lord, the Christ, the Originator, and the Savior. Moreover, He was inaugurated to be the Head over all. &ldquo;And hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fulness of him that filleth all in all&rdquo; (Eph. 1:22-23). Christ is the Head that heads up all things. I may illustrate with my own body. It seems that my two legs support my body, but if you were to cut off my head, my body would fall. It is not my two legs that hold my body, but my head.</p>
<p>The man Jesus was appointed the head over all things. If we were to take away Christ as the head, the whole universe would fall apart. He heads up all the universe, not simply to maintain its existence. No, Christ is the head over all things <em>tothe church.</em> He is not the head over all things <em>for</em> the church, but <em>to</em> the church. He is heading up all things to produce and build a church that will be God&rsquo;s eternal dwelling place.</p>
<p>Once, after a meeting in a certain place, a lady rebuked me saying that I spoke too much about the church life and not enough about the family life. I told her that she already knows the family life and does not need me to tell her anything about it. I said that the thing she does need is the church life. For years she had been a member of a certain denomination, yet no one had ever told her about the church life. It was too bad that she was so distracted by the family life that she did not care to hear about the church life. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today we are for the church life. I realize that some may argue by saying that the church life needs the proper family life. In a sense I agree, but if you would have the proper family life, you must have the proper church life. If you say that the church life requires the family life, I would say that the family life needs the church life more. Why is it rare to find the proper family life today? Simply because the church life is not known. Anyone who really knows the proper church life will have a proper family life. The Lord Jesus was not inaugurated as head over all things to the family, but to the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING ALL THE GIFTS FOR THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Praise the Lord for His exaltation. Through His ascension He has been given a name that is above all names. He was inaugurated the Lord, the Christ, the Originator, the Savior, and the Head to the church. Now this Christ has the position to receive all the gifts from the Father. In His inauguration as the Lord of all, as God&rsquo;s appointed one, as the Originator, the Savior, and the Head of all, He has the position to receive from the Father the gifts for the producing and building of the church. These gifts include all the members of His Body, In His ascension, God not only gave the Holy Spirit to this inaugurated one, but also all the gifts as His members. He was given all of God&rsquo;s chosen people. Before the foundation of the world, in eternity past, God marked us out to be His chosen ones. We became God&rsquo;s elect. Then when the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens, in that inauguration, the Father gave Him all His chosen people, including you and me. Therefore, on the day of Pentecost He came to anoint His Body, His members. We will see something more about this in the next chapter.</p>
<p>We have seen Jesus as a wonderful Person, inaugurated into His position as the Lord of all, the appointed One, the Author of everything, the Savior, and the Head of all things to the church! Here in His inauguration He was given the Holy Spirit of promise, all the gifts from the Holy Spirit, and all the members. Then after ten days He came back to produce the Church and build up the Body. This is the real meaning of the ascension of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE ASCENSION OF CHRIST<br />
FOR THE BUILDING OF THE BODY</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 2:32-33, 36; 4:10-12; 5:40-41; Phil. 2:9-11; Eph. 1:20-23; 4:7-12</h1>
<p>Very few Christians have ever paid much attention to the ascension of Christ. Of course, even the attention that has been paid to the incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection of Christ has not been adequate. When people talk about the incarnation or the birth of Christ, it is always in a very shallow way. They celebrate His birth at Christmas, and recall a child born in a manger to be their Savior. Most Christians did not see, and still do not see, that the incarnation of Jesus is much deeper than that.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REAL MEANING OF THE INCARNATION, CRUCIFIXION AND RESURRECTION</h2>
<p>What is the real meaning of the incarnation? It is the bringing of God into humanity. The incarnation of Jesus brings in the mingling of divinity with humanity. It is deeper than merely the birth of a Savior. For four thousand years after Adam was created, God was God, and man was man. However close God may have been to man at times, God never mingled Himself with man until the incarnation. The incarnation of Jesus brought God into man and formed a mingling of divinity with humanity. Almost two thousand years ago, four thousand years after Adam&rsquo;s creation, there was a man by the name of Jesus. That man was the mingling of divinity with humanity. Through Him God was in man, and man was in God. There was such a mingling. This is the deeper meaning of the incarnation of Christ.</p>
<p>Then we come to His crucifixion. The crucifixion of Christ means termination. The cross of Christ terminated everything! It terminated sin, Satan, the world, and you and me. The crucifixion of Christ put an end to every negative thing. All that was sinful, old, rotten, fallen, corrupt, devilish, demonic, and satanic was ended by the cross of Christ! Most Christians only realize that the cross of Christ accomplished redemption. That is true, and we are very much for the redemption of Christ on the cross. But the crucifixion also has a deeper meaning. It terminated every negative thing.</p>
<p>What then is the meaning of the resurrection of Christ? The resurrection of Christ is a new beginning with a new creation. The crucifixion of Christ terminated everything, and His resurrection originated everything new. The cross of Christ terminated all the old, negative things, and the resurrection of Christ brought forth a new start. It was a new start not only in creating power, but also in generating power. Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion terminates and His resurrection germinates. Everything old and negative has been terminated by the crucifixion of Christ, but that was not the end. The end became the beginning. Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion was followed by His resurrection. The termination was followed by germination. The resurrection of Christ was, and still is, a real germination.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE ASCENSION</h2>
<p>After His resurrection, Christ ascended to the third heavens to God the Father. As we have seen in the last message, the best word defining the ascension of Christ is inauguration. The ascension of Christ was His inauguration. By being exalted to the right hand of God, He was inaugurated into His office. He was not elected by you and me; He was selected by God.</p>
<p>Before the ascension Christ was the Redeemer, the Savior, and the Author of life, yet He was not inaugurated. It was by His ascension that He was exalted by God the Father. Satan did his best to bury Jesus in a sepulchre, but God raised Him up! He not only raised Him up, but also highly exalted Him to His own right hand. The right hand of God is the peak of the universe. Satan tried to put Jesus down, but God raised Him and highly exalted Him to His own right hand. This is the ascension, the exaltation, the inauguration of Christ. In this exaltation God declared to the whole universe that the man Jesus is now the Lord of all! &ldquo;This Jesus hath God raised up, whereof we all are witnesses....Therefore let all the house of Israel know assuredly, that God hath made that same Jesus, whom ye have crucified, both Lord and Christ&rdquo; (Acts 2:32, 36).</p><h2 class="head1">A MAN MADE LORD OF ALL</h2>
<p>It is not that God is the Lord of all, but that a man by the name of Jesus has been made the Lord of all. God has made Him the Lord of <em>all.</em> He is also the anointed One, the Christ, as well as the Author, the Originator, and the Savior. God has put all things under His feet. He is the Head. Nothing is above Him. Rather, He is above all; all things have been put under Him. He is the Lord of all, the Anointed of God, the Author, the Savior, and the Head of all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TO THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>What is the purpose of this? Why has God made Christ all of these things? Very few Christians know the significance of Christ&rsquo;s ascension. It is clearly revealed in two portions of the book of Ephesians. The first is in chapter one: &ldquo;Which he wrought in Christ, when he raised him from the dead, and set him at his own right hand in the heavenly places, far above all principality, and power, and might, and dominion, and every name that is named, not only in this world, but also in that which is to come: and hath put all things under his feet, and gave him to be the head over all things to the church, which is his body, the fullness of him that filleth all in all&rdquo; (Eph. 1:20-23).</p>
<p>This portion of Ephesians tells us that God raised up Christ and exalted Him above all, putting all things under His feet, and giving Him to be the head over all things to the church. Therefore, we must see that the ascension is for the church. The ascension is to build up the body of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GIFTS FOR THE BODY</h2>
<p>Then in Ephesians four we are told that Jesus, in His ascension, firstly received all the gifts from the Father, and then gave these gifts to the church for the building up of the Body. &ldquo;But unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. Wherefore he saith, when he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men....And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, to the work of the ministry, to the building up of the body of Christ&rdquo; (Eph. 4:7-8, 11-12).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S GOAL</h2>
<p>When Christ was inaugurated to be Head over all things to the church, He received all the gifts to give them to men for the building up of the Body. Most Christians have never seen the ascension of Christ in a full way because today&rsquo;s Christians do not pay much attention to the church. Some feel that as long as people are getting saved, it is good enough. I agree that it is good to be saved, but simply to be saved is not sufficient. Others say that after being saved, we must be spiritual. I also agree that this is good, but to be spiritual still does not reach God&rsquo;s goal. God&rsquo;s goal is not merely to have people saved or to be spiritual. God&rsquo;s goal is to build a Body for Christ.</p>
<p>If we have never been saved, there is no peace until we are saved. We who are saved have all experienced this peace. But after we receive peace through salvation, we find that we are still short. We received peace, but we also obtained hunger. So we begin to pursue after Christ that we may grow. The more we grow, the more hungry we get. It is because we are short of the church. When the Lord finally leads us to the church, we find that the hunger has disappeared. We are satisfied, and we are home! This is God&rsquo;s goal. When we come to God&rsquo;s goal, we are satisfied. Before we came into the church, we did not have satisfaction. But today as the church people in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we do have satisfaction. Hallelujah! Here we have the sense within that we have hit God&rsquo;s goal, the recovery of the proper church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO KINDS OF WORK</h2>
<p>The ascension is the inauguration of Christ for the producing and building up of the church. Most Christians think that after the Lord was crucified, He finished His work. That is true. John 19:30 tells us that the Lord said, &ldquo;It is finished.&rdquo; But we must realize what was finished. God&rsquo;s redemption was finished on the cross, but not the building up of the church. We cannot add anything to the redemption that was accomplished by Christ. That was completely finished. But the building up of the church had not started by that time. The Lord has two kinds of work. One is the work of redemption, and the other is the building up of the church. The first kind of work was finished at the cross. But the second was not started until after the ascension, on the day of Pentecost. The Lord finished the redemptive work; therefore He was qualified to be the builder of the church. Only Christ is the right person to build the church. Because He accomplished redemption, He was qualified. So God exalted Him to His own right hand. This exaltation is God&rsquo;s ratification. God ratified the crucified and resurrected Christ. By exalting Him to His right hand, God fully approved of Him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE QUALIFICATIONS</h2>
<p>In the whole universe, God has a great project to accomplish: that is, to build the New Jerusalem. No other project could be greater than this. Who has the qualifications for such a building work? Christ! He has been fully qualified. All the highest educational degrees on this earth mean nothing. God&rsquo;s great project requires much more, and only Christ has the qualifications.</p>
<p>Who defeated Satan? Christ! Who put him to the end? Christ! Who bruised the head of the serpent? Christ! Could you do it? Who took away all the sins of the world? Christ! Who conquered death? Christ! Who took a tour in hades to see what death could do? Christ! Who entered hades and resurrected from it? Christ! Who could meet the requirements of God&rsquo;s righteousness? Christ! Who can meet the holy requirements of God? Christ! Who can meet the requirements of the glory of God? Christ!</p>
<p>Only Christ is qualified. We are short of all the requirements. All the degrees on this earth could not qualify us. Only Christ has all the divine degrees. Whatever God required, Christ accomplished. Therefore, God fully approved Him.</p>
<p>Then on the day of the ascension God declared the inauguration of Christ. He was inaugurated into His post. Now He is the official Redeemer. Now He is the official Savior. Now He is the official Author of life. Whatever He is, is official, and whatever He is doing is official. Praise Him! He is the only One that is qualified to carry out God&rsquo;s great project of building the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Has Christ accomplished redemption? His ascension says, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Has Christ dealt with the serpent? His ascension says, &ldquo;Yes!&rdquo; Whatever Christ did was approved by God in His ascension. Now He is seated at the right hand of God. He is more than qualified. He is fully approved by God. Now He is the greatest operator to carry out God&rsquo;s divine project of building the New Jerusalem. He is the builder. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>Have you ever realized that Christ is a qualified builder to carry out God&rsquo;s project of building the New Jerusalem? Christ has accomplished the work of redemption. Now He is operating to build the New Jerusalem. God&rsquo;s intention is to obtain the New Jerusalem. Today&rsquo;s church life is just a small miniature of the New Jerusalem. This is God&rsquo;s project. Who can carry out such a project? Only Christ!</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR BASIC THINGS</h2>
<p>To complete this project there is the need of four basic things. First of all, there is the need of the stones. The New Jerusalem could not be built without stones. The wall of the holy city is built with jasper and has twelve foundation stones (Rev. 21:17-20). Praise the Lord that we all are the living stones for His building (1 Pet. 2:5). The second need is that of life. The New Jerusalem is a matter of life. In the New Jerusalem there is the tree of life and the water of life. Then, thirdly, there is the need of the Spirit. For God&rsquo;s project, we need the Spirit. Finally, the fourth need is that of the technique, the skill to build such a tremendous building. This is the gifts. For such a building, we need the stones as the materials, the life, the Spirit, and the gifts.</p>
<p>We are the materials. In the last message, I mentioned how in eternity past, God the Father in His foreknowledge chose us and marked us out. But in time we became fallen. God&rsquo;s marked-out people became fallen. Therefore, Christ came to accomplish redemption for us and brought us back. In John 17:2, 6 we see that God the Father gave all His chosen ones to the Son. Even before the Son redeemed us, God gave us all to the Son.</p>
<p>Then, when Christ was exalted to the Father at the time of His ascension, the Father made Him to be the Author of life, He gave Him the Spirit, and He gave Him all the gifts. God made Christ the Author of life in order that Christ would take all His chosen people and put His divine life into every one of them. Then He would fill and empower them with the Spirit and make them functioning gifts to the Body. They not only would have the gifts; they themselves would become gifts.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s ascension, He was officially authorized and inaugurated into His position, and He was commissioned with the Kingship, the Lordship, and the Headship. After His ascension, He came back on the day of Pentecost to put all the materials together. He collected them, He put the divine life into them, and He poured out the Spirit upon them. They received the life within and the Spirit without. Then with this life and Spirit He imparted the spiritual ability to every believer. Therefore, all the believers obtained the life, the Spirit, and the functioning ability. Then eventually everyone, from the least to the greatest, became a gift to the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">COLLECTING THE MATERIALS</h2>
<p>After the ascension, from the day of Pentecost, Christ started the collection of God&rsquo;s chosen materials. One was Saul of Tarsus. He was so religious and traditional, and he even persecuted the church (Gal. 1:3-14). But one day while he was on his way to suppress the believers of the Lord, the wonderful Lord came to him, and he was knocked to the ground. The Lord said, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting me?&rdquo; (Acts 9:1-5). He was surprised. He had been persecuting Stephen and many other believers on the earth, but not one in the heavens. So he said, &ldquo;Lord, who are you?&rdquo; He did not know who the Lord was, yet he called on the Lord. And he got saved! When he said, &ldquo;Lord, who are you?&rdquo; the Lord Jesus got in! Then the Lord told him that He was Jesus, the One whom he had been persecuting. It was in that way that Saul was saved, gathered, and collected.</p>
<p>The principle is the same with all of us. When we were saved, not one of us had any intention of coming into the church life. In fact, some of us intended to oppose it. Yet the Lord found a way to collect us. Praise the Lord, we were collected! Many among us can testify that just by attending one meeting, we were caught! I do know what the Lord is doing here. He is collecting His material for His building.</p>
<p>About twelve years ago, we were only a handful of people in Los Angeles. Yet we prayed boldly that we would take the earth! If someone had heard us at that time, they would have said that we were crazy. How could such a small group of people take the earth? Yet we were led by the Lord to pray that way. Now the signs are here. The U.S.A. has been taken already! And the recovery has gone to Germany, Britain, Switzerland, Denmark, France, Africa, New Zealand, and Australia. And this is just the beginning! Christ is collecting all the materials for His building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOOKED!</h2>
<p>Have you been &ldquo;hooked&rdquo; for the Lord&rsquo;s recovery? I have really been &ldquo;hooked.&rdquo; Once you are &ldquo;hooked,&rdquo; you can never extricate yourself! This is Christ collecting materials for His building. More and more will get &ldquo;hooked.&rdquo; This is not just the crucified Christ for redemption, or the resurrected Christ for life. This is the ascended Christ collecting all the materials which the Father has given to Him. We can be sure that the Lord has a way to get all the materials He needs.</p>
<p>Many of the young people can testify that after they were hooked for the Lord&rsquo;s building, they loved the Lord more. They never enjoyed life as much as they are enjoying it now. Surely when the Lord collects us, He will put us into the abundant life. So many people today are talking about the baptism of the Holy Spirit. But the real baptism of the Spirit is to be put into the Spirit. Many times in our meetings we have the real sense that we have been immersed in the Spirit. It seems that we are in the heavens, but we are still on the earth. This is the proper and real experience of the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Once we have been collected by the ascended Christ, it is really hard to get away. I do know of some young people who came into the church life, and after a while they left. But some time later they came back. They testified that they tried desperately to get away, but somehow they could not quite make it. Once we have been collected by the Lord, it is really hard to escape. This is because we have been put into the real enjoyment of the Spirit with the riches of the abundant life.</p>
<p>Once we have been collected, we have the life within, we have the Spirit, and we have all the persons as gifts to the Body. Unto every one of us is given grace according to the measure of the gift of Christ. We all have a measure of something of Christ, and all have been given to the Body as gifts. Regardless of how weak and small we are, as long as we are in the church, we are gifts.</p>
<p>The materials, the life, the Spirit, and the gifts, are all for the producing and the building up of the Body. This is the work of the ascended Christ to carry out God&rsquo;s project. He is doing this work right now! Day by day the ascended Christ is collecting the materials, putting His life into them, pouring out the Spirit upon them, and imparting the abilities to them that they may be gifts to the Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GIFTED PERSONS</h2>
<p>Eventually we see in Ephesians 4 that the gifts are the persons. &ldquo;When he ascended up on high, he led captivity captive, and gave gifts unto men....And he gave some, apostles; and some, prophets; and some, evangelists; and some, pastors and teachers; for the perfecting of the saints, to the work of the ministry, to the building up of the body of Christ&rdquo; (Eph. 4:8, 11-12). All of these persons are the materials collected, filled with life, empowered with the Spirit, and talented with the spiritual abilities. Eventually they all become the gifts. These gifts are for the perfecting of the saints to the work of the ministry, which is the building up of the Body of Christ. The ascension of Christ is for the building up of the Body! Christ, the wonderful ascended One, has been fully inaugurated by God. He is the builder to carry out God&rsquo;s project, which is the church life today and which will eventually consummate in the New Jerusalem in the future. This is the real meaning of the ascension of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE BAPTISM IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 1:5, 8; 2:4, 17a, 21, 33, 38; 10:44-47; 11:15-16; 1 Cor. 12:12-14; Gal. 3:27-28</h1>
<p>We have seen that with Christ first of all there is the incarnation. Following this we have the crucifixion, resurrection, and then the ascension. After the ascension, we have the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Incarnation brings God into man, mingling divinity with humanity. The crucifixion terminates and ends every negative thing: sin, the world, the flesh, the old man, the self, and Satan. All negative things have been fully terminated on the cross. The cross was the end of the old creation. Crucifixion was followed by resurrection. Resurrection is the germination of a new start that we may have new life and be in the new creation. After this Christ was exalted to the right hand of God. This exaltation was a kind of inauguration to put Jesus into His office. He was positioned, authorized, and inaugurated into His post to carry out God&rsquo;s project of building God&rsquo;s eternal dwelling place. Today this is the church, and ultimately it will be the New Jerusalem. In His ascension He has been qualified, approved, appointed, and even committed with the divine life, the Holy Spirit, and all the gifts. Now this ascended Christ has all the items that are necessary for the building of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A BIG MYSTERY</h2>
<p>The first step the Lord took to accomplish God&rsquo;s project was to baptize all His members in the Holy Spirit. These were all the people which God had chosen and predestinated in eternity past to be given to Him. He baptized all of them into Himself. This was the baptism in the Spirit. Here we have a big mystery, and this is why among Christian teachers there are different opinions, interpretations, understandings, and practices concerning the matter of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In the New Testament there are a few mysteries. The person of Christ is one. He is both God and man. He is the Son, the Father (Isa. 9:6), and the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). This is according to the pure revelation of the Bible. We have no doubt that Jesus is God incarnated; He did become a man. We all have to confess that Jesus did come in the flesh. He was God as well as man. As the expression of God, He is the Son of God. Yet Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given...and his name shall be called...The mighty God, The everlasting Father.&rdquo; The Son given to us is called the everlasting Father. This is why He is so mysterious. But this is in the Word of God. Then the New Testament says in 2 Corinthians 3:17, &ldquo;Now the Lord is that Spirit.&rdquo; He is the Son, yet He is called the everlasting Father. He is the Lord, yet the Lord is that Spirit. Jesus is altogether a mystery. We should not try to understand Him by our limited mentality. He is too mysterious.</p>
<p>How can we understand the mysterious Jesus when we cannot even understand ourselves? Do you know that you have two hearts? One heart is the physical heart, and the other is the psychological heart. Our physical heart may be quite perfect, but our psychological heart is corrupt. Can you tell where this psychological heart is in your being? We cannot even understand ourselves. Then how can we understand the wonderful Jesus? The person of Christ is a real mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>In the New Testament there is another mystery&mdash;the matter of the Triune God. God is one, yet He is triune. How can you define Him? When I was a young Christian, I tried to understand the trinity of God. But the more I tried, the more I could not understand. The Triune God is a mystery.</p>
<p>To say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are three persons of one God is just a kind of interpretation. This should not be pressed too far; otherwise it will lead to three Gods. Many Christian teachers do hold the concept that the Father, Son, and Spirit are three Gods, but they dare not to express this in words openly. Some say that the Father, who has a person, is one God, and the Son, who also has a person, is another God, but the Spirit, who does not have a person, is merely an influence, not another God. All these concepts with their interpretations are complicated and complicating. We should not get involved with them.</p>
<p>We cannot understand the mystery of the Triune God adequately. We can and should only believe the pure Word of God. Matthew 28:19 speaks of the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit. There is one name for the Father, Son, and Spirit, because God is triune. Then 2 Corinthians 13:14 says, &ldquo;The grace of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the love of God, and the communion of the Holy Spirit be with you all.&rdquo; Christ, God, and the Spirit are the one Triune God. We cannot tell how God could be triune, but according to the Bible we do know that He is triune. We have to forget about the theological terminology, but take care of the pure Word of the Bible. How could one God be the Father, the Son, and the Spirit? It is a mystery. This is why His name is called &ldquo;Wonderful.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">THE THIRD MYSTERY</h2>
<p>The third mystery in the New Testament is the matter of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. This is altogether a mystery. It has been a matter of argument for over nineteen centuries.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO EXTREMES</h2>
<p>When I first came to this country, I met two groups of people within a short time. Firstly, I was invited to a dinner in Los Angeles and met the leader of a group which denies the water baptism. He interpreted the baptism such as mentioned in Matthew 28:19, Romans 6:4, etc. all as baptism in the Holy Spirit. He was strongly opposed to water baptism. Then I went to Texas. While I was speaking there in a meeting about being baptized in the Holy Spirit, a lady from a certain group stood to interrupt my speaking and to argue with me about being saved by water baptism. This group believes that if you are not immersed with water by them, you cannot be saved. It has to be with their immersion, not with any other. These two occasions showed me the two extremes in the argument concerning the baptism in the Holy Spirit. It surprised me and saddened me very much.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPEAKING IN TONGUES</h2>
<p>Some people say that to be baptized in the Holy Spirit you must speak in tongues. According to them, if you have never spoken in tongues, you have never received the baptism in the Spirit. Some even say that if you have never spoken in tongues, you are not regenerated. It is ridiculous!</p>
<p>So many Christians today know the name of Watchman Nee. I was with him about twenty years and knew him very well. He never spoke in tongues. Does this mean that Watchman Nee did not have the Holy Spirit? Does it mean that he was never regenerated? In 1936 I was sent to work in North China by the work under his leadership. While I was there I became influenced to speak in tongues, and I took the lead to help many others to speak in tongues. Of course, this news traveled to Shanghai where Watchman Nee was. Immediately I received a cable from him. It simply said, &ldquo;Not all speak in tongues.&rdquo; He was one-hundred percent against the teaching that speaking in tongues is the unique manifestation of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The baptism in the Holy Spirit is a mystery. How could anyone say that a man like Watchman Nee did not have the Holy Spirit? It is doubtful that Spurgeon, the king of preachers, ever spoke in tongues. We spent much time to study his writings, but we could not find a hint that he spoke in tongues. Does this mean that he did not have the baptism in the Holy Spirit? D. L. Moody was also a great preacher. There is no indication in his writings that he spoke in tongues. Many people know Jesse Penn-Lewis. She wrote a good number of spiritual books on the cross. She was absolutely against the so-called Pentecostal movement emphasizing the speaking in tongues in England. Andrew Murray was a very spiritual person, yet in his books you cannot find anything about him speaking in tongues. I can give you a list of names of many spiritual giants that never spoke in tongues. This is why it is too much to say that if you have never spoken in tongues you have never received the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>The Pentecostal movement came to this country in the early years of this century. At the beginning, Dr. A. B. Simpson, the founder of the Christian Missionary Alliance Church, was with the Pentecostal movement. He was one of the most spiritual persons that America has ever produced. When most of the leaders of this movement made the decision that speaking in tongues is the unique manifestation of the baptism in the Holy Spirit, he would not agree and withdrew from the movement.</p>
<p>Why are there so many different opinions and interpretations about the baptism in the Holy Spirit? Because it is a mystery. Therefore, we must come back to the pure Word of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SON AND THE FATHER</h2>
<p>We need to see clearly in order to see the baptism in the Holy Spirit. We should never think that the Triune God is three Gods. We can never separate the Son of God from the Father. In John 14:8-10 Philip asked the Lord to show them the Father and they would be satisfied. The Lord immediately rebuked him by saying, &ldquo;Have I been so long time with you, and yet hast thou not known me Philip? He that hath seen me hath seen the Father; and how sayest thou then, Show us the Father?&rdquo; Then He told Philip that the Father was in Him, and that He was in the Father. Are the Son and the Father two or one? According to the pure Word of the Bible, we should not separate the Son from the Father. The Father is in the Son, and the Son is in the Father. The Son and the Father are one (John 10:30). Is there then no difference? Yes, there is some difference, for the Son is the Son and the Father is the Father. But the Son is also called the Father in Isaiah 9:6. Therefore, we see that it is a mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SON AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the same way, we should not separate the Spirit from the Son. According to the Bible, this is absolutely wrong. We have at least two verses which tell us that Christ is the Spirit. Second Corinthians 3:17 says, &ldquo;Now the Lord is that Spirit,&rdquo; and 1 Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (A.S.V.). Then is there no difference between Christ and the Holy Spirit? Surely there is some difference. Christ is the Christ, and the Holy Spirit is the Holy Spirit. But to say that they are two is also wrong, because these clear verses tell us that Christ is the Spirit. It is a real mystery.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BAPTIZED INTO CHRIST</h2>
<p>When we come to the matter of the baptism in the Holy Spirit, it is absolutely not wise to separate Christ from the Spirit. Galatians 3:27 says, &ldquo;For as many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; Have you been baptized into Christ? When were you baptized into Christ? Many Christian teachers insist on saying that Christ is the baptizer, but here it says that we have been baptized <em>into</em> Christ. This translation in the King James Version is according to the original Greek text. Christ the baptizer has baptized us <em>into</em> Himself. To say that Christ has baptized us into the Spirit is logical. But to say that Christ has baptized us into Himself is rather mysterious. This is because Christ is not only the baptizer, but also the Spirit into whom He has baptized us. Hence, to be baptized into Him is to be baptized into the Spirit. This corresponds to 1 Corinthians 12:13 which says, &ldquo;In one Spirit were we all baptized.&rdquo; Therefore, we should never separate the Holy Spirit from Christ. The Holy Spirit is just the realization of Christ. The Holy Spirit is nothing less than Christ. He is the reality of Christ. This is why He is called the Spirit of reality. Without the Holy Spirit, we can never realize Christ, meet Christ, or touch Christ. Today Christ dwells in us, and the Spirit also dwells in us. This simply means that the two as one dwell in us.</p>
<p>After His ascension, Christ became qualified, approved, anointed, and inaugurated. Moreover, He was committed with all the necessary things to complete God&rsquo;s project. The first step He took after this was to come down in the form of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost. On the one hand, He was the baptizer, and on the other hand, He was the Spirit for this baptism. As the Head of the Body, He was the baptizer. He put all of God&rsquo;s chosen people into the Spirit, that is, into Himself. On the day of Pentecost, the ascended, approved, and inaugurated Christ came down in the form of the Spirit into whom His people were immersed.</p><h2 class="head1">AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT</h2>
<p>What is the baptism in the Holy Spirit? It is Christ putting all of God&rsquo;s chosen people into Himself as the Spirit. On the day of Pentecost He put the Jewish part of God&rsquo;s chosen people into Himself (Acts 2). Then in the house of Cornelius He put the Gentile part of His Body into Himself (Acts 10). These two parts put together are the baptism in the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 12:13). It is an accomplished fact, just like the crucifixion. When did Christ die for you? Was it when you confessed your sins and believed in Him? No, He died for our sins before we were born. Furthermore, we all know that we were crucified with Christ. This also was accomplished before we were born. This is God&rsquo;s divine economy. This is God&rsquo;s accounting.</p>
<p>The crucifixion of Christ was once for all. It does not mean that today, when a sinner repents and confesses to the Lord Jesus, the Lord comes to die for him. Then tomorrow another sinner repents and confesses, and then the Lord comes to die for him. The Lord Jesus was crucified once and for all.</p>
<p>Allow me to illustrate with a circle. A circle signifies eternity, without beginning and without end. Now we put the cross of Jesus at a certain place on the circle. Adam is on the circle, as well as Abraham, David, and Peter. We also are on the circle. Then who is before the cross and who is after? No one is before, and no one is after. Jesus died for and with all of us on the cross. He died there once for all. He died there for Adam, for Abraham, for David, for Peter, and He died there for us. We do not need to ask Him to come and die for us. He has died for us already. All we need to do is to thank Him that He has already died for and with us. It is an accomplished fact. We only need to receive what He has done.</p>
<p>In the same principle, the baptism in the Holy Spirit is an accomplished fact. On the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius, Christ as the Head put His whole Body into Himself. Otherwise, how do you interpret 1 Corinthians 12:13. &ldquo;For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit&rdquo; (A.S.V.). This verse says that we all <em>were baptized</em> in one Spirit into one Body. When were we all baptized in one Spirit into one Body? It is the same as when we were crucified. We were all crucified with Christ at the same time. In like manner, if we are Jews, we were baptized in one Spirit into one Body on the day of Pentecost. If we are Gentiles, we were baptized in the house of Cornelius. The whole Body was baptized on these two occasions.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NO THIRD OCCASION</h2>
<p>By reading our New Testament carefully, we see that only these two occasions, one at Pentecost and the other at the house of Cornelius, are called the baptism in the Holy Spirit. There is no third occasion. The others are not the baptism, but the experience of the baptism which has already been accomplished. The baptism in the Holy Spirit was accomplished before we were born. What we need is just to participate in this baptism that has been effected on the Body already. Christ died for all of us once and for all. In the same principle, Christ put His Body into Himself as the Spirit once and for all.</p>
<p>Do you believe that baptizing people into water simply means to put them into the water? Indeed not. That is just a physical sign. The reality is that we are putting them into Christ. This is what Paul meant when he said, &ldquo;So many... were baptized into Jesus Christ&rdquo; (Rom. 6:3), and &ldquo;As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; When we baptize people in water, we need faith in our spirit to realize that we are putting them into Christ. The water baptism is just an outward sign of this.</p>
<p>The ascended Head, after being inaugurated by the Father, came back in the form of the Spirit. As the Head of the Body, He was the baptizer, and as the Spirit He put the Body into Himself. The Body is composed of all God&rsquo;s chosen people, those whom God had marked out in eternity past. On the day of Pentecost and in the house of Cornelius Christ put all of them into Himself. We were all baptized there. We were all put into Christ. Whether we speak in tongues or we do not speak in tongues, we are in Christ. I know many that have never spoken in tongues, yet they have full assurance that they have been baptized into Christ. Hallelujah! We all have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body.</p>
<h2 class="head1">POSITIONED TO DRINK</h2>
<p>This is not all. The first half of 1 Corinthians 12:13 says that we were all baptized in one Spirit into one Body. But the next part of the verse says that we were all made to drink of one Spirit. It is not simply a matter of being baptized. That has been accomplished already. Today it is a matter of drinking. We all have been made to drink. This means that we all have been positioned to drink. God can position us, but He cannot drink for us. We must drink for ourselves. Christ has baptized us into Himself as the Spirit, and He has positioned us to drink of Him as the Spirit. Now we must drink of Him by calling, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus.&rdquo; This is clear by reading 1 Corinthians 1:2. &ldquo;Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours.&rdquo; Paul did not say &ldquo;with all that read the Bible,&rdquo; or &ldquo;with all that speak in tongues,&rdquo; but &ldquo;with all that call upon the name of the Lord.&rdquo; According to the whole book of 1 Corinthians, to call on the name of the Lord is to drink of Him. This is also proved in the same chapter that speaks of our being positioned to drink. First Corinthians 12:3 says, &ldquo;Wherefore I give you to understand, that no man speaking by the Spirit of God calleth Jesus accursed: and that no man can say Lord Jesus, but in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (Gk.). This means that whenever we say, &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; we are in the Holy Spirit, that is, we are drinking of the Spirit.</p>
<p>To call on the name of the Lord is to drink of the Spirit. Some say that this is merely a psychological phenomenon. But try calling, &ldquo;O Confucius, O Plato, O George Washington!&rdquo; When you call on these names nothing happens. But whenever we call on the name of Jesus, no one can deny the sweetness, the refreshment, and the comfort. This is the drinking of Christ as the Spirit. We all have been baptized, and we have been positioned to drink. Now we must open our mouth and call on the name of the Lord. &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; When we do this, we are drinking of one Spirit. Then we have the reality of the oneness in the Body. Praise the Lord! It is so real and simple. We should never forget that we all have been baptized into Christ as the Spirit, and He has positioned us that we may drink of Him all the time. Now what we need is not to be baptized again, but to drink of Him every day. The more we drink of Him, the more we will grow into Him. Then we will enjoy the reality of the Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>

<h1 class="title">ONCE FOR ALL</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 3:11; Acts 1:5, 8; 2:1-4; 8:14-18; 9:17-18; 10:44-47; 11:15-17; 19:1-6; Mark 16:16-18</h1>
<p>In the Bible we see clearly that God had an eternal purpose in eternity past to work Himself into a group of human beings, that He might be their life, nature, and everything, and that they might be His corporate expression. This is God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. The Bible calls this corporate expression the Body of Christ, the church, the house of God. Ultimately this corporate entity will consummate in the New Jerusalem, the eternal expression of God in a corporate way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GOVERNING PRINCIPLE</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s purpose is a kind of governing principle. If we would understand what is revealed in the Bible, we first of all must see the governing principle. If we do not have such a governing principle, our understanding of the Bible will be loose, wild, and full of error. It is similar to white lines marking the lanes on the highway. They are there to regulate us, and we must drive our car within them. Likewise, whenever we come to the Bible, we must take heed to the governing lines and principles. The regulating lines of the Bible are God&rsquo;s eternal purpose of working Himself into us that He may be our content, and we may be His expression.</p>
<p>How can God accomplish this? It is by His anointed One, the Christ. Christ came to accomplish God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. He did not come simply to save us from hell that we might go to heaven. That is altogether too low. Neither did He come to make us spiritual and heavenly like the angels. These are all religious concepts. This is why we need the governing principle of the Bible. God wants to work Himself into us as our content, making us His expression.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIVE STEPS</h2>
<p>For Christ to accomplish His purpose, He had to pass through several steps. The first was incarnation, the second was crucifixion, the third was resurrection, and the fourth was the ascension. Then the fifth step was the baptism of His Body into Himself. Now we are waiting for the sixth step, which will be His coming back.</p>
<p>We have seen that incarnation means the mingling of divinity with humanity, the mingling of God with man. This was a real wonder. God and man were mingled together. God was brought into man, and man was made one with God. This man&rsquo;s name was Jesus. Jesus was and still is the mingling of God with man. God&rsquo;s eternal purpose was to work Himself into man. Now Jesus became such an example. He became God mingled with man. This is the real meaning of the incarnation.</p>
<p>What is the meaning of crucifixion? We should not simply say that it is redemption. Crucifixion did accomplish a full, complete, and finished redemption for us. But redemption is not the only significance of crucifixion. Crucifixion is also the termination of all the negative things. Everything that is old, negative, dead, dark, and subtle has been terminated. Even before we were born we were terminated.</p>
<p>We should not attempt to understand this with our logical mind. All spiritual things cannot be fully comprehended by our logical mind. Two thousand years ago we were all terminated. This is what the Bible says! &ldquo;Knowing this, that our old man is crucified with Him&rdquo; (Rom. 6:6). As a young child many of us sang the song, &ldquo;Jesus loves me this I know, for the Bible tells me so.&rdquo; Now we can say, &ldquo;I was terminated this I know, for the Bible tells me so.&rdquo; It is not what we think or feel. We must forget about our thinking and feeling. We only need to accept the pure word of the Bible.</p>
<p>How were we created by God? It is clear that we were born of our parents. Yet the Bible says that God created us. We were created by God when Adam was created six thousand years ago. We all were created in Adam, and we all became fallen in Adam. Adam&rsquo;s fall was our fall, because we were all within him. Before we were born, we were fallen in Adam. In the same principle, before we were born, we were on one hand redeemed and on the other hand terminated in Christ.</p>
<p>Now we can see how we were terminated at the time of Christ&rsquo;s crucifixion. We all were terminated there. Paul says in Galatians 2:20, &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.&rdquo; We were terminated two thousand years ago on the cross with Christ.</p>
<p>Crucifixion means termination, and resurrection means germination. All the old creation was terminated, and the new creation was germinated. After this, we have seen that the ascension means inauguration. Surely this is a heavenly language to say that incarnation is mingling, crucifixion is termination, resurrection is germination, and ascension is inauguration.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE TIME OR MANY TIMES?</h2>
<p>Now we come again to the matter of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. We all must realize that all the major steps taken by the Lord are once for all. Incarnation was once for all! Crucifixion was once for all! Resurrection was once for all! Ascension was once for all! The Lord&rsquo;s coming will be once for all! Then, what about the baptism? Many Christians think that the baptism in the Spirit occurs many times. But this is not true. Christ does not need to be incarnated again whenever someone is saved. He did this once for all. Neither does He need to be crucified again when we confess our sins. His crucifixion is once for all. We believe it, take it, and enjoy it. In the same way, the resurrection and ascension are once for all. Now we must also see that the baptism is once for all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUT INTO CHRIST<br />
FOR THE FORMATION OF THE BODY</h2>
<p>The real meaning of the baptism in the Holy Spirit is the putting of us into Christ. &ldquo;As many of you as have been baptized into Christ have put on Christ.&rdquo; Formerly we did not have Christ. Then Jesus put us all into Himself, so that we have put on Christ. The baptism is to put us all into the Spirit, who is Christ (2 Cor. 3:17), for the formation of the Body. We all have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body. This is not a personal matter; it involves the whole Body. God&rsquo;s intention from eternity past is to have a Body for Christ. When He ascended to heaven in His inauguration, Christ received the life, the Spirit, and all the gifts. Then after ten days, He came to put all of us into Himself. On the day of Pentecost, He put the Jewish part of His Body into Himself, and then later in the house of Cornelius He put the Gentile part of His Body into Himself. He finished it. We all were baptized. He put us into Himself in a corporate way once for all for the formation of the Body. Nothing could be clearer from the pure Word.</p>
<p>Incarnation means the mingling of divinity with humanity. Crucifixion means the termination of all old things, resurrection means the germination of all the new things, ascension means the inauguration of Christ, and the baptism means the putting of us into Christ for the formation of the Body. The coming advent of Christ is the completion of the corporate mingling of divinity with humanity for eternity. This is the governing principle of the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONCE FOR ALL IN TWO PARTS</h2>
<p>We all must realize that the baptism in the Spirit was accomplished once for all. It has been completed in two parts: with the Jews at Pentecost, and with the Gentiles in the house of Cornelius. In these two parts, the entire baptism in the Spirit was fully accomplished. In Matthew 16 the Lord Jesus told Peter that He would build His church and give him the keys to the kingdom. There was not just one key, but two. On the day of Pentecost Peter used one key, and in the house of Cornelius he used the other. At the same time, the ascended Head baptized these two parts of His Body into Himself. Only these two cases are called in the Scriptures the baptism in the Holy Spirit. There is no third case.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE PECULIAR CASES</h2>
<p>In Acts 2, at the time of Pentecost, the disciples and many new converts received the baptism in the Spirit. Then two or three days later, five thousand were saved. It does not say anything about the baptism in the Spirit there. Many times in the book of Acts people were saved, but the baptism in the Spirit is not mentioned.</p>
<p>Besides the two cases at Pentecost and the house of Cornelius, the book of Acts gives us another three cases. One is the case of the Samaritans in Acts 8. The second is the case of Saul of Tarsus in Acts 9. The third is that of the Ephesians in Acts 19. Why are these three cases mentioned, and others are not? It is because all these three cases are peculiar. The Samaritan case is peculiar because the Jews would not recognize the Samaritans. The case of Saul of Tarsus was peculiar because he was saved directly through the Lord Jesus. Then the Lord told Ananias that Saul was saved, and he must go there to confirm it so that Saul might become a useful vessel to the Lord. So Ananias went to lay hands upon Saul of Tarsus, as Peter and John went to lay their hands on the Samaritans to confirm what the Lord did to them.</p>
<p>The third case with the Ephesians was also peculiar. They had heard the Gospel, but only the partial Gospel with the baptism of John from Apollos (Acts 18:24-25). They did believe in Christ, but in an inadequate way. So Paul preached the full Gospel to them, laid hands on them, and they received the Spirit.</p>
<p>Only these three peculiar cases needed the recognition by the laying on of hands. Nothing is mentioned about all of the regular cases. There was no laying on of hands at Pentecost or in the house of Cornelius because these were cases when Christ as the Head of the Body directly put His Body into Himself. There was no intermediate instrument. All the other three peculiar cases had the laying on of hands by some representative of the Body, because at that time the Body had been baptized into Christ already. There was no need for the Head to baptize individual believers any more. But the Body had to confirm the new members by its representatives. Then whatever had been accomplished on the Body would flow into the new members through the channel of the laying on of hands.</p>
<p>Whenever someone refers to the case of the Samaritans or of the Ephesians for the baptism in the Spirit, we must also refer them to the case of the three thousand or of the five thousand (Acts 2:41; 4:4) where nothing concerning the baptism in the Spirit is mentioned. The same is true of the multitude at Corinth (Acts 18:8). Many times in the book of Acts it tells us that many people believed in the Lord Jesus without mentioning the baptism in the Spirit. Therefore, we all must be clear that the baptism in the Spirit was fully accomplished once and for all by the Head. He was the baptizer and He was also the Spirit into whom He baptized His Body. He baptized His Body into Himself once for all. From henceforth He never did it again. The most that was needed was for the Body to send some representatives to the peculiar cases to lay hands upon them that they might receive what had already been accomplished on the Body. For the ordinary cases, there was no such need. Normally, when we are baptized into water, that is an indication that we have been baptized into Christ already in the once-for-all baptism in the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">TONGUES AS A SIGN?</h2>
<p>Some so-called Pentecostals and charismatics say that on the day of Pentecost all spoke in tongues, but let us look carefully at the verses. &ldquo;And they were all filled with the Holy Spirit and began to speak with other tongues, as the Spirit gave them utterance&rdquo; (Acts 2:4). It does not say, &ldquo;They were all filled with the Holy Spirit and <em>all</em> began to speak with other tongues.&rdquo; There is no &ldquo;all&rdquo; concerning speaking with other tongues. If I were to say that last night we all came to the meeting and began to pray, does that mean that everybody prayed? This is exactly the same structure grammatically. We all came to the meeting, but not all did pray. In the same way, they all were filled with the Spirit, but not all spoke in tongues. This is quite clear.</p>
<p>Then let us read Acts 19:6: &ldquo;And when Paul had laid his hands upon them, the Holy Spirit came on them; and they spake with tongues and prophesied.&rdquo; Do you believe that all twelve both spoke in tongues and prophesied? I cannot believe it. I do believe that some spoke in tongues and some prophesied, but I do not believe that all of them did both.</p>
<p>There are some who would say that unless you speak in tongues, you have never received the Holy Spirit. They refer to Mark 16:17-18. &ldquo;And these signs shall follow them that believe: In my name shall they cast out demons; they shall speak with new tongues; they shall take up serpents; and if they drink any deadly thing, it shall not hurt them; they shall lay hands on the sick, and they shall recover.&rdquo; If anyone uses these verses to ask if you speak in tongues, you had better ask them if they handle serpents and drink any deadly thing. To try to prove it in this way is ridiculous! What the Lord means here is that among all His believers throughout all the generations some will cast out demons, some will speak in tongues, some will handle serpents, and some will drink a deadly thing and it will not hurt them. Do not try to do these things to prove that you are saved! If you do, you may not be lost, but there is a chance you will be dead!</p>
<p>The matter of healing is also mentioned in these verses. But we should not think that everyone who believes in the Lord will be able to heal. Among all believers through all generations, some did speak in tongues, but not all. Some did heal others, but not all. Some did handle serpents without being hurt, but not all. Speaking in tongues is only one of many items.</p>
<p>Most of the tongue-speaking Christians say that tongue speaking is the unique manifestation of the baptism in the Holy Spirit. Generally, there are two schools among them. One says that if you do not speak in tongues, you are not even regenerated. But most of them do not believe this. Most believe that you could be regenerated, but you could not have the baptism in the Holy Spirit unless you speak in tongues. Therefore, this second school insists that speaking in tongues is the proof that you have the baptism in the Holy Spirit. But it is hard to find a verse in the Bible to prove this.</p>
<p>I have already mentioned how Brother Watchman Nee never spoke in tongues. He was not against it, but, according to the Bible, he was strongly against the claim that speaking in tongues is the unique manifestation of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT THE GENUINE TONGUE</h2>
<p>As I mentioned, for a time I was influenced to speak in tongues. But even then I doubted that all the sounds uttered by the so-called tongue-speaking people were genuine tongues. According to Acts 2, all the tongues are a kind of language or dialect. The word for tongues in Acts 2:4 is &ldquo;glossa.&rdquo; Then in Acts 2:6, the word is &ldquo;dialektos&rdquo; which means dialect or language. Verse 8 also uses the word &ldquo;dialektos.&rdquo; Then verse 11 uses the word &ldquo;glossa.&rdquo; It is so clear that in this part of the Word, &ldquo;dialektos&rdquo; and &ldquo;glossa&rdquo; are used interchangeably. This means that a tongue must be a dialect. But today so many so-called tongue-speaking people only utter the same few sounds repeatedly, which can hardly form a dialect. This is why I believe that much of the tongue speaking today is not the genuine tongue. I know many stories to prove this point.</p>
<p>However, we must see that the matter of the baptism in the Holy Spirit is once for all. &ldquo;For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body&rdquo; (1 Cor. 12:13). We do not need to seek for another baptism; what we need is to experience the unique baptism that has been accomplished on the Body of Christ already. We only need to be on the right standing of the Body. Then whatever has been accomplished on the Body is ours for the building up of the Body of Christ, the church. The baptism in the Holy Spirit is for the formation and building up of the Body. It is an accomplished fact. We only need to take it by faith as we did the incarnation, the crucifixion, the resurrection, and the ascension.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE PROPER EXERCISE OF THE GIFTS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 2:17-21; 1 Cor. 12:7-11, 27-31; 13:1, 2, 8, 11; 14:1, 5-6, 12, 18-19, 23-26, 31-32</h1>
<h2 class="head1">AN ACCOMPLISHED FACT</h2>
<p>From the past messages in the last issue, we have seen what the baptism in the Holy Spirit is. It is simply Christ putting His Body into the Spirit, which means into Himself. He did this once for all. Of course, according to the record of the book of Acts, He did it in two parts. The first part was accomplished on the day of Pentecost to the Jewish believers, and the second part in the house of Cornelius to the Gentile believers. Only these two cases in the Bible are called the baptism in the Spirit. All the other cases are an experience of the baptism which was upon the Body already. They received it by the transmission from the Body through the representing members of the Body.</p>
<p>We have also seen that the baptism in the Holy Spirit is an accomplished fact. It was done once and for all, just as the other steps taken by Christ. The incarnation is an accomplished fact; likewise the crucifixion and resurrection. By reading 1 Peter 1:3, we see that the resurrection of Christ was accomplished once for all. &ldquo;Blessed be the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ, which according to His abundant mercy has begotten us again unto a living hope by the resurrection of Jesus Christ from the dead.&rdquo; This word clearly tells us that all saints have been begotten by God through the resurrection of Christ. This does not mean that whenever a child of God is to be born again, Christ must be resurrected again. The one resurrection of Christ is sufficient. Regenerations are many, but the resurrection of Christ is only one. In the same way, the experiences of the baptism are many, but the baptism in the Holy Spirit was once for all. All the steps taken by Christ to accomplish God&rsquo;s purpose were done once for all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SPIRIT BAPTISM AND WATER BAPTISM</h2>
<p>Another point we must see is that the Spirit baptism and the water baptism are two aspects of one thing. The Spirit baptism is the reality, and the water baptism is the expression. The expression without the reality means nothing. Romans 6 tells us clearly that we are baptized into Christ by being buried with Him in baptism. Some say that Romans 6 refers to water baptism; others say that it refers to the Spirit baptism. However, in the normal situation the water baptism should be the expression of the Spirit baptism. Comparatively speaking, the Spirit baptism is much, much more than the water baptism. One is the reality, the other is the expression. If the expression is just a form, it means nothing. We do believe that in the pure Word the reality of baptism is of the Spirit; but we do need an expression, as seen in water baptism, to express the reality of immersion in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO SCHOOLS</h2>
<p>There are many concepts regarding the baptism in the Holy Spirit, and many divisions have been created by all these concepts. The biggest issue is caused by the so-called Pentecostal Christians. They are mainly of two schools. The first says that if you do not speak in tongues, you are not regenerated. Of course, this is altogether erroneous. We do know of a good number of spiritual giants who never spoke in tongues. The second school says that if you do not speak in tongues, you have not experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit. To say this also neglects history. What about C. H. Spurgeon and D. L. Moody? Do you believe men like them did not have the baptism? Yet they never spoke in tongues.</p>
<p>The greatest revival in this century took place in Wales at the first of the century. The leader of this revival was a man by the name of Evan Roberts. The revival was so prevailing that all the people of Wales believed in the Lord. Yet there was no speaking in tongues. Does this mean that they did not have the baptism in the Spirit? Evan Roberts later worked with Jessie Penn-Lewis, who was absolutely against the so-called Pentecostal movement. There are many spiritual giants in history who had the impact, yet never spoke in tongues. This proves that the second school is also wrong.</p>
<p>Those in the Pentecostal movement insist that all have to speak in tongues. But according to the Bible, this is absolutely not so. Some speak in tongues, and some do not. This is the proper revelation we have from the Scriptures. To say that speaking in tongues is over is too much, but to say that everyone must speak in tongues is also too much. This forces people to bring forth an imitation of human manufacture. It is hard for people to believe that this kind of human-manufactured tongue is genuine. Speaking in tongues is supposed to be miraculous. If this is so, why do we have to learn to speak? If we must learn to speak, that is not miraculous. Balaam&rsquo;s donkey in the Old Testament certainly did not learn to speak the human language. That was absolutely miraculous; it was the genuine tongue. Do you believe that Peter and John and all the others on the day of Pentecost learned to speak in tongues? So many tongue speakers say that you must turn your jaw and exercise your tongue, saying something like, &ldquo;Praise Jesus,&rdquo; very fast. Should the children of the Lord believe this kind of thing?</p>
<p>To say that everyone must speak in tongues will surely discourage and disappoint some of the saints. Some could never speak in tongues, even in a manufactured way. Yet they can believe in the Lord Jesus and they can praise the Lord. This is why the so-called Pentecostal movement has caused so much division. We must learn to be genuine. We are not opposing any genuine tongues. As long as they do not insist that everyone must speak in tongues, we must be open to them. We should not oppose, but they should not impose. Several times in the meetings of the churches some people have spoken in tongues and even gave the interpretation, but we did not stop them. We must take such a general outlook in order to include all the believers. A local church is all-inclusive. But we would ask the tongue-speaking saints not to impose and insist that tongue speaking is a must.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXERCISE OF THE GIFTS</h2>
<p>Now we must go on to see the exercise of the gifts. The Pentecostal people always insist to have the exercise of gifts in the meetings. When they come into our meetings, the first thing they look for is whether there is the speaking of tongues with interpretation or not. They also look for the so-called prophesying. If there are not these kinds of things in the meeting, they say there is no exercise of gifts. But this is not true! Today in the churches we have more exercise of the gifts. What they mean is just tongue speaking, interpretation, and prophesying. But in our meeting we have more exercise of the gifts than they do.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 12:8-10, the first gift is not speaking in tongues, but the word of wisdom. For so many years, the word of wisdom has been in the meetings of the churches. The next gift is the word of knowledge. Have you ever heard the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge as you have in the church meetings? This is not boasting. This is just the fact. Are these not the exercise of the gifts? The third gift in this passage is faith, and the fourth is healing. The fifth is miracles, the sixth is prophesying, and the seventh is the discerning of spirits. Then the last two at the end are speaking in tongues and interpretation. There are nine gifts in this passage. The foremost are the words of wisdom and of knowledge. This is what we exercise all the time in our meetings. We exercise the top gifts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRADITIONAL TEACHING</h2>
<p>People used to talk about the so-called nine manifestations of the Spirit as we have just mentioned. But the manifestations of the Spirit are not just these nine. Even in 1 Corinthians 12:28 there are another two. In this verse, &ldquo;helps&rdquo; and &ldquo;governments&rdquo; are also listed as gifts. There are more. In Acts, chapter two, visions and dreams are mentioned, which are also not mentioned with the nine. So we should never say that there are only nine manifestations of the Spirit. There are more! The record of the New Testament is very economical. Just because it mentions nine in one place does not mean that that is all.</p>
<p>Today in Christianity there are many traditional teachings. People teach in a traditional way, and people also understand in a traditional way. I have pointed out these other items of the manifestation of the Spirit to prove that the so-called nine manifestations of the Spirit are just traditional. Therefore, we should not go along with the traditional teaching, but rather come back to the pure Word.</p>
<p>Let us now consider the matter of speaking in tongues in the meetings. After reading all the above verses, does the Apostle Paul encourage people to speak in tongues in the meetings or discourage them? If we are fair and honest, we must admit that he is writing to discourage them. But the tongue-speaking people like to quote Paul in 1 Corinthians 14:5, &ldquo;I would that ye all speak with tongues.&rdquo; But they leave out the rest of the verse, &ldquo;But rather that ye prophesy.&rdquo; It is clear in this passage that what is needed for the building up of the church is not the tongue speaking, but the prophesying.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PROPHESYING</h2>
<p>Concerning the matter of prophesying, I do believe we need some proper understanding. In the Bible the word &ldquo;prophesy&rdquo; has three meanings. The first meaning is to tell for. In this meaning, to prophesy is to tell something to people for God. Isaiah is a long book of sixty-six chapters, but not all are predictions. Isaiah told the people of Israel many things for God. The second meaning of prophesying in the Bible is to tell forth or to declare. Many times the Old Testament prophets and the New Testament writers did this. The third meaning is to foretell. This is to predict or to tell beforehand. All the Epistles of the Apostle Paul are prophesying. He tells things to people for Christ, he tells forth, proclaims, and declares the things of Christ to people, and he also foretells some things, such as the matters of the Lord&rsquo;s second coming.</p>
<p>However, the Pentecostal brothers do not care for the first two meanings. They say that to prophesy is only to foretell, and they have their way to do it like the Old Testament prophets. I have heard these predictions both in this country and in China. In both countries this kind of foretelling is in the same tone and in the same terminology. Eventually I discovered that they were trained to prophesy in this way. However, very few of their predictions come to pass. I could give you many stories of predictions of earthquakes and other phenomena that never came to pass. If you would spend time to attend their meetings and listen to all their predictions, you would see that there is nearly no fulfillment.</p>
<p>We should not care for this kind of traditional thing. To prophesy in 1 Corinthians 14 does not mean this. It means to say something for Christ. If prophesying here is a kind of miraculous prediction, how could everyone do it? Paul tells us in this chapter that if the whole church comes together and everyone speaks in tongues, people will say you are mad. But if all prophesy, people will be convinced and convicted. Then he says, &ldquo;For ye can all prophesy one by one, that all may learn, and all may be comforted&rdquo; (1 Cor. 14:31).</p>
<p>Now we understand the real meaning of prophesy. It means to speak forth something about Christ. Praise the Lord, we all can do it! Everyone can say something for Christ, and if everyone does, the meeting will be in the heavens. We have been much influenced in a negative way by our traditional background. We simply do not know how to exercise our spirit to say something for the Lord. We thought that to exercise the gifts meant to speak in tongues or to prophesy by saying, &ldquo;Thus saith the Lord.&rdquo; We must drop all of these strange traditions. We must come back to the pure Word and exercise our spirit to learn how to say something for the Lord Jesus. We can all prophesy, for the spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets. We do not have to wait for an inspiration. The Lord has given us the inspiration already! When we come to the meetings, we should never forget that the Lord Jesus is in our spirit. Then we should simply exercise our spirit, and forget our troublesome mind and our self-consciousness. Then we will speak forth something for the Lord. Many riches of Christ have been buried in the saints and need to be released. Let us come back to the pure Word and drop everything else.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY OF LIFE</h2>
<p>At the end of 1 Corinthians 12, Paul tells us to seek the greater gifts, yet he would show us a most excellent way. What is the most excellent way? It is the way of life. Everyone knows that 1 Corinthians 13 speaks about love, but love is the expression of life. If we do not have love, it means that we do not have the expression of life. We are like sounding brass: there is a noise, but there is no life. Even if we speak a genuine tongue, not a human-manufactured one, that is not the expression of life. Paul says, &ldquo;Love never faileth, but whether there be prophecies, they shall fail; whether there be tongues, they shall cease; whether there be knowledge, it shall vanish away&rdquo; (1 Cor. 13:8). Prophecy fails, tongues cease, and knowledge will vanish. Only life is eternal.</p>
<p>By the context of chapters 12&mdash;14, it is very clear what the childish things are (1 Cor. 13:11). In the eyes of the Apostle Paul, all of these superficial gifts are toys. Even if they are genuine, they are still childish. That is why he tells us to pursue after love in the first verse of chapter fourteen. This is in order to prophesy, because prophesying builds up the church (1 Cor. 14:5).</p>
<p>I believe that we are now clear about the baptism in the Holy Spirit and the proper exercise of all the gifts. Praise the Lord that today in all the church meetings there is always the exercise of the top two gifts, the word of wisdom and the word of knowledge. And there is the proper prophesying for the building up of the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE INDWELLING CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17a; 1 Cor. 6:17; 2 Tim. 4:22; Rom. 8:9-10; Gal. 1:15-16; 2:20a; 4:19; Eph. 3:17a; Phil. 1:20b-21a; Col. 1:27</h1>
<p>We have seen Christ is the wonderful One with six major steps. The six steps are incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, baptism, and advent or second coming. Incarnation is the mingling of divinity with humanity, crucifixion is the termination of all negative things, resurrection is the germination of all positive things, ascension is the inauguration of Christ, baptism is the putting of us all into Christ for the formation of the Body, and the advent is the Lord&rsquo;s return to this earth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE INDWELLING</h2>
<p>The past messages have cleared the confused ground. Now we must go on. We have seen the six major steps of Christ, but we must realize that six in the Bible is not a good number. The number of the anti-Christ is six hundred and sixty-six. So for Christ to have only six steps is not so good. There must be one more, and it is between the baptism and the advent. This step covers a long period of time. The baptism is already accomplished, and we are waiting for His coming back. In between, there is a long period. During this period, Christ is the indweller. This is the seventh step, His indwelling.</p>
<p>In the baptism, Christ was the baptizer. Immediately after the baptism, He is the indweller. After He baptizes us into Himself, He comes to dwell within us. Hallelujah! Our Christ is not only our Redeemer and our Baptizer, but also our Indweller. By baptizing, He puts us into Himself, and by indwelling, He comes to stay within us. So now we are in Him, and He is in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ANOTHER FORM</h2>
<p>In eternity past God had a purpose. Then in time He became incarnated to be a wonderful man. This man lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. He passed through and tasted every part of human living. After this He went to the cross to redeem us back to God and to terminate all the negative things. By that work He became our Redeemer. Then He went into the tomb to rest. He kept the real Sabbath. Just as God rested on the seventh day following the six days of creation, so in the same principle Christ finished His redeeming work and rested in the tomb. After the rest, He awoke in resurrection.</p>
<p>It was in His resurrection that Christ became another form. Now He was not only in a physical form, but also a spiritual. Our human mentality cannot comprehend it. On the day of resurrection His disciples were frightened and locked themselves in a room. They feared the persecuting of the Jews. Even though they heard from Mary that she had seen the Lord, they did not know what to do. Then Jesus suddenly was there in the room. In a sense they were happy, but in another sense they did not know how He got there. Was Jesus there with a physical body or not? They could see Him, yet the door was not opened. This is too wonderful to understand. Then the Lord did a very unusual thing. He did not give the disciples any teaching. All He did was to breathe into them and say, &ldquo;Receive ye the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Then He disappeared. He was suddenly there, and He was suddenly gone. After the resurrection, Christ became not only the wonderful One, but also the mysterious One. He is so wonderful, yet so mysterious.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PRESENT JESUS</h2>
<p>Then in John 21, Peter was tested. They had nothing to live on, so Peter said that he was going fishing. Then all the others followed. They were fishing experts from their youth, yet they caught nothing after fishing all night. Then in the morning, Jesus was there. They could not stay away from Jesus. It does not say that Jesus came, but that Jesus was there. Wherever we go, Jesus is there. Jesus then told them to cast the net on the right side of the ship, and they caught a number of fish. This story tells us of a present Jesus. This is a Jesus that is always present with us, regardless of where we go or what we do. Today&rsquo;s Jesus is a present Jesus, a constant Jesus, an instant Jesus, a ready Jesus, and an available Jesus. He is not only real and living, but also constant, instant, present, ready, and available. Praise the Lord that we have such a Jesus.</p><h2 class="head1">A PREPARED BRIDE</h2>
<p>This is the Lord&rsquo;s indwelling between His baptism and His coming back. By His baptism He puts us all into Him. By His coming He will take us as His Bride. This is why we need His indwelling, transforming work. The Bride needs to be prepared. We are still so ugly and unsuitable. A man would never marry such a woman. This is exactly today&rsquo;s situation. How could the Lord Jesus come today? Hence, we need a long period for His indwelling work. This is the finest work He is doing. It was easy for Him to accomplish incarnation once and for all. His crucifixion only took six hours. The resurrection and ascension did not take long. Even the baptism was accomplished on both parts of the Body in a short time. His coming back will also not take long. But to prepare us takes a lot of time. If we did not have the indwelling Christ, I am afraid that we all would give up. Praise the Lord that it is not a hopeless case! Christ is in us, the hope of glory. Eventually we all will be in the New Jerusalem. All the time He is working within. We may say that we do not like the church life, but still He is working. The Lord has a way to work in us, and to work us into His glory. The way is by His indwelling. We all have the same life indwelling us. He is so rich, so present, so available, so ready, so constant, so instant, and so continually working in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TWO WONDERFUL STEPS</h2>
<p>The indwelling of Christ is really hidden and mysterious; yet it is so real, strengthening, empowering, satisfying, enlightening, comforting, refreshing, and watering. This is why we have such a wonderful church life. If we only had the baptism accomplished once and for all, and were waiting for Him to come back, we would be miserable. But today we do have His indwelling. This is because He has become the life-giving Spirit. The last Adam was Jesus in the flesh. Then this last Adam has become the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>We should never forget that Jesus took two wonderful steps in order to become something. The first step was the Word becoming flesh. He was God, yet He became flesh. That was Jesus. He was no longer merely God, but God plus humanity. He was God becoming flesh so He could be our Redeemer as the Lamb of God. Then in resurrection, the Lord Jesus as the last Adam became something else. Here He took another step. This time He became the life-giving Spirit. His first step was for Him to become our Redeemer. His second step was for Him to be our life-giver. To be the Redeemer He needed to become flesh. To be the life-giver He needed to become the Spirit. The flesh is for redemption, and the Spirit is for life-giving. It is indeed sad that most Christians have never heard that Christ became the life-giving Spirit. Rather, some Christians even condemn this as heresy. But what can they do with 1 Corinthians 15:45b? It tells us clearly that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>Now we are clear that the Lord has taken two steps. He was God, yet He took the step to become flesh. Then He became Jesus, the last Adam. After He finished His redemptive work, He took another step as the last Adam to become the life-giving Spirit. First of all He was for redeeming; now in the second step He is for life-giving. After we are redeemed, we need the life supply, the life-giving, and Christ as the life-giving Spirit is the indweller to supply the life to us. In the past, we never heard that Christ today is the life-giving Spirit. If we need to have a Bible study, we should study the verses concerning Christ as the life-giving Spirit. Christ as the life-giving Spirit is indwelling us, imparting life to us all the time.</p>
<p>Following 1 Corinthians 15:45b, we have 2 Corinthians 3:17. &ldquo;Now the Lord is that Spirit.&rdquo; John the Baptist declared, &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God!&rdquo; Now the Apostle Paul declares, &ldquo;Now the Lord is that Spirit!&rdquo; The Lord is no more just the Lamb of God for redemption. Now He is the Spirit for life-giving. Darby&rsquo;s New Translation puts brackets around verses six through seventeen of 2 Corinthians 3. This indicates that verse seventeen continues verse six. Verse six says that the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life. Then verse seventeen continues to say that now the Lord is that Spirit. It is the Spirit that gives life, and now the Lord is that Spirit that gives life. This is marvelous! Today the Lord Jesus is the Spirit that gives life.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Another important verse is 1 Corinthians 6:17, &ldquo;But he that is joined unto the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; We are not only one with the Lord, we are one spirit with the Lord. The Lord today is the life-giving Spirit, and we have a human spirit purposely created by God that we may take Christ as the life-giving Spirit into us. Now these two spirits have become one. This is wonderful! Our spirit is one with the Lord, because as the life-giving Spirit He indwells our spirit. But the Lord in our spirit is not like a drop of oil in water, never mingling with the water. He mingles with us in our spirit as tea mingles with water. This is why many times it is difficult to distinguish whether it is we or the Lord doing things. We have some burden, yet it seems the Lord wants to do it. It is because we are one with the Lord in our spirit. After tea is put into water, it is difficult to separate the tea from the water. That is why I call it tea-water. It is both tea and water. The two mingle as one. In the same way, the Lord Jesus as the life-giving Spirit mingles with our spirit as one. He is in us, and we are in Him. It seems that a brother is speaking, but while he is speaking, the Lord is also speaking. He speaks within that brother. His speaking is the brother&rsquo;s speaking, and the brother&rsquo;s speaking is His speaking. Eventually, a mingled one is speaking. Praise the Lord! We are really one spirit with the Lord.</p>
<p>Now we must come to 2 Timothy 4:22. &ldquo;The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit.&rdquo; Most Christians have never realized that there is such a verse in the Bible, telling us that the Lord Jesus is with our spirit. The most they have heard is that He is in their heart. But Christ first of all does not come into our heart, but into our spirit. When I come to visit you, I do not come into your bedroom first, but into your living room. The Lord first of all comes into our spirit. That is our living room. Our heart is the bedroom, the closet, and all the other rooms. He will get into all those parts only with our consent. If we do not agree, He will never go there. Praise the Lord that He has come into our spirit!</p>
<p>Then Romans 8:9-10 tells us that this Christ in our spirit is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God. &ldquo;But ye are not in the flesh, but in the Spirit, if so be that the <em>Spirit of God</em> dwell in you. Now if any man have not the <em>Spirit of Christ,</em> he is none of his. And if <em>Christ</em> be in you, the body is dead because of sin; but the spirit is life because of righteousness.&rdquo; The indwelling Christ is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is just the Spirit of God. Praise the Lord, they all are one. By these verses we can see that the Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is just Christ Himself. The Spirit of God dwells in us, so we have the Spirit of Christ. Then if we have the Spirit of Christ in us, Christ Himself is in us. This proves that the very Christ that indwells our spirit is the Spirit of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REVEALED IN US, LIVING IN US, FORMED IN US</h2>
<p>Paul tells us in Galatians 1:15-16 that it pleased God to reveal Christ in us. &ldquo;But when it pleased God...to reveal his Son in me.&rdquo; Then in chapter two he tells us that Christ lives in us. &ldquo;I am crucified with Christ: nevertheless I live; yet not I, but Christ liveth in me.&rdquo; Furthermore, the Christ that lives in us must be formed in us: &ldquo;...until Christ be formed in you&rdquo; (Gal. 4:19). This can be illustrated by putting a hand into a glove. Sometimes the hand may be in the glove, but not fully formed. The fingers of the hand may not be all the way into the fingers of the glove. The hand is in the glove, but not in a good shape. It is not formed in the glove. Gradually the fingers of the hand get into the fingers of the glove, and finally the hand is fully formed in the glove. Praise the Lord that Christ is within us, but He must be formed within us. Paul travailed that Christ would be formed in the Galatian Christians. Christ should not only be revealed in us and living in us, but also formed in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOME IN OUR HEARTS</h2>
<p>Ephesians 3:17 says that Christ must &ldquo;make his home in your hearts by faith.&rdquo; First of all He is in our spirit; then gradually He will spread into every part of our heart until He has fully made His home there. Now He is not only formed, but completely settled in our whole being. This is why Paul could say in Philippians 1:21, &ldquo;For me to live is Christ.&rdquo; Paul says that regardless of what kind of circumstance or situation he is in, for him to live is Christ. Do you realize how much work is needed in us in order to say this? Yet Paul could say that his living was Christ. Then one day the Christ within us will become the glory. &ldquo;To whom God would make known what is the riches of the glory of this mystery among the Gentiles; which is Christ in you, the hope of glory&rdquo; (Col. 1:27). Today Christ is within us as the hope of glory. But while we are living out Christ, we are waiting for the day when this indwelling Christ will become our outward glory. Praise the Lord! This is the indwelling Christ.</p>
<p>We were made with a spirit, a soul, and a body. The parts of the soul are the mind, emotion, and will. These three parts combined with the conscience part of the spirit constitute the heart. We have seen that Christ as the life-giving Spirit has come into our spirit; but He needs to spread from our spirit into all the parts of our heart that He may make His home in our heart. This is why Paul prays in Ephesians 3:16 that our inner man will be strengthened that Christ may make His home in our heart. The inner man is just our regenerated spirit. This part of our being needs to be strengthened that Christ may spread into our heart. From our spirit He will spread into our mind, our emotion, and our will. This is a gradual work. It could never be done overnight or even over one year. Gradually Christ spreads Himself from our spirit into every part of our being. This takes much time and much dealing by the Lord. So many of us must confess that although Christ is within us, He does not have much ground within us. We have opened our spirit to Him, but we have closed our mind, our emotion, and our will to Him. In the meetings we shout &ldquo;Amen,&rdquo; but when we get home we will not let the Lord touch us. However, He does not give up. Gradually, little by little, we open our inward parts to Him. It is in this way that Christ will make His home in us. Then our very living will become the manifestation of Christ, and we will be waiting for His coming to become our outward glory.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">TAKING CHRIST AS OUR PERSON</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Phil. 2:5; 2 Cor. 2:10b; 10:1; 11:10; Rom. 8:4; Gal. 5:25; 2 Cor. 3:18</h1>
<h2 class="head1">POSITIONED TO DRINK</h2>
<p>By the baptism in the Holy Spirit, we were all put into Christ. Thus we were put into a position that fits His work. His intention is not merely to put us into Himself, but to put us into Himself for His working within us. After putting us into Himself, He started His work within us. It is just like a school. First of all we are enrolled, then we enter into the school. The admission into the school is to put us into the position that the school may work on us.</p>
<p>First Corinthians 12:13 says that we have all been baptized in one Spirit into one Body. This is to be put into Christ. Also we have all been made to drink of one Spirit. This means that we have all been put into a position to drink. To put us into Christ is one thing; to make us to drink Christ into us is another thing. The main purpose is not only to put us into Christ, but to get Christ more and more wrought into our being. What we eat and drink is assimilated into our being and becomes something organic that belongs to our constitution. Eventually what we drink becomes us. So to be put into Christ is to be positioned for Christ to work Himself into us day by day. To enter into school is for at least one semester, but to let the school work on you is a day by day matter. To be put into Christ is a matter once for all, and this has been accomplished through the baptism. Now we are positioned for Christ to be wrought into us.</p>
<p>Christ is working Himself into us, and He is working by dwelling in us. In a sense He is in us, and in another sense He is getting more into us. He is adding Himself into us more and more. Today we may only have a little of Christ, but after two months we may have more of Him. Day by day He is adding Himself into us and multiplying Himself within us. This is why we have both peace and bothering at the same time. We have real peace by the indwelling Christ, yet we do not have peace, because He is constantly bothering us! If there is no bothering and troubling, there is no growth. Praise the Lord that we have all been baptized into Christ and have put on Christ! Now we are in Christ. This is our position and our standing. Christ is now the indwelling One, constantly working Himself into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST THE PERSON</h2>
<p>In the last chapter, we saw that it pleased God to reveal His Son in us (Gal. 1:15-16). God has revealed His Son in us! This is a great thing. Next we saw through Galatians 2:20 that we have been crucified with Christ, nevertheless we live, yet it is not we, but Christ who lives in us. This is really a strange language. We live, yet it is not we; it is Christ. Marvelous! He is the One living in us. Many Christians know this verse, but I am afraid that they do not see that this verse shows us that Christ is our person. It does not say that it is no more I, but the life of Christ that lives in me. It says that Christ, the person Himself, lives in me. Many Christians take the life of Christ, but they do not take the person of Christ. There is a big difference. By itself life does not bother us a great deal, but a person is always a problem.</p>
<p>Marriage is a very good illustration of taking another person. Marriage is wonderful; however, you not only get a helper, but a person. Your husband is a person; he is not just a machine to take care of you. If he were a machine, that would not bother you. But he is a person; so when he takes care of you, he takes care of you in his way. And his way is not your way. A machine does not have a will. You can irritate it, and it will never lose its temper because it does not have a temper to lose. But your husband is a person with feeling, emotion, and temper. The only way for you not to have any trouble with your husband is for you to take him as your person. If you do this, there is no problem. Marriage is a big responsibility, because you get a person who gives you a lot of problems. There is no doubt that we do get help from our wives and husbands, but at the same time there is a real suffering in order to get the help. The only way is to take your wife or your husband as your person. Then whatever they do will be all right. This is why in all the weddings, Western or Eastern, the wife has a veil to cover her head. Most people think that this is just a formality, but there is a deep significance. It means that in marriage there can only be one person; the other one is gone. There can only be one head; otherwise there will be a divorce. The main reason for all divorces is the fact that one couple has two heads, two wills, two minds, two emotions, and two persons. No wonder they fight! One couple must have only one person. Then there will be peace in the marriage. If the young people are not ready to take another one as their person, they should forget about marriage. Otherwise they will suffer.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE VESSEL FOR ONE PERSON</h2>
<p>This is why the teachings concerning marriage life do not work so well. Regardless of what kind of teaching we have, we still hold on to our own person. Real love means to take another one as your person. If you do love your wife, yet you would not take her as your person, your love is not genuine. Rather, it is a selfish love. If you love your husband in a genuine way, you will take him as your person. Then there is no problem. The same thing is true in God&rsquo;s economy. It is not a matter of teaching. The Lord&rsquo;s intention is to work Himself into us, not only as our life, but also as our person. If we were just a box, and the living Lord came into us to be our person, that would be easy. A box has no person. But we are living boxes, and so many of us do have a strong person. Some of us are strong in the mind, others are strong in the emotion, and others are strong in the will. Therefore, the Lord has some difficulty. But we must realize that the Lord will never give up His own person. We must be the ones who give up. The Lord has no intention to have us live as a person. We should simply be the vessel that contains Him. But the problem is that God created some living vessels. This is why in the very beginning of the New Testament, the Lord Jesus said that if we are going to follow Him we must deny ourselves. This means to deny our person. To follow Jesus means to take Him as your person. In order to do this, surely we must deny our own person. If all the followers of Christ would deny themselves, there would be no need of so many pages in the New Testament. It would be so simple. Then we could really say that it is no more I, but Christ who lives in me. He lives; we do not live. The &ldquo;I&rdquo; has been terminated. Now it is not only another life, but another person who lives in us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DWELLER OF THE HOME</h2>
<p>Another verse which we mentioned in the last chapter was Ephesians 3:17. Here we see that Christ desires to make His home in our heart. Many times when I am a guest in someone&rsquo;s house, they tell me to make myself at home. But regardless of how strongly they say this, deep within I know that that is not my home. My home is the place where I have the full right and the full freedom to do whatever I like. If I am told where to put my suitcase and where to put my towels, that is not my home. A home is a place where a person is absolutely free. In my home I have the freedom to fulfill all my desires. That means that I am the real person of that home. If I do not have the freedom to do whatever I like in that house, it means that I am not the dweller in that home. Christ must have His full liberty and the full right to do whatever He likes. Then our heart will be His home. This means that we will no longer be the dweller, but the dwelling place. He will be the dweller to make His home in us. If He is the person as the dweller in us, then we have to lose whatever we are. We are just the home. The home has no idea, no concept, no emotion, no will, no desire; it is all up to the dweller of the home. This is why whenever there is a wedding, the wife must be covered. In marriage, there should only be one person. Galatians 2:20 and Ephesians 3:17 present strongly the point that Christ has to be our person. In a sense, simply to take Christ as our life is not so adequate. The real meaning is to take Christ as our person. When He is our person, then surely it will be easy for Him to be our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REAL LIVING OF PAUL THE APOSTLE</h2>
<p>Now we can understand what Paul means when he says, &ldquo;Let this mind be in you, which was also in Christ Jesus&rdquo; (Phil. 2:5). This is to take Christ as our person by denying our natural mind and taking His mind. When we take someone else&rsquo;s mind as our mind, we certainly take him as our person. If we really mean to take Christ as our person, we must know how to deny our mind and to have our mind fully replaced by the mind of Christ. It does not mean that we do not need our mind or use our mind, but that the mind of Christ replaces our mind.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 10:1, Paul says, &ldquo;Now I Paul myself beseech you by the meekness and gentleness of Christ.&rdquo; This means that Paul besought the early Christians not in his own person; he besought them in the person of Christ. The meekness and gentleness of Christ had to become his. This is God&rsquo;s economy; this is not religion. This is not a teaching, a philosophy, or any kind of instruction or regulation; it is a living, complete, practical, available, and present person. When we take Him as our person, His meekness and His gentleness becomes ours. This was the real living of Paul the Apostle.</p>
<p>This is also seen in 2 Corinthians 11:10. &ldquo;As the truth of Christ is in me.&rdquo; It was not the falsehood, but the truth of Christ which was in Paul. This means that Christ the Person was in him. It does not mean that Paul imitated the honesty, faithfulness, and truthfulness of Christ. No, instead Paul took the faithful, honest, sincere, and truthful Christ as his person. Therefore, this Person&rsquo;s truthfulness becomes Paul&rsquo;s; so he could say that the truth of Christ was in him.</p><h2 class="head1">IN THE PERSON OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>Eventually, Paul gives us such a deep verse in 2 Corinthians 2:10. &ldquo;To whom ye forgive anything, I forgive also: for if I forgave anything, to whom I forgave it, for your sakes forgave I it in the person of Christ.&rdquo; Suppose you go to the department store. Could you say that you are going there in the person of Christ? When you buy something there, could you say that you are buying it in the person of Christ? If we were able to say this, I am quite sure that we would not buy many items. Almost all Christians know Galatians 2:20, but very few know 2 Corinthians 2:10. Here is a verse which tells us that we must do things in the person of Christ.</p>
<p>In the Greek text, the word for &ldquo;person&rdquo; in 2 Corinthians 2:10 is a difficult word to translate. It is not easy to find an equivalent for this Greek word. This word in Greek denotes the part of the face just around the eyes. It is sometimes called the index of the face. This part around our eyes is the index of our inward being. When we look at this part, we know whether a person is agreeable or not agreeable, happy or angry. Many times a wife&rsquo;s &ldquo;yes&rdquo; is changed into &ldquo;no&rdquo; by looking at the index of her husband&rsquo;s face. This means that at that time she was taking her husband as her person. This would make a very good marriage. Whatever the wife does, she does it in the person of her husband. This is what Paul meant when he said that he forgave in the person of Christ. He did not do anything in his own person; he did everything in the person of Christ because he was taking Him as his person. So in this verse we see the practical application of what Paul said in Galatians 2:20. It is really marvelous!</p>
<h2 class="head1">WALK ACCORDING TO THE MINGLED SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now we must look at some verses in another category. Romans 8:4 says, &ldquo;That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who walk not according to flesh, but according to spirit.&rdquo; There is not the definite article here before the word &ldquo;spirit,&rdquo; which makes it difficult to decide whether it is our human spirit or the Holy Spirit. Therefore it must be the mingled spirit, the Holy Spirit and our spirit mingled as one. So now we must walk according to this mingled spirit, which simply means to walk according to the living Christ as the Spirit who indwells our spirit. Here there is the real fulfillment of the law. Whatever the law requires we will spontaneously fulfill, not by ourselves, but through Christ, the Spirit moving in our spirit.</p>
<p>This shows us how to take Christ as our person, which is to walk and live according to the mingled spirit. Day by day we should not have our being according to teaching, feelings, concepts, or circumstances, but according to the mingled spirit. Praise the Lord that we do have a spirit and that Christ as the life-giving Spirit is indwelling our spirit to make these two spirits one. Now we must walk according to this mingled spirit, and to walk according to this spirit is to take Christ as our person. The wording is different, but the fact is the same. To practically take Christ as our person is to have our being wholly according to the spirit.</p>
<p>In the entire Bible, especially in the New Testament, there is not one verse which tells us that we must walk according to Bible teaching. This does not mean that I am against the Bible. I am absolutely for the Bible, but our walk should not be something according to the outward teachings of the Bible; it must be according to a living person. If we walk only according to the teaching of the Bible, we will get into trouble. This is because there are many things that the Bible does not mention. It never tells us how long or short to cut our hair; nor does it say whether we should smoke or not. If you read the Bible two-hundred times, you will not find one verse about smoking. If the Lord meant for us to walk according to the Bible, the Bible would need to have thousands of pages! It would be difficult for us to carry such a book! But praise the Lord, it is so simple. We simply must learn to walk according to the mingled spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRANSFORMED FOR THE BUILDING</h2>
<p>It is by walking according to the mingled spirit and taking Christ as our person that we will be transformed. &ldquo;But we all, with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:18, Gk.). We behold Christ as a mirror, and we reflect Christ with an unveiled face. While we are beholding and reflecting Christ in this way, we are being transformed. It is not correction, improvement, or adjustment, but transformation.</p>
<p>A very good illustration of transformation is the petrification of wood. This is caused by different logs being caught in a place where water is constantly flowing over them. By the flowing of the water, the minerals in the water discharge the old, wooden nature. Then the logs become petrified. Wood is transformed into stone. Praise the Lord, we are just like those logs! The water of life flows into us and brings all the divine elements into our being to replace our natural essence. All of our natural elements are discharged, and we are transformed. Teaching can never do this because teaching does not have the flow of the living water with the divine element. But Christ as the life flow has all the divine minerals to flow through us to replace our natural disposition and discharge all the natural things. Then we are transformed into the image of Christ from one degree of glory to another degree of glory. And this is by the Lord Spirit whom we have learned to take as our person.</p>
<p>Eventually, when we come to the end of the Bible, we do not have anything built with wood. The whole New Jerusalem is built with transformed precious stones. Precious stones are not natural elements, but transformed ones. In the New Jerusalem there will be nothing natural, for whatever is built into God&rsquo;s building must be transformed. All the natural dispositions must be discharged and replaced by what Christ is. Today in the church, wherever there are some brothers that have some amount of transformation, that church will be living, rich, strong, and established. But wherever there is a church without such a measure of transformation, that church will be weak, poor, and shaky. We do look to the Lord that we may have a church built not by teaching, but by taking Christ as our person. And this person is the living flow of the water of life. Then we will become the precious stones which are good for the building up of God&rsquo;s building which is the Body of Christ. The building of the church is by the Christians who have been transformed by the Lord Spirit through taking Christ as their person in walking according to the mingled spirit.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIXTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE ONE NEW MAN AS THE BODY-CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:22-23; 2:15-16; 4:4-6, 13-16, 22-24; 1 Cor. 12:12-13; 1:9-10; Rom. 15:5-6</h1>
<h2 class="head1">ONE MIND AND ONE MOUTH</h2>
<p>How wonderful to take Christ as our person! When we are all taking Him as our person, the real oneness is brought in. Romans 15:6 says, &ldquo;That ye may with one mind and one mouth glorify God, even the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; How could one hundred, one thousand, ten thousand people have one mind and one mouth? Here is a verse which tells us that the church has one mind and one mouth. How could this be? How could all the Californians, the Texans, the Yankees, the Filipinos, the Chinese, the Japanese, the French, the Germans, and the British all have one mind and one mouth? It seems impossible. The only way is if we all take Christ as our person. All of us must put aside our own person. All the other persons must be buried! Then we will all have only one person, and that is Christ who is our unique person. Thus we will all become one man.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>Since the last century, the matter of the Body of Christ has been stressed so much by the seeking Christians. Everywhere you can hear the seeking ones talking about the Body of Christ. But most Christians have never seen that the Body of Christ is not only a Body, but also a new man. Because they have not seen this, some of the translators translated the Bible in a wrong way. The Revised Standard Version in Ephesians 4:22-24 translates the Greek word for man into nature. The new man in Ephesians 4:24 is not the new nature. This can be clearly seen in chapter two. &ldquo;Having abolished in his flesh the enmity, even the law of commandments contained in ordinances; for to create in himself of twain one new man, so making peace. And that he might reconcile both unto God in one body by the cross, having slain the enmity thereby&rdquo; (Eph. 2:15-16). Here we see that the new man is not an individual matter; it is a corporate entity. First, Paul says that Christ abolished all the ordinances to create a new man of two peoples. And we know that these two peoples are the Jews and the Gentiles. Then in the following verse, he says that Christ reconciled both of these two peoples unto God in one Body by the cross. By reading these two verses it is clear that the one new man is the one Body and the one Body is the one new man.</p>
<p>By this we can see that the church is not only a Body, but also a man. This point has not been seen by most Christians. In recent years the Lord has shown us that the church is not only a Body, but a man. What is the difference between a body and a man? A body needs life, but a man needs not only life but also a person. A tree needs life, but a tree does not need a person. The life in a tree grows, but that life is not a person. A man not only has a life to live, but also a person to express. To grow is a matter of life, but to express oneself is a matter of a person. The church as the Body of Christ needs life. The church is not an organization; it is a living organism, and this is something pertaining to life. Yet the church is not only the Body, but also the new man. As the new man, the church not only needs life, but also a person.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONE MIND AND ONE MOUTH FOR ONE PERSON</h2>
<p>To have one mind and one mouth is not related so much to the life as to the person. Why are there so many opinions among Christians today? It is because nearly all the Christians do not know that they should take Christ as their person. Regardless of how many Christians come together, the person should only be one. So the whole church as the one new man has only one mind and one mouth of the one Person. As the Body of Christ and as the one new man the church not only needs the life, but also the person. We are here not only for the Body, but also for the new man. And this new man has a unique person that is neither you nor me. Hallelujah! Our person is Christ. Now we can understand how thousands of people could have one mind and one mouth. The philosophers would say that this is impossible, but we do know that this is a fact for we have experienced this fact. This is because all the believers as the members of the Body of Christ must take Christ as their person. When we all take this one Person, He thinks for us and He speaks for us. We all have one mind to think and one mouth to speak.</p>
<p>In 1 Corinthians 1:10, Paul says, &ldquo;Now I beseech you, brethren, by the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that ye all speak the same thing, and that there be no divisions among you; but that ye be attuned to the same mind and to the same opinion&rdquo; (Gk.). How could we be attuned to the same mind and to the same opinion? The only way is to forget about our person and take Christ as our person. When we all take Christ as our person, spontaneously we will all be attuned to the same mind and to the same opinion. Thus we will be like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus (Rom. 15:5). It is not according to the Scripture, doctrine, knowledge, or anything else; we can only be like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus. If it is according to doctrine, immediately we will be of a different mind. There are so many doctrines to argue about. Should baptism be by sprinkling or immersion? Is the rapture pre-tribulation, post-tribulation, or mid-tribulation? Is man a dichotomy or a trichotomy? What about speaking in tongues? Doctrinally speaking, we could never stop arguing.</p><h2 class="head1">DOCTRINES ONLY DIVIDE</h2>
<p>Forty-eight years ago I picked up many doctrines. I was so sure that I was right, but I was just a little frog in a well with a narrow opening. The sky to me was just one foot in diameter. I thought I knew everything, but gradually the Lord led this little frog out of the well. In a sense I got out of the well and the sky was endless and spacious, but my sight was still confined. Then gradually, the Lord led me out of my confined sight. I learned that doctrinally there is no end to man&rsquo;s argument. Man can argue forever about doctrine. I finally realized that it is not doctrine, but Christ. We have to be like-minded one toward another according to Christ. Doctrines only create an argument.</p>
<p>In 1963, while we were having a meeting in Los Angeles, a brother came up to rebuke me. He said that we were not scriptural because the sisters were praying and testifying in the meetings. Then he quoted 1 Corinthians 14:34, &ldquo;Let your women keep silence in the churches: for it is not permitted unto them to speak.&rdquo; Of course, I knew this verse before he was born, but I did not say anything. I simply said, &ldquo;Brother, do you have any kind of meeting?&rdquo; He said that they did. Then I asked him, &ldquo;Do your sisters sing the hymns in your meetings?&rdquo; He answered, &ldquo;Yes, they do.&rdquo; Then I told him that he was against the Scripture because the sisters in his meeting were not silent. According to the letter of this verse as understood by him, all the sisters must not open their mouths. This is just an illustration to prove to you that we could argue concerning the Scriptures forever. The more we argue, the more material we have with which to argue.</p>
<p>The Bible is not for doctrine. The Bible is for the revelation of Christ and the Church and for nourishment. Man lives not by bread alone, but by every word that proceeds out of the mouth of God (Matt. 4:4). Doctrines can only divide Christians. We can never be one according to doctrine. We must be like-minded one toward another according to Christ Jesus. Then with one mind and one mouth we can glorify God. This can never be our mind or mouth, it must be Christ&rsquo;s. When we take Christ as our unique person, we are really one. Hallelujah! We have one person, one mind, and one mouth. It is absolutely possible for believers meeting together to be one by everyone taking Christ as his person.</p>
<p>When I was young, I was always taught to be patient, humble, kind, and loving. Eventually I discovered that regardless of how patient and kind these teachers were, they fought with each other over doctrine. So doctrine does not work. There is only one thing that works, and that is Christ Himself. We all need to take Him as our person. Today, if you still hold on to some doctrines, it proves that you are short of Christ. The more we take Christ as our person, the more He will swallow up all the dissenting doctrines. We need to open to the Lord and pray, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, You are my person. I live by You. I reject my person and take You as my person.&rdquo; If we would pray this way for some time, all the dissenting germs would be killed. Everything would be swallowed up by Christ. Then the church would be the one new man with one mind and one mouth.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUT OFF AND PUT ON</h2>
<p>Ephesians 2:15 says that Christ on the cross has abolished all the ordinances. On the cross Christ took away our sins, crucified the old man, condemned the world, and destroyed the devil. On the cross Christ has also dealt with another item&mdash;the ordinances, which are the different ways of living and the different ways of worship. By abolishing the ordinances on the cross, Christ created in Himself one new man of the Jews and the Gentiles. Now we need to put off the old man and put on the new man. We do not need to create the new man; it has been created already. What we need to do is put it on.</p>
<p>We must read the full context of Ephesians 4:22-24. &ldquo;That ye put off concerning the former conduct the old man, which is corrupt according to the deceitful lusts; and be renewed in the spirit of your mind; and that ye put on the new man, which according to God is created in righteousness and true holiness.&rdquo; To put off the old man concerns the old, former conduct. This is related to the old social life, the old community life, because our conduct is always related to others. No man can be unsocial; everyone likes to have a community. We like to be with our relatives, our friends, our neighbors, and our classmates in order to have a kind of social life. So to put off the old man according to the former conduct means to put off the former social life.</p>
<p>When I was a young man I had my schoolmates, friends, and relatives. Then the Lord saved me, and from that day on He began to separate me. All of my schoolmates, friends, and even my relatives were gradually put off. After my old communal life was put off, I needed a new communal life. The Lord was so merciful in bringing me into the church life so that I could put on the new man. Now the church life is upon me, and I am under the church life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BODY-CHRIST</h2>
<p>According to the past messages on the indwelling Christ and this message on the new man, we can see that all the members of this new man will be wholly filled up by Christ. We will even be saturated, permeated, and covered with Christ. Thus we shall all become a corporate Christ, because the Body is Christ. First Corinthians 12:12 tells us that Christ is the Body. &ldquo;For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body, so also is Christ.&rdquo; This is the Body-Christ. Today our Christ is the Body-Christ. He was God, He became flesh for redemption, and He became the life-giving Spirit to come into us and work within us. Now He becomes the Body-Christ.</p>
<p>In the beginning of the Bible we see God creating the heavens and the earth, but at the end of the Bible, God is in the Lamb surrounded by a city. In the beginning of the Bible God was alone, without a counterpart to match Him. That was signified by His saying that it is not good for man to be alone. That signifies that it is not good for Him to be alone. He wants a counterpart, and this counterpart is a corporate man. As we read on through the Bible we see that although man becomes fallen, God redeems him through the cross and becomes the life-giving Spirit to get into him. Finally, God gets a living city, and that living city is just His counterpart. The living city will be His bride, and He will be the Bridegroom. Our God was alone in eternity past, but in eternity future He will have a counterpart. The New Jerusalem is the eternal Eve, and God in Christ is the real Adam. The church as His bride came out of His side, and eventually she will go back to Him for eternity. The whole New Jerusalem with God in Christ will be the Body-Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR STAGES</h2>
<p>In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God. This is the first stage. The Word becoming flesh to be the Redeemer is the second stage. Then the Redeemer, through death and resurrection, became the life-giving Spirit to be the indwelling One, which is the third stage. Eventually, from the indwelling One, the new man is realized to become the Body-Christ. This is the fourth stage. Praise the Lord that we are now in the fourth stage! The Jews are in the first stage. They all believe in the one God. The fundamental Christians are in the second stage, and are somewhat better than the Jews because they believe in God, and they also believe in Christ and the Redeemer. Some Christians are in the third stage, realizing that Christ not only died for them, but also that He lives within them as their life. These are the improved Christians. But praise the Lord that it does not stop here! We must get into the fourth stage, the Body-Christ.</p>
<p>Ephesians 4:13-16 tells us that we must all arrive at a full grown man. This is the new man, the proper church life, where we will be no more children tossed to and fro by every wind of doctrine. Even the best doctrine can be a wind that carries us away from the Head and the Body. But if we hold on to the Head, we will grow up into Him in all things. Then out of Him, the whole Body will be fitly joined and compacted together by every joint of supply, according to the effectual working of every part of the Body to build itself up in love. This is the experience in the process of the Body-Christ. Now in the church life we are not only enjoying God, the Redeemer, and the indwelling One, but also the Body-Christ. Whenever we come together, something of Christ comes out of all of us. We are just the Body-Christ, the corporate Christ, sharing Christ with one another.</p>
<p>Today Christ is not alone. He is not merely the Redeemer or the Life-giver. Today our Christ is the Body-Christ. We could never enjoy the Body-Christ individually. To enjoy the Body-Christ we have to be in the new man, the proper church life. It is only here that Christ could be the Body-Christ. Nothing is so sweet as the church meetings. If you were to take me away from the meetings for one week, I would just die. Here we enjoy the riches of Christ coming out of all the saints. I especially like the sharing of the young brothers and sisters. There is no need for us to be so rich individually; we have the riches already in the Body-Christ. And the more we experience Christ, the more riches and the more enjoyment of the Body-Christ there will be in the church life. This is the ultimate enjoyment of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVENTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">TRANSFORMATION FOR THE BUILDING<br />
ON THE PROPER GROUND</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; 1 Cor. 1:2; 3:9b, 11, 12a; Gal. 1:2, 20-22; 4:11-12, 16; 1 Pet. 2:2, 5; Rev. 1:11; 2:7; 21:2, 18-19a</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE ENLARGEMENT OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>In these messages we have seen God&rsquo;s purpose and plan, which is to work Himself into us that we might be built up into the one new man. And this is the Body-Christ. In the beginning of the Bible God was alone, but He had the desire to have a counterpart. Nothing could be His counterpart unless it was out of Him and brought back to Him. We should never forget that Eve came out of Adam. God did not create one man and one woman. God only created one man, and out of this one man a part was taken from his broken side with which God built a woman. God did not create a woman, but built a woman from that part which was taken out of man. Man was created, but woman was built. In building anything there is the need for material. Woman was built with a part of the man as the material. Eve came out of Adam and went back to Adam from whom she was taken. Then the two became one flesh.</p>
<p>The church as the Bride of Christ comes out of Christ. Christ on the cross was broken, and out of His side came blood and water. His blood redeems us, and the water, which signifies His life, is for the building up of the church. And the church must go back to Christ as His counterpart that they may become one. This is eventually the Body-Christ. We must realize that Eve was not only a part of Adam; Eve was Adam&rsquo;s enlargement. Without Eve, Adam was incomplete. At best, he was just a half of the whole. A man must have a wife to make him complete. But God did not create another half for Adam; He put him to sleep and took a part out of his side and built this part into a woman. Then God brought this part back to Adam and Adam said, &ldquo;This is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh&rdquo; (Gen. 2:23).</p>
<p>We do not have this concept. Our concept is that we are fallen and sinful and we need a Redeemer, a Savior. But the New Testament tells us clearly that Christ came not only to be our Redeemer, but also to be the Bridegroom (John 3:29). He came for a bride, and His Bride was produced in just the same way as Adam&rsquo;s was. Jesus went to the cross. In a sense, He was crucified, but in another sense, He was sleeping. During His sleeping, a part of Him was taken out. Throughout all the centuries, God has used this part to build the corporate Eve. One day this corporate Eve will be brought back to Him, and He will say, &ldquo;This is bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh. This came out of Me.&rdquo; This part becomes the enlargement of Christ, and this is the Body-Christ. The Body-Christ is Christ enlarged. Adam was enlarged in Eve, and now Christ is being enlarged in the church. One day the enlargement of Christ will be complete, and that will be the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NEED OF BUILDING</h2>
<p>Whenever the Bible speaks of the church as the Bride of Christ, there is always the need of building. Even in Genesis 2:22, the Bible uses the word &ldquo;builded&rdquo; concerning the rib out of which Eve was made. The King James Version uses the word &ldquo;made,&rdquo; but in the Hebrew it is the word &ldquo;builded.&rdquo; It is not that God made a woman, but that God builded a counterpart for Adam with the rib out of his side. Then, when we go to the end of the Bible, we see a building. That building is the New Jerusalem, and it is also the Bride (Rev. 21:2). The Bride is the holy city, and since it is a city, there is the need of building.</p>
<p>We have seen that the church is the Body of Christ, the new man, the Bride, and the dwelling place, or the temple of God. For the Body, the need is life; for the new man, the need is the person. For the Bride, the need is love; for the temple, God&rsquo;s habitation, the need is the building. In life, the church is the Body; in person, the church is the new man; in love, the church is the Bride; and in building, the church is God&rsquo;s habitation. The church must be these four things.</p><h2 class="head1">PRECIOUS STONES, NOT BRICKS</h2>
<p>Now we must see something of the building. Everyone knows that to build a proper building there is the need of the proper materials. This is why for God&rsquo;s building there is the urgent need for transformation. We have seen that the New Jerusalem is built with precious stones (Rev. 21:19-20). Precious stones are not created, but transformed. Therefore, for the building of the church, we all need to be transformed. Naturally speaking, we were made with clay. But God could never make the New Jerusalem with clay. All the buildings of Satan, such as the city and tower of Babel, the pleasure cities of Egypt, and Babylon, were built with bricks. In the Bible, brick is the production of man&rsquo;s natural work, of man&rsquo;s human labor with clay. But precious stones are something transformed, not made with human labor. All of Satan&rsquo;s cities were built with bricks, but God&rsquo;s city is built with precious stones. All natural things are not good for God&rsquo;s building. For God&rsquo;s building transformation is needed.</p>
<p>It is clear that we all have different kinds of personalities. Some are quick, some are slow. Some are humble, others are proud. Some are kind, and others are hard. But none of these are good for the building of the church. They are all muddy. Regardless of how loving you are, your love is a muddy love. Your humility is muddy and your kindness is muddy. Everything natural is muddy. This is why the Lord has brought all of us to the cross and terminated us. Not one of our natural dispositions is good for the building. All of our dispositions must go to the cross. Therefore, we need something new, something divine, something heavenly, something holy, and something eternal to replace our natural make-up. This is why we need transformation. Among today&rsquo;s Christians, it would be difficult to find a place where you could hear someone give a message on transformation. Most of the messages are on correction, adjusting, and improvement. They even quote 2 Timothy 3:16 to say that the Bible is good for correction. But the Lord does not need the corrected things; He needs the transformed things. For the building up of the church, we must have transformation. The building up of the church could never avail by our natural character, regardless of how good we are. This is just building with bricks, but there is no place in God&rsquo;s building for bricks. In the New Jerusalem there is only one kind of material&mdash;the precious stones which have been transformed. What God needs is the transformed precious stones for His building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE REAL FOOD AND THE REAL DRINK<br />
FOR TRANSFORMATION</h2>
<p>Transformation is not something corrected; it is something transformed from one essence into another element. Therefore, we need another element to get into us, and this other element is Christ Himself. For example, eating and drinking cause a great deal of transformation. Day by day our body is undergoing a process of metabolism. New elements get into our body to discharge and replace the old. This is called metabolism. Our body is constantly being metabolized, which gives us the daily newness. In the same way we must take Christ in daily. This is why the Bible tells us that Christ is our food and drink (John 6:35, 57; 1 Cor. 10:4). This should not be just a term; it must be our spiritual reality. Then Christ will get into us to be the new element to replace and discharge all of the old things. In this way we will have a divine metabolism. That is transformation. Only transformed brothers and sisters are good for the building of the church. How much we could be built into the church depends upon how much we will be transformed, and the way to be transformed is to eat and drink Christ. In the New Jerusalem there is the tree of life and the river of water of life (Rev. 22:1-2). This is why the whole city is something transformed because the whole city is maintained by eating the tree of life and drinking the water of life (Rev. 22:14, 17).</p>
<p>Today, the church life is a miniature of the New Jerusalem. What we need for the church is simply the daily eating and drinking of Christ. Trying to correct or improve ourselves will never work. What we must do is learn to take Christ in every day, eating Him by pray-reading the Word, and drinking Him by calling on His name. All day long we must call on the Lord. &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; I know that some people are opposing this kind of calling, saying that it is just vain repetition. Yes, it is repetition, but it is not vain. Breathing is repetition, but I do not suggest that you stop. We can never graduate from breathing. I have been breathing for over 70 years, but I do not plan to stop. Eating is also repetitious; every day we eat at least three times. All of the things that sustain life must be repeated.</p><h2 class="head1">CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>Regardless of what people say, we love to call on the name of the Lord. This is really to drink the living water. If we are in darkness, the best way to get out of that darkness is to call on the name of the Lord. If we are in trouble, the best way out is to call on the name of the Lord. If we would just call for three minutes, we would be in the third heavens! The best way for us to overcome our temper is not to try to overcome it. The more we try to overcome our temper, the more it will overcome us! The best way to deal with our temper is to call, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus!&rdquo; Eventually, our temper is gone. This is not something superstitious. The next time you have a problem try calling on the name of Plato: &ldquo;O Plato, O Plato!&rdquo; Nothing will happen. But when you call on the name of Jesus, there is the real comforting, strengthening, and refreshing. This is because the name of Jesus is the Person. The name represents the Person, and the Lord Jesus is a real, living, nigh, present, and available Person! Whenever we call on Him, He is right there to be our supply.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRAYING THE WORD</h2>
<p>We must also learn to eat the Lord in the Word. This means that we must not simply read the Bible, but pray-read the Bible. It is so nourishing to pray over the Word. Some people have condemned us by saying that pray-reading is not in the Bible, but I do have a portion of the Word for them. The King James Version does not have the proper translation, but in the Greek, Ephesians 6:17-18 says, &ldquo;Take...the word of God by means of all prayer, praying at every time in spirit.&rdquo; These verses tell us clearly that we need to pray the Word of God. When we simply read the Word, we only get the knowledge into our mentality. But when we pray the Word of God, we get the Spirit of the Word into our spirit. This gives us the nourishment. Jesus said, &ldquo;The words that I speak unto you, they are spirit, and they are life&rdquo; (John 6:63), They are not doctrine or knowledge, but spirit and life. As they are spirit and life, we must take them into our spirit, not into our mind. How can we do this? It is not by thinking, reading, or understanding; it can only be done by praying. When we exercise our spirit to pray the Word, we receive the Spirit of the Word and we get the life.</p>
<p>If we will daily eat and drink Christ by pray-reading the Word and calling on the name of the Lord, we will have the growth in life and the transformation. Then we will not only be in the church, but be built into the church. It is very difficult to take anything away that has been built in. The New Jerusalem is a building with precious stones. It is not a piling up of stones, but a building up. This can only come through transformation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPER SITE</h2>
<p>In order to have a building, there is the need of the proper site. If we build a house on the wrong site, we will lose it. Therefore, the site or the ground upon which we build is very important. For the building up of the church, we need the proper ground. We know that there are some real Christians in the Catholic church. They are our real brothers and sisters because they are also born of our Father. But could we go into the Catholic church to be built up with them? This would be impossible, because they are on the wrong site. The same principle is true with all the denominations. There are thousands of real Christians there, but can you go into their denomination to be built up with them? No, for they are also on the wrong site. Then what about the free groups? Today, especially in this country, there are hundreds of free groups meeting in their homes and in many other places. They are real brothers in the Lord, but can we go and be built up with them? Again, the site is wrong.</p>
<p>People are always telling us that we are narrow because we take care of the ground of the church, the site for the building. But we must take care of it, because the building must be on the proper ground of unity. In the Catholic church, there is no possibility of having the proper unity because the ground is wrong. The same thing is true with the denominations and the free groups. In typology, the temple of God could only be built in Jerusalem. If you were to build the same temple in Babylon, that would be wrong. Therefore, we need the proper ground, the proper site for the building of the church. We know that the proper ground is not in the Catholic church, the denominations, or the free groups. Then where is the proper ground? Again we must come back to the pure Word of the Lord. The pure Word tells us that the church is one. How many bodies does Christ have? Universally speaking, the Body of Christ is one. And this one Body comprises all the saints. But we know that all the saints are not in the same place at the same time. Some are scattered in this city, and some are scattered in another city. But wherever we are, we must come together to be one and to be built up with the saints in the city where we live. This is the local church, the church that, according to the pure Word, is built upon the ground of unity in the locality where we live.</p><h2 class="head1">A BIG PROBLEM</h2>
<p>However, there is a big problem. Perhaps you and I would like to come together for the proper building up of the church, but so many brothers and sisters do not like to come together. They still like to stay in the Catholic church, in the denominations, or in the free groups. What shall we do? Shall we go to their different places and join them? If we do, there will be no possibility for the proper building on the ground of unity. We must still come together to be the local church. Some say that a local church must include all the saints in that city. We absolutely agree with this. But they go on to say that since we only have a small number, not including all the saints in that city, how can we call ourselves the local church? If this were the case, there would be no possibility of having the local church because so many real Christians in every city will never agree to meet in this way.</p>
<p>Let me illustrate in this way. Suppose there is a large family by the name of Smith with thirty-six members, and they all become scattered individually into so many places and into so many things. One day, two of the thirty-six become saved, begin to consider the poor situation of their family, and realize that they must come together to be the Smith family. Following this they come to the third brother and tell him about the Lord Jesus, and ask him to come home to be the family with them. Eventually five come back home, but thirty-one remain scattered. Now, is it too much for these five to say that they are the Smith family? I would say that it is not too much. Yes, the Smith family should be composed of thirty-six people, but all of them would not come back. Only five, by the mercy of the Lord, would come back. If they do not call themselves the Smith family, what should they call themselves? Should they call themselves the Smith fellowship, the Smith Center, or the Smith Bible study? It is absolutely right for them to call themselves the Smith family because they <em>are</em> the Smith family. They do miss so many of their folks, but they are still the Smith family.</p>
<p>Today is a day of confusion. I would like to be kind to everyone, but I do have a burden from the Lord. If I were afraid that I would offend someone, I could not be faithful to the Lord&rsquo;s burden. I must speak the truth. The sky must be cleared. If you are the Smith family then you must simply call yourselves the Smith family. If you do not like the Smith family, just say that you do not like it. Be honest and frank and faithful.</p>
<p>Since 1962, a strong testimony of the local churches has been raised up by the Lord, starting from Los Angeles. In the first few years people did not agree with it and did not pay much attention to it. After so many years, not only were many more churches raised up, but many books were published. Therefore, the term &ldquo;local church&rdquo; has become popular. Twelve years ago it was opposed, but in the last five years so many so-called free groups have begun to call themselves the local church. Recently the churches had some migrations to several cities, and from two of these cities we received letters warning us not to come because there was a local church there already. They said that they were the local church, and that they would not have fellowship with all the other local churches. And they did not! But they claimed to be the local church in those cities.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONE IN FELLOWSHIP</h2>
<p>In a situation of this nature, there is the need of clear discernment. According to the Bible, the Body of Christ is universally one, comprising all the saints and all the local churches. All the local churches, regardless of whether they are in this city, in this country, or in other countries, are the one Body of Christ. It is absolutely right to say that all the local churches are independent of one another. But this independence should be in administration, not in fellowship. In administration, all the local churches have their own jurisdiction, but in fellowship they must still be one. All the local churches throughout the whole world should be one in fellowship. Suppose there is a so-called local church in Atlanta. On the one hand they claim to be the local church there, but on the other hand they would not open to the other local churches in order to have fellowship. What sort of local church is this? Immediately that church becomes a local sect. A local church is one that is open to all the saints in that locality and open to all the other local churches. If there is a so-called local church that would not have fellowship with the other local churches, that is not a local church, but a repetition of the history of fallen Christianity. In refusing fellowship, this so-called local church becomes a local sect.</p>
<p>The first local church in the U. S. was raised up in Los Angeles in 1962. If anyone truly means business with the Lord for the proper unity, they will have no problem in having fellowship with the church in Los Angeles. If they will not fellowship with the church in Los Angeles, but hold a certain kind of concept that keeps them separated, they have lost the proper ground and have become sectarian. They are the same as the other free groups, because they will not recognize the other local churches. Ever since 1962, wherever a local church was raised up, if those saints did mean business with the Lord, they were happy to fellowship with the church in Los Angeles and the other local churches. This is in order to keep the proper unity among the Body of Christ. If any group refuses to fellowship with the other local churches, they have lost the ground of unity and have become sectarian. They are not a local church but a local sect.</p><h2 class="head1">A PROPER LOCAL CHURCH</h2>
<p>Since so many free groups have picked up the name of the local church, we must discern what a proper local church is. A proper local church is one that is open to all the real saints in the city where they are, as well as open to all the other local churches in this country and throughout the world. This is because all the churches are one Body. So many of these who have picked up the name of the local church argue that every local church is independent, saying that there is no need to be related to all the other local churches. But in Revelation, although there were seven epistles written to seven local churches, the whole book as one letter was written to all the churches. Surely this means that all the local churches should be related to one another, not in organization or administration, but in the testimony of Jesus. Then at the end of each of the seven epistles, the Lord says, &ldquo;He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the <em>churches.&rdquo;</em> This shows that each separate epistle written to a particular local church is also the speaking of the Spirit to all the churches.</p>
<p>Galatians is a book that was not written to an individual local church, but to all the local churches in Galatia. Galatia was not a city, but a province of the Roman Empire. Therefore, in Galatia there were many churches, and Paul wrote one letter to many churches. This shows that the churches there were related as one. Otherwise, how could they be one Body? In 1 Corinthians 1:2 Paul says that the letter was written to the church in Corinth with all that in every place call upon the name of the Lord. This one letter, which was written to one particular local church, was also good for all that in every place called upon the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>Since all the local churches are one Body, we cannot be divided in any way. Even localities cannot divide us. We may meet in Los Angeles, but we are one with the saints in Atlanta. Although we are separated by distance, we are still one. And we are one with the churches in the Far East, Germany, England, Africa, and in so many other countries. Praise the Lord that we are one Body!</p>
<p>Some have said that the seven churches in Revelation were all different from one another. In the early days, I was influenced by this kind of teaching. But gradually my eyes were opened to see that this is not accurate or sound. The seven local churches in Revelation were different from one another only in a negative sense. On the negative side, they were different; but on the positive side, all seven were the same. They were all golden lampstands. In nature, in appearance, in shape and in function they were all the same, losing their individual identity. They were different in their corruption and in their degradation, but in the positive things, they were all the same. This is also seen in the New Jerusalem. The wall of the city has four sides, yet every side is built with the same material, jasper, and looks the same (Rev. 21:18, 11).</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONLY ONE FLOW</h2>
<p>When the Lord raised up His recovery in China, He began in 1922 with Brother Watchman Nee in South China. From that time on, a number of gifted Chinese Christians were raised up. Nearly all of them passed through the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. They came and they left. In 1932 I came in contact with Brother Nee. The next year I went to visit him and stayed with him for three months. After that, he asked me to move down from North China to work with him and the other brothers. When I went to the Lord about this matter, I saw that in the book of Acts there was only one flow with the Lord&rsquo;s work. It started in Jerusalem, went up to Antioch, and turned to Ephesus and other places. On the way, here and there, new ones were raised up to join that one flow. It was not that one flow started with Peter, another with Paul, and another with Apollos. No, there was only one flow, and they all got into that flow. When I saw that, I told Brother Nee that I would come and join them, and I did. I saw that this was the Lord&rsquo;s unique flow. I could only join it; I could not start another one.</p>
<p>The Lord has led me to bring the torch of His recovery to this country. My burden is to pass the torch on to you brothers here, and I do believe that the torch has been passed. There are now thousands of saints in this country who would go on with the Lord&rsquo;s flow. This is not my work. This is the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, and this is His flow. I have mentioned all of these things so that we may be clear about the real situation, and so that we can have the proper discernment. Not every group that says it is the local church is the local church. It is not what we say we are; it is what we are. If we do mean business with the Lord to be a proper local church, we have to be a proper local church, receiving all the saints and being open in fellowship with all the local churches throughout the world. Then there will be no problem in having the real unity in the one Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE SEVENFOLD INTENSIFIED SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 1:4, 5a; 4:5; 5:6; 2:1, 7a, 8, 11a, 12, 17a, 18, 29; 3:1, 6, 7, 13, 14, 22; 14:13b; 19:10b; 22:17; Zech. 4:2, 4-6</h1>
<p>In the past few chapters in this book we have seen Christ as the wonderful One in the four Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles. Now we must come to the last part of the New Testament, the book of Revelation. When we come to the Word, many times we simply cannot see the things that are there. This is why we need the revelation of the Holy Spirit. If we simply read the black and white letters and understand with our mentality, we never see the clear revelation in the Bible.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD WAS GOD</h2>
<p>&ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God&rdquo; (John 1:1). By this verse we are clear that in the beginning Christ was God. We all must declare, proclaim, and announce to the universe that our Christ was God in the beginning! It is sad that today there are some so-called Christians who do not believe that Christ is God. But we do! Why do we believe? Simply because the Bible tells us so. The Bible tells us that Christ is God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD BECAME FLESH</h2>
<p>However, we must realize that this is in the beginning. When we have such a phrase, &ldquo;In the beginning,&rdquo; we realize that surely something will follow. The whole Bible opens with the same phrase: &ldquo;In the beginning God...&rdquo; (Gen. 1:1). In the beginning there was only God. God was God and there was nothing else. But John 1:14 tells us something more: &ldquo;And the Word became flesh, and tabernacled among us, (and we beheld his glory, the glory as of the only begotten of the Father,) full of grace and truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Now we have a problem. John 1:14 tells us that the Word which was God became flesh. Is the term &ldquo;flesh&rdquo; in the Bible positive or negative? If you say that it is negative, how could God become anything that is negative? However, the Word tells us clearly that God became flesh. In the beginning was the Word, and the Word became flesh. In order to understand this, we must come back to the pure Word. God did not create flesh. God created a man. Originally, man was man; he was not flesh. The Bible does not say that man became flesh until Genesis 6. By this we see that flesh in the Bible is not a positive term, but a negative one. By incarnation, God became flesh. By the time God was incarnated, man was no longer pure; he had become fallen. Fallen man in the Bible is called flesh. Man became flesh, and no flesh can be justified by the works of the law (Gal. 2:16). Flesh in the Bible is a negative term, denoting fallen, corrupted man.</p>
<p>How then could Christ as God become flesh? In this matter, we must be very careful. The Bible tells us that Christ became flesh, but only in the likeness of the flesh of sin. Romans 8:3 says, &ldquo;For what is impossible to the law, in that it was weak through the flesh, God sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin, condemned sin in the flesh&rdquo; (Recovery Version). When Christ became flesh, He did not take on the corruption of the flesh, but only its likeness.</p>
<p>There is a type of this in the Old Testament. In Numbers 21, God told Moses to make a brass serpent and put it on a pole to save those who were bitten by the fiery serpents. Then in John 3:14 we are told that this brass serpent was a type of the Lord Jesus. &ldquo;And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, even so must the Son of Man be lifted up; that every one who believes in Him may have eternal life&rdquo; (Recovery Version). Jesus was lifted up on the cross just as the serpent was lifted up on the pole by Moses. This means that when Jesus was on the cross for those six hours, in the eyes of God He was made a serpent. But He was a serpent only in form. Within Him there was no corruption.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAMB</h2>
<p>What was the purpose of Christ becoming flesh? The first reason was that He could be our Redeemer. He was God in the beginning, and then He became flesh. John 1:29 then tells us that He is the Lamb of God. He became flesh that He might be the redeeming Lamb. In God&rsquo;s redemption, the most important element is the blood. If there is no blood, there is no remission of sins (Heb. 9:22). Without the flesh, Christ would not have any blood for cleansing our sins. Praise the Lord that He became flesh with the blood! Then He could shed His blood upon the cross for our sins. &ldquo;Behold the Lamb of God that takes away the sin of the world&rdquo; (John 1:29). Christ became flesh for the purpose of accomplishing redemption for us.</p>
<p>The second reason Christ became flesh is deeper. He became flesh to bring God into man, that divinity might be mingled with humanity. This is God&rsquo;s eternal purpose, to work Himself into humanity. This work began with the incarnation of Jesus. When Jesus became man, that brought God into humanity. There was on the earth a man by the name of Jesus who was the mingling of divinity with humanity. Jesus was a wonderful Person. He was nothing less than the mingling of God with man. This is altogether wonderful!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE-GIVER</h2>
<p>After becoming flesh, Jesus lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. Then He took the second step. The first step was incarnation. The second was a step of death and resurrection. By this, He became the life-giving Spirit. First Corinthians 15:45 says that the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit. We know that the last Adam was Christ, the One who was God in the beginning and became flesh. In the first step He became flesh to be the last Adam. In the second step, through death and resurrection, as the last Adam He became the life-giving Spirit. Most Christians today only see that God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. Matthew 28:19 clearly mentions the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit. There is no argument about this. But not many have seen the last part of 1 Corinthians 15:45. This verse tells us plainly that Christ as the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit. He became flesh for redemption; He became the life-giving Spirit for giving life. We not only need redemption; we also need life. Redemption is on the negative side; life is on the positive side. We do need redemption; but even more, we need life! Christ is not only the Redeemer, but also the Life-giver. To be the Redeemer He became flesh; to be the Life-giver He became the Spirit. By becoming flesh, He accomplished redemption. By becoming the life-giving Spirit, He is now imparting life. Hallelujah! The Lord is not only our Redeemer, He is our life-giver! In eternity past He was God. Then in time He became flesh and the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BODY-CHRIST</h2>
<p>But we must realize that this is not all. After these two steps, He is now taking a third. He is becoming the Body-Christ! I realize that this is a new term. Some will say that this term is not in the Bible. But they need to read 1 Corinthians 12:12, &ldquo;For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one <em>body;</em> so also is the <em>Christ</em>&rdquo; (Greek). I am afraid that when we read this verse, we would read &ldquo;so also is the <em>church.</em>&rdquo; We know that Christ is the Head. But this verse says that Christ is the Body! We are clear that the Head is Christ and the Body is the church, but this verse does not say that the Body is the church. It says, &ldquo;For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one <em>body;</em> so also is the <em>Christ.</em>&rdquo; So we do have the Body-Christ. Our Christ today is the Body-Christ. He was God. Then He became flesh, the life-giving Spirit, and the Body-Christ. The first step was by incarnation. The second step was by death and resurrection. And the third step is by indwelling. After the Lord became the life-giving Spirit, He came to indwell us. By this indwelling, He is day by day working Himself into all of us.</p>
<p>We may use petrified wood as an illustration. A wooden log falls into a flowing river, and water flows through the log bringing in all the minerals, and carrying away all the wooden essence. Eventually the log still appears as a log, but the interior element has been discharged and replaced with something new. It has become a precious stone. This is what the indwelling of the Lord Jesus is accomplishing in us. In a sense, He is petrifying us. This is transformation. Today He is the living water flowing through us to bring in the divine minerals and replace all our old element. We are not under a kind of correction or adjustment: we are under transformation. Something new is coming in to replace the old. This is just Christ Himself. It is by this that we are made the Body-Christ.</p>
<p>God in the beginning was merely God. He was alone. But it is not good for God to be alone. He wants a counterpart. When Jesus came, He was recommended by John the Baptist not only as the Lamb of God, but also as the Bridegroom. &ldquo;He who has the bride is the bridegroom&rdquo; (John 3:29). Jesus came not simply to be the Redeemer, but to be the Bridegroom, and as such He needs a bride. Paul said that he had espoused the Corinthian believers as a chaste virgin to Christ (2 Cor. 11:2). Ephesians 5 tells us that the church is just like the wife, and Christ is the husband. Then in the book of Revelation we are told that the wife has made herself ready, and the marriage of the Lamb has come (Rev. 19:7). That will be a universal marriage. Who is going to be married there? Christ our God! From that time God will never be alone. Our God will be a married God! He will marry the Holy City, the New Jerusalem, the bride. At the beginning of the Bible, God is looking for a counterpart. At the end of the Bible, He is no more alone; He is with a bride. This is a picture showing us God being mingled with corporate humanity. This is God&rsquo;s eternal purpose. Look at the New Jerusalem. God is there as the center, and man is the corporate vessel containing God. The Spirit is flowing as living water, and the supplying Christ is there as the tree of life. This is the Triune God fully mingled with humanity. This is the Body-Christ. We must realize that today the genuine church life is just a miniature of that Body-Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE HARVEST IN REVELATION</h2>
<p>In the Gospels the seed was sown. In the Acts there is the sprouting of the seed. In the Epistles we see the growth of the seed. And in Revelation there is the harvest. Christ, the wonderful One, was sown as the seed in the Gospels. Then He sprouted up in the Acts, and began growing in the Epistles. Eventually, there is a harvest in Revelation. Revelation 14 tells us that the harvest is ripe. The sowing was in the Gospels, and the reaping will be in Revelation. In the Gospels, the Lord Jesus told us that He was the sower who came to sow Himself into the human earth. Then in the Acts, the individual Christ sprouted from the human earth to be the corporate Christ. In the Epistles, this corporate Christ continues to grow in a big field of humanity. Then eventually in the book of Revelation the harvest is ripe, and the bride is ready to be the New Jerusalem as the Body-Christ for eternity. This is God&rsquo;s goal. He was God in eternity. Then He came into time to become flesh. After passing through death and resurrection, He became the life-giving Spirit to indwell His members. In this way He becomes the Body-Christ. This is for eternity. He was God, but eventually He becomes the Body-Christ, the full mingling of divinity with humanity.</p>
<p>Our God in Christ has already taken two steps and is now taking the third. We should never forget these steps. The first was incarnation; the second was death and resurrection; and the third is indwelling. By incarnation He became flesh. Through death and resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. As such a Spirit He is now taking the third step of indwelling to mingle Himself fully with us. We will be wholly saturated with Him, and eventually there will only be one entity, the mingling of divinity with humanity in a corporate way. This corporate mingling is the Body-Christ. Today in the church life we are enjoying the foretaste of the Body-Christ that will be consummated in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEVENFOLD SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Now we must come to the book of Revelation. This book starts with the seven Spirits. &ldquo;John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from Him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before His throne&rdquo; (Rev. 1:4). Is God&rsquo;s Spirit one or seven? If it is one, why does it mention seven Spirits in the book of Revelation? To see this, we need a definition from Zechariah. &ldquo;And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof....Then the angel that talked with me answered and said unto me, Knowest thou not what these be? And I said, No, my lord. Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit, saith the Lord of hosts&rdquo; (Zech. 4:2, 5-6).</p>
<p>Zechariah the prophet saw a golden lampstand with lamps. Why is God&rsquo;s Spirit one, yet seven? Look at the lampstand. It depends upon which end you see. From the lower end, it is one. From the other end, it is seven. So it is one in seven, or seven in one. The angel asked the prophet what this was and then answered himself, &ldquo;This is the word of the Lord...Not by might, nor by power, but by My Spirit.&rdquo; The answer is that this is the Spirit. What the prophet saw was the Spirit. If we would know what the seven Spirits of God in Revelation are, we must go back to Zechariah. Nearly all the terms used in the book of Revelation have their source in the Old Testament. The Spirit of God in His ministry for God&rsquo;s move is seven. The number seven means completion in God&rsquo;s move. Therefore, the seven Spirits of God in Revelation do not mean seven different Spirits, but the one Spirit intensified seven times. If the one lampstand had only one lamp instead of seven, the light would not be that strong. If, however, there are seven lamps on the one lampstand, the light from the lampstand is intensified. This does not mean seven, separate, individual Spirits, but one Spirit with sevenfold enlightening. It is the intensified Spirit&mdash;one lampstand with seven lamps for intensified lighting.</p>
<p>The context of these verses in Zechariah shows that the lampstand, which signifies the Spirit of God in God&rsquo;s move, is for God&rsquo;s building. In the same principle, the sevenfold intensified Spirit in the book of Revelation is for the building of God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DEGRADED CHURCH</h2>
<p>Why is there the need of the sevenfold intensification of the one unique Holy Spirit? It is because at the time of the writing of the book of Revelation, the church had become degraded. On the day of Pentecost the church was initiated, and for the accomplishing of the proper church life there was the need of elders and deacons, as well as certain regulations. For example, the sisters practiced the headship in a living way by wearing a head covering. But not long after the church life was established, it became another religion. The Jews did the same thing with the commandments in the Old Testament given by God. They systematized everything and put it together to make a dead religion called Judaism.</p>
<p>The living Christ is against any kind of dead, systematized religion. When He came, He behaved in a way that denied, rejected, and renounced everything of religious Judaism. While they were keeping the regulations and forms, offering sacrifices on the altar, and worshipping God in the temple according to scriptural instructions, the Lord Jesus never joined them. Who was He? He was the very God whom they presumed to worship. But the very God was not in the temple anymore. While they were praying and worshipping in a formal and religious way, Jesus went into a common house in Bethany (John 12:1-10). At that time, where was God? Was He in the temple or in that common house? It is certain that He was in that common house. The religious people thought they had the proper worship according to their Scriptures, yet they did not know that they missed God. God had no intention of keeping all those religious regulations. He purposely did things to break their religious Sabbath. The Gospel of Matthew tells us that He did things again and again on the Sabbath day. He led His disciples to eat in the cornfield on the Sabbath day (Matt. 12:1), and the religious Sabbath patrol caught them. They caught a Sabbath breaker, and the Sabbath breaker was God incarnated as a man! God came to break the regulations of the Sabbath.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MISSING THE REALITY OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Do you think that God cares for religion? I can tell you that He does not. This is why when we come to the book of Revelation, there is the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Not long after its establishment, the church became a religion, with positions, regulations, and forms, having little that was living or real. In the first three chapters of Revelation, the churches, with the exception of the church in Philadelphia, had become degraded and had missed the reality of Christ as the life-giving Spirit. They worshipped an objective Christ, One who was sitting in the heavens. They had very little if any experience of Christ as the life-giving Spirit indwelling them as a spiritual reality. They had degraded into religion. This is why in the book of Revelation it is difficult to find any kind of doctrine. There is no doctrine of justification, holiness, foot washing, head covering, or baptism. There are absolutely no forms or positions. There is no mention of elders or deacons. In this book there is nothing but the sevenfold Spirit. Christ as the life-giving Spirit today must be intensified! We do not need to talk so much about doctrine. We need the intensified Spirit. How poor it is to degrade into a religion and leave the Spirit!</p>
<p>In today&rsquo;s Christianity, nearly everything is forms, regulations, doctrines, and positions. Even the singing has become formal. All of this must be cast into the lake of fire! We do not need all these formal, religious things. We need the living Christ! We need the sevenfold intensified Spirit. So many sisters cover their head in the meetings, but when they get home, they cover the head of their husband. There is no spirituality, just a form. The Lord hates this. With our headcovering we need the sevenfold intensified Spirit! Everything in the church life must have the sevenfold Spirit.</p>
<p>The leading ones in the churches in Revelation are not called elders, but angels. These angels are the shining stars in the Lord&rsquo;s hand. There is no position; they are just the shining ones. But in today&rsquo;s Christianity there are all kinds of positions. In the church life we do not need positions; we need the shining ones burning with the sevenfold Spirit. In the book of Revelation, the Lord denounces all forms. There is only the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</p>
<p>There is another change in Revelation. In Matthew 28:19, the Spirit is ranked third in the mentioning of the Triune God: &ldquo;...baptizing them in the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; But in Revelation 1:4-5, the order is changed. &ldquo;John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne; and from Jesus Christ, who is the faithful witness.&rdquo; Here we see that the seven Spirits are listed second. I did not change the one Spirit to the seven Spirits, and I did not make the Spirit second instead of third. This is all mentioned by John in the book of Revelation.</p><h2 class="head1">RELIGION</h2>
<p>What is religion? Religion is to worship God, to do good, to help others, and to adjust and correct yourself&mdash;all without Christ. Anything that is good for God or man, yet without Christ, is religion. In the church life we must not do anything without Christ. We are just for Christ. Our worship to God must be with Christ. Our goodness must be Christ. Without Christ, everything is religious. We may dress nicely to attend &ldquo;church&rdquo; on Sunday morning, carrying our Bible in our hand, but all without Christ. This is just a religion. If a young man who was on drugs two weeks ago came into the service shouting his praise and love for Jesus, he would be told not to make noise like that in the Sunday morning service. But let us be fair. Which do you think God prefers? The dressed up religious one without Christ, or the crazy, praising, shouting, one? I can boldly tell you that God is pleased with such a new lover of His, shouting, Hallelujah! This is not something of religion; this is something of the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</p>
<p>So many today are concerned about right doctrine. But in Revelation, there is no doctrine, just the sevenfold Spirit. Whoever is only for doctrine will miss God&rsquo;s presence. They are today&rsquo;s scribes and Pharisees, so scriptural, but missing the living Christ. I do not mean that we do not need the Bible. I believe that I love the Bible as much as anyone. But I know that without the Spirit, the Bible is merely dead letters, only good for mental knowledge, which kills. Paul tells us in 2 Corinthians 3:6, &ldquo;For the letter killeth, but the Spirit giveth life.&rdquo; All the Pharisees and scribes were killed by Bible knowledge. They sentenced Christ to death according to the Bible! (John 19:7). Satan is so subtle. He can use everything, even the Bible. There is only one thing that he cannot use, that is, Christ as the life-giving Spirit. Satan does not fear the Bible in letters, but he flees when he hears someone calling on the name of the living Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BURNING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Today we are not in the Acts nor the Epistles. We are living today in the book of Revelation, where there are no doctrines, forms, regulations, or positions. Rather there is the sevenfold Spirit as seven lamps of burning fire. &ldquo;And out of the throne...there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God&rdquo; (Rev. 4:5). The sevenfold Spirit is like seven lamps of fire burning us. In the last book of the Bible, the Spirit is not the Spirit of gentleness, but a burning fire! Many times while at home I felt I should be more moderate in my speaking. But in the meetings when I stand to speak, I simply cannot contain myself. I know how to speak so as not to offend anyone. I realize that the things I say are very offensive to many dear Christians. But I cannot help it. I am under the burning of the sevenfold Spirit. If I do not speak what the Spirit burdens me to speak, I have no peace for days. I must speak according to the burning of the sevenfold intensified Spirit.</p>
<p>This Spirit burns us to burn others. If we are not on fire, we are not qualified to be in the church life in a practical way. The whole church life is a burning fire. Everyone who is in the church ought to be on fire. On the one hand they are being burned, and on the other they are burning others.</p>
<p>The seven Spirits of God are not only burning, but also enlightening and searching. They search the inmost part of our heart, discerning our thoughts and motives with sharper perception than any X-ray. Such a Spirit searches us, enlightens us, and burns us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE OBSERVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>This is not all. Revelation 5:6 tells us that the seven burning Spirits are the seven eyes of the Lamb: &ldquo;And I beheld, and, lo, in the midst of the throne and of the four living creatures, and in the midst of the elders, stood a Lamb as it had been slain, having seven horns and seven eyes, which are the seven Spirits of God sent forth into all the earth.&rdquo; Here is a Lamb standing with seven eyes, and these seven eyes of the Lamb are the seven Spirits of God. We all know that eyes are not only for seeing, but for observing. If I were to keep my eyes upon you, it would mean that I mean business with you. This is an intimate, dear visitation. The Lord Jesus today has seven eyes. When He looked at Peter while He was on earth, He only had two eyes. But today when Christ comes to see us, He has seven eyes. This means that today the Lord&rsquo;s visitation is more serious and intensified. Yes, our Lord is the redeeming Lamb. But this Lamb has seven eyes, and His seven eyes are seven burning lamps. In one sense He is visiting us, and in another sense He is observing us and burning us. I do not believe that I am speaking mere knowledge. This is the reality of the sevenfold Spirit today.</p>
<p>Whenever anyone goes to a meeting of the church, they are under a special kind of observation. Just by going to one meeting, they begin to sense the living observation of the sevenfold Spirit. Before they went to the meeting, they said what they liked; but after going, Christ always seems to be there to regulate their speaking. In the evening some kind of inner voice within them urges them to go to the meeting. They really do not want to go, but they cannot help it. Then when they arrive at the meeting, they touch the living Christ again. Praise the Lord! It is not up to us; it is up to the visiting Christ. He is so gracious; yet He is rather terrifying. In the book of Revelation He has seven eyes! I have full assurance that today in the local churches the seven eyes of Jesus are here. The burning, searching, enlightening, and observing reality of Christ as the life-giving Spirit is in the local churches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SPEAKING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>All seven epistles written in the first three chapters of Revelation begin by saying, &ldquo;These things saith...,&rdquo; and the Lord Himself is presented in a particular aspect as the speaking One. But at the end of each epistle it says, &ldquo;He that hath an ear, let him hear what <em>the Spirit saith unto the churches.</em>&rdquo; This proves that what the Lord says is what the Spirit says. Instantly the Lord speaks to one church in particular, but constantly the Spirit speaks the same word to all the churches. Some say that the seven churches are independently different. But every epistle is not only to one particular church, but to all the churches. It is clear that these seven churches are only different in negative things. In all of the positive matters, they are the same. They all are golden shining lampstands. In their degradation they are different, but in nature, in essence, in purpose, and in ministry they are all the same.</p>
<p>Here in the book of Revelation we see the reality of the Spirit. Today is not the age of doctrine. Today is the age of the speaking Spirit. In all the other epistles, Peter speaks, John speaks, and Paul speaks. Only in the book of Revelation does it mention the Spirit speaking. &ldquo;Yea, saith the Spirit&rdquo; (Rev. 14:13). This is not any kind of doctrine or teaching, but the living reality of the speaking Spirit.</p>
<p>Originally it is the Spirit speaking to the churches; eventually it becomes the speaking of the Spirit and the Bride. &ldquo;And the Spirit and the bride say, Come&rdquo; (Rev. 22:17). Eventually the Spirit and the Bride have become one, so they speak as one. At the beginning of the book, the Spirit was the Spirit, and the churches were the churches. But at the end of the book, the Spirit and church have become one.</p>
<p>May the Lord have mercy upon us today. If we are still in the realm of doctrine, arguing about which doctrine is right and which is wrong, we have missed the mark. Today is a day of degradation. In this kind of situation, the Lord asks us to listen to the sevenfold intensified Spirit with the seven burning lamps and the seven eyes.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETEEN</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE HARVEST OF THE DIVINE SPIRIT<br />
AND THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 1:10-18, 20; 4:5b; 5:6b; 4:2; 17:3; 21:10; John 4:24; 6:63; 3:6b; 2 Cor. 3:17; 2 Tim. 4:22a; 1 Cor. 6:17; 12:12-13; Zech. 3:8b-9; 4:2, 6; 12:1</h1>
<p>The Bible is not only the holy Word, but also the divine Word. In this divine Word we have divine revelation. But we must realize that this divine revelation was not given all at once. It took God thousands of years to pass it on in a progressive way. In one year God gave a little part of His divine revelation. Then after a certain time, He came in to give another part. To us, this seems long, but to Him, a thousand years is like one day. God gave His divine revelation progressively, yet it is wholly consistent.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE &ldquo;LAMB-STONE&rdquo;</h2>
<p>Many Christians are troubled by the book of Revelation because of all the symbols. How could a face have seven eyes? And these seven eyes are on the face of a lamb (Rev. 5:6). Moreover, we are told that the seven eyes are seven lamps of burning fire (Rev. 4:5). Seven eyes are mysterious enough, but in addition we see that these seven eyes are on fire and burning. However, we must realize that nearly all the symbols in the book of Revelation are already mentioned in the Old Testament. We should not attempt to exercise our mind unduly, but come back to the pure Word. There is a rich mine in the Old Testament. If we dig this mine in the right way, we will obtain the proper interpretation.</p>
<p>Zechariah 3:9 also mentions seven eyes: &ldquo;For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua; upon one stone shall be seven eyes: behold, I will engrave the gravings thereof, saith the Lord of hosts, and I will remove the iniquity of that land in one day.&rdquo; Here the seven eyes are not on the lamb, but on a stone. On the cross God engraved this stone for the remission of sins. Thus He said that He would remove the iniquity of the land in one day. This is redemption. We know that a stone is material for God&rsquo;s building. But before the Lord can build us up, He must get rid of our iniquity. Therefore, the stone becomes a lamb. This is why the seven eyes on the stone are the seven eyes of the lamb. On the cross God engraved Christ to remove the iniquity of God&rsquo;s people. This is not only for redemption, but for the building of God. When the Lord Jesus was surrounded by His opposers. He indicated that He Himself is a stone. He said that the stone which the builders rejected would become the head of the corner (Matt. 21:42). This is the &ldquo;lamb-stone.&rdquo; He is both the lamb and the stone: the lamb is for our redemption, and the stone is for God&rsquo;s building. Redemption is for building. So eventually He is the lamb-stone&mdash;the lamb-stone with seven eyes.</p>
<p>In the book of Zechariah we also see the lampstand with seven lamps: &ldquo;And he said unto me, What seest thou? And I said, I have looked, and behold a lampstand all of gold, with a bowl upon the top of it, and his seven lamps thereon, and seven pipes to the seven lamps, which are upon the top thereof....Then he answered and spake unto me, saying, This is the word of the Lord unto Zerubbabel, saying, Not by might, nor by power, but by my spirit, saith the Lord of hosts&rdquo; (Zech. 4:2, 6). It is clear from these verses that the seven lamps are the Spirit of the Lord. Now we see that for God&rsquo;s building and God&rsquo;s administrative government, His Spirit is the seven lamps burning with fire.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BRANCHING OUT OF GOD</h2>
<p>Before the stone with seven eyes is mentioned in Zechariah, we read of the Branch. &ldquo;For, behold, I will bring forth my servant the Branch. For behold the stone that I have laid before Joshua: upon one stone shall be seven eyes&rdquo; (Zech. 3:8b-9a). The branch is the stone with seven eyes, which are the seven lamps. A branch is for growing, and a stone is for building. Christ is not only the branch of the Lord (Isa. 4:2), but also the branch of humanity (Isa. 11:1; Jer. 23:5; Zech. 6:12). He is the branching out of God, and He is also the branching out of the proper humanity. His name is the Branch. He is continually branching out God into humanity, and this branching out produces stones for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>I realize that we simply do not have this concept when we read the Bible. We have a natural concept; therefore, these verses are confusing. Our natural concept only takes the verses that we like. If you are a wife, you get nothing from Zechariah; but when you read, &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives&rdquo; (Eph. 5:25), you are encouraged and consider the Bible a wonderful book. This is the only verse that some wives can see. The husbands see another verse in this chapter: &ldquo;Wives, submit yourselves unto your own husbands&rdquo; (Eph. 5:22). This is the favorite verse of some husbands, because the natural concept of the husband is that his wife should submit herself to him. But when they come to the Branch and a stone with seven eyes, they are not interested. In our natural concept we do not have this kind of thing.</p>
<p>We must relinquish our natural concept and pray-read the Word. It was while I was praying over these verses in Zechariah that the Spirit within said that Christ is the branching out of God. He branches out God from eternity into time! Christ branched out God from the third heavens to the earth. He is the real branch! Today we are His branches, and we are branching out Him. One day when I was praying, &ldquo;O the Branch of the Lord, the Branch of the Lord,&rdquo; I realized that this was the branching out of God. And this branching out is for God&rsquo;s building, so He is also a stone. He is both a branch and a stone. When we come to the divine Word, we must forget our mentality and pray-read the Word. Then the Spirit will speak to us. There are many things in the Bible which are new to us, and we must learn how to get into all the parts of this consistent revelation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF THE WHOLE BIBLE</h2>
<p>We also need a bird&rsquo;s eye view of the whole Bible. If we detach a part from the whole, it is difficult to understand. To understand even one phrase of the divine revelation, we need the whole Bible. The Bible begins with &ldquo;In the beginning God...&rdquo; (Gen. 1:1), and the Bible ends with the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21&mdash;22), which is the Holy City, the Bride, the tabernacle of God. The Jews only hold on to the God of Genesis 1:1. They say they have God, but they only have God alone. However, God desires a counterpart. This is why we need to see the revelation of the whole Bible.</p>
<p>Matthew chapter one tells us that a virgin will conceive and bring forth a Son, who is to be called Jesus, which means Jehovah the Savior. His name is also Immanuel, meaning God with us. He is not only God, but God with us. There is a plus. When I was speaking concerning this in a certain place, a young seminary student was offended. He said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, do you mean that God is not complete? Do you think that God is short of something? Why should God need a plus?&rdquo; I simply did not have the heart to answer this young man. But within I said, &ldquo;Young man, you go on to have your complete God, but I have God-plus!&rdquo; The religious concept today is terrible. They say that God is complete and does not need anything, but the Bible says that God desires a bride. It is certain that before Jesus came, God was only God; He was never mingled with man, and He never came to be with man. Immanuel really means &ldquo;God-plus,&rdquo; but the natural religious concept would not accept this.</p>
<p>The first time I gave a message on eating Jesus was in 1958 in Taipei. Immediately after the meeting, a well educated brother came to speak with me in a very polite and political way. He said, &ldquo;Brother Lee, your message tonight was really good, but you used some terms which are not so refined. In fact, they are rather wild.&rdquo; When I asked to which terms he was referring, he said that to speak about eating Jesus was not good. I replied that I was not the first to say this. The Lord Jesus said in John 6:57, &ldquo;He that eateth me, even he shall live by me.&rdquo; Later I discovered that the word &ldquo;eateth&rdquo; in Greek does not only mean to eat, but to masticate, to chew finely. But this is not the religious concept of all Christians.</p>
<p>Likewise, Christians have never heard that God desires to have a counterpart. But this is the revelation in the divine Word. After man&rsquo;s creation, man was alone. Man needed a counterpart. God did not create one for him; He builded him one. The word for &ldquo;made&rdquo; in Genesis 2:22 is rendered &ldquo;builded&rdquo; according to the Hebrew. &ldquo;And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, builded he a woman, and brought her unto the man.&rdquo; When anything is built, there is the need of material. The material with which God builded man a counterpart was a piece out of man. Then God brought this counterpart back to the man, and the man said, &ldquo;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man&rdquo; (Gen. 2:23).</p>
<p>The beginning of the Bible reveals how a bride came out of man and was brought back to man. The end of the Bible also is the revelation of a wedding, the wedding of the Lamb (Rev. 19:7). Eventually this bride is a &ldquo;city-lady,&rdquo; the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:9-10).</p>
<p>In the beginning God was alone, but at the consummation, at the end, God has a big plus. In the beginning there was only God, but at the consummation, God is surrounded by a big city with a high wall built up with precious stones (Rev. 21:19). God is in the Lamb, for Revelation 21:23 tells us clearly that God is the light and the Lamb is the lamp: &ldquo;For the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof.&rdquo; Out of the throne of this Lamb-God flows the living water of life: &ldquo;And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb&rdquo; (Rev. 22:1). Along with the flow of the water of life, the tree of life grows (Rev. 22:2). This reveals that the Lamb-God is flowing out to water and supply every part of the city. Eventually the whole city becomes His expression. It is not an individual expression but a corporate one. This is the Body-Christ as the ultimate consummation of the whole Bible.</p><h2 class="head1">SEVEN STEPS FOR GOD&rsquo;S INCORPORATION</h2>
<p>Now I want to use another new term. This Body-Christ is God incorporated. God has become incorporated with man. Divinity has become incorporated with humanity. This is God incorporated. However, God could not accomplish this overnight. It will take Him at least six thousand years. One thing we do know is that this incorporation has not yet been finished.</p>
<p>To carry out such a great project, He appointed His Son Christ to be the Anointed One. As the appointed and anointed One He has taken seven steps for this work. The first was incarnation, the second crucifixion, the third resurrection, the fourth ascension, the fifth baptism, and the seventh is His coming back. What then is the sixth step? It is His indwelling. In the past messages we have seen all the definitions of these steps. Incarnation is the real mingling of divinity with humanity. Crucifixion not only means redemption, but also termination. All negative things along with the old creation were terminated on the cross. Then resurrection is the germination of the new creation. Ascension is the inauguration of God&rsquo;s Anointed One. Christ ascended to the heavens to be inaugurated into His post. Then God declared to the whole universe that He has set His Son as Lord of all, and Head over all to the church. After this He came down in the form of the Spirit. In His inauguration God the Father gave Him all the functions and abilities to build and finish God&rsquo;s divine project, that is, to build God&rsquo;s eternal habitation. To do this He needs the germinating life, the empowering Holy Spirit, and the gifted persons. On the day of ascension He received all of these. Then after His inauguration He came back in the form of the Spirit on the day of Pentecost to collect all God&rsquo;s chosen people on the Hebrew side as His members. He put them into Himself by baptizing them into the Spirit. Following this, in the house of Cornelius, He collected all His Gentile believers and baptized them into Himself. Only these two occasions are called the baptism in the Holy Spirit by the Bible. Therefore, the baptism of the Holy Spirit was accomplished once and for all. This is why 1 Corinthians 12:13 says, &ldquo;For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit.&rdquo; We all were baptized into the one Spirit. We do not need to be baptized again. Incarnation was accomplished once and for all. Crucifixion was accomplished once and for all. Resurrection was accomplished once and for all. Ascension was accomplished once and for all. And the baptism in the Holy Spirit was also accomplished once and for all.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DRINKING OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>There is only one step among these seven that is not completed instantly, once and for all. That is the indwelling. Although the Lord does indwell us when we are born again, it takes a longer period of time for Him to fully indwell us. This is why we need the moment by moment drinking of Him. The baptism in the Holy Spirit is once and for all. The drinking of the Spirit is not. &ldquo;For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body, whether we be Jews or Gentiles, whether we be bond or free; and were all made to drink of one Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 12:3, Gk.). Whenever we call &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; that is to drink one body once and for all, but now we have been made to drink of one Spirit. Drinking is a continual, lifelong matter. The baptism in the Spirit was to position us to drink. Now we must all continually drink of the one Spirit. And the way to drink of the Spirit is to call on the Lord. There is a verse in the same chapter that makes this clear. &ldquo;No man can say Lord Jesus, but in the Holy Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 12:1, Gk.). Whenever we call &ldquo;Lord Jesus,&rdquo; that is to drink of the Spirit. It is really meaningful that among the more than thirteen epistles written by the Apostle Paul, only 1 Corinthians opens with the matter of calling on the name of the Lord. &ldquo;Unto the church of God which is at Corinth, to them that are sanctified in Christ Jesus, called saints, with all that in every place call upon the name of Jesus Christ our Lord, both theirs and ours&rdquo; (1 Cor. 1:2). This is not simply to pray, but to call. The word &ldquo;call&rdquo; in the Greek means to cry out, to invoke a person by name. Jesus is so living! He is so near to us. He is so present and available! When we call on Him, He comes to us as the living water for us to drink.</p>
<p>There have been many people that have argued with me about calling on the name of the Lord. Some have said that it is merely psychological. But I have challenged them to try calling on any other name. Try to call, &ldquo;O Confucius,&rdquo; or, &ldquo;O Plato!&rdquo; You will feel and get nothing. But we all know that whosoever calls on the name of the Lord shall be saved (Rom. 10:13). The Lord of all is rich unto all that call upon Him (Rom. 10:12). It does not say that the Lord is rich unto all that study the Bible. Neither does it say that He is rich unto all that meditate. The Lord is rich unto all that call upon His name! The fact is the fact. We may tell ourselves that we do not need to breathe, because it is too repetitious. But it is not vain repetition. While we are arguing that we do not need to breathe, we are breathing.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord that we have all been positioned to drink! We have already been baptized in the Spirit, and now we have been positioned to drink of the Spirit. We have not been positioned to work for the Lord; we have been positioned to drink! We have all been made to drink of one Spirit. The Lord has been inaugurated into His post, and we have been inaugurated into ours. Our inauguration is to drink, not to work. And the way to drink is to call deeply on the name of the Lord. We have even been called to call. We are the calling ones as well as the called ones. All day long we must call on the name of the Lord.</p>
<p>To the Lord this is the indwelling, but to us it is the drinking. This drinking is for transformation. We have all been baptized in the Spirit, but we have not all been transformed. We have been put fully into Christ, but Christ has not been fully wrought into us. This takes a lifetime. The Lord Jesus was incarnated to be a man that He may be our Redeemer. Then He went to the cross and accomplished redemption. Three days later, in His resurrection, He was made the life-giving Spirit in order that He may come into us, indwell us, and impart Himself into us as life day by day. Even now He is waiting for a chance to gain more within us. He is just like the air, waiting for a crack to open that He may come in more. But so many times we will not open. We confine Him in a little box. May the Lord open our eyes to realize that He wants to take us over, possess us, fill us, and saturate us with Himself. He wants to fully indwell our mind, our emotion, our will, and our conscience that He may make His full home in our heart.</p>
<p>In the book of Ephesians Paul never prayed that the Ephesian Christians might be baptized in the Spirit and speak in tongues. But he did pray that the Lord would possess their inner man. &ldquo;For this cause I bow my knees unto the Father of our Lord Jesus Christ,...that he would grant you, according to the riches of his glory, to be strengthened with power by his Spirit in the inner man: that Christ may make his home in your hearts by faith&rdquo; (Eph. 3:14, 16-17a, Gk.). Paul was concerned that Christ might spread from their regenerated spirit into their heart, in order that He might settle down and make His home there. This is what we also need to pray for. We have all been baptized once and for all, but our drinking is too occasional. I fear that some of us have gone for two weeks without drinking hardly at all. We need to drink daily, hourly, instantly, constantly, and unceasingly of the Lord Jesus. We need to drink of all the divine riches of the indwelling Christ. Then His spiritual ingredients will be assimilated into our being. This is how the Body-Christ is produced.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT RELIGION BUT THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the book of Revelation it is altogether a matter of the Spirit. There is nothing to do with forms, regulations, or any kind of religion. Whether you are quiet or noisy, whether you wear long hair or short hair, whether you are circumcised or uncircumcised is not the question. It is altogether a matter of a new creation in the Spirit. This is to have Christ wrought into a resurrected humanity. Poor Christianity just follows the Jews. The Jews used the thirty-nine books of the Old Testament to form their Jewish religion. Poor Christianity followed by using their thirty-nine books plus twenty-seven more in the New Testament to form a Christianity religion.</p>
<p>Some time ago I was invited to a Jewish brother&rsquo;s home. He told me that when he was an orthodox Jew, they did everything based upon the verses of the Bible. He even put his shoes in a certain order according to their teaching of the Bible. They were very scriptural. Whatever they did was based upon their Scripture. But they did not have Christ. They had the type, and they had all the verses, but they did not have Christ. When Christ came to the Jewish people, according to their point of view, He did things against their Scriptures. He was not scriptural. He did not keep the Sabbath. He did not worship properly in the temple. He did things against their Scriptures. Yet He was the very God. This shows that to reach God&rsquo;s goal is altogether not a matter of religion. It is a matter of the Holy Spirit in our spirit.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was talking to the Samaritan woman, she spoke to Him about religion. But at that very time she had had five husbands and was now living with a man who was not her husband. So the Lord told her that it was not a matter of religion, but of worshipping God in her spirit. &ldquo;But an hour is coming, and now is, when the true worshippers shall worship the Father in spirit and reality; for the Father seeks such to worship Him. God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality&rdquo; (John 4:23-24, Recovery Version).</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOUR VISIONS SEEN IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In the book of Revelation John said four times that he was &ldquo;in spirit.&rdquo; This is because this book is composed of four major visions. The vision of the church is in the first three chapters. The vision of the world under God&rsquo;s administration is in chapters four through sixteen. The vision of the harlot, the false church, is in chapters seventeen through eighteen. Following this, there is the vision of the New Jerusalem in chapters twenty-one and twenty-two. Every time John saw one of these four visions, he was in spirit. &ldquo;I was in spirit on the Lord&rsquo;s day, and heard behind me a great voice, as of a trumpet....And I turned to see the voice that spake with me. And being turned, I saw seven golden lampstands; and in the midst of the seven lampstands one like unto the Son of man&rdquo; (Rev. 1:10, 12-13a, Gk.). Then in Revelation 4:2 John said, &ldquo;I was in spirit; and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne&rdquo; (Gk.). In this vision John saw the judgment of the world from God&rsquo;s throne. In Revelation 17 John was &ldquo;carried away in spirit into the wilderness: and I saw a woman sit upon a scarlet colored beast, full of names of blasphemy, having seven heads and ten horns&rdquo; (Rev. 17:3, Gk.). This was the great harlot, Babylon. The final vision is in Revelation 21 where John says, &ldquo;And he carried me away in spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me the holy city, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God&rdquo; (Rev. 21:10, Gk.).</p>
<p>John did not see these visions in his mentality. He saw them in spirit. The book of Revelation is a book of the harvest of these two spirits, the divine Spirit and the human spirit. The seed was sown in John 4:24: &ldquo;God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit.&rdquo; Those who have fellowship and contact with God must be in their spirit. In Revelation, this divine Spirit becomes the sevenfold intensified Spirit (Rev. 1:4; 4:5; 5:6), and this Spirit is seven eyes to burn, enlighten, search, observe, and visit. What should we do with this burning Spirit? We should not use our mind. We must be in our spirit. It was in spirit that John saw the churches, the judgment of the world, the great Babylon, and the New Jerusalem. God is Spirit, and those who contact Him must use their spirit. John did not see any of these visions until he was in his spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PROPER ORGAN, OUR HUMAN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>If we argue with our mentality, we miss the mark. This is not the organ we should use. For the church we must use our spirit. The church is a matter of the divine Spirit in the human spirit. You could never hear my voice with your eyes. That is the wrong organ. You must use your ears. The church is spiritual and mysterious. It can only be substantiated in our spirit. If there is an odor in the air and we exercise our eyes to see the odor, we will not see it. Neither can we listen to the odor with our ears. This does not mean that there is no odor. It simply means that we did not use our nose. We did not use the proper organ to substantiate this substance. Every kind of substance needs the proper substantiating organ. To substantiate a noise, we need our substantiating ears. To substantiate all colorful things, we need our substantiating eyes. If we lose our sight, we cannot substantiate any color.</p>
<p>We all must learn to turn to our inward &ldquo;nose,&rdquo; our spirit. We need our spirit for the church life. In Old Testament days no one with a flat nose could serve as a priest (Lev. 21:18). Everyone serving God must have a keen nose. This kind of spiritual nose is a beauty appraised by the Lord (S. of S. 7:4, 8). Many people speak to me, but they cannot cheat me. I have an inward smelling nose. They may say &ldquo;Yes&rdquo; to me, but in the spirit I know that the tone is &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Where is our spiritual nose? We must learn to turn to our spirit. God is Spirit, and we must learn to worship Him in spirit (John 4:24). Even the words of the Lord Jesus while He was here on earth are spirit. &ldquo;It is the Spirit Who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life&rdquo; (John 6:63). We do have a spirit, and our spirit is where we have been born again. &ldquo;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit&rdquo; (John 3:6b). We must learn to use our regenerated spirit. The church life needs our spirit!</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus was with His disciples for over three years, and they appreciated Him greatly. When He told them that He was going to die, they could not bear it. But He explained to them that His going was His real coming back. Before His death and resurrection He could only be among them. He could not enter into them. Therefore, He needed to take a further step that He might come into them. His going to die was not His going away; it was His coming back. It was only in this way that He could come back as the Spirit of reality to dwell in them forever.</p>
<h2 class="head1">IN SPIRIT AND WITH SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We must all realize that the Christian life is altogether a matter of the Spirit. It is not a matter of any doctrine or teaching, even from the Bible. I respect the Bible, but if the Bible is not taken in spirit and with spirit, it is just dead letters. I am not against the sisters covering their head. But whatever we do, we must do it in spirit and with spirit. Otherwise, it is just a dead form of godliness. When we touch the Bible in the church life, we must do it in spirit. If there is no spirit, it is deadening. We simply kill ourselves and others. In like manner, we should sing hymns in spirit and with spirit. Otherwise, we should not sing. Everything we do should be in spirit and with spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Today we are in the age of Revelation. Whatever we do must be under the seven eyes of Christ. Then we are no longer in religion with doctrines, but in Christ, with the Spirit. After Jesus accomplished His incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension, He became the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45) and came back to His members in a mysterious and hidden way. Now He dwells in us in such a hidden way (Gal. 2:20), but it is more than real. From within He is going to transform us, replacing all our fallen elements with Himself. This is His work and it takes time, but today He is doing it. This work is to build up the Body-Christ. By resurrection, in resurrection, and with resurrection Christ was made the life-giving Spirit. He is not only God, the Redeemer, and the Savior, but also the life-giving Spirit.</p>
<p>Andrew Murray, John Darby, and M. R. Vincent, in their interpretation of the Bible, all admit that Christ is the Holy Spirit. How can you reconcile this? I do not know. But it is a fact in the Bible. First Corinthians 15:45 says, &ldquo;The last Adam became a life-giving Spirit.&rdquo; Second Corinthians 3:17 says the same thing: &ldquo;Now the Lord is that Spirit.&rdquo; John Nelson Darby in his New Translation of the Bible puts verses seven through sixteen of 2 Corinthians, chapter three, into parentheses. By this he is saying that verse seventeen is a continuation of verse six. The last part of 2 Corinthians 3:6 says, &ldquo;But the Spirit giveth life.&rdquo; This is then continued by 2 Corinthians 3:17, &ldquo;Now the Lord is that Spirit.&rdquo; By these two verses it is clear that the Lord is the Spirit that gives life. Thus Darby agrees that the Lord is the Spirit that gives life.</p><h2 class="head1">A STRONG BASE</h2>
<p>Today is a day of confusion. We have a strong base for the things we minister. I admit that so many items are very new. But we should not think that because they are new, they are not scriptural. The Lord is progressing in opening His word to us. Even today we are seeing something more, that is, the matter of the Body-Christ. This is strongly based upon 1 Corinthians 12:12, &ldquo;For as the body is one, and hath many members, and all the members of that one body, being many, are one body: so also is <em>the Christ</em>&rdquo; (Gk.). The many members are one body, and so also is the Christ. This is simply the Body-Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A JOYFUL NOISE</h2>
<p>We believe in the Bible, the divine Word, and we believe every word in the Bible. We believe that Jesus Christ is the Son of God incarnated to be a man, that He died on the cross for our sins and was literally resurrected from the dead. He is our Saviour and life today, and we are looking forward to His coming back, when we will all be raptured. We believe in all these things. Who can say that we are heretical? Is it just because we are shouting? Does this mean that to be silent is scriptural? I do not believe so. There are many verses in the Bible about shouting. When all the captives returned to Jerusalem, and saw the foundation of the temple laid, they all shouted for joy (Ezra 3:11-13). Psalm 5:11 says, &ldquo;But let all those that put their trust in Thee rejoice: let them <em>ever shout</em> for joy, because Thou defendest them: let them also that love Thy name be joyful in Thee.&rdquo; This verse says that we should ever shout for joy, not just once in a while. It also says that if we love the Lord&rsquo;s name, we will be joyful in Him. If we are joyful, how could we be silent? Psalm 47:1 says, &ldquo;O clap your hands, all ye people; shout unto God with the voice of triumph.&rdquo; Some may argue that this is a kind of voice, not a noise. But Psalm 100:1 says, &ldquo;Make a joyful noise unto the Lord.&rdquo; The Bible tells us to be noisy! Seven times the Psalms tells us to make a joyful noise.</p>
<p>Some will say that this is something of the Old Testament. Then we had better read Matthew 21:15-16, &ldquo;And when the chief priests and scribes saw the wonderful things that he did, and the children crying in the temple, and saying, Hosanna to the Son of David; they were sore displeased, and said unto him, Hearest thou what these say? And Jesus saith unto them, Yea; have ye never read, Out of the mouth of babes and sucklings thou hast perfected praise?&rdquo; The children were crying in the temple and shouting, &ldquo;Hosanna to the Son of David!&rdquo; Certainly the chief priests and scribes thought this was out of place in the temple. They were greatly displeased. But Jesus declared that out of the mouth of babes and sucklings praise would come unto Him. They were so quiet scripturally, but they never saw such a verse in the Scriptures.</p>
<p>Preaching was only practiced in the sanctuary of the church of England. But God raised up John Wesley, who cared nothing for this. He preached and taught the Holy Word on the street corner. In his meetings there was much shouting. Even today, there are still the shouting Methodists. Church history shows us that many human concepts were brought in to confine the living Christ. He told the seven churches in Revelation, &ldquo;I am the living One, and was dead; and, behold I am living forevermore&rdquo; (Rev. 1:18). He is living! He can never be confined by any forms. Of course, if we were to have a form of shouting, Jesus would leave that too. This is why everything must be in the spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LESSONS LEARNED IN CHRISTIANITY</h2>
<p>I was born and raised in formal Christianity. I really know what Christianity is. After I was saved, I was brought into an assembly of Christians to learn the good teachings of the Bible. I received the teachings on prophecy and typology; but after seven and a half years, I discovered I had been killed by the teachings of dead letter. I repented and came into the matters of the inner life. After practicing the inner life for some time, I still felt weak, so I became involved with the Pentecostal things. I spoke in tongues for a considerable time and took the lead to help others to do this. Then I stopped this peculiar kind of speaking. By the Lord&rsquo;s mercy He planted me in the church life. You can see that I passed through all of these things. I was in formal Christianity, fundamental Christianity, the inner life, and the Pentecostal things. Through all this process, the Lord planted me in the church life. Now I have learned to enjoy the Lord as everything in my spirit by calling on the name of the Lord, the life-giving Spirit, and pray-reading the living Word, which is spirit and life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE DIVINE SPIRIT MINGLING<br />
WITH THE HUMAN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>By all these lessons in the past, I have realized that it is altogether a matter of the divine Spirit mingling with our human spirit. This is why 2 Timothy 4:22 says, &ldquo;The Lord Jesus Christ be with thy spirit,&rdquo; and 1 Corinthians 6:17 tells us, &ldquo;But he that is joined to the Lord is one spirit.&rdquo; Zechariah speaks not only of the wonderful divine Spirit in his book (Zech. 4:6), but also the human spirit. &ldquo;The Lord, which stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him&rdquo; (Zech. 12:1). In the whole universe, only three things are important: the heavens, the earth, and the spirit of man. The book of Zechariah speaks of the recovery of God&rsquo;s building. But without the divine Spirit and the human spirit, God&rsquo;s building is impossible. This is why both of these spirits are mentioned in this book. God&rsquo;s building <em>is</em> possible, and God is doing it. This building is a corporate entity, the Body-Christ. How the Lord must open our eyes to see this! The whole matter issues from the Triune God as the seven Spirits in our human spirit.</p>
<p>The book of Revelation is a harvest of the divine Spirit and the human spirit. John spoke of it first in his Gospel when he said that God is Spirit and that we must worship Him in spirit (John 4:24). Now in the book of Revelation we see the sevenfold Spirit in our human spirit. This book was written to the seven churches from the seven Spirits. &ldquo;John to the seven churches which are in Asia: Grace be unto you, and peace, from Him who is, and who was, and who is to come; and from the seven Spirits which are before his throne&rdquo; (Rev. 1:4). To see all that the sevenfold, intensified Spirit is speaking to the churches, John had to be in spirit. In spirit he saw the churches with the Son of Man walking in the midst. In spirit he saw the world under God&rsquo;s judgment. In spirit he saw the great Babylon. In spirit he saw the Holy City, New Jerusalem. Everything was so clear because he was in spirit. We will never understand what the Lord is speaking unless we also are in spirit. When we are in spirit, the vision is clear. This book is the speaking of the Spirit to the churches (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). Eventually, the Spirit and the Bride speak together as one (Rev. 22:17). It is altogether a matter of the divine Spirit with our human spirit. May we all see this.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY</h1>

<h1 class="title">EATING JESUS FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 1:13-18; 2:4, 7, 14, 15, 17, 20, 24, 26, 28; 3:12, 20</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE HIGH PRIEST AMONG THE CHURCHES</h2>
<p>Christ is the wonderful One. By reading Revelation, especially the first three chapters, we can see what a wonderful One He is. In chapter one we see Him as the Son of Man. He is the Son of Man, but He is not only the Son of Man. Let us read this description of Him. &ldquo;And in the midst of the seven lampstands one like unto the Son of man, clothed with a garment down to the foot, and girt about the breasts with a golden girdle. His head and his hairs were white like wool, as white as snow; and his eyes were as a flame of fire; and his feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and his voice as the sound of many waters. And he had in his right hand seven stars: and out of his mouth went a sharp two-edged sword: and his countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength. And when I saw him, I fell at his feet as dead. And he laid his right hand upon me, saying unto me, Fear not; I am the first and the last: I am the living one, and was dead: and, behold, I am living forevermore; and have the keys of hell and of death&rdquo; (Rev. 1:13-18, Gk.).</p>
<p>In this description of Christ, we see that His hair is white as snow. And His garment is a long robe going down to His feet. This is something that covers His whole body. His eyes are like flaming fire, and His face is like the shining of the sun. There is no night with Him. Within His mouth there is a two-edged sword, and His two feet are as burning brass. Have you ever seen such a one? Yet He is called the Son of Man. According to the Bible, His garment is a priest&rsquo;s garment. In the Bible, all the priests must wear long robes (Exo. 28:1-2, 4-5). Here His girdle is not at the loins, but at the breast. When He washed the feet of the disciples, He girded His loins. Now His girdle is on His breast. It is quite meaningful. This means that His work is over, but He still has a heart of concern. What is He concerned about? He is concerned about the churches.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, the priests did four main things. They offered the sacrifices, arranged the showbread, dressed the lamps, and burned the incense. To dress the lamps included two things. First they had to fill the lamps with oil, and then they had to snuff the wick. To snuff the wick means to cut off the burned part of the wick. We know that the sacrificial work of Christ was accomplished on the cross. Now He is not at the altar, but among the lampstands. He no longer needs to offer the sacrifices, but He does need to dress the lampstands by filling them with oil and snuffing the burnt wick. He still has a heart of concern to care for all the shining lampstands. He is the Priest to supply the oil and to snuff the waste. He is doing this today among the churches. The main point here is that Christ is revealed as such a priestly Person caring for the churches.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS FOOD</h2>
<p>After Revelation chapter one, Christ is revealed in chapters two and three as so many things. But in His speaking to the churches He is especially revealed as the tree of life and the hidden manna. &ldquo;He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the midst of the paradise of God....He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches; to him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it&rdquo; (Rev. 2:7, 17). Both the tree of life and the hidden manna are just Christ Himself. As the Priest with the heart of concern, He is among the churches. But as the tree of life and the hidden manna, He is the food for the overcomers. Christ as such a wonderful Person has at least two aspects. The first is the priestly aspect. Today He is our High Priest, walking among the churches, supplying the oil and snuffing the waste to make all the churches shining. Hallelujah for such a Person! The second aspect is that He is the supply to all the individual overcomers. He is the tree of life and the hidden manna for the overcomers to eat. &ldquo;To him that overcometh will I give to eat....&rdquo; It is not to learn, but to eat! We must eat Him as the tree of life and the hidden manna. He is the priestly Person taking care of His shining churches, and He is the life supply to all the overcomers. While He is walking among the churches, He is feeding us. We can eat Him as our life supply.</p>
<p>Such a Christ is revealed to us as the Son of Man. He really is the Son of Man, and He will be such for eternity. He is the mingling of divinity with humanity. He is a man, but this man is very ancient. He is ancient, but He is not old. His white hair does not signify His oldness but His ancientness. He is eternally ancient. He is the One in the beginning without a beginning. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God....And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us&rdquo; (John 1:1, 14, Recovery Version). This is the Son of Man. He was in the beginning that did not have a beginning. Jesus, the Man of Nazareth, is ancient. This is God Himself. In the Bible He is called the Ancient of days (Dan. 7:9, 13, 22). He is the Son of Man, yet He is shown to be the eternal God.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS PRIEST</h2>
<p>This God-Man is also a priest. He has all the virtues with no shortage whatsoever. Suppose His priestly garment were short, exposing His feet and legs. This would indicate that He lacks some virtues. However, His long robe signifies that He is short of nothing. In the Bible, a priest should not be exposed in any part (Exo. 20:26). All parts of His body must be clothed. Clothing in the Bible means righteousness (Isa. 64:6; Rev. 19:8). This means that we have been justified by the righteous God; we can stand in the righteousness of God. This God-Man has human virtues that are sufficient to cover His whole being. This is indicated by His long priestly robe. He is fully qualified to be a priest. But now He is not a priest at the altar in the outer court. That work is over. Now He is in the Holy Place, taking care of the lampstands.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS THE SHINING ONE</h2>
<p>This wonderful Christ is also the shining One. His face is like the shining of the sun, and His eyes are like flaming fire. His two feet are also like shining brass. This means that He has passed through all kinds of testing. He was tested and He was burned. Every step He took on this earth was tested. He passed all the tests, and now He is qualified to test others. He does not test us by His opinion, but by His two feet. From His head to His feet, He is a shining Person. When we come into His presence, there is no darkness. Instead we are under the absolute shining. Nothing can be hidden or concealed in His presence. Everything is exposed. Do you like this kind of Christ? Our brother John was frightened to death. We should not forget that the Apostle John was the one who leaned on His breast when Christ was on earth (John 13:23). At that time there was no burning and shining, but here John fell at His feet as dead. In the church life, everyone needs to have such an exposure. Sooner or later, whether it is this year or next, we will be in His presence and have an exposure that will frighten us to death. We will see that whatever we are, whatever we have, and whatever we do cannot stand His testing. Then we will fall down at His feet as ones dead.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SHORT OF EATING</h2>
<p>Why will we be so exposed in His presence? It is simply because we are short of eating. We are undernourished. In reading chapters two and three of Revelation, we see the concept of degraded Christianity. This religious concept is altogether a matter of doctrine. There is the doctrine of Balaam, the doctrine of the Nicolaitans, and the teaching of Jezebel (Rev. 2:14-15, 20). The word &ldquo;doctrine&rdquo; is mentioned three times and &ldquo;teaching&rdquo; once. What is religion? Religion is something composed of doctrines upon doctrines. The more doctrines there are, the better religion it is. The degraded churches only care for doctrines. But the concept of the living Christ who has such a care for the churches is to give His dear ones something to eat.</p>
<p>In all seven epistles to the churches there are three promises of eating. There is one in the first epistle concerning the tree of life. There is one in the middle concerning the hidden manna. There is also a promise of eating in the last epistle. &ldquo;Behold I stand at the door and knock: if any man hear my voice, and open the door, I will come in to him, and will feast with him, and he with me&rdquo; (Rev. 3:20, Gk.). This is a promise of feasting. Some Christians only use this verse half way. They speak of the Lord knocking at our heart&rsquo;s door, wanting to come in. If we will open the door, He will come in. This is all they say. It is right, but it is only half of the verse. What about the other half? When I was in Christianity, I listened to this message concerning the Lord&rsquo;s knocking many times. I never heard anyone say that when Jesus comes in, He will feast with us. They do speak about the coming in, but they forget about the feasting. But the coming in is for the feasting! Jesus did not say that when we open the door in answer to His knocking He will come in and feast by Himself. He said that He would feast <em>with us.</em> The first two promises were concerned just with eating, but in the last promise there is the feasting together with the Lord. This is wonderful!</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIFE SUPPLY TO BE LIVING</h2>
<p>The Lord Jesus told John that He is the living One. He is not only the ancient One, but also the living One. He has passed through death. He was dead, but now He is living forevermore! He is shining, and He is also living. To be living not only requires life, but also the life supply. If I did not eat anything in the last seven days, I would not be so living. But since I have been eating three good meals a day I am quite living and energetic. My energy comes from my eating. In the seven epistles, the concept of religion is doctrine and teaching. But the concept of the living One is eating and feasting. It is not doctrine, but the tree of life and the hidden manna. The tree of life is in the paradise of God. This is just God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Today, on the earth, God&rsquo;s dwelling place is the church. The tree of life is in the church, and it is Christ as our food and life supply.</p>
<p>Where then is the hidden manna? In typology, the hidden manna was in the Holy of Holies. The Holy of Holies is also the church. In the church life Christ is our hidden manna. He is really hidden. All those outside the church simply do not know what we are doing week after week. They also do not know where we get our energy to have meetings almost every night, as well as many mornings. Our energy comes from the hidden Christ. When we come into the church, we enjoy something hidden, the hidden manna. Christ today is the hidden manna, not for teaching, but for eating.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OVERCOME THE LOST LOVE</h2>
<p>Jesus said that to him that overcometh He will give to eat of the tree of life. Nearly all Christians have misinterpreted the meaning of the word, &ldquo;overcometh.&rdquo; Most think that this means we must overcome our temper, our family problems, our self, our flesh, our weak points, our sin, the world, and even Satan. But according to the context, to overcome is not to overcome all these things. Here it means that we must overcome the degraded situation of Christianity. In the church at Ephesus, the first love was lost. Therefore, we must overcome the losing of our first love. We must pray, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, I love You. I love You first, and I love You the best. My first love belongs to You. O Lord Jesus, I give the priority of my love to You.&rdquo; When we look at today&rsquo;s Christianity, we do not see such a love. Hence, we must overcome this kind of degradation. Then we will obtain the reward, which will be to enjoy Christ as the tree of life. To him that overcomes the situation of the church at Ephesus, Christ will give to eat of the tree of life. The first love will bring us to the tree of life. There is a kind of exchange. When we give our first love to the Lord Jesus, He will give us to eat of the tree of life. Our love is His enjoyment, and the tree of life is ours.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OVERCOME DOCTRINE</h2>
<p>To overcome the degraded situation in the church in Pergamos is to overcome all kinds of doctrines. In this church there was this kind of doctrine and that kind of doctrine. This is something we all must overcome. Almost all those in the church life must overcome doctrines. Even now I am concerned that some of the dear ones among us still hold on to some kind of doctrines. Of course some will say that we should not hold on to the wrong doctrines, such as the doctrine of Balaam and the doctrine of the Nicolaitans. These are certainly wrong, devilish doctrines. However, they continue to say that we must hold on to the right doctrines. But how do we know that the doctrines which we hold are right or wrong? No person will hold on to a doctrine that he knows is wrong. If I have a false twenty dollar bill, surely I will not keep it. If I do, it means that I think it is genuine, though it is false. Sometimes the counterfeit money looks better than the genuine. Only the experts can discern that it is false. How can you discern whether the doctrine you hold is right or not? It is really difficult. Therefore, we must forget the paper money and take the gold. This is the divine wisdom. As long as we hold the gold, we can never be cheated.</p><h2 class="head1">A BAIT WITH A HOOK</h2>
<p>In the same way, I do not care that much for doctrine. I am so much for the living Christ. As long as I have Christ, I have the real gold. Please do not talk to me about doctrine. Doctrine is always a bait, and with the bait there is a hook. We must be careful about doctrine. I am afraid that many of you are still not off the hook. You have been hooked for years with your doctrines, but how much Christ do you have? Some dear Christians think that they are so right and scriptural, yet they are so dead. They have been hooked for over twenty years, and they are still hooked. They have not been freed from doctrine. Immediately after I was saved, I was hooked by doctrines for seven and a half years. One day while I was walking on the street, the Lord stirred within me to show how dead and unfruitful I was. I had much knowledge from the types and prophecies, but I was dead. I repented to the Lord and asked for His mercy. It seemed that I had gotten off the hook. But the little hook was still in my throat. It has taken me twenty-five years to fully get off this hook. But today I can say that I am free. &ldquo;Now the Lord is that Spirit: and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is liberty&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:17).</p>
<p>Praise the Lord, I am liberated! I have been liberated from the hook of doctrine! Now I would ask, &ldquo;How about you?&rdquo; If you have been liberated from the hook of doctrine, you will never say I do not like this doctrine or that. You are free from this hook. To care for the doctrines means to care for the hook. I fear that nearly all Christians are hooked. On the day you were saved there was something living, bubbling, and transparently wonderful within you. Then you thought you had to &ldquo;go to church&rdquo; to learn more about the Bible. There the pastor helped you study the Bible and learn all the right doctrines. He may also have recommended that you go to Bible school or seminary. Then you graduated in a dead way. You were hooked by all the dead doctrines; you have been distracted from receiving the help of life. May the Lord have mercy upon us all!</p>
<p>While ministering in a certain place, a young man studying at a seminary came to speak to me. He asked if I believed in the Triune God. I told him that I believed more than he. Then he asked if I believed in the rapture. I asked what kind of rapture he was talking about. There is the pre-tribulation, post-tribulation, and mid-tribulation rapture. Poor Christianity! There is no ministry of Christ as the rich gold. They only have the dead teachings and doctrines. After this young brother had asked me a few questions and I did not satisfy him, he said, &ldquo;Goodbye Mr. Lee; I&rsquo;ll see you in heaven.&rdquo; I called him to come back and sit down. He wanted to see me in heaven, but I wanted to see him here. I thank the Lord that He saved this young brother from the doctrinal hook.</p>
<p>Nearly all Christians in this country have been killed by the teachings, doctrines, and knowledge of the Bible. The first year I came to minister in this country, I was invited to three different groups. Everyone was utterly dead. I told them that Christ today is the living One and that they did not need the dead doctrines. What they needed was the living Christ! All of them rebuked me to my face. Immediately after I finished speaking, they came to tell me that my doctrine was wrong. I assured them that whether I was doctrinally wrong or not, they would see one day that they are short of Christ. That was the end. They never invited me again. Instead, I became famous among them as a preacher of heresy. They sent out a paper saying that none of their groups should invite me. When I read it, I was happy. I did not need to minister the living Christ to such a dead place. It is just a waste of time.</p><h2 class="head1">BACK TO THE BEGINNING</h2>
<p>Jesus said, &ldquo;I am the living one, and was dead; and, behold, I am living forevermore&rdquo; (Rev. 1:18). Therefore, He can be the tree of life to us. He is Someone germinating and energizing all the time. He is the living fruit. He is the tree of life that grows and the hidden manna that supplies. Eventually He became a feast to all who will open the door to Him. The religious concept is doctrine, but the living Christ&rsquo;s concept is that we may eat of Him. Not long ago I gave a message on the eating of Christ. The next day while I was fellowshipping with the leading ones in an adjoining room, I heard the saints singing, &ldquo;Wholly, Wholly, Wholly.&rdquo; I thought they were singing, &ldquo;Holy, Holy, Holy,&rdquo; but when I came out I heard them sing:</p>
<p class="hbody">&ldquo;Wholly, wholly, wholly back to the beginning.<br />
God is in Christ Jesus now, and He is food to us.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was so happy with that song. Eventually it says that in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, we only know to eat. We do need to go back to the beginning, for in the beginning there was the tree of life. Christians have become degraded, going down into the bottomless pit of doctrine. But we are rising up to go back to the beginning to eat the tree of life. In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, there is only the eating of the tree of life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STONES TO BE BUILT UP</h2>
<p>In Revelation 2:17 the Lord says, &ldquo;To him that overcometh will I give to eat of the hidden manna, and will give him a white stone, and in the stone a new name written, which no man knoweth saving he that receiveth it.&rdquo; When I was a young Christian, I could not understand what this meant. Years went by until I began to understand that in the New Testament a stone is for building. When Peter first came to the Lord, the Lord changed his name. &ldquo;Jesus said. You are Simon the son of John; you shall be called Cephas (which translated means a stone)&rdquo; (John 1:42, Recovery Version). Then Peter tells us in his first epistle, &ldquo;As newborn babes, desire the pure milk of the word, that ye may grow into salvation: if so be ye have tasted that the Lord is gracious. To whom coming as unto a living stone, disallowed indeed of men, but chosen of God, and precious, ye also as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ&rdquo; (1 Peter 2:2-5, Gk.). In these verses Peter tells us that we need to eat the pure milk of the word that we may grow into precious stones to be built up together as a spiritual house.</p>
<p>A stone is for building. For the Lord to give the overcomers a white stone means something for the building. We originally were a piece of clay, but by eating Christ as the hidden manna, we are transformed into a stone good for God&rsquo;s building. When we come to the end of the Bible, we see a city that has a wall built up with precious stones (Rev. 21:19-20). This is why in the promise to the overcomers in the church in Philadelphia, the Lord says that they will be a pillar in the temple of God. &ldquo;Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem, which cometh down out of the heaven from my God: and I will write upon him my new name&rdquo; (Rev. 3:12). In the previous promise, the Lord only gave us a stone. We were not built in yet. But here the stone has become a pillar, which will never go out. How can someone come to the church, and yet leave? It is simply because he has not been built in. Once we are built in, even if we want to leave, we cannot. The building does not allow us to go. We can never go out. The pillar also bears the name of God. This means that this pillar is filled with God. It is something of God. It also bears the name of the New Jerusalem, because it is a part of the New Jerusalem. The final name it bears is the new name of Christ. This means that this pillar is a transformation of all the elements of Christ. It is altogether something new. It is the mingling of God with man as a part of the New Jerusalem. It is a part of God&rsquo;s building, and it is the expression of the transforming Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING JESUS</h2>
<p>When we put all the seven epistles together, we see that it is by eating Jesus that we will be transformed into a stone for God&rsquo;s building. By eating Jesus we will be built in. By eating Jesus we will be transformed to have His divine elements as our very element. By eating Jesus we will become a part of God&rsquo;s building, the New Jerusalem. By eating Jesus we will become His expression, bearing His new name. This is what it means to overcome. We must overcome the present situation of degraded Christianity. How can we do this? First of all we have the Son of Man as our High Priest caring for the churches by filling them with oil and cutting off all the oldness. Then we have this living One as our life supply. He is the tree of life and the hidden manna for us to eat that He might be assimilated into our very being. This will transform us into stones for God&rsquo;s building. Eventually we will be a part of the building. This is what the church life should be like today. We must see that the church life is absolutely nothing doctrinal, but something in the living Christ. All the churches must be in the presence of this living Person. Every member in the church must eat Him as the tree of life and as the hidden manna that they may be transformed into stones for God&rsquo;s building. This is the way the Body-Christ is produced.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE LIGHT OF LIFE</h1>
<p>Scripture Reading: Rev. 1:14b, 16b, 20; 2:28; 4:5; 10:1; 12:1; 18:1; 21:10-11, 23-24, 25b; John 1:4; 8:12; 9:5; 1 John 1:6-7; Eph. 5:13-14</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE AND LIGHT</h2>
<p>The divine revelation in the Scriptures is both progressive and consistent. The last book of the Bible is the consummation of God&rsquo;s revelation. All the points of God&rsquo;s revelation were sown as seeds in the book of Genesis, the first book of the Bible. These seeds continue to grow until all these points reach the harvest of God&rsquo;s revelation in the last and consummate book. The harvest of God&rsquo;s revelation includes many important items. One of these is life. The Bible may even be called a book of life.</p>
<p>With life, there is the important item of light. It is hard to say which of these is first. Does life come first, and then light, or does light come first, followed by life? According to Genesis, chapter one, light comes before life. Before God caused the things of life to come into being, He commanded the light to come forth. Then from light the things of life were brought forth. First of all, the light was very vague. Then the lowest things of life came forth. After this, more solid light was needed, so the sun, the moon, and the stars as the light bearers were revealed. Out of this solid light, the higher animal life and even the human life were created. Then God Himself as the highest light appeared on the Sabbath day. Following this highest light, the tree of life as the highest life, the life on the highest plane, was revealed.</p>
<p>According to Genesis, light comes first and then life is produced. But in the Gospel of John the order is reversed. &ldquo;In him was life, and the life was the light of men&rdquo; (John 1:4). According to this verse, life comes first, and then light follows. Christ is the life, and Christ is also the light. In the very beginning of the Bible, light and life are there.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIVE LEVELS OF LIFE</h2>
<p>By reading Genesis 1 and 2 carefully, we see that there are at least five levels of life. The lowest level of life is the vegetable life. This is life without any consciousness. The second level of life is the fish in the water and the birds in the air. These are animals, but they are not strong in life. The third level is the higher animal life such as the dog. You can talk to a dog a little, but you cannot talk to a fish. A still higher level is the human life that bears the image of God. This life is for expressing God, so it is made in the image of God. It is not God&rsquo;s life, but it has the form of God&rsquo;s life. The container of anything you purchase is always in the form of the content. The human life is the container of the divine life. This divine life is seen in Genesis 2 as the tree of life. The tree of life denotes life on the highest plane, the divine life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING THE TREE OF LIFE</h2>
<p>We were made in the image of God with the human life. Our life is much higher that the animal&rsquo;s. But we still need something. We are higher, but we are not the highest. There is the potential that we can possess life on the highest plane. This highest life is presented to us as food. It is shown as the tree of life, which is good for food. Although it is the life on the highest plane, it is not far from us.</p>
<p>Many times I have tried to discover how high the tree of life was. Of course, the Bible does not tell us. But it could not be so high that we could not reach it. He says that He is the bread of life (John 6:35). There is a type in the Old Testament called manna (Exo. 16:15). Manna was just a small round thing, yet we know from John 6 that manna is a picture of Jesus as the bread of life. The tree of life must be very available and convenient so that we can take this life in as our food.</p>
<p>Yet there is the possibility that man will take the tree of knowledge instead of the tree of life. The religious concept is of the tree of knowledge, thinking that we must know all the doctrines and teachings. But the divine concept is eating the tree of life. These two concepts were in the beginning in Genesis 2. The Bible is consistent. In the beginning there is the tree of life, and in the last book the tree of life is still there. In Revelation it has been even more developed. Man fell, yet we have the blood to wash our robes that we may come again to the tree of life. &ldquo;Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city&rdquo; (Rev. 22:14, Gk.). Hallelujah! Redemption brings us back to eating. Fallen Christianity keeps us away from eating. This is why we need the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. It brings us back to eating again, back to the beginning. We can come to the highest plane by eating the tree of life and taking the highest life into us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ORDER OF LIFE AND LIGHT</h2>
<p>Why is the order of life and light reversed in the Gospel of John? In God&rsquo;s creation, light is first and life follows. But in God&rsquo;s regeneration, life comes first and light follows. In the old creation light comes before life. But in God&rsquo;s new creation, life comes first, followed by light. This is because in God&rsquo;s old creation, God did not enter into His creatures. Therefore, God sent light in an objective way to shine over the darkness that life may be produced. However, in God&rsquo;s new creation, God comes into His creature. He comes into us as our life, and this life is the light of men.</p>
<p>When we came into the church, we did not see light first. We did not have eyes to see the spiritual reality. The butterfly was there, but we only saw the cocoon. We could not see the spirit, we could only see the flesh. This simply means that our eyes were blind to the real things.</p>
<p>Before we were saved, we never saw anything. Then one day we opened to the Lord Jesus and called on His name. Soon the light began to shine, and we could see all the sinful things we had done. Eventually we said, &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, forgive me!&rdquo; Then we sensed heavenly peace, and the burden of our sins fell off. The tears of joy began to flow. This is life. &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; From that time we were delivered out of darkness and brought into His wonderful light. This light comes from the life within. Once Jesus gets into us, the light begins to shine. I believe we have all had this kind of experience. When we were without Christ and in darkness, we could not see our sinfulness, our wickedness. But when the Lord Jesus came into us, His life became the light. Then He began to enlighten and expose us. In one sense, it is terrifying, but in another sense, it is really wonderful. What a release, and what a cleansing!</p>
<h2 class="head1">A PERSON OF LIGHT</h2>
<p>Now we must see something more in the book of Revelation. In Revelation 1, there are many items related to light concerning the Son of Man: &ldquo;And His eyes were as a flame of fire; and His feet like unto fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace; and His countenance was as the sun shineth in his strength&rdquo; (Rev. 1:14b-15a, 16b). Here the Lord&rsquo;s face is like the shining sun. This is light. His eyes are like flaming fire. Flaming fire not only burns; it also gives light. His feet were like fine brass, as if they burned in a furnace. They were also shining.</p>
<p>Look at this wonderful Person! His eyes are flaming, His face is shining, and His feet are burning. When we approach Him, we simply approach light. When He comes, He comes with light. In all the social clubs of this world, everything is in darkness. But if the church is genuine in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery, Jesus is there with a face like the shining sun, with flaming eyes, and with burning brass feet. Some may argue concerning who is the church. If we are the genuine church, Christ is here shining.</p>
<p>Eventually, because of His glory, the whole earth will be lightened. One day, all the earth will be under the lightening of the church. In the new heaven and new earth, all the nations will walk in the light of the New Jerusalem. &ldquo;And the nations shall walk in the light of it: and the kings of the earth do bring their glory and honor into it&rdquo; (Rev. 21:24, Gk.). The New Jerusalem will not only be full of light, but even the nations around the New Jerusalem will walk in the light of the city. The city will enlighten the whole earth. This should be a picture of the church today. The church today should enlighten the earth.</p>
<p>Jesus said in the Gospel of John that He is the light of the world (John 8:12; 9:5). This is just a little seed. When we come to the book of Revelation, there is the harvest of this seed. We have already seen that His face is like the shining of the sun. In chapter eighteen, His glory enlightens the whole earth. &ldquo;And after these things I saw another angel come down from heaven, having great power; and the earth was lightened with his glory&rdquo; (Rev. 18:1). Here we see the harvest. In the Gospel of John, we only have the seed of Christ being the light, but in Revelation there is the harvest. In this book Christ is not only the light, but also the shining sun full of glory, enlightening the whole world.</p><h2 class="head1">SHINING IN THE CHURCHES</h2>
<p>Before the Lord comes back to enlighten the whole world, He is now walking among the local churches shining over us. The church life is not only full of life, but also full of light. If you still can tell a lie, I doubt if you are in the real church life. In the genuine church life, we cannot lie to the brothers and sisters. Before a lie can come out of our lips, the shining of Christ causes it to vanish. Then we turn to the Lord and thank Him for His shining. &ldquo;O Lord Jesus, forgive me. I was going to lie to the brothers, but your shining saved me.&rdquo; This is the church life. With our roommates, our husbands and our wives, there is the shining light of Christ. Christ is the real light in the church life. His face is like the shining of the sun, and He has seven eyes like flaming fire. When He looks at us, we are under his shining and exposing. Even His walk among the churches is shining. He has shining feet. This exposes how dirty, sinful, and dark our walk is. Praise the Lord that He is shining today in the churches!</p>
<h2 class="head1">SHINING STARS</h2>
<p>In the book of Revelation, not only is Christ shining, but all the messengers, His servants in the churches, and even the churches themselves are shining. The churches are the lampstands, and the messengers of the churches are shining stars. &ldquo;The mystery of the seven stars which thou sawest in My right hand, and the seven golden lampstands. The seven stars are the messengers of the seven churches: and the seven lampstands which thou sawest are the seven churches&rdquo; (Rev. 1:20, Gk.). Both the stars and the lampstands are for the night. In the day we do not need the stars or the lampstands. But it is still night-time during the church age. The day is not here until the Lord comes back.</p>
<p>As shining stars in the church, we do not have any light of ourselves. We are only good for reflecting the sun&rsquo;s light. Hence, we must look unto Him with unveiled face that we might reflect His glory (2 Cor. 3:18). This causes us to become the shining stars.</p>
<p>In the Lord&rsquo;s recovery today in the churches, position means nothing. What we can do and how much we can accomplish also mean nothing. It all depends upon how much we are shining and how bright we are. This is what it means to be a messenger of the Lord in the churches today. The night is so evil and dark. There is absolutely no light. But here are some shining stars in the churches. Hallelujah! Their presence in the church means very much. When they are here, everything is in light. When they are gone, the whole situation is full of darkness. This should be the real elders in the churches. Christianity has spoiled the term &ldquo;elder.&rdquo; Therefore, the Spirit in the book of Revelation does not use this word. There is only the mention of the messengers as the shining stars. If any elder in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery holds the position without shining, that is a shame. It is not a matter of position, it is a matter of shining. It does not depend upon how much we can do, but upon how much we shine. And we can only shine by reflecting the sun. We do not have any light in ourselves.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HOLDING UP THE LAMP</h2>
<p>In the same principle, lampstands do not have any light of themselves. They are simply the stands to support the light. Most Christian teachers talk about the lampstands, but little about the lamps. Yet if we have the lampstands without the lamps, we are still in darkness. It is clear that the churches are the lampstands, but what are the lamps? In chapter one, we see the seven lampstands, and in chapter four we see the seven lamps. &ldquo;And out of the throne proceeded lightnings and thunderings and voices: and there were seven lamps of fire burning before the throne, which are the seven Spirits of God&rdquo; (Rev. 4:5). The seven lampstands are the seven churches, and the seven lamps are the seven Spirits. This means that the lamp is the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Some so-called churches may claim that they are the lampstand, but do they have the Spirit? If we do not have the Spirit, we are just a stand without a lamp. By itself, the lampstand cannot shine. It needs the lamp, the sevenfold intensified Spirit. Now we know how the church can shine. It is by and with the Spirit. This is why we all must turn from knowledge, doctrine, regulations, and ordinances to the Spirit. When the church turns to the Spirit, the Spirit becomes the lamp which the church holds to shine over others.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAMB LAMP</h2>
<p>In the church age, the lamps are the seven Spirits, but when we arrive in the New Jerusalem, the lamp will be the Lamb. &ldquo;And the city had no need of the sun, neither of the moon, to shine in it: for the glory of God did lighten it, and the Lamb is the lamp thereof&rdquo; (Rev. 21:23, Gk.). God is the light, and the Lamb is the lamp. This means that God is in Christ, shining out over the city. Today, God Himself through the Spirit is shining on the stands with all the churches. In eternity, the entire New Jerusalem will be a golden lampstand. If we read Revelation 21 and 22 properly, we see that the New Jerusalem is a mountain of gold, just like a golden stand. The throne of God and the Lamb is on the top. This is God in Christ shining out as the light. Christ is the lamp, and within this lamp is God as the light Therefore, Christ shines out God, and the city shines out Christ. Then the whole earth will walk in the light of the city.</p>
<p>Why is the Holy City so bright and full of light? It is because this city is saturated with the water of life and nourished with the tree of life. &ldquo;And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life&rdquo; (Rev. 22:1-2a). In other words, life will fill, saturate, and permeate this city. The city will be full of life, so that life will be the light of men. Our God is the light, His Christ is the lamp, and we are the golden lampstands holding the lamp shining out the light. This is a corporate entity composed of the mingling of divinity with humanity. This is the Body-Christ, full of life; and this life is the light.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SHINING WOMAN</h2>
<p>Now we must come to Revelation 12. The woman in this chapter describes the people of God. &ldquo;And there appeared a great sign in heaven; a woman clothed with the sun, and the moon under her feet, and upon her head a crown of twelve stars&rdquo; (Rev. 12:1, Gk.). To understand this woman, I would suggest that you read <em>The Glorious Church</em> by Watchman Nee. In this book, Brother Nee tells about four women. The first is Eve in Genesis 2. The second is the church as the counterpart of Christ in Ephesians 5. The third is the wonderful, universal woman in Revelation 12. Then, eventually, the fourth woman is the Bride, the New Jerusalem, in the last two chapters in the Bible. Brother Nee points out that the woman in Revelation 12 denotes all God&rsquo;s chosen people, from the patriarchs, through Israel, to the church. There are three stages. This woman is clothed with the sun. This means that her main part is covered with the sun, which signifies the church age. Under her feet is the moon. The moon signifies the age of the law. And upon her head are twelve stars. The stars signify the patriarchs. Both the patriarchs and the law are in the night. Before Jesus came, it was night. The patriarchs were the stars, and the people of Israel were the moon. Then, when Christ came, it was the dawning of the day. Therefore, the church age is clothed with the sun.</p>
<p>All God&rsquo;s selected people as a whole are this woman. She is full of light. In the whole universe, there are only three kinds of light bearers: the sun, the moon, and the stars. All these are on or around the woman. This is God&rsquo;s people. They are full of light, like the sun, moon, and stars. The church must be like this. We are not only God&rsquo;s people; we are the greater part of God&rsquo;s people. We are not the stars or the moon; we are the sun. This is wonderful!</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEARING THE GLORY OF GOD</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem shines the brightest of all, because she bears the glory of God. &ldquo;And he carried me away in spirit to a great and high mountain, and showed me that holy city, Jerusalem, descending out of heaven from God, having the glory of God: and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal&rdquo; (Rev. 21:10-11, Gk.). The sun will still shine during the time of the New Jerusalem, but there will be no need of the sun, because of the brightness of the city. &ldquo;And there shall be no night there; and they need no lamp, neither light of the sun; for the Lord God giveth them light&rdquo; (Rev. 22:5, Gk.). Suppose the electric light is burning in our room in the morning, and then the sun begins to shine in the window. At such a time the light becomes useless because of the brighter shining of the sun. These verses do not mean that there will be no sun in the New Jerusalem, but that God will be the light, and His light will swallow up the sunshine. His light will become the light of the city, so that in the city there is no night. God will shine there day and night as the greatest light. With the shining of the divine sun, there will be no moon, and there will be no night. However, outside the city, there will still be day and night.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LIGHT IN THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem is a picture, showing us how the Body-Christ, the church life, should be full of light. We should be filled and saturated with light. Many of us have been in various denominations and free groups. When we were there, we all sensed that there was no light. We could participate in all kinds of sports and worldly entertainments, and never experience any shining. Yet on Sunday, we could dress properly and go to &ldquo;church.&rdquo; There was absolutely no light there. But one day we came to the genuine church life. From the very first meeting, there was light. The more we opened to the Lord and called on His name, the more the light shined. Day by day in the church life we are under the shining of the sevenfold intensified Spirit. The church is the lampstand holding the lamp, and the lamp has seven eyes as a flame of fire. In the churches Christ is walking and observing with his seven flaming eyes; so the churches are full of light. Everyone is exposed. Some would try to hide, but there is no place to hide. In the church there is a heavenly flashlight, shining all the time. None can escape. The more we try to hide, the more we are exposed. The wisest way is to come to the light. The heavenly flashlight is not to hurt us, but to heal us. We need the shining of the light of life.</p>
<p>Whether we are the church or not does not depend upon what we say or what others say. It depends altogether upon the light. The light is the very presence of Christ. When He is here, who can deny the light, and who can escape the light? Praise the Lord! In the church there is no night, for Christ as the day is here! There is no need for anyone to manage or control. He is here! Where there is light, there is order. Where there is darkness, there is confusion. In the church life we are all under the control of the light, for here there is the shining of Christ. We are all under His sunshine. &ldquo;Awake thou that sleepest, and arise from the dead, and Christ will shine upon thee&rdquo; (Eph. 5:14, Gk.). Hallelujah! This is the lampstand with the proper shining of the lamp.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-TWO</h1>

<h1 class="title">FIVE ASPECTS OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 12:5, 10-11; 14:3-4, 14; 19:7-9; 21:2-3, 10-14, 22; 22:1-2, 14, 17</h1>
<p>The book of Revelation is a wonderful and all-inclusive book. It is the consummation of all the Bible. Nearly all the points and subjects in the Bible are consummated in this book. Without it, there is no consummation. At the beginning of Revelation, we see the local churches with Christ walking in their midst. Then at the end of this book, there is the holy city, New Jerusalem, God&rsquo;s habitation for eternity. In the beginning there are the churches, and at the end there is the New Jerusalem. The local churches and the New Jerusalem are two aspects of one thing. The local churches will eventually issue in the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the local churches. We all must see this.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE KERNEL AND THE SHELL</h2>
<p>Between the local churches and the New Jerusalem there are many things. The things we are interested in depend upon what kind of Christian we are. When I was young, I was with a group of Christians who were often in this book. They always talked about the beasts, the ten horns, the seven eyes, or sometimes the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven vials. Many times they taught me concerning the three and a half years, forty-two months, and twelve hundred and sixty days. Their mathematics in this book were exact. As a young man I had the desire to know all these things, and they did not disappoint me. However, after I had learned these things, I became dead. It took the Lord much grace to make me alive.</p>
<p>Some may wonder why these things would deaden me. Are these not things that are in the book of Revelation? Are these not scriptural matters? Yes they are. But when you eat peanuts, what part do you eat? Do you pick up the peanut, break it, drop the kernel, and eat the shell? Never. But do not the shells belong to the peanut? Without the shells, the kernel could never grow. Yet no one would be so foolish as to drop the kernel and eat the shell. However, among all Christians, everyone seems to be so foolish when coming to the Bible. We neglect the kernel, and choose the shell. We even use many ways to grind the shell into powder and make bread with the shell powder. But even then it is not tasteful. I was forced to feed on these shells for over seven years, and thus became so dead.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RIGHT SET OF SEVENS</h2>
<p>Praise the Lord that in these last forty years, when I come to the book of Revelation, I forget about the beast, the ten horns, and the seven heads! I was with that poor beast long enough. In these past years I have begun to see the Christ in this book. In chapter one, He is the wonderful Son of Man. His head is white, His eyes are flaming, and His face is shining. His robe covers His whole being, and His golden girdle is on His breast. He is caring so much for all the churches. This is what we must see in this book. This wonderful One is so much more precious than the ugly beast. His seven eyes are more marvelous than the seven heads.</p>
<p>In these days I do not like to study the seven trumpets and the seven vials. I would much rather deal with the seven lampstands, the seven Spirits, the seven stars, and the seven churches. Many have chosen the wrong set of sevens. They only know the seven trumpets, the seven vials, and the seven heads. Praise the Lord for another set of sevens! Seven lampstands, seven Spirits, seven stars, and seven churches! I would never trade this set of sevens for the other. There are too many wonderful things in the book of Revelation for us to pay so much attention to the shell.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A WONDERFUL WOMAN AND THE FIRSTFRUITS</h2>
<p>In Revelation 12 we see a wonderful woman. She is clothed with the sun, and under her feet is the moon. Upon her head is a crown of twelve stars. Is not this much better than the beast? We need the shell for the sake of the kernel, but we should always realize which is the most important. Undoubtedly, this wonderful woman is part of the kernel, and the ugly beast is but a part of the empty shell.</p>
<p>Then in Revelation 14 we read of 144,000 followers of the Lamb. &ldquo;And I looked, and lo, a Lamb stood on the mount Zion, and with Him an hundred forty and four thousand, having His Father&rsquo;s name written in their foreheads....These are they which were not defiled with woman; for they are virgins. These are they which follow the Lamb whithersoever He goeth. These were redeemed from among men, being the firstfruits unto God and to the Lamb&rdquo; (Rev. 14:1, 4). Eventually these followers of the Lamb will be the firstfruits. Who are they? They are not a special kind of people. They are just like you and me. They are the redeemed of this earth. They are not angels. They will be the firstfruits unto God and unto the Lamb. At this time the Lamb is not on earth, but on mount Zion. This is the heavenly mountain where God is.</p>
<p>In typology, the firstfruits were brought into the temple to present to the Lord. God Himself enjoyed the freshness of the firstfruits. When the harvest time comes, the harvest will not be brought into the temple, but to the air, which is between the heavenly temple and the earth (Rev. 14:14-16). In any type of farming, there is the farm, the barn, and the farmer&rsquo;s home. The barn is always between the farm and the home. It is halfway. The farmer does not take the firstfruits into the barn, but into the home for his own enjoyment. Then, later, the harvest is brought into the barn. Our Father&rsquo;s home is the temple on the heavenly mount Zion. Therefore, the firstfruits of His farm will not be brought into the &ldquo;barn&rdquo; in the air, but to the temple which is on mount Zion in the heavens. Then the harvest will be brought into the &ldquo;barn.&rdquo; This is really wonderful.</p>
<p>I love to study the wonderful Son of Man. I love to study the seven local churches, the seven lampstands, the seven stars, and the seven Spirits. I also love this wonderful woman and this wonderful crop with the firstfruits and the harvest. But as we read on we come to a horrible scene. It is the great Babylon, the great harlot, the mother of harlots. She is in Revelation 17 and 18. We do not need to spend much time here. We only need to know that she is fallen, and the Lord calls all His people to come out of her (Rev. 18:2, 4).</p><h2 class="head1">A PREPARED BRIDE AND AN ADORNED CITY</h2>
<p>In chapter nineteen, the marriage of the lamb is come, and His Bride has made herself ready with white linen (Rev. 19:7-8). This is really good, but it is not good enough. We must read on until we come to chapters twenty-one and twenty-two. Here we see that the Bride is the holy city. Now she is not only ready, but adorned. She is not just a bride, but a city. She has become a city-bride. She is God&rsquo;s tabernacle, the holy city, New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>I really like the sight of this New Jerusalem. I have traveled through almost forty countries, and I have seen many great cities. However, by the time I came to this country, I lost my interest in seeing big cities. I have seen the holy city, so I do not need to see any other city. The holy city, the New Jerusalem, is the Bride of Christ and the tabernacle of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A SHINING TESTIMONY</h2>
<p>Now we have seen at least five aspects concerning the church. There are the seven lampstands, the wonderful woman with the manchild, the crop with the firstfruits and the harvest, the Bride prepared for a wedding, and the New Jerusalem, the adorned Bride. When we come to the book of Revelation, we must spend most of our time with these five aspects as well as all the revelation regarding Christ. We should forget about the Antichrist, the ugly beast, the ten horns, and the wrong set of sevens, and spend our time with Christ and the church.</p>
<p>In this book, the church is a wonderful thing. Firstly, we see that the church in this dark age is God&rsquo;s shining testimony; so the church must be the lampstand. As God&rsquo;s shining testimony, all the local churches must be the lampstands. Of course, as the lampstands only, they could not shine. The stand must hold the lamp. And we have seen that the lamps in this age are the seven Spirits, the intensified Spirit. The testimony of Jesus is the speaking Spirit, and this is the lamp. Seven times in this book it says, &ldquo;He that hath an ear, let him hear what the Spirit saith unto the churches&rdquo; (Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). The speaking Spirit is the testimony of Jesus. Revelation 19:10 says, &ldquo;The testimony of Jesus is the spirit of prophecy.&rdquo; This is the speaking Spirit. Prophecy is not just to predict, but to speak. It is to speak something of Jesus, something concerning Jesus, and something for Jesus. The Spirit of this kind of speaking is the testimony of Jesus. This is the real lamp. The church must hold this shining lamp in this dark age.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MANCHILD WITHIN THE WOMAN</h2>
<p>The church is also the greater part of this wonderful woman in Revelation 12. God&rsquo;s people in His eyes are never a male, but a female. In the whole universe, God is the unique male. He is the husband. Isaiah, Jeremiah, Ezekiel, and Hosea all tell us that Israel was God&rsquo;s wife (Isa. 54:5; Jer. 3:14; Ezek. 16:32; Hosea 2:19-20). God is the husband, and His people are His wife. The church, we know, is the wife of Christ. Since God&rsquo;s people are a woman, God&rsquo;s enemy from the very beginning has tried to damage this woman. To understand the woman in Revelation 12, we must go back to Eve in Genesis 3. The serpent sought to damage her. God told the serpent that He would put enmity between him and the woman (Gen. 3:15). This means that there is enmity between Satan and God&rsquo;s people. It is the same in Revelation 12. The woman is God&rsquo;s people, and the dragon seeking to devour her child is the old serpent, the devil. We have seen by this woman that God&rsquo;s people are composed of three sections: the patriarchs, the people of Israel under the law, and the church under grace. The church is symbolized by being clothed with the sun. Israel under the law is symbolized by the moon under her feet. This indicates that this part is not respected so much as the other parts. Yet the patriarchs were a crown on her head, because the principle with the patriarchs was the same as that with the church: it was the principle of grace, not the principle of law.</p>
<p>Since the woman is the weaker vessel, she needs a stronger part. The stronger part of the woman in Revelation 12 is the manchild within her. &ldquo;And she brought forth a manchild, who was to rule all nations with a rod of iron: and her child was caught up unto God, and to his throne&rdquo; (Rev. 12:5). The manchild is not Christ, but a corporate person consisting of the overcomers. In Revelation 12:10, the manchild is called the brethren. This proves that this manchild is not individual, but corporate. It is this manchild that defeats Satan and casts him down from the heavens. &ldquo;And I heard a loud voice saying in heaven, Now is come salvation, and strength, and the kingdom of our God, and the authority of his Christ: for the accuser of our brethren is cast down, which accused them before our God day and night. And they overcame him by the blood of the Lamb, and by the word of their testimony; and they loved not their soul lives unto the death&rdquo; (Rev. 12:10-11, Gk.). This woman&rsquo;s child is the ultimate fulfillment of the prophecy in Genesis 3:15: &ldquo;He shall bruise thy head.&rdquo; The individual seed of the woman on the cross bruised the serpent&rsquo;s head, and the corporate seed of the corporate woman eventually casts down Satan from the heavens. The corporate manchild is raptured to the heavens, and casts down the old serpent, the devil. Because of this the salvation and the kingdom of God with the authority of His Christ are come. Praise the Lord that the brethren overcame him! This is the corporate manchild.</p>
<p>The church as the people of God needs to conceive a stronger part. The present part of this manchild should be in the local churches. I do not mean that every member of the local churches is a part of that manchild. But I do mean that today in the local churches there are a number of stronger ones who are the strong part of the church. The gentler part of the church is the woman, and the strong part of the church is the manchild. This is for the purpose of defeating God&rsquo;s enemy and casting him down.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S FARM</h2>
<p>The third aspect is that the church is God&rsquo;s farm. This is what the Apostle Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 3:9. &ldquo;For we are laborers together with God: ye are God&rsquo;s farm, ye are God&rsquo;s building&rdquo; (Gk.). Christ came and sowed Himself as a seed into the human field. Now this seed is growing up, and God has a crop. But this crop could never be harvested as long as it is green. There is the need of maturity so that the crop will ripen. With any crop there is the principle that part of it ripens early, and another part later. The early ripened ones are the firstfruits, and the rest become the harvest. Regardless of whether we are the firstfruits or the harvest, we all must be ripened. Then God will reap us either into the temple as the firstfruits, or into the &ldquo;barn&rdquo; in the air as the harvest.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST&rsquo;S BRIDE</h2>
<p>The church is not only the lampstand, the woman that produces the manchild to defeat the enemy, and the ripened crop, but also Christ&rsquo;s Bride. This is why the church must make herself ready for the marriage of the Lamb. &ldquo;Let us rejoice and be exceeding glad, and give glory to him: for the marriage of the Lamb is come, and His wife hath made herself ready. And to her was granted that she should be arrayed in fine linen, bright and pure: for the fine linen is the righteousnesses of the saints&rdquo; (Rev. 19:7-8, Gk.).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S ETERNAL HABITATION</h2>
<p>Eventually the church must become God&rsquo;s eternal habitation, the tabernacle of God. This is the New Jerusalem, the holy city. Now she is not only made ready, but also adorned. As the Bride, not yet as God&rsquo;s habitation, a white raiment to clothe her is sufficient. But for God&rsquo;s habitation she needs to be built up with transformed precious stones. There is the great high wall, the gates of pearl, and the city proper, which is golden. This is not merely something made ready, but something adorned. She is adorned with gold, pearl, and precious stones (not merely a piece of clothing) for God&rsquo;s eternal habitation. This is wonderful!</p>
<p>Have you seen these five aspects of the church in the book of Revelation? I have seen every aspect, and it is marvelous! From now on we must never tell others that the book of Revelation is a book of the ugly beast, the seven seals, the seven trumpets, and the seven vials. We must share how it is a book of seven golden lampstands, a wonderful woman, God&rsquo;s crop, a prepared Bride, and God&rsquo;s eternal tabernacle adorned with gold, pearl, and precious stones. Revelation is also a book of the seven Spirits, as well as of the wonderful Person of Christ. When He comes in Revelation 18:1, the whole earth will be lightened by His glory. This is His being the light of the world in a complete and full sense. No other book is so wonderful as this book of Revelation!</p>
<h2 class="head1">A MATTER OF EATING AND DRINKING</h2>
<p>Now let me ask a question. How could the wonderful woman in Revelation 12 conceive the manchild? All expectant mothers know that the child within them grows according to what they eat. If they eat properly, the child within them grows properly. If they eat adequately, the child grows adequately. If an expectant mother does not eat and drink, it is the baby that will die first. Whatever the mother eats is mainly for her child within. The manchild grows by the woman&rsquo;s eating and drinking. Even after the manchild has been raptured to the throne, the woman still needs to nourished. &ldquo;And to the woman were given two wings of a great eagle, that she might fly into the wilderness, into her place, where she is nourished for a time, and times, and half a time, from the face of the serpent&rdquo; (Rev. 12:14).</p>
<p>It is the same with the ripening of the crop. How could the crop reach maturity? It is only by eating and drinking. The eating is the proper fertilizing, and the drinking is the watering. The crop must always be fertilized and watered. In this way the crop eats and drinks and grows. The best way to be one of the firstfruits is to be faithful in eating Jesus.</p>
<p>How then does the Bride in Revelation 19 prepare herself? Today a girl who is getting married may go to a store to buy material to make a dress. But <em>this</em> Bride is clothed with fine linen, bright and pure. This could never be bought in any store, for it is the righteousnesses of the saints. This is Christ growing up and living out of us. When we live out Christ by letting Him grow in us, He will be our living. This is the preparation. The only way that Christ can grow in us and live out of us is by our eating and drinking Him all the time.</p>
<p>It is not different with the New Jerusalem. The picture shows us clearly how the holy city is adorned with gold, pearl, and precious stones. There is the river of water of life for drinking, and there is the tree of life for eating. &ldquo;And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life&rdquo; (Rev. 22:1-2a). It is altogether by eating and drinking that this city is adorned with the precious materials. The center of the New Jerusalem is God&rsquo;s throne, and upon this throne is God within the Lamb. God is now the redeeming God. This is shown in Revelation 4:3, where John said that the One sitting upon the throne looked like a jasper and a sardine stone. The jasper is green, and sardine is red. Green signifies life, and red signifies redemption. Green signifies God&rsquo;s divinity, and red signifies the redeeming Lamb. This is the Lamb-God, sitting on the throne in the center of the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>Out from the throne flows the river of water of life. This living water flows out of the Lamb-God. It is clear that this is the Spirit. In typology, the water of life flowed out of the cleft rock (Exo. 17:6). Jesus told us that if we are thirsty, we should come to Him and drink, and out of our innermost being will flow rivers of living water (John 7:37-38). John then tells us that Jesus was speaking of the Spirit (John 7:39). Here we have a picture of the Triune God. God is in the Lamb, and out of this Lamb-God flows the Spirit. In the river of water of life grows the tree of life. The tree of life signifies Christ as our life supply. This means that the Triune God flows out to water and supply the whole city. Then this city will be transformed into precious materials and built up together. This depends upon the whole city feeding on Jesus as the tree of life and drinking of the Spirit. It is altogether a matter of eating and drinking.</p><h2 class="head1">A PROMISE TO EAT AND A CALL TO DRINK</h2>
<p>Have you noticed that the book of Revelation closes with a promise and a call? The promise is in Revelation 22:14. &ldquo;Blessed are they that wash their robes, that they may have right to the tree of life, and may enter in through the gates into the city.&rdquo; The call is in Revelation 22:17. &ldquo;And the Spirit and the bride say, Come. And let him that heareth say, Come. And let him that is athirst come. And whosoever will, let him take the water of life freely.&rdquo; The promise is to eat the tree of life, and the call is to drink of the water of life. By eating Jesus as the tree of life and by drinking the Spirit we will be strong to deal with the enemy of God. By eating Jesus and drinking of the Spirit we will grow to reach maturity. By eating Jesus and drinking of the Spirit we will prepare ourselves as the Bride dressed in fine linen. It is also by eating Jesus and drinking of the Spirit that we will be adorned with the precious materials of gold, pearl, and precious stones that we might be built up together as the tabernacle of God. This is really wonderful! Hallelujah for such a promise and call!</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINGLING OF DIVINITY WITH HUMANITY</h2>
<p>Now we must see something more about the New Jerusalem. We have already seen that it is the total mingling of divinity with humanity. The New Jerusalem&rsquo;s number is twelve. Twelve is composed by multiplying three times four. There are four walls with four sides, and three gates on each side. This is three times four. It is multiplication, not addition. Multiplication is really a mingling. Four is the number signifying God&rsquo;s creatures. There are four living creatures before the throne of God (Rev. 4:6). Three is the number which signifies the Triune God. By multiplying three times four we get twelve. The creature mingled with the Triune God makes the New Jerusalem. This is a total mingling of divinity with humanity. In the beginning of the book of Revelation, the number of the church is seven. Seven is composed of three plus four. This is addition, not multiplication. In the beginning, God is only added to us, but eventually we will be fully mingled with Him. Before we were saved we were just number four. Then at the time we were saved, the number three was added unto us. We then became number seven. This is the beginning. But God wants to mingle Himself with us more and more until we become number twelve. Fifty years ago my number was seven, but today my number is twelve. Hallelujah! At the beginning I was in addition, but now I am in multiplication. Originally it was God added to me, but now God is multiplied with me. This is the mingling. The height of the wall is 144 cubits. This number is composed of twelve multiplied by twelve. This is the mingling multiplied by the mingling.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THREE GATES</h2>
<p>Why are there three gates on each side in the New Jerusalem? This is the Triune God, the Father, the Son, and the Spirit. In Luke 15, there are three parables. There is a shepherd who lost one of his sheep. There is a woman that lost a coin. Finally, there is a father whose son left home. The father is the Father, the shepherd is the Son, and the woman is the Spirit. These are the three gates to bring people in. Ephesians 2:18 says, &ldquo;For through Him we both have access in one Spirit unto the Father&rdquo; (Gk.). Through the Son we have access in the one Spirit unto the Father. These are the three gates to the New Jerusalem. The Triune God is our entry, our entrance. If there were only God the Father, there would be no entrance. It must be God the Father, God the Son, and God the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ONE STREET, ONE FLOW, ONE TREE</h2>
<p>At the center of the city is God in the Lamb, sitting on the throne. We have seen that now God is not merely God, but the Lamb-God. Out of the Lamb-God flows the river of water of life. This flow is not in a straight line, but in a spiral course. The New Jerusalem is a mountain with the throne at the top. The flow of living water within the one street starts at the top and spirals downward around the mountain until the final spiral at the bottom covers all twelve gates. In this way, the flow reaches every gate.</p>
<p>In this city there is only one flow and one street. We can never get lost. Regardless from what gate we enter&mdash;America, China, Europe, or Canada&mdash;we are in the flow. There is only one street, and the flow is in the midst of the street. &ldquo;In the midst of the street of it...&rdquo; (Rev. 22:2). The one street is on the two sides of the river of life, and the tree of life is growing in the river. This means that on the two sides of the street, the tree of life is growing. Here the tree of life is not like a tall tree, but as a vine, stretching all the way down the street in the flow of living water. Where there is the street, there is the river; and where the river is, the tree of life is growing. Once we enter the gate, we have three things before us: a unique street to walk on, a unique river to drink of, and a unique tree to eat of. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>This entire New Jerusalem is a picture of the proper church life. The church life is just like this. Once we get in, we are in the flow, and we will never be lost. There is only one street or one way. Where the street is, there is the flow for our drinking. In the flow, there is the tree of life for our eating. By following this one street we will be brought upward to God on the throne. At the same time we will be nourished to grow that we might be strong to deal with God&rsquo;s enemy. This is the way to be ripened, to be ready as the Bride, and to be adorned as the New Jerusalem. There is no need for any mere teachings or regulations. What we need is the proper eating and drinking that comes in the flow in the one street that leads to the throne of God. This produces the gold, pearl, and precious stones for the building up of God&rsquo;s eternal habitation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-THREE</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE CONSUMMATION OF GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 1:27; 2:9-12, 22; Matt. 16:18a; Eph. 2:20-22; 1 Cor. 3:9b, 11-12a; 1 Pet. 2:5; 2 Cor. 3:18; 1 John 3:2; Phil. 3:21; Rev. 4:2-3; 21:11-13, 16-21</h1>
<h2 class="head1">MAN FOR GOD&rsquo;S PURPOSE</h2>
<p>In these messages we have clearly seen that the revelation of the Scriptures is progressive and consistent. It starts from Genesis and goes through sixty-six books, ending with Revelation. In Genesis 1, after God finished the work of His creation, He created man. Zechariah 12:1 says that the Lord stretched forth the heavens, laid the foundation of the earth, and formed the spirit of man. The heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man is for God. But for man to be for God he must have an organ to contact God and take God in. This organ is the human spirit. Therefore, Zechariah says that God created the heavens and the earth and the spirit of man.</p>
<p>The whole universe serves God&rsquo;s purpose. His purpose is to have a group of human beings that He may work Himself into them so that they might bear His image. In this way God would become their life and content. God would be one with them, and they would be His expression, filled with all that He is.</p>
<p>For this purpose, God had to create man. For man to exist there is the need of the earth, and the earth needs the heavens. The sunshine, the rain, and even the air are all required for life. Without these things, no life can exist. The heavens are for the earth, and the earth&rsquo;s existence is for man. If the earth were a little closer to the sun, everything on the earth would be burned up, including man. If the earth were a little farther from the sun, everything on the earth would be frozen. Praise the Lord that the distance between the earth and the sun is just right! Therefore, the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man is for God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONTENT FOR THE CONTAINER</h2>
<p>John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit; and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and reality&rdquo; (Recovery Version). God made a spirit for man that man might worship Him. The way God made man was unique. He did not make anything in His own image but man. A glove is made in the image of a hand that the hand might enter into the glove. When it does, the glove is no longer empty, but has a content which is expressed by the glove. If we remove the hand from the glove, the glove becomes empty and useless. Its usefulness is just to contain the hand. In the same way, God made man in His image that He Himself might come into this man.</p>
<p>All containers are made in the form of the content. A round item has a round container. A square item has a square container. God made man in His image that man might contain God. Hence, Paul tells us in Romans 9:23 that man is God&rsquo;s vessel. &ldquo;And what if He should make known the riches of His glory upon vessels of mercy, which He had before prepared unto glory&rdquo; (Recovery Version). Man was made as a vessel to contain God. This vessel as the container of God was made exactly in the form of God. We human beings are not good for anything but God. Anything else does not fit. Whatever else we have tried to fill ourselves with can never satisfy. When we called on the Lord Jesus, He came into us. Then we all testified that we had found the purpose for living. To put anything but a hand into a glove is awkward and meaningless. A pencil or a book does not fit. Only a hand fits. Paul says in Galatians 4:19, &ldquo;My little children, of whom I travail in birth again until Christ be formed in you.&rdquo; Many Christians have Christ in them, but He is not formed in them.</p>
<p>God created man in His image that He might become the very content of man. To have the image is one thing, but to have God&rsquo;s life and nature is another. A wax man is made in the image of man, but does not have man&rsquo;s life. Our parents not only gave us man&rsquo;s image, but also man&rsquo;s life; but God in His creation only gave man His image, not His life. Therefore, after man was created, God placed him before the tree of life. This indicated that man had God&rsquo;s image, but he still did not have God&rsquo;s life. In Genesis 1 we see the image of God, and in Genesis 2 we see the life of God. God gave us His image in creation, but until we take in the tree of life, we do not have His life.</p><h2 class="head1">EATING THE LAMB-BREAD</h2>
<p>Praise the Lord for the day we received the Lord Jesus! He is the tree of life. &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo; (John 1:4). The tree of life is good for food, and Jesus as the bread of life is also good for food. The best way to receive Jesus as the bread of life into us is by eating. We are a living container. We received Jesus into us by eating Him. I have been eating for about seventy years, but I never really understood the right meaning of eating. Recently I have learned something about eating in a scientific way. When anything is eaten, it is digested and assimilated into the blood system. Eventually, what is eaten becomes the very cells and organic tissues of our being. It simply becomes us. The dieticians tell us that we are what we eat. We are composed of all the elements we eat. It is the same spiritually. If we eat Jesus all the time, we will be composed with Jesus. God made man as His container with His image, and then He put this living container before a tree symbolizing Himself as life. There man was to take God in by the way of eating. The Word tells us that the tree of life was good for food (Gen. 2:9). The only way to take anything into us in order that it might become us is by eating. God is good for eating. God is edible. God presented Himself to man in the form of food.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s first attempt to cause man to take Him in as food was a failure because of man&rsquo;s unfaithfulness in the garden of Eden. Man did not eat of the tree of life. Instead, he ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and fell. For this cause God Himself became a man. He came to redeem man by putting Himself through a process. He has been processed for us to take Him in. God again came in the form of food to man.</p>
<p>In His first attempt God presented Himself to man in the form of food. In His second attempt, He did the same. However, there was a difference between the first and second attempt. In a sense, the tree of life did not need any processing, but the bread of life does. In Genesis 2, He was the tree of life, ready to eat. But in John 6 as the bread of life, a process is necessary, for man had fallen, and there was the need of redemption. Redemption is a kind of process. In the book of Exodus, the Passover lamb had to be processed in a certain way before it could be eaten (Exo. 12:9). The lamb was killed and the blood was shed. Then the blood was struck on the door post and the meat of the lamb eaten. God instructed that the lamb must be roasted with fire. This is a process of cooking. Through the cross, Jesus has been processed that we might take Him in by eating. This eating includes redemption, for the processing includes the shedding of blood.</p>
<p>John 6 troubled me for many years, for Jesus firstly said that He was the bread of life (John 6:35), but eventually He said that we must eat His flesh and drink His blood (John 6:53). What kind of bread is this? Bread is something of the vegetable life, and blood is of the animal life. But today I am clear. Christ has many aspects. In one aspect He is the bread, and in another aspect He is the lamb with the flesh and blood. So eventually He is the Lamb-bread. Praise the Lord! Christ is the Lamb-bread, processed and good for eating. When we eat this One we receive the remission of sins and the imparting of life. His blood washes away all the negative things, and His life imparts into us everything positive. Hallelujah!</p>
<h2 class="head1">BLOOD AND WATER</h2>
<p>When we come to the end of the Bible, the tree of life appears again. The tree of life was there in the beginning, and seemed to be taken away. But eventually it appears again. This time it is seen growing in a flow of living water that proceeds out of the throne of God and the Lamb. &ldquo;And he showed me a pure river of water of life, clear as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb. In the midst of the street of it, and on either side of the river, was there the tree of life&rdquo; (Rev. 22:1-2a). Who is the Lamb? We know that this is the redeeming One. But in eternity, the blood does not flow. In this picture it is the living water that flows out of the Lamb. When the Lord was on the cross, two things flowed out of His side: blood and water (John 19:34). Blood is for redemption, and water is for imparting life. When we get into eternity, we will still see that Christ is the Lamb, but at that time we will not need the blood. We will only need the water. The blood came first to wash us, and the water followed to impart life into us. In eternity, Christ is still the Lamb, but we do not need the blood any longer. Satan, and all the trouble he caused, for which we needed the blood, will then be in the lake of fire. All the negative and sinful things will be gone. We will not need the blood, but we will still need the water of life with the tree of life growing in it.</p><h2 class="head1">TRANSFORMATION BY THE FLOWING LIFE</h2>
<p>The beginning of the Bible and the end of the Bible are much alike. In Genesis 2, besides the tree, there is a river flowing in four directions (Gen. 2:9-10). This is just like the New Jerusalem. There the one river from the throne flows until it eventually reaches all four directions of the twelve gates. In Genesis 2:12, we see that in the flow of the river there is gold, bdellium (or pearl), and onyx stone. Three kinds of precious materials are in the flow of the river. Eventually a woman was builded as a bride for man. &ldquo;And the rib which the Lord God had taken from man builded he a woman, and brought her unto the man&rdquo; (Gen. 2:22, Heb.). This is a very meaningful picture.</p>
<p>As we read through the whole Bible, we begin to see that the tree of life is just God Himself presented to man in the form of food. When this life enters into man, it becomes a flowing river. When Jesus comes into us, we begin to feel something flowing within. While we are in the classroom, while we are at work, while we are at home, there is something flowing within us. This is Jesus as the water of life, flowing to transform us. It is by water flowing through a log that it becomes petrified wood. The flowing of the water brings in many minerals and discharges the old wooden essence. There is a replacement. Likewise, by the flowing of the living water within us we are replaced. This is transformation.</p>
<p>Romans 9 tells us that we are vessels of clay. But God&rsquo;s intention is to transform these muddy vessels into precious stones. Precious stones are not created by God naturally. They were originally something else, but under the proper conditions they were transformed into precious stones. Originally we were all made vessels of clay. Sooner or later God will transform us into precious stones. He is very patient. To Him, one day is equal to a thousand years. He will not hurry. We may look at ourselves after three years in the church life and feel that we are about the same. But to God this is just a few minutes.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRECIOUS MATERIALS ARE FOR BUILDING</h2>
<p>All the precious materials are for a building. In Genesis 2 God did not create a woman; He built a woman. It is the same at the end of the Bible. The New Jerusalem is built with exactly the same materials that were in the flow of the river in Genesis. There is the tree of life growing in the river, and a city is built up with gold, pearl, and precious stones. And this city is a woman, a Bride. This Bride was not produced, but builded with the transformed items. Now we can see the consistency of the Bible. What was in the beginning in Genesis is eventually in Revelation. But there is a big difference. In Genesis these three precious materials were only lying there. They were not built together. But in Revelation, all three precious items are fitly framed and compacted together as a building. This is the Bible&rsquo;s consistent and progressive revelation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING STONES FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>From Genesis we come to Matthew, the first book in the New Testament. In chapter sixteen Jesus asked the disciples who the people thought He was. Peter answered boldly, &ldquo;Thou art the Christ, the Son of the living God&rdquo; (Matt. 16:16). Then the Lord answered Peter, &ldquo;And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it&rdquo; (Matt. 16:18). When Peter answered the Lord, he was right, but he was only half right. We need to underline the little word &ldquo;also&rdquo; in verse 18. &ldquo;I say <em>also</em> unto thee, That thou art Peter.&rdquo; The name Peter means a stone. When Andrew first brought Peter to the Lord, the Lord changed his name from Simon to Cephas, which means a stone (John 1:42). Therefore, the Lord was telling Peter that he was a stone to be built upon Himself as the rock for the producing of the church. &ldquo;Upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it.&rdquo; This little verse covers the whole New Testament.</p>
<p>Peter could never forget these words. When he was speaking to Jewish leaders in Acts 4, he told them that they had not simply rejected a little man from Nazareth, but the stone which God had made the head of the corner for His building. &ldquo;This is the stone which was set at nought of you builders, which is become the head of the corner. Neither is there salvation in any other; for there is none other name under heaven given among men whereby we must be saved&rdquo; (Acts 4:11-12). Many Christians preach this word concerning the name of Jesus, but they never touch the previous verse about the stone. Peter told the Jews that they had not only rejected the Savior, but also the stone for God&rsquo;s building. Salvation is not for going to heaven; salvation is for building. To be saved is not merely to go to heaven some day. To be saved is to be built into God&rsquo;s building. Jesus saves us with the purpose of making us a stone for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>Later, Peter wrote in his first epistle, &ldquo;Ye also, as living stones, are built up a spiritual house, an holy priesthood, to offer up spiritual sacrifices, acceptable to God by Jesus Christ&rdquo; (1 Pet. 2:5). We are not made living stones for an exhibition in the heavens. It is not like this. Stones are not for exhibition; they are for building. &ldquo;Ye also as living stones, are built up a spiritual house.&rdquo;</p><h2 class="head1">THE UNIVERSAL AND LOCAL BUILDING IN SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Then Paul tells us that we &ldquo;are built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets, Jesus Christ himself being the chief cornerstone; in whom all the building fitly framed together groweth unto an holy temple in the Lord: in whom ye also are being builded together into an habitation of God in spirit&rdquo; (Eph. 2:20-22, Gk.). In these verses we see that all Christians are fitly framed together to grow into an holy temple in the Lord. This is the universal aspect. But Paul also practically covers the local aspect. He says that we also are being built together locally into an habitation of God in spirit. This local building is now under the process. &ldquo;Ye also are <em>being</em> builded together.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many teachers in Christianity say that it is impossible to have the building now. They say that this will be in the future. But I cannot find such a teaching in the Bible. The church is not to be built in the future. The next age will be the dispensation of the kingdom. That will not be the church age. The church age is today! Ye also as local saints in your locality are being builded together into an habitation of God in spirit. This is something in our spirit. It is not through the Holy Spirit as translated by the King James Version. The Holy Spirit is the dweller, not the dwelling place. Our spirit is the dwelling place and the Holy Spirit is the dweller.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S FARM FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>Paul continues to tell us in 1 Corinthians 3 that we are God&rsquo;s farm to grow Christ, and we are God&rsquo;s building. &ldquo;Ye are God&rsquo;s farm, ye are God&rsquo;s building&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:9b, Gk.). Whatever is grown on God&rsquo;s farm is for God&rsquo;s building. Christ is the foundation, and we are not only the materials, but also the builders. Therefore, we must be careful which materials we use for the building. &ldquo;For other foundation can no man lay than that is laid, which is Jesus Christ. Now if any man build upon this foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, hay, stubble...&rdquo; (1 Cor. 3:11-12). We must build with gold, silver, and precious stones. This is the same as in Genesis 2. God&rsquo;s intention from Genesis to Revelation is to obtain such a building.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CONSUMMATION OF GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING</h2>
<p>In the book of Revelation, John gives us the full consummation of the Bible. It is the harvest of all the seeds in the divine Word. The seed of the tree of life was sown in Genesis, but the harvest of the tree of life is at the end of Revelation. Gold, pearl, and precious stones are sown in Genesis as a seed, but they are reaped in a city built up with these precious materials at the end of Revelation. Revelation is the reaping of all the things sown in the Bible. Jesus, Peter, and Paul all spoke about the building, but what they spoke was not the harvest. John reaped the building in the book of Revelation. How marvelous is the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 and 22! This is not a heavenly mansion as poor Christianity teaches. It is the consummation of God&rsquo;s building!</p>
<h2 class="head1">A UNIVERSAL GOLDEN LAMPSTAND</h2>
<p>Now we must see something in detail concerning the New Jerusalem. The city proper is a mountain. Its height is twelve thousand furlongs (Rev. 21:16). The number is meaningful. This is one thousand times twelve. We have seen that twelve is the mingling of three and four, which means the mingling of God and man. So the New Jerusalem is the mingling of God with man one thousand times. The length and the breadth and the height are equal (Rev. 21:16). They are all twelve thousand furlongs. The city is a big mountain with God&rsquo;s throne on the top. Out of the throne the living water is flowing. At the bottom of the mountain a wall is built which is 144 cubits high (Rev. 21:17). This is twelve times twelve. The height of the wall is not too high, but the height of the city proper is twelve thousand furlongs. This mountain is all of gold, the ultimate consummation of all the golden lampstands. The seven lampstands are local, and this golden lampstand is universal. The New Jerusalem is a universal golden lampstand, holding the Lamb as the lamp shining out the glory of God (Rev. 21:23). God as the light is in Christ as the lamp shining out from the top of this universal golden lampstand.</p><h2 class="head1">BUILT UPON GOD&rsquo;S FAITHFULNESS</h2>
<p>Around the New Jerusalem a wall is built with twelve foundations. These twelve foundations are twelve different kinds of precious stones (Rev. 21:19-20). The wall is all of jasper, and the first foundation of the wall is also of jasper (Rev. 21:18-19). On the twelve foundations of the wall of the city are the names of the twelve apostles of the Lamb (Rev. 21:14). I read an article which said that the colors of these precious stones are exactly the same as the colors of a rainbow. In Revelation 4:2-3, John saw God on the throne, and He looked like jasper. &ldquo;And immediately I was in spirit, and, behold, a throne was set in heaven, and one sat on the throne, and he that sat was to look upon like a jasper and a sardine stone: and there was a rainbow round about the throne.&rdquo; God on the throne appears like jasper, and the expression of the New Jerusalem also appears like jasper. &ldquo;Having the glory of God; and her light was like unto a stone most precious, even like a jasper stone, clear as crystal&rdquo; (Rev. 21:11). This shows that the New Jerusalem is the very expression of God. We also see that around the throne there is a rainbow (Rev. 4:3). This corresponds with the foundations of the wall of the city which also look like a rainbow. A rainbow signifies God&rsquo;s faithfulness. The foundation of this city is based upon God&rsquo;s faithfulness. The rainbow around God&rsquo;s throne also speaks of His faithfulness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NOT A PHYSICAL PLACE<br />
BUT A LIVING COMPOSITION</h2>
<p>Now we have seen the harvest and consummation of the Bible. Revelation 21 and 22 are the full harvest of the whole Bible. Everything that is sown in the Scriptures is reaped in these two chapters. The tree of life, the flowing river, the precious materials are all harvested here. This consummation is God&rsquo;s complete building. It should not be considered as a physical place. This picture of the New Jerusalem symbolizes that God in eternity will have a great living habitation composed of all the Old Testament and New Testament saints. The names of the twelve tribes are written on the twelve gates (Rev. 21:12). This signifies that all the Old Testament saints are there. The names of the twelve Apostles on the twelve foundations of the wall represent the New Testament saints.</p>
<p>In Revelation 3:12, we have a good illustration: &ldquo;Him that overcometh will I make a pillar in the temple of my God, and he shall go no more out: and I will write upon him the name of my God, and the name of the city of my God, which is new Jerusalem.&rdquo; This verse reveals that the New Jerusalem, God&rsquo;s temple, is not a physical building. We are God&rsquo;s temple, and this temple is eventually enlarged into a city. In the Old Testament the temple was God&rsquo;s habitation, and now this city-temple will be God&rsquo;s habitation for eternity. The overcomers who have been built into God&rsquo;s temple will all be part of God&rsquo;s eternal habitation. In this way we can see that the New Jerusalem is not a physical building, but a living composition composed of all God&rsquo;s chosen people. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>For centuries these last two chapters of the Bible have not been opened up to the church as they are today. Peter is a layer of the foundation, and John is a layer of the foundation. I do believe that we will all be the wall. In eternity we will all look like jasper stones. There will be no white face, no black face, no yellow face, but all jasper faces! We will not express American, Spanish, Chinese, or Japanese, but we will express the unique God. God on the throne looks like jasper, and we will be there for eternity looking also like jasper. Satan did his best to damage us, but God purged away all our negative elements into the lake of fire. Everything of Satan that came into us in the garden of Eden is now in the lake of fire. Now we are the same as God. Every saint in eternity will lose his identification, but this does not mean that we will lose our personality. We will all look like jasper stone in the appearance of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HEAT AND PRESSURE</h2>
<p>Precious stones are not created, but are formed under the earth mainly by heat and pressure. I have been told that there are some manufacturers today who produce diamonds by using high heat and pressure. There is no other way. God knows how to surround us with just the right heat and pressure. All the brothers realize that their wives are good heaters, and their children produce much pressure. For the sisters, their husbands and children produce the same. It sometimes seems that we cannot stand it any longer, but after a few years a precious stone is produced. If we are not married, there are still many good heaters in our big family, the church life. Some members will press us to the uttermost. They will press us out of our strength and out of our measure. I have been a Christian with two families for many years. One is small, and the other is larger. I have many pressures from my small family. But in the big family, the church life, I could not remain for one day without the Lord&rsquo;s mercy and grace. Sometimes I am in a big oven during the day with all the brothers, and at night I go home to be in the little oven. I am happy for so many pressures. They will produce precious stones for God&rsquo;s habitation. Today this habitation is just the church life. In the midst of all the heat and pressure we have the life supply. Praise the Lord! We have the tree of life and the water of life. In this way God is building His eternal habitation.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR</h1>

<h1 class="title">THE HARVEST OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rev. 21:1-21</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE ETERNAL HOLY OF HOLIES</h2>
<p>The book of Revelation is a book of symbols, so to understand this book, we need to find the real meaning of all the symbols. It is also a book that reaps all the seeds of the Bible. We must use these principles in understanding the New Jerusalem in chapter twenty-one.</p>
<p>The first thing we need to see is that this city is square, with three equal dimensions. The length, the width, and the height are all identical. In the Old Testament, there is only one thing that has three equal dimensions. That is the innermost part of God&rsquo;s dwelling place, the Holy of Holies. In the tabernacle, the Holy of Holies is ten cubits wide, ten cubits long, and ten cubits high. In the temple built by Solomon, the width, length, and height of the Holy of Holies are twenty cubits (1 Kings 6:20). By this we understand that the whole New Jerusalem is the eternal Holy of Holies. That is why there is no temple in this city. The whole city is the temple, twelve thousand furlongs, by twelve thousand furlongs, by twelve thousand furlongs. This means that this city is one thousand times the total mingling of divinity with humanity. It is altogether a mingling of God with man, and this mingling will be God&rsquo;s eternal Holy of Holies.</p>
<p>God does not desire any kind of habitation in the heavens or on the earth. Not only is the earth not satisfactory for God&rsquo;s habitation, even the heavens do not satisfy Him. God&rsquo;s desire is to have a habitation of Himself mingled with His chosen people. In other words, God wants His chosen people to be His habitation by being mingled with Himself. This is the real church life. The church life is neither a building nor a place, but a group of God&rsquo;s chosen people mingled with God. The more mingling we have, the more we will be God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<h2 class="head1">AN INWARD METABOLISM</h2>
<p>The mingling of God with man is the real meaning of transformation. Transformation is the divine essence coming into us to replace the fallen human element. We are human, but the divine elements are coming into our being to replace our natural essence. This is what the New Testament calls transformation. Transformation is not an outward change, but an inward metabolism. Metabolism is an inward change caused by a new element replacing the old. This is God&rsquo;s work today, and this is the work the indwelling Christ is doing. This is also the reason that teachings, doctrines, forms, and regulations never work. Teachings may correct you, and regulations may improve you somewhat, but they can never metabolize you; they can never transform you. The metabolic process in our physical bodies takes place with the eating of food. As we eat day by day, something new comes into our body to replace the old. All the old things are discharged. The body&rsquo;s health depends upon this kind of metabolization. Hallelujah! Jesus is transforming us! Day by day He is metabolizing us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RELIGIOUS VEILS</h2>
<p>To be transformed we need an unveiled face. &ldquo;But we all with unveiled face beholding and reflecting as a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit&rdquo; (2 Cor. 3:18, Gk.). All the veils keep us from being transformed. Most of the time our veils are our old concepts. They may be good and wonderful, but they are old. The Lord is new and fresh every day. He is moving on! If we still hold on to our old concepts, we will have veiled faces. These things may have been good ten years ago, or even two years ago. But the Lord is going on.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament, the Lord charged His people to be circumcised. He also charged them to keep the Sabbath day. The Jews became so accustomed to these things that they could never give them up. Then one day the very God who gave them these commandments came to them in a very mysterious way. He came in the form of a little child born in a manger at Bethlehem. If He had come in a glorious way with two camps of angels escorting Him, all the people of Israel would have received Him. But because He came in such a manner, they missed Him.</p>
<p>Who could believe that this little child was the very God? Yet Isaiah 9:6 tells us so. &ldquo;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given: and the government shall be upon his shoulder: and his name shall be called Wonderful, Counsellor, The mighty God, The everlasting Father, The Prince of Peace.&rdquo; A child is born, yet His name is called the Mighty God. The Jews paid all their attention to the verses concerning circumcision and the keeping of the Sabbath, but they missed Isaiah 9:6. If they had heeded this verse, surely they would have been watching for such a child to be born. When the wise men came from the East, they might have been clear that this was the fulfillment of Isaiah 9:6.</p>
<p>When Jesus came to the Jews, He completely disregarded the Sabbath day. He told them that He was the Lord of the Sabbath! If they have Him, they have the Sabbath, and if they do not have Him, they miss the Sabbath (Matt. 12:8). God&rsquo;s dealing with man is always improving. Leviticus 11 tells clearly the things that can be eaten and the things that cannot be eaten. Even after Pentecost Peter still held onto that ancient, traditional teaching. It forced God to give Peter a vision to show him that what He had cleansed Peter should not call common or unclean (Acts 10:15). Peter was veiled by the old religious way.</p>
<p>The Apostle Paul was a typical Jewish religionist. Then the Lord within began to show him that circumcision was just an outward form. This was not easy for a typical Jew. But he was very bold to say, &ldquo;For in Christ Jesus neither circumcision availeth any thing, nor uncircumcision, but a new creation&rdquo; (Gal. 6:15, Gk.). Some of us still hold onto something which veils us. Some of my friends have told me that they cannot tolerate the noise in our meetings. But is this really wrong? How many verses can you find about meeting in a silent way? I cannot find one verse. There are a few which tell us to be silent, but all of these are regarding God&rsquo;s judgment. We have to be silent if God is coming to judge! But when we are meeting together, are we expecting to be judged by God? No! We are meeting with joy! Psalm 100:1 tells us to make a joyful noise unto the Lord. This is not just a voice, but a noise. Do you think that the Lord really cares for all the silent religion? Paul tells us that in the last days there is the danger that some will have the form of godliness without the power (2 Tim. 3:5). A mere form means nothing. We need the reality! The reality is just the Spirit. We must forget about all the old, dead, traditional things, or they will become a veil to us.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD SPIRIT</h2>
<p>We all must look to the Lord with an unveiled face. When we see Him thoroughly, we can reflect Him as a mirror. By this we will be transformed into His image from one degree of glory to another. This is the transformation accomplished by the Lord Spirit. Here we have another compound title of the Lord. It is not the Father God that transforms us, but the Lord Spirit. The Lord Spirit is not teaching or correcting us, but transforming and metabolizing us. He is putting the riches of His element into us to discharge all our old, natural element and replace us with Himself. He is not making us an adjusted man, but a new man! Then we will be fully mingled with God, and this total mingling is God&rsquo;s habitation, God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This is the basic concept of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is the total mingling of God with man for His habitation.</p>
<p>This should help us to realize what the proper church life is. It is not the sisters coming to the meeting with their heads covered, and the brothers meeting as the head. This does not mean that I am disregarding the Bible. What I mean is that the real church life does not consist of these outward things. The real church life is to be filled up and saturated with the Lord Spirit. Why do we not say certain things? Not simply because it may be wrong, but because the Lord Spirit within us will not say them. If He will not say them, then we will not say them. Even if it is right, we still will not say them. Whether we say them or not is not based upon right or wrong, but upon the Lord Spirit. This is the basic concept of the church life. Many people today are talking about the church life, but in a way that is based upon right or wrong. In the New Jerusalem there will be no teachings of right or wrong, but the total mingling of divinity with humanity.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PEARL GATES</h2>
<p>How can we obtain this mingling? To enter into the New Jerusalem, we must pass through one of the twelve gates. Every gate was made of one pearl (Rev. 21:21). The producing of a pearl is very meaningful. It starts in a living oyster in the death waters. Something, such as a grain of sand, enters into the oyster and makes a wound. Then, because the grain of sand abides at the wound, the oyster secretes a kind of life juice around the grain of sand. Eventually a pearl is produced by the secretions of the oyster&rsquo;s life juice. This is the work of Christ, the Son of God, as the second Person of the Triune God. He came to be such a living One in the death waters of this earth. We are the grains of sand that wounded Him at the cross. But if we stay at this wound, He will secrete His life over us. In this way we all become pearls. This is a picture of regeneration. Regeneration is the entrance into the New Jerusalem. How did we get into the church? It was not by joining or by being sprinkled, but by realizing that in all this world full of death there is Someone living. This Someone died on the cross by being crucified. When we believe in Him, we abide at this wound of the cross, and the life of Jesus begins to cover us. From that time onward there is a secretion of life over us all the time. This is the gate into the church life. This includes redemption, crucifixion, resurrection, and regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GOLDEN STREET</h2>
<p>Once we are in the gate, we are on the street of gold. In typology, gold signifies the divine nature of God. Once we enter into the gate of regeneration, we are immediately on the street of the divine nature. God&rsquo;s divine nature becomes our way of doing things. Suppose a brother wants to have his hair cut. Should he have it cut long or short? There is no verse in the Bible telling us how to cut our hair. But our way is the divine nature. God&rsquo;s divine essence is our way. We have a golden way. We need not ask anyone, but turn to the divine nature within us. The divine nature will become the way we cut our hair. We will know what kind of haircut to have. We should not take our way or anyone else&rsquo;s way. We should take the golden way! There is something golden within us! We have been regenerated and have passed through the gates of pearl. Now we are on the golden street, the divine way. The divine nature within us has become our street. When we call on the Lord from deep within to contact this divine nature, we know the way to take. There is no need to tell you where the golden street is. As long as we have passed through the pearly gates, we are on it. There is only one way, for in the New Jerusalem there is only one street. The American, Chinese, and German believers are all on the same golden way. This golden street is God&rsquo;s divine nature.</p>
<p>Many Christians today say that we must do everything according to the Bible. I was influenced to believe that. But later, as I studied more of the Bible, I realized that if everything we did was according to the Scriptures, our Bible would need thousands of chapters. It would take us years to read through this Bible. But we do not need such a thick Bible. We have the divine nature! After being regenerated, we are on the golden way. We have the divine nature within us as our living way.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RIVER AND TREE IN THE STREET</h2>
<p>In all of America there is not such a highway as this golden street. It is a spiral that begins at the throne of God and the Lamb at the top of the mountain and spirals around until the last spiral covers all twelve gates. This street is of two lanes, with the living water of life flowing in the midst. Wherever the street goes, the river flows. If we walk on the golden way, we will have the continual flowing of the living water. The best check to see whether we are on the divine way or not is the flow within. You may say that it is all right for you to do a certain thing, but do you have the flow within? Do you have the flow of the water of life? If you do not, you have turned away from the divine way. The divine way is full of the flowing of the water of life.</p>
<p>The tree of life also grows in the river of life, which is between the two lanes of the golden street. Once we enter the gate, we have three things: the golden street, the flow of the river of life, and the tree of life. This is just the Triune God. The divine nature is the Father, the tree of life is the Son, and the flow of the river of life is the Spirit. While we are walking on the golden street, we are drinking of the living water and eating of the tree of life. This means that we are living, behaving, walking, and having our being in God&rsquo;s divine nature. We are drinking of the Spirit and eating of the Son that we may live in the Father&rsquo;s nature. This is the way the Triune God is getting into us. The Father is our way, the Spirit is our drink, and the Son is our food. This is not a teaching of the Trinity; this is the real experience of the Triune God! The Triune God is dispensing Himself into us in our daily living as we walk in the divine nature, drink of the Holy Spirit, and eat Jesus as the tree of life. This is our way.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO MEET</h2>
<p>People are always asking me concerning the way to have a meeting. It is really difficult to answer. We have published a book entitled, <em>How To Meet,</em> and by the title many have thought that it gives directions concerning how to meet. But I can assure you that the more you read this book, the more you will not know how to meet! My intention in publishing this book was to puzzle all those who think they know how to meet. After reading it, I believe you will never think that you know how to meet again. Some say that the way to meet is in 1 Corinthians 14, but they are still not clear. No one can be clear how to meet. The way is not in the letters. The way is in the divine nature of the Father. The way to meet is to take the divine nature of the Father, drink of the Spirit, and eat of the Son. If we do this, the Lord will take away all our knowledge. Eventually, we will not know anything. We will only know to call on the name of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head1">A GOLDEN LAMPSTAND</h2>
<p>If we will take the divine nature as our way, the Triune God will flow all of His divine elements into our being. This flow will also carry away all our old nature. We will have a real replacement, and we will become golden! This is why in the book of Revelation the church is seen as a golden lampstand. The New Jerusalem is the same. The whole city is of gold (Rev. 21:18). It is a universal golden lampstand. How can we become such a church? It is by walking in the divine nature of the Father, drinking of the Spirit, and eating of the Son. Day by day we are walking in the street, drinking of the river, and eating the tree. This signifies that the Triune God is getting into us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Poor Christianity never could understand the book of Revelation, but it is so clear in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I do believe that we have all passed through the pearl gates, and we are now walking in the golden way. Here is the flow of life and the supply of life. Here we enjoy the Triune God by drinking of the water of life and eating of the tree of life. By taking the divine nature we have the flow for drinking and the tree for eating. It is new, living, real, and available. When we take care of God&rsquo;s divine nature within, we sense that the water of life is flowing, and the tree of life is supplying. This is the real enjoyment of the Triune God through drinking and eating.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WALL OF TRANSFORMED PRECIOUS STONES</h2>
<p>The gate is the work of the Son. The street is the nature of the Father. Besides these, there is the wall. The wall is built of transformed precious stones. This is the transforming and building work of the Spirit. So in the pearl, the gold, and the precious stones we see the Triune God again. This city is the product of the working of the Triune God. The pearl signifies the regenerating work of the Son, the gold signifies the sanctifying work of the Father&rsquo;s divine nature, and the precious stones signify the transforming work of the Spirit. Hallelujah!</p>
<p>While we are walking in the divine way, drinking the living water, and eating the tree of life, something is getting into us. We are being transformed into precious stones to be built up as the wall. The wall is made of jasper stone which bears the appearance and image of God (Rev. 4:3). This transforming work is the work of the Spirit, the third Person of the Triune God. We all with unveiled face are beholding and reflecting the glory of the Lord to be transformed into the Lord&rsquo;s image from glory to glory by the Lord Spirit (2 Cor. 3:18). The Lord Spirit is doing this transforming work within us. Even now He is doing this work.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SEED AND GROWTH OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>The whole New Jerusalem is the issue of the Triune God moving, living, working, and transforming us. The seed of the Triune God is sown in Genesis 1:26. &ldquo;And God said, Let <em>us</em> make man.&rdquo; Then in the New Testament, in the last chapter of Matthew, the Lord tells us to baptize His disciples into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit (Matt. 28:19, Gk.). In the Gospel of John, Philip asked the Lord to show them the Father and they would be satisfied. &ldquo;Jesus said to him, Am I so long a time with you, and you have not known Me, Philip? He who has seen Me has seen the Father. How is it that you say, Show us the Father? Do you not believe that I am in the Father, and the Father is in Me? The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father Who abides in Me, He does His works&rdquo; (John 14:9-10, Recovery Version). In a brief word the Lord is saying that He and the Father are one. Isaiah 9:6 says, &ldquo;For unto us a child is born, unto us a son is given:...and his name shall be called...The mighty God, The everlasting Father.&rdquo; A Son is given, yet His name is called the everlasting Father. Is He the Son or the Father? I simply cannot explain it. I can only say that it is wonderful. In the same chapter of John, the Lord tells the disciples that He will ask the Father to send the Spirit of Reality, who will abide in them forever (John 14:16-17). He seems to say that this Spirit of Reality is just Himself (John 14:18). It is really mysterious. This is the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE TRIUNE GOD HARVESTED</h2>
<p>All these things concerning the Triune God are in the Bible, but the harvest of the Triune God is in the book of Revelation as seen in the New Jerusalem. The three gates on each side show the Triune God. The street, the river, and the tree signify the Triune God flowing within us. The three categories of precious materials&mdash;gold, pearl, and precious stones&mdash;also show us the work of the Triune God. He is working Himself into us and even replacing us with Himself. The end result is that we all become an eternal mingling of divinity with humanity. This is the New Jerusalem. Hallelujah for the Son&rsquo;s regeneration! Hallelujah for the Father&rsquo;s sanctification by His nature! Hallelujah for the Spirit&rsquo;s transformation! In this way we are built up as gold, pearl, and precious stones for God&rsquo;s eternal habitation.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GREAT BABYLON</h2>
<p>In contrast to the New Jerusalem there is the Great Babylon in Revelation 17&mdash;18. All Bible scholars agree that this is the Roman Catholic Church. This counterfeit and falsehood is superficially gilded with the same precious materials of the New Jerusalem (Rev. 17:4). We should not think there is nothing real in the Roman Catholic Church. There are some real things, but in a subtle, superficial, and deceiving way. There are some real Christians there seeking God. In history Madame Guyon and Brother Lawrence were very spiritual, yet they remained in the Roman Catholic Church. They were there even after Martin Luther&rsquo;s reformation. This harlot holds a golden cup. The appearance is of real gold, but within are abominations. This means idol worship and fornication. There is something real, but it is full of mixture. The Roman Catholic Church abounds with idol worship, yet undoubtedly some of her people are real brothers and sisters in the Lord. However, this does not justify Catholicism. The Lord says, &ldquo;Come out of her, my people, that ye be not partakers of her sins, and that ye receive not of her plagues&rdquo; (Rev. 18:4).</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S GOVERNING PRINCIPLE</h2>
<p>The Roman Catholic Church is the mother harlot, and this mother has many daughter harlots (Rev. 17:5). A harlot is a woman who will be a wife to anything. A proper wife could only be a wife to one husband. This is God&rsquo;s governing principle. A harlot breaks this principle and causes confusion by committing fornication.</p>
<p>In the Bible there is the governing principle of one city, one church. This is for the oneness of Christ&rsquo;s Bride, the church. The church has only one husband. But today&rsquo;s Christianity does not abide by this governing principle. Instead, they take many different kinds of names as their husband. They say that they are broad-minded because they can have anybody as their husband, and they condemn us because we take the way of one city, one church. They all say that this is too narrow. But every genuine wife has to be narrow. She can only have one husband. The church has only one husband, and that is Christ. The proper unity is Christ, and this is described in the Bible as one city, one church. Anything that causes confusion and division is in the principle of the harlot. I have never seen such a confusion as in today&rsquo;s Christianity. Many people leave the denominations and form free groups. But these many small free groups are just more confusion. They are the little daughters of the great harlot.</p>
<p>Praise the Lord that today He is recovering the proper church life! The genuine church is a genuine wife to Christ. We do have a definite husband on the ground of unity. All the principles of this church life are clearly portrayed in the New Jerusalem by the working of the Triune God within us. It is in this way that God will obtain His eternal dwelling place. May the Lord have mercy on us that we may take the narrow way of His purpose.</p></body></html>
