 <h2 class="head3">Subject Two Hundred Eight</h2>
<h1 class="title">WHO SHALL BE IN THE LAKE OF FIRE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Rev. 21:8</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Those who will be in the lake of fire
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The fearful. These want to believe in Jesus but are afraid of others&rsquo; mocking.</li>
	<li>The unbelieving. These would not receive the Lord Jesus as their Savior.</li>
	<li>The abominable. These do not believe in the true God, but rather worship idols. This is like an evil woman who loves another man besides her own husband and commits abominations.</li>
	<li>The murderers. Once a man worships idols, it is easy for him to commit sins and to hate and kill others.</li>
	<li>The fornicators. Today&rsquo;s newspapers, magazines, and movies are full of fornication.</li>
	<li>The sorcerers. These include fortune-tellers, soothsayers, astrologists, etc.</li>
	<li>The idolaters. Abomination and idolatry are nearly the same. The difference is that abomination refers to the nature of idol worship, whereas idolatry refers to the act of idol worship.</li>
	<li>The liars.</li>
	<li>All men are at least one of these eight kinds of people. Whoever is none of these, please raise your hand.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>How to escape the lake of fire
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>Repent.</li>
	<li>Believe in Jesus.</li>
	</ol></li>
</ol>
