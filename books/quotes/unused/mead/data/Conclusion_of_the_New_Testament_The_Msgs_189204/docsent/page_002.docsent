   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE CONCLUSION OF THE NEW TESTAMENT MESSAGE ONE HUNDRED EIGHTY-NINE THE CHURCH THE HIDDEN MYSTERY IN GOD'S ETERNAL ECONOMY 1</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Thus far in these messages on the conclusion of the New Testament we have covered four persons: God, Christ, the Spirit, and the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the remaining messages we shall cover three corporate persons: the church, the kingdom, and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The church is a corporate person.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The kingdom also is a corporate person.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>According to chapter two of Daniel, Christ, the heavenly stone, will eventually become a great mountain filling the entire earth.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the kingdom as the increase of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The New Jerusalem in the new heaven and new earth will also be a corporate person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First we shall consider the church and then the kingdom and the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I. THE HIDDEN MYSTERY IN GOD'S ETERNAL ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The first matter we shall consider concerning the church is the hidden mystery in God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this universe there is a hidden mystery, a mystery hidden in God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This hidden mystery is in God's eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here we have two crucial words mystery and economy modified respectively by the adjectives "hidden" and "eternal."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, in the New Testament we have the hidden mystery and the eternal economy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In revealing the divine things, Paul, under the inspiration of the Spirit, uses the word "economy" in his writings.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The English word economy is an anglicized form of the Greek word oikonomia.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some dictionaries define oikonomia as a dispensation, a special arrangement, a plan with a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>These definitions are correct.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if we know only this much concerning oikonomia, we shall not know the deep and complete significance of this Greek word.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we would understand the meaning of oikonomia, we need to realize that this Greek word is composed of two words oikos, meaning house or household, and nomos, meaning law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Economy, therefore, is a "house law," a household administration.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God's household is His house, His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means that God's dwelling place is His family, His household.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This household has an economy, a household law.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Here "law" means regulations, and these regulations refer to a household administration.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to have a household administration, an administration in your house or family, there surely is the need for a particular arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such an arrangement is a house law.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In using the word oikonomia, a word that denotes a household administration, Paul was implying that God, who made this oikonomia, has the intention to have a house, a household, a family.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In eternity past God was alone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was triune the Father, the Son, and the Spirit yet He, the one God, was alone.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, God's oikonomia, His household arrangement, implies that in eternity past He intended to have a household, for without a household, He cannot have an administration.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Furthermore, without a household God would not be able to carry out a plan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order for God to carry out His plan in His household administration, He needs a household, a family.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is the reason Ephesians 1:5 reveals that, before the foundation of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God the Father predestinated us unto sonship.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This predestination was with the intention of having sons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, God's original intention was to have sons.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The book of Romans tells us that, in Christ's redemption, God has made many sinners into sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These sons are the many brothers of Christ, God's unique, only-begotten Son.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From this we can see that God intends to have many sons to form His household through which He can carry out His eternal oikonomia.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In this oikonomia, which is eternal and of God, a mystery was hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What is a mystery?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may say that a mystery is a mysterious story.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>A mystery, a mysterious story, was hidden in the eternal God and in His eternal oikonomia.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As we shall see, this mystery, this mysterious story, is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Today the word "church" is very common.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But when Paul comes to the revelation of the church, he uses certain mysterious expressions.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He calls the church a mystery, even a hidden mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This mystery is hidden in God's household arrangement.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In eternity past, God the Father had a household arrangement, and in that arrangement a mystery was hidden.</S>
