[1]  CONTENTS The Need for Men Who Turn the Age The Characteristics of the Men Who Turn the Age
[2]  Today we would like to consider how young people who are under God's hand can be used by Him to turn the age.
[3]  We need to realize that many times God does things on earth to turn an age.
[4]  The reason that God has many age-turning moves is that men used by Him in one age often become fallen and fail to reach His goal.
[5]  This forces God to turn the age, that is, to have a new start so that He can do what He wants to do in a new age.
[6]  GOD'S FOCUS THROUGHOUT THE AGES BEING HIS AUTHORITY AND EXPRESSION ON EARTH
[7]  Nevertheless, I hope that you would know something about God.
[8]  In the first chapter of the Old Testament, after God created man, His focus was on two things: first, He wanted man to have His image, and second, to have authority on His behalf.
[9]  From the beginning of the Bible, we can see that what God cares for in man are the matters of image and authority.
[10]  At the tower of Babel, not only did men overturn God's authority, but they worshipped idols.
[11]  Idols are versus God's image; they do not allow God to be expressed.
[12]  As a result, God forsook that age, that is, He forsook the descendants of Adam and chose Abraham, intending that his descendants would become God's testimony to rule for God and to express God's glory in the land of Canaan.
[13]  THE RAISING UP OF MEN WHO TURN THE AGE FOR THE RECOVERY OF GOD'S AUTHORITY AND EXPRESSION
[14]  Brothers and sisters, a little spiritual pursuit or a little godly living before the Lord is not enough to be used by the Lord to turn the age.
[15]  All those who are used by the Lord to turn the age must be Nazarites; they must be voluntarily consecrated ones.
[16]  Other people do not have God and are not for God, but we are for God."
[17]  THE NEED FOR YOUNG PEOPLE TO CONSECRATE THEMSELVES VOLUNTARILY TO BE AN ANTI-TESTIMONY IN THIS AGE
[18]  Brothers and sisters, while I was considering before the Lord what to share, I had a strong feeling within that I should let the young people realize the importance of turning the age, and should show the young brothers and sisters the kind of persons God uses to turn the age.
[19]  CHAPTER TWO THE CHARACTERISTICS OF THE MEN WHO TURN THE AGE Scripture Reading: Dan 2:17-18; 6:10-11, 19-22, 26; 9:1-4, 20, 17; 10:2-3, 12-13; 12:13
[20]  In other words, we will consider the reasons those men who turn the age are used by God.
[21]  We can see briefly from Samuel the kind of men God used to turn an age.
[22]  From the record of the book of Daniel, we can further find out the reasons man was used by God.
[23]  Nevertheless, we must remember that in an age where the tide is downward, to be used by God as a person to turn the age, we must be separated persons; we must be able to stand up as an anti-testimony for God.
[24]  THE SECOND CHARACTERISTIC BEING JOINED TO GOD'S DESIRE THROUGH HIS WORD
[25]  Daniel was not only a person who read God's Word regularly, but a person who was joined to God's Word.
[26]  When he read from the book of Jeremiah that God had ordained seventy years of captivity for the Israelites, and that after seventy years God would turn back to bless them, he immediately fasted and prayed.
[27]  The book of Daniel records Daniel as a person who could pray.
[28]  We must realize that it was this prayer of Daniel which resulted in God being manifested as the living God.
