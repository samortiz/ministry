If we have been a Christian for three to five years without receiving one answer to prayer, we are ineffectual Christians
Prayer is so simple that the moment a person believes in the Lord, he can start praying and have his prayers answered
It is useless to spend an hour or two hours or even eight or ten days before the Lord without asking for anything
When you seek something specific, you will not be satisfied with just anything; you want that particular thing
While God often gives us 'superabundantly above all that we ask or think' , asking evilly is a different matter
If a person has obvious and known sins in his heart, yet is unwilling to drop or part with them, the Lord will not answer his prayer
The moment we begin our Christian life, we have to ask for the Lord's grace to keep us from falling and to sanctify us in our conduct
Proverbs 28:13 says, 'He that covereth his sins shall not prosper:/but whoso confesseth and forsaketh them shall have mercy'
Even if you do not ask evilly, the Lord will not answer your prayer as long as you keep back a favorite sin and regard it in your heart
The Lord Jesus said, 'All things that you pray and ask, believe that you have received them, and you will have them'
We hope that as soon as a person has received the Lord, even a week after his conversion, he will know what faith is
They pray to the Lord that the mountain be taken up and cast into the sea, and they believe that it will be so
Not only do new believers need to learn this, but even those who have been believers for many years need to learn this
If he says, 'I believe the Lord will surely heal my sickness,' he will probably need to try harder to 'believe'
Let us look at Mark 9:21-23, which says, 'And He questioned his father, How long has this been happening to him?
Which is easier: to say to the paralytic, Your sins are forgiven, or to say, Rise and take up your mat and walk'?
The Lord was showing them that to man it was a question of whether or not one could do it, but to God it was a question of which was easier
Whether or not God can do something is not the question here; rather, it is a question of whether or not God is willing
Faith is not just believing that God can and will do something but also believing that God has done something already
Many people's prayers are not answered because they are not clear about this point; they still hope that they will receive something
Perhaps, you have prayed continually for three or five days, a month, or even a year, and still your hands are empty
Simply put the first stage is to pray from nothing to having faith and the second stage is to praise from having faith to actually receiving
Many Christians have the experience that as soon as their prayer strikes faith, they can no longer continue to pray
Another point about prayer which requires attention is that we must persevere in prayer and never stop praying
Please count how many of your prayers have been offered for the second time, the third time, the fifth time, or the tenth time
The third column should record the date the prayer is answered, and the fourth column should record how God answers the prayer
In this way one will find out how many things he asks God for in a year how many prayers God answers and what prayers are still unanswered
The advantage of writing things down in a prayer-book is that it shows us whether or not God is answering our prayers
It is good for Christians to be zealous in serving the Lord, but such service is useless if their prayers are not answered
Any item that has been recorded in the book, but has not received an answer, should be followed up by persistent prayer
In using the prayer-book, note that some items require daily prayer while others require prayer only once a week
If there are many items, you can arrange for certain items to be prayed over on Mondays and others to be prayed over on Tuesdays
He must learn the lesson of prayer well before he can have a deeper knowledge of God and a fruitful future for himself
