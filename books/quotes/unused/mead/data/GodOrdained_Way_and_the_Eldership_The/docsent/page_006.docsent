   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>You need to contact people directly and individually, laboring in the gospel two to three hours every week.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You should find out who is available for you to contact and then contact them directly and continually over a long period of time.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You will gain one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If you take this way of directly contacting people one by one, I can assure you that you will bring two people into the church every year.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You should make a decision and tell the Lord that you will spend two to three hours every week in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then ask the Lord to lead you to contact people one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You should not stop going to the church meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You should still live your regular church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You do not need to promote what you are doing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You just need to go and do it.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then gradually some will see what you are doing, and they will join you.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have tried many ways in the last six years, and they may work, but they do not work satisfactorily.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Only the way of contacting people directly brings a satisfactory result.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We need to plan how to contact our acquaintances.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have to keep working on one of them directly, individually, and continuously.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To get someone saved and established takes about six months, and to bring them into the church will take another six months.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may think that to bring one or two a year into the church life is too slow.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But this slow way is actually the quick way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If twenty are meeting together in a locality, and five of them bring two people into the church life, that is a fifty percent increase.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I can assure you that this can be worked out.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Any other way will waste our time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As branches of the Lord, we should give Him three hours a week for the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Then we can pray, "Lord, lead me, teach me, and give me the wisdom in planning, in scheduling my time, in making appointments, and in talking to people."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then we should practice this directly and definitely.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Surely we will gain people for the Lord's kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We have to change our concept concerning having a preacher with a preaching meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We ourselves need to labor directly to bring one or two into the church life yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This should be a goal in our labor.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We love the church, but we may not have brought one person into the church in the past five years.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We must have a definite beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We must practice contacting people to bring definite fruit into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We also need to practice the church life in group meetings and in larger prophesying meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is really needed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But we need the adequate number as a base for our practice of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The elders need to work two to three hours in the gospel every week to bring one or two remaining fruit into the church within a year.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If the elders do this, others will rise up to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not give any announcement about this or promote it.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have been doing this for years, with little result.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Promotion does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to labor ourselves to build up a living example.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is altogether up to our decision.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Would we still remain in the natural way, or would we turn to this way, a way full of the need for learning?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A working brother's job may occupy him to the uttermost, but he should still endeavor to save some time every week for definite laboring in the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Many of us have been busy working for years with little result.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must change our way.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We must have a plan for reaching people.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should make a list of all our acquaintances and study their situation.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then we can work on them according to our study.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the way to gain the proper persons.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not leave our bearing of fruit to fortune.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is not a matter of fortune but a matter of labor.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We all have acquaintances for whom we can pray.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to consider them and pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to study their situation and decide when the best time would be for us to visit them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Farmers do not labor in a loose way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They study the situation of their land, their crops, and the weather, and they labor accordingly so that they can reap a proper harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We need to be the same way in our labor to gain people.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We must have a plan and a schedule to labor on people two to three hours every week.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We need to learn how to gain people.</S>
