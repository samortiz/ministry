The reason is that both modalism and tritheism stressed in an unbalanced way one aspect of the twofold truth of God&#8217;s revelation in the Bible. Modalism takes one aspect of the truth-that there is only one unique God-and pushes it to a heretical extreme; tritheism, on the contrary, takes another aspect of the truth of God&#8217;s revelation-that He is one-in-three-and pushes it to the opposite heretical extreme. If we see the principle of the twofoldness of divine truth, we can easily avoid these extremes and still maintain a testimony faithful to the whole truth of God&#8217;s revelation in the Scriptures.<p>As a help to understanding this principle, let us quote several portions from an article entitled, &#8220;The Twofoldness of Divine Truth,&#8221; written by Robert Govett, a very perceptive and careful student of the Word of God. Govett says:<p>The twofoldness of truth as offered to our view in Holy Writ is one strong argument of its not being the work of man. It is the glory of man&#8217;s intellect to produce oneness. It is to trace different results to one principle, to clear it of ambiguities, to show how, through varied appearances, one law holds. Anything that stands in the way of the completeness of this, he eludes or denies.<sup>58</sup><p>&#8220;But,&#8221; as Govett continues, &#8220;it is not so with God. In nature He is continually acting with two seemingly opposed principles.&#8221;<sup>59</sup> Therefore, Govett says, &#8220;It is not then to be wondered at, if two seemingly opposed principles are found placed side by side in the Scripture. &#8216;Unity in plurality, plurality in unity&#8217; is the main principle on which both the world and the Scripture are constructed.&#8221;<sup>60</sup> Regarding the apparently irreconcilable statements in God&#8217;s Word, Govett remarks, &#8220;It is not necessary to reconcile them before we are bound to receive and act upon the two. It is enough that the Word of God distinctly confirms them both.&#8221;<sup>61</sup> As Govett says, &#8220;The claim on our reception is not that we can unite them, but that God has testified both.&#8221;<sup>62</sup> Many debates regarding the truth in God&#8217;s Word are unnecessary, for, as Govett states, &#8220;Opposite views of truth arise from different parts of the subject being viewed at different times.&#8221;<sup>63</sup> In this article Govett clearly expresses what the attitude of a Christian should be toward the truth of God&#8217;s revelation:<p>Thus does God try His people. Will they trust Him when He affirms that view of truth which runs counter to their temperaments and intellectual bias? or will they trample on one of His sayings in their zeal for the other? The humble, child-like saint will acknowledge and receive both; for his Father, who cannot err, testifies to each alike.<sup>64</sup><p>Govett specifically applies the principle of the twofoldness of divine truth to the nature of God:<p>The same twofoldness of truth appears in the Scripture statements concerning the nature of God. It affirms His unity....But the Scripture as plainly affirms the distinction of persons in the Godhead. &#8216;Unity in plurality and plurality in unity&#8217; is the assertion here. This master-truth, which takes its rise in the nature of the Godhead, flows out into all His works.<sup>65</sup><p>Note Govett&#8217;s statement that this &#8220;master-truth...takes its rise in the nature of the Godhead.&#8221; In other words, God&#8217;s revelation in the Scriptures, being twofold, is an expression of the very nature of God Himself. The two aspects of God&#8217;s being-that He is the Three being one and the One being three-are testified by the twofoldness of the truth of His revelation in the Scriptures.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Contending for the Faith: Modalism, Tritheism, or the Pure Revelation of the Triune God according to the Bible &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
