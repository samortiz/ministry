   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WEEK 16 DAY 6</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Matthew 23:37-39</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>37 Jerusalem, Jerusalem, who kills the prophets and stones those who are sent to her!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>How often 1 I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings, and you would not!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>38 Behold, your 1 house is left to you desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>39 For I say to you, You shall by no means see Me from now on until you say, Blessed is He who comes in the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Portions from Footnotes</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>37 1 It was always God Himself who cared for Jerusalem, as a bird flutters over her young Isa 31:5; Deut 32:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Hence, when the Lord Jesus said, "I desired to gather your children together, the way a hen gathers her brood under her wings," He indicated that He was God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>38 1 Since house here is singular, it must denote the house of God, which was the temple 21:12-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It had been the house of God, but now it was called "your house" because the Jews had made it a den of robbers 21:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Portions from Life-study Messages</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After the Lord had been tested and examined and after He had rebuked the scribes and Pharisees, He forsook Jerusalem with its temple.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 23:37-39 the Lord spoke a final word to Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After this word, the Lord had nothing more to do with her.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As the Lord Jesus was declaring this final word to them, He was still like a loving hen, stretching out His wings to brood over the little ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But they were not willing to be gathered under His wings.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In ancient times, according to the book of Ezekiel, God left His temple.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The same thing was happening here.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In chapter ten Ezekiel saw in a vision the glory of God leaving the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the temple was left desolate for the rebellious Jews, and eventually it was burned and destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Here in Matthew 23 the Lord who is the real glory, the manifestation of God , was once again about to leave the house desolate.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Not too long afterwards, the temple was destroyed by the Roman army under Titus.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus 23:38 corresponds to 24:2, which indicates that not one stone was to be left upon another.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Both of these verses refer to the desolation of the temple in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord's word here is brief, but it includes a number of things from the destruction of Jerusalem until the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Here the Lord made a clear declaration that He, the very glory of God, was leaving the nation of Israel and that they would not see Him until His coming again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Nearly two thousand years have passed since that time, and Israel still has not seen the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some may ask, "Does this mean that the Jews have no opportunity to believe in the Lord Jesus?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As individuals, the Jews still have the opportunity to believe, but as a nation they do not have this opportunity today.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As a nation, Israel is through with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Thank the Lord that He is still merciful to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even though He has left the nation of Israel, the back door is still open for individual Jews to come to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today no Jew has the position to come to God as a representative of his nation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But when the Jews are persecuted by their enemies at the end of this age, they will cry out to their God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then Christ will descend and place His feet on the Mount of Olives, which will be cleft like the waters of the Red Sea.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This will enable the Jews to escape from persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At that time they will repent to the Lord and call upon Him, and the nation will be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This salvation will be not only for individuals, but for the entire nation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, before the Lord's coming back, it is impossible for the nation of Israel to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But, as we have pointed out, individual Jews can still repent today and come into God's grace.</S>
