   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE SEVENTEEN THE PEACE OFFERING CHRIST AS THE PEACE BETWEEN GOD AND GOD'S PEOPLE FOR THEIR CO-ENJOYMENT IN FELLOWSHIP Scripture Reading: Lev 3:1, 5-7, 12; 6:12; 7:37</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The word in Leviticus concerning the offerings was spoken by the Lord in a little tent, the tent of meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the wilderness, apart from millions of people who were busy doing many things, the very God who created the universe came into a small tent.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Whatever the Triune God spoke there was for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Through God's wonderful speaking, that little tent of meeting will gradually issue in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Every aspect of this speaking concerning Christ and our enjoyment of Christ in togetherness with God will be fulfilled in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There in the New Jerusalem we will surely realize that Christ is our burnt offering, meal offering, peace offering, sin offering, trespass offering, wave offering, and heave offering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All these offerings will eventually issue in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Leviticus the offerings are in a particular sequence.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First we have the burnt offering and then the meal offering and then the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The burnt offering signifies that we must be absolutely for God, and the meal offering indicates that Christ is our daily food.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we are absolutely for God and live by feeding on Christ, the result is peace.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We have peace with God and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that when Christ satisfies us, He becomes the peace between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today we are in this peace, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Christ is the One by whom and through whom we are absolutely to God and for God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Christ is also the One on whom we are feeding every day.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is our daily food.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This Christ is now the peace we enjoy with God and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering are the basic offerings for us to enjoy Christ as our peace with God and with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the significance of the sequence of these three offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we get out of Christ, we have no peace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we are short of peace, we are short of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The amount of peace we have depends on how much of Christ we have.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Having peace is a measurement to show us to what degree we enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no reason for the church people not to have peace.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We should not try to have peace by our own effort.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The more we try in ourselves to have peace, the less peace we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The only way to have peace is to enjoy Christ every day.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the morning we should take Christ as our burnt offering and offer Him to satisfy God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Then we should take Him as our daily food to meet that day's particular need.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We should enjoy Christ today and forget about yesterday and about tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Yesterday is gone, and we are not in tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Since yesterday is gone, none of us can remain in it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whether we were a failure or a success yesterday, yesterday is passed.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As Christians we do not have tomorrow; we only have today.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Do not bother about tomorrow live today!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What do we have today?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Christ is today.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have seen the significance of the sequence of the first three offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now let us consider a number of matters related to the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I. ILLUSTRATED BY THE FATTED CALF AS A PEACEFUL ENJOYMENT BETWEEN THE RECEIVING GOD AND THE RETURNED PRODIGAL IN LUKE 15:23-24</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The peace offering is illustrated in Luke 15:23 and 24 by the fatted calf as a peaceful enjoyment between the receiving father, that is, God, and the returned prodigal son, a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The prodigal son came back in a wretched way, but the father was loving, and he immediately became the receiving father.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>After the father received the prodigal, the fatted calf was slain for their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This fatted calf is an illustration of Christ as our peace offering for our enjoyment with our receiving God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The father and the returned son had a rich enjoyment of the peace offering.</S>
