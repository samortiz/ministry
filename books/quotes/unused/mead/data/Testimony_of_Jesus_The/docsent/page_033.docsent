   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TEN THE PRACTICAL WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO BE THE TESTIMONY OF JESUS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AS HIS FULL EXPRESSION IN THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Rev 1:1-2, 12-16; 5:5-6; 19:15; 2:2, 4, 7, 17; 3:12, 20; 2:9; 3:9; 2:20; Matt 13:33; Rev 17:1-5; 3:1, 15-16; 2:13-15</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Bible has a wonderful beginning in Genesis and a wonderful conclusion in Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Without the book of Genesis, the divine revelation would not have a proper beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The first ten chapters of Genesis require more than thirty messages of the Life-study of Genesis to cover them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Likewise, without the book of Revelation, the Bible would not have a proper conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is very meaningful that the Bible concludes in the same way it begins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It begins with the tree of life in Genesis 2:9.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then throughout most of the remainder of the Bible, the tree of life seems to disappear.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I read the Bible as a young man, I wondered where the tree of life went after the way to it was closed.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Eventually, the tree of life returns in the book of Revelation 2:7; 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way, the Bible begins with the tree of life, and it also concludes with the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Bible also begins with man as God s expression Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>That man was created by God in His own image means that he was created to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Man was destined to be the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the final two chapters of the Bible, man eventually becomes the true expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The One sitting on the throne has the appearance of jasper, and the New Jerusalem, with man as a component, also has the appearance of jasper Rev 4:3a; 21:11, 18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>That jasper is the appearance of the holy city signifies that man becomes the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, in the first two chapters of the Bible there is life and the expression of God, and in the last two chapters there is again life and the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The only difference is that the Bible begins with creation, but it concludes with building.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is there in the first two chapters of the Bible is mainly God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the beginning God created the heavens, the earth, and many other items, including man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the final two chapters, however, there is a city built with precious materials.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A city is not something of creation but something that has been built.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The building with which the entire Bible concludes is a building with the divine life, and the purpose of the building is to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we grasp these few points, we can see the intrinsic significance of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we must spend adequate time to get into Genesis and Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>REVELATION BEING THE UNVEILING OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>IN A FURTHER, DIFFERENT WAY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The book of Revelation is a mysterious book.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, it is a book of prophecy, but to say this with the proper understanding requires us to know what prophecy is.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Prophecy is not merely a prediction, as the Old Testament prophets would say, Thus says Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It is something more weighty, higher, deeper, and more excellent.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Although Revelation is a book of prophecy, prophecy itself is not the subject of this book.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Revelation 1:1 begins, The revelation of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must keep this in our memory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is a book of revelation, but the revelation is of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Among the Christian teachers, there are different schools concerning the meaning of this one phrase the revelation of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Some say this refers to the revelation given by Christ, but this is an inadequate interpretation.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This book is the revelation concerning Christ and unveiling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We may have seen Christ in the four Gospels, the Acts, and all the Epistles, but Christ is much more even than this.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Regrettably, most Christians only know Christ mainly from the Gospels and a little from the Acts and the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the past fifty years I have met many Christians of different kinds and from different parts of the world, and I have always tried to humbly receive what they had.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Throughout my entire Christian life, however, Brother Watchman Nee was the only person I met whose ministry I could fully respect.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Among all the other Christian teachers I met, almost no one else truly knew the Christ in the last book of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Christ in Revelation is absolutely different from the One in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the past I have been condemned for saying this.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One preacher even said, This is heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This man says that he has a different Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Nevertheless, in this message I repeat strongly, the Christ in Revelation is different from the Christ in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Yes, He is the same Christ, but He is the same Christ in different aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the four Gospels Christ was mild, gentle, and kind.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever He looked at people, they felt loved.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>His most intimate disciple could even recline on His bosom John 13:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This same Christ, however, appears differently in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He has not only two eyes but seven eyes, which are like a flame of fire 1:14; 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If such a Christ appeared to us today, we would all be shocked.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Luke 4:22 says that words of grace proceeded out of His mouth, but Revelation tells us that a two-edged sword proceeds out of His mouth 1:16; 19:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Moreover, in John 1:29 He is introduced as the Lamb of God, but in Revelation 5:5 He is called the Lion of the tribe of Judah.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It is foolish to say that the Lion is the same as the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The book of Revelation unveils Christ to us not in a common way but in an extraordinary way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This way is absolutely different from that in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In this sense, Revelation continues the Gospels and the Epistles, but it does not reveal Christ according to the Gospels and the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The revelation of Christ unveils Christ in a different aspect.</S>
