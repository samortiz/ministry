<h2 class="head1">FOUR THINGS THAT MUST BE CONSECRATED</h2><h2 class="head2">Consecrating People</h2><p>The first thing to do after overcoming is to consecrate. What is consecration? It is putting yourself and all that you have on the altar. Specifically, we should consecrate four things to the Lord. The first is people, that is, all the people who are related to us. If a man loves many people, the Lord will have no place in his heart. If you have consecrated yourself to the Lord, no one in this world will occupy your heart any longer, and no person can seize your heart away from Him. God saves you in order to gain full control of you. However, many tears are holding you back, many human affections are enticing you to turn, and many broken hearts are calling you to return. You have to say to the Lord, "Whom do I have in heaven but You?/And besides You there is nothing I desire on earth" (Psa. 73:25). Such a consecration is not for the future, but for today; it is something that we can do today. Today we can cut off all human affections and human relationships and give the Lord the preeminent place.</p><h2 class="head2">Consecrating Careers</h2><p>The second thing we should consecrate is our career. We do not need to consecrate ourselves to be preachers. Many preachers today are not consecrated. Rather, we need to consecrate ourselves to do God's will, to seek after His will, and to find out what His will is for us. A brother, as a high school student, was always the first in his class. He was determined to be the first in his final examination and would not settle for less. He devoted all his time and energy to his study, and his love for the Lord was diminished. Later, he had a breakthrough in the matter of overcoming and realized that it was wrong for him to have such an ambition. He prayed to the Lord, "If it is Your will, I am willing to even come last in the class." This student was a genuine brother in the Lord. In the end he overcame. He experienced the overcoming life in his academic pursuit. Brothers, if you have any aspirations in your business or career that you cannot let go and if there is anything that you insist on having, you have to consecrate yourself. You have to consecrate your career, aspirations, and ambitions totally to the Lord so that you can do God's will.</p><h2 class="head2">Consecrating Things</h2><p>The third item we have to consecrate is things. It is easier for a rich man to forsake the Lord than for a poor man to forsake the Lord because the heart of a rich man is with his money. Nothing in this world belongs to us; everything belongs to the Lord. Therefore, we have to consecrate everything to the Lord and put everything we have on the altar (1 Chron. 29:12-16). Many people squander their money. This is not pleasing to God, of course, but some save up their money in a way that does not please the Lord either. For example, a sister would not spend even a dollar in fifty years. Squandering has no place before the Lord, just as thrift has no place before the Lord either. All of our saving and spending will be judged by the Lord at the judgment seat of Christ. Whatever the Lord wants us to spend our money on, we should spend it accordingly. Offering in the New Testament is different from that in the Old Testament. The principle in the Old Testament is tithing, offering one-tenth. But the principle in the New Testament is offering up ten-tenths; it is offering up all that we have into the hand of the Lord. God will not allow us to go hungry. We may worry about how we are going to support our living, but God wants us to first offer up everything to Him and then draw our needs from Him. The first day we take home our wages, we should say to the Lord, "All of this money is Yours. I offer it all up to You." After we have received our wages, we should first offer them up to the Lord and then use them according to His dispensing. When we receive our wages, it is wrong to first spend the money on what we need and then give the rest to God. Brother Witness Lee lives in a big family. He and his two brothers hand over all the money they earn each month to their mother, and then she dispenses it according to each one's need. This should be how it is between God and us. We should not offer to God what is left from our own spending. Rather, we should offer up everything to God and then allow Him to supply us with what we need.</p><p>There is no need to dispose of all the possessions we own from the past. If God wants us to offer up everything, we should offer up everything. We may sell all our possessions and deposit everything in the bank, wait for God's future leading, and then offer it all up for the Lord's use. If we offer in this way, the bank which keeps our money will be blessed. It will not be foreclosed because God will guard His own deposit. In this world, five percent interest is considered to be high, but the Bible says that when we offer to the Lord, we will receive a hundredfold in this world (Matt. 19:29)! This is ten thousand percent interest! What a bargain! Brothers and sisters, God will not shortchange us. In the past we have passed up many God-given opportunities. In the matter of material offering, I have much experience. I have experienced many blessings that were brought in through offerings. A sister once offered the entire one hundred twenty dollars that she earned in a month to the Lord. When treasures are in our hand, they are either squandered or kept. But if we offer up everything to the Lord, we will not dare to spend loosely. After we consecrate our money to the Lord, everything will become the Lord's, and He will keep it or use it as He sees fit.</p>
