<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>III. THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL<br>NOT LISTENING TO THE VOICE OF JEHOVAH<br>THEIR GOD AND NOT DOING ALL HIS COMMANDMENTS<br>AND HIS STATUTES, AND ALL THE CURSES<br>COMING UPON THEM AND OVERTAKING THEM</H2><P>If the children of Israel did not listen to the voice of Jehovah their God and were not certain to do all His commandments and His statutes, all the curses would come upon them and overtake them (v. 15).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Curses Coming to Every Place,<br>on Everything, and in Every Way</H2><P>Verses 16 through 19 indicate that curses would come to every place, on everything, and in every way. They would be cursed in the city and in the field, and cursed in their coming in and in their going out. The curse would come on their basket and kneading bowl, on the fruit of their womb and of their ground, and on the offspring of their cattle and the young of their flock.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Curses in Discomfiture<br>in All Undertakings, in a Plague,<br>in Consuming Diseases, in Burning Heat<br>and Drought, and in Blight and Mildew</H2><P>Verses 20 through 22 speak of curses in discomfiture in all undertakings, in a plague, in consuming diseases, in burning heat and drought, and in blight and mildew. The diseases here would not come and go but would cling to the people until they were consumed from off the land.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Curses in the Heaven<br>above Their Head Becoming Brass,<br>in the Land under Their Feet Becoming Iron,<br>and in the Rain Becoming Powder and Dust</H2><P>Other curses would be the heaven above their head becoming brass and the land under them becoming iron (v. 23). Moreover, Jehovah would make the rain of their land powder and dust (v. 24). How terrible!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Curses in Being Struck Down<br>before Their Enemies</H2><P>The children of Israel would also be cursed in being struck down before their enemies and in all the diseases, robbings, and sufferings incurred at their hands (vv. 25-35).</P>
