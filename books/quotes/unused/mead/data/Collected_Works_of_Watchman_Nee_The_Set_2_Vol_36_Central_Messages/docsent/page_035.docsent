   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE CHRIST IS THE ROCK OF THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Matt 16:13-19 "WHO DO YOU SAY THAT I AM?"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Who do men say that the Son of Man is?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord Jesus posed this question to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>No doubt the Lord was the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Everyone would admit that He was the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Jews admitted it, and so did the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This was not the problem.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The problem was not whether the Lord was the Son of Man, but who the Son of Man was.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Lord was not asking if others considered Him to be good or bad, but who did men say that He was.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who opposed Him said that He was demon-possessed John 7:20; 8:48, 52 , a gluttonous man, and a drunkard Matt 11:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are not very concerned with these blasphemous remarks.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But those who were favorable towards Him also had different views.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some said that He was John the Baptist; others said that He was Elijah.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Still others said that He was Jeremiah or one of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Nicodemus said that He came from God as a teacher John 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Samaritan woman said that He was a prophet 4:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who really was this Son of Man?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everyone had their own view and own opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the Lord did not stop with this question.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He wanted to know one thing: He wanted to know the difference between the disciples' view of Him and the view of other men.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In particular, He wanted to know the difference between Peter's knowledge of Him and others' knowledge of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In effect, the Lord was saying, "Others have said that I am this and I am that.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But who do you say that I am?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>You who are My disciples, who do you say that I am?"</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Who do you say that I am?"</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Matt 16:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was the Lord's main question.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Simon Peter answered the Lord and said, "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God" v. 16 . Peter's word was clear: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God." Peter acknowledged two things about the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>First, he acknowledged that He is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Second, he acknowledged that He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>As far as the Lord's person is concerned, He is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As far as His work is concerned, He is the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>His being the Son speaks of who He is, and His being the Christ speaks of what He does.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His being the Son speaks of His relationship with God, and His being the Christ speaks of His relationship with God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As far as His person is concerned, He is the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As far as His work is concerned, He is the Christ, the Christ of the living God; He is the anointed One, the One set apart to accomplish God's plan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This was Peter's confession of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is also our confession of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>After Peter made this confession, the Lord said, "Blessed are you, Simon Barjona, because flesh and blood has not revealed this to you, but My Father who is in the heavens" v. 17 . This was not something that Peter thought of, or something that he learned from others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It was something that the Father who is in the heavens had revealed to him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Following this, the Lord said, "And I also say to you" v. 18 . First the Lord showed Peter where his confession came from.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Afterwards, He pointed out the great significance of this confession.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>What did the Lord say to Peter?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He said, "You are Peter, and upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it" v. 18 . This tells us what the foundation of the church is.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is the most important question in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is the crux of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What is the foundation of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord showed us that the church is built upon "this rock."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>"This rock" is the foundation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>WHAT IS THIS ROCK?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Let us now specifically consider this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we do not know what this rock is, we do not know the foundation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we do not know what this rock refers to, we will not know how the church is built up.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This rock is Peter's confession of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Peter confessed that the Lord Jesus is the Christ, the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The church is built upon this confession.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is built upon man's confession and knowledge of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Peter's confession did not come through a revelation of flesh and blood; he made this confession based on the revelation he received from God.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This shows that Peter did not receive a Christianity that was handed down by others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He did not confess the Lord as the Christ just because others told him that the Lord is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He did not confess the Lord as the Son of the living God just because others said that He is the Son of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This was not something that Peter thought of by himself, or something others told him.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Father in the heavens revealed this to him and gave him this knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Peter's confession was not based on man's conjecture or the teaching of others.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It was based on God's revelation of His Son in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This was the basis of his knowledge of Him as the Son of God and as the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church is built upon this confession.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This confession is based on God's revelation, and this revelation reveals Christ's person and work to man.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>When the Father who is in the heavens revealed this to Peter, He showed Peter that this One is the Son of God and the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord said, "Upon this rock I will build My church."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>What is this rock?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>It is Peter's confession: "You are the Christ, the Son of the living God."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This word is man's confession, and it is also God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This is the rock.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The Lord is building His church upon this rock.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we have a problem with this rock, it means we have a problem with our knowledge of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Once there is a problem with this rock, there is a problem with the foundation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Hence, we have to spend some time to consider what this rock is.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But this is a big subject; within our limited scope here, we can only touch this matter briefly.</S>
