That He Was Now Setting a Plumb Line<br />
in the Midst of His People Israel</h2>
<p>The Lord was holding a plumb line to measure Israel in order to determine what part had to be destroyed and what part had to be retained. Here the Lord was like a surgeon, knowing what should be cut off and what should remain.</p>
<p>The Lord told Amos that He was now setting a plumb line in the midst of His people Israel (v. 8a). He said, &ldquo;The high places of Isaac will be desolated, / And the sanctuaries of Israel will be made waste; / And I will rise up against the house of Jeroboam with a sword&rdquo; (v. 9). The &ldquo;high places&rdquo; were the places where Israel worshipped the idols on the mountains. The expression &ldquo;sanctuaries of Israel&rdquo; refers not to the sanctuary in the city of Jerusalem but mainly to the sanctuaries in Bethel, in the northern kingdom of Israel. God would make them waste; He would attack the house of Jeroboam (one of the kings of Israel) with a sword.</p>
