   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Hebrew word for men in this verse denotes those who are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In the eyes of God, the children of Israel were weak men.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The same is true of believers today.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We all are weak and can easily be defeated by our flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God, however, chose those who are weak to fight against Amalek.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The victory or defeat in the battle hinged on Moses interceding on the mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verse 11 says, And when Moses lifted his hand up, Israel prevailed; and when he let down, Amalek prevailed.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here Moses interceding on the mountaintop typifies Christ interceding in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Believers fighting against the flesh in their spiritual journey today always need the intercession of Christ in ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When this interceding continues, we prevail; otherwise, we are defeated, for we are no match for the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We must depend on the ascended Christ interceding for us.</S>

   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is God who justifies.</S>

   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>TYPIFYING THE INDWELLING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>FIGHTING AGAINST THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the battle against Amalek, Moses lifted up his hand on the mountaintop, and Joshua fought for the people at the mountain foot Exo 17:10, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Joshua fighting at the mountain foot typifies the indwelling Christ as the Spirit fighting against the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, Christ is interceding today in the heavens for the believers; on the other hand, Christ as the Spirit is in the believers fighting for them.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This Christ who is in the believers fighting for them is the life-giving, indwelling Spirit in us 1 Cor 15:45; Rom 8:11, 13 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He is the ascended Christ and the Spirit indwelling us as well.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In heaven He intercedes for us as the High Priest who has ascended to the height and entered into the heavens Heb 4:14; 7:25-26 ; on earth He fights for us against our flesh as the Spirit of life who indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Romans 8:13 says, For if you live according to the flesh, you must die, but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This shows us that we must put to death the practices of the body, but we must do it by the Spirit who indwells us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the one hand, we must take the initiative to put to death the practices of the body, because the Spirit does not do it for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the other hand, we should not attempt to deal with the body of our flesh by relying on our own effort without the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The putting to death here is actually our coordinating with the Spirit who indwells us, just as Israel cooperated with Joshua.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When we take the initiative to put to death the practices of our body, the Spirit comes in to apply the effectiveness of Christ s death to those practices, thus killing them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>SUMMARY</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When the children of Israel were on their way in the wilderness, the first enemy who came to hinder them from going on was Amalek.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Amalek as a descendant of Esau, Jacob s twin brother, signifies the believers flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The name Amalek means warlike, signifying that the flesh enjoys fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The flesh often destroys the believers life and disturbs them so that they cannot go forward.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The flesh, sin, the world, and Satan are all related to one another and interwoven.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, the most prominent among them in fighting against us is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Hence, the flesh is the leading enemy in frustrating us from entering into and possessing the all-inclusive Christ as the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God has decided that the flesh must be blotted out.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This will be fulfilled in the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Today is still the time for us to fight against the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When the children of Israel were fighting against Amalek, their victory or defeat hinged on Moses interceding on the mountaintop.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This signifies that believers fighting against the flesh in their spiritual journey today must depend on the intercessions of the ascended Christ for them to gain the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Christ s intercession for us in His ascension at the right hand of God is ever-unceasing, and His power in caring for us is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the battle against Amalek, Joshua fighting at the mountain foot typifies the indwelling Christ as the Spirit fighting against the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In heaven He intercedes for the believers as the High Priest who has ascended to the height and entered into the heavens; on earth He fights for the believers against their flesh as the Spirit of life who indwells them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The believers should coordinate with the indwelling Spirit and take the initiative to put to death the practices of the body, and then the Spirit will come to apply the effectiveness of Christ s death to those practices, thus killing them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>QUESTIONS Who was the first enemy to hinder the children of Israel from going on in their journey through the wilderness?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Briefly state the significance of this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Briefly explain how we can apply to our situation Christ s interceding in ascension for the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>How do we cooperate with the Christ who fights against the flesh for us as the Spirit of life indwelling us?</S>
