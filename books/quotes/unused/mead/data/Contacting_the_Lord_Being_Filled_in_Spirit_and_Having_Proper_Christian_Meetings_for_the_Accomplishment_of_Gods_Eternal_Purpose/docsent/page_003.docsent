   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Accomplishment of God s Eternal Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>How does God accomplish that which He has purposed?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How does God gain a group of people to express and represent Him?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>God accomplishes His purpose through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In incarnation God Himself became a man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In so doing He joined and mingled Himself with man.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Jesus was a God-man, a man joined and mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This man lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years and then died on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>His death was all-inclusive; when He died, everything died with Him cf.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>2 Cor 5:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Following His death, He rose from the dead, and in His resurrection He imparted His life into man John 12:24; 1 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In incarnation He brought God into man, and in resurrection He brought man into God John 14:6, 20 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was the way God accomplished His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Application of the Accomplishment</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>of God s Eternal Purpose</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Now we need to see how this accomplishment is applied to us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The application of the accomplishment of God s eternal purpose is carried out absolutely in and by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the day of Pentecost, following the Lord s resurrection, the Holy Spirit was poured out from the heavens to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This Spirit is all-inclusive.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ s incarnation, human living, death, and resurrection are all in this Spirit, who is the realization of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God the Father is embodied in the Son, and God the Son is realized as the Spirit 14:10, 16-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this Spirit is everything that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Spirit takes three steps in applying the accomplishment of God s eternal purpose to us: He regenerates us, transforms us, and causes us to realize that we are members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When we first heard the gospel and received the Lord, the all-inclusive Spirit entered into us and regenerated us 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In regeneration we received God Himself as life into us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was the beginning of our spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Regeneration is the first step that the Spirit takes in applying the accomplishment of God s purpose to us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After regenerating us, the Spirit continues to work in us to transform us from our old, human nature into a new, divine nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is the second step that the Spirit takes in applying the accomplishment of God s eternal purpose to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The third step that the Spirit takes is to work in us to cause us to realize that we are members of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Spirit works in us, demanding that we enter into the Body life, the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While the Spirit is transforming us, we will have the realization that we must fellowship with others and have a meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A meeting life is a life of meeting with other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can never be individual Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Instead, we must join ourselves to other believers.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is a demand of the Spirit within us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If you meet with the Lord in the morning by yourself, surely the Lord within you will lead you to meet with the saints in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whenever you go to the Lord, the Lord will send you to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is because the Lord s desire is to have a built-up Body as His corporate expression.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the Lord s coming back, His work of transformation in us will be completed, and He will transform even our body into His glorious likeness Phil 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At that time we with all the saints will be a divine, corporate expression, manifesting and expressing God the Father in God the Son as God the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>May we all go to the Lord and consider where we are in relation to these three matters God s eternal purpose, the accomplishment of God s eternal purpose, and the application of the accomplishment of God s eternal purpose.</S>
