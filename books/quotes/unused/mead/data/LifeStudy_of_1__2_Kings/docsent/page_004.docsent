   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE MAIN STRIKING POINT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE HISTORICAL BOOKS CONCERNING ISRAEL</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The main striking point of these historical books concerning Israel is to show us in detail, in the way of typology, how to experience Christ as the good land given to us by God as our portion Col 1:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, the book of Joshua shows us how to gain, to take possession of, and to keep the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then the books of Judges, Ruth, and 1 and 2 Samuel give us pictures of certain persons, showing us how they remained in the good land and enjoyed the good land after they took possession of it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The record of quite a few judges in the book of Judges, of Ruth and Boaz in the book of Ruth, and of Eli, Samuel, Saul, Jonathan, and David in the books of 1 and 2 Samuel presents us vivid pictures of how those persons remained in and enjoyed the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Even though those pictures were painted in detail, there is still the need of 1 and 2 Kings to give us pictures of more persons showing us how they remained in and enjoyed the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christ is the good land given to us by God, and we need to enjoy this good land.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should ask ourselves how much we have enjoyed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is not sufficient simply to experience Christ; we must also enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Have you enjoyed Christ today?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I can testify that today I have enjoyed Christ as my life supply, my strength, my living faith, my joy, and my peace.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE TWO BOOKS OF KINGS PRESENTING US</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A FULL PICTURE OF THE DETAILS</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>BY WHICH GOD'S ELECT REMAINED IN</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>AND PARTICIPATED IN THE GOOD LAND</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The two books of Kings present us a full picture of the details by which God's elect remained in and participated in the good land.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It depicts, as an x ray, in detail, the character, the intention, the preferences, the habits, the morality, and the actions of all the kings as the descendants of David the king.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By such a picture we can see that what we are, what we desire, what we intend to do, what we want, and how we behave ourselves have very much to do with our remaining in Christ and participating in all His unsearchable riches for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This picture concerning Israel ends with a tragedy of all the kings who were put into the blessed situation of the Davidic kingship and who were not faithful to God and did not take good care of their inheritance: they lost the good land and were carried away as captives to the idol-worshipping world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This should be a solemn alarm and warning to us in our relationship with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we are wrong in any of the matters mentioned above, we will suffer the loss of Christ as our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I hope that we all will see this and be deeply impressed with it.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Christ is our good land, and we need to remain in this land, participate in it, and enjoy it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But the enjoyment of Christ has been very much neglected by the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For instance, many believers can testify that they have prayed and that their prayers have been answered by God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, not many can say that in receiving an answer to their prayers they enjoyed Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This indicates we can pray and receive an answer without having any enjoyment of Christ.</S>
