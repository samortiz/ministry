   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>C. Believing and Practicing the Revelation Seen</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Noah received the revelation, he believed it and practiced it 6:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He practiced it in a way of not caring about being different from his forefathers and from his generation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps people said to him, "Noah, what are you doing?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Adam never talked this way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Neither did Abel or Enosh.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>All the fathers lived, begat, and died, but none of them talked the way you do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Who are you?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Are you greater than Adam or Enoch?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We admire Enoch, for he walked with God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What are you talking about, telling us that a flood will come?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>What do you mean by building an ark?"</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The principle is the same today.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are following God's revelation that is according to the Bible in order to practice the church life; however, most Christians lack this revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God's revelation will always make you different.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Daniel and his three companions were different, for they refused to eat the royal food.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Paul was different, and so was Martin Luther.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Everyone who has seen God's revelation is different.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The revelation makes him different.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must be different from our folks, our schoolmates, our neighbors, and even from our fellow Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Only those who are void of God's revelation are so common.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we see something, it makes us different.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is good to be different.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE WORK A. Preaching Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Now we must consider Noah's work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Firstly, Noah worked in preaching righteousness 2 Pet 2:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If you read the whole context of the Bible, you will see that in Noah's day preaching righteousness was to protest against the evil generation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>His generation was evil and filled with violence, but Noah was a man who preached righteousness and protested against all the unrighteousness, evil, and violence.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He testified of the righteous way of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>B. Building the Ark 1.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>According to God's Revelation by Faith</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>While Noah was preaching righteousness, he was building the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In principle, we are doing the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are preaching righteousness and we are protesting against the evil age.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>While we are preaching, we are building a corporate ark.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Noah built the ark by faith according to God's revelation Heb 11:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He did not construct it according to tradition or his own concept and invention, but absolutely according to God's revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is the reason that in everything we must return to God's revelation in His holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must come back to the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Against the Tide of the Age</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The building of the ark was absolutely against the tide of Noah's generation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was against the trend of that age and "he condemned the world" Heb 11:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>No one besides Noah's family appreciated that work.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The work of Noah and his family was unique, peculiar, and strange.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In human eyes it was impractical.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It was according to God's revelation and, thus, it was against the trend and tide of that generation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do you not think that the principle is the same today?</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What we are preaching and doing is altogether against the tide of this generation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But we praise the Lord that we are in His flow.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are not in the tide of this generation; we are in the flow from the throne according to His revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Praise Him!</S>
