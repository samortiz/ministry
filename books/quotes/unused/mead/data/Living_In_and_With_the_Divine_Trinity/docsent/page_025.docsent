   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>HEBREWS 2:3-4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Hebrews 2:3 and 4 also show us the Divine Trinity in His divine move.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, there is so great a salvation being spoken by the Lord the Son .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then God God the Father bears witness to the great salvation by signs and wonders and by various works of power and by distributions of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God's full salvation, so great a salvation, is wrapped up with the Three of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We may wonder why there are three in the Godhead and not one.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If there were only one in the divine Godhead, there would be no beauty and no excellency.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the beauty, the excellency, the attributes, and the virtues found in the Godhead depend upon the divine Godhead being three yet one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Three yet one here is the beauty; here is the excellency.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Likewise, in the corporate constitution of the Body of Christ, composed of millions of members, there is much beauty, excellency, and virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Millions of members have been composed together and constituted together to become members one of another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In this corporate constitution are many beauties, excellencies, virtues, and attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Eventually, all of these millions of members will be the constituents of the New Jerusalem, which will be the ultimate, corporate expression of the Triune God, full of beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Suppose that in the church life there is a group of sisters and brothers who are serving and living in the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In their serving they are one and very harmonious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are all humble.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is not one of them who is for himself, by himself, or to himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In such a service in the Body, beauty and excellency are displayed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If there were thousands of saints on the earth living and serving in such a way, what beauty and excellency there would be!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the church life, in the Body life, in the new man, it is marvelous to see saints from every race and background meeting together in oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To have harmony in the church life requires humility and selflessness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The harmony in the church life is beautiful.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of beauty was first displayed in the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Divine Trinity took the lead to exhibit this kind of beauty in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Among the Three, the Son took the lead to be so selfless, so humble, and so considerate of the others.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>LUKE 15:3-32</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Luke 15 there are three parables: the parable of a good shepherd finding a lost sheep, the parable of a fine woman seeking her lost coin, and the parable of a loving father receiving back his prodigal son vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>3-32 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These three parables in Luke 15 give us a full picture of the Divine Trinity in saving lost sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>First there is the Son's finding vv.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>4-7 as the good Shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Son came to find us by accomplishing His all-inclusive redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then there is the Spirit's seeking vv.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>8-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Spirit comes as the fine woman to do her seeking work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Spirit enters into our heart to enlighten us, to search us, and to sweep away all the "dirt" in order to find us, to gain us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>After being caught by the Spirit, we repent and come to ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Then we make up our mind to come back to the Father, typified by the prodigal son coming back to his father.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The father, who was waiting for the prodigal son's return, saw his son and ran to him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He clothed him with the best robe, which typifies our Father clothing us with Christ as our righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then the father gave the command to kill the fattened calf for their enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This signifies the rich Christ Eph 3:8 killed on the cross for the believers' enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Luke 15 presents a full picture of the Divine Trinity in saving sinners by His divine love.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Again we can see a marvelous coordination among the Three of the Divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>These Three typified by a shepherd, a woman, and a father cooperate together as one person in saving sinners.</S>
