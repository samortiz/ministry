   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF GENESIS MESSAGE EIGHTY-FIVE THE BUILDER OF THE PILLARS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SKILLFUL HIRAM 1</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message, a parenthesis in our study of the pillars, we shall consider Hiram, the builder of the pillars 1 Kings 7:13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In 1 Kings and 2 Chronicles the Bible has much to say about Hiram.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Although David and Solomon both prepared skillful men for the building of the temple, Hiram is the only one of these skillful builders mentioned by name.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Bible not only mentions Hiram's name, but also gives his background in a detailed and meaningful way, telling us of his mother and father and of Hiram himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we study the Bible, we must realize that it has no wasted words.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Everything it stresses or repeats is meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead of considering some verse as mere repetition, we must find the significance in each repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When I spent much time studying the two pillars in 1 Kings 7 nearly fifty years ago, I did not see any light.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I only saw that the names of the two pillars were Jachin, meaning, "He shall establish," and Boaz, meaning, "In it is strength."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But as we have been considering Jacob's dream and his experience at Bethel, I began to study these two pillars again.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This time a great deal of light, like the fourth-day light 1:14-19 , shined upon me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In my study of the pillars I found that many verses mention Hiram, the builder of the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I knew by the speaking of the Spirit within that I had to pay attention to this.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>While I was considering the pillars, light also came concerning Hiram's mother and father, neither of whom is named in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I was especially bothered by the fact that, according to the Hebrew text, 1 Kings 7:14 says that Hiram was of the tribe of Naphtali.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As I considered all these things further, I realized that I needed one complete message to discharge my burden on the builder of the pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When you hear about the builder of the pillars, you may say, "I don't think that I could ever be a builder.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As long as God's mercy and grace would make me a pillar, I would be more than satisfied."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But do not be so limited.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's grace is unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It can not only make you a pillar, but even a builder of pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although I am not saying that all of us will be pillars or builders of pillars, I believe that in the coming years many, even some sisters, will become pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If you do not believe this word now, I would ask you to wait for several years.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Then you will see many pillars raised up in the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When that time comes, I will be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Furthermore, I believe that a good number of us will also become Hirams, the builders of pillars.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God needs these Hirams.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only one temple was built in Solomon's time, but today many local churches need to be built.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>How many Hirams will be required for this work!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every local church needs at least one Hiram.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whenever there is a Hiram in a local church, that church is in glory.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Thank the Lord that He has raised up a number of Hirams in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But I believe that in the future the Lord will perfect many more Hirams.</S>
