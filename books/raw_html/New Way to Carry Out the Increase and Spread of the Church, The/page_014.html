	<h2 class="head1">LEADING THEM TO MINGLE THE WORD WITH PRAYER</h2>
<p>We must also lead the new converts to mingle the Word with their prayer. Lead them into prayer which mostly does not use their own wording, but rather the terms, the phrases, and even the clauses of the Bible verses quoted in our publications. This is not merely to read, or to repeat, but to mingle the word of the Bible with their prayer, that is, to make their prayer one with the word of the Bible. This is the best prayer. By this way you will &ldquo;kill two birds with one stone&rdquo;&mdash;this prayer touches the Word, and this prayer also touches the Spirit. The Word and the Spirit will both get into you. Then the Lord&rsquo;s words will be spirit and life to you, and you will have the light of life (John 8:12; cf. 1:4). Three things will be in you&mdash;the Spirit, life, and light. The new converts will be nourished with food-to-go if we lead them to mingle the word with prayer. Perhaps you could not do all these items at once. In one visit you can cover two or three, leaving the rest for another visit. Do not go too fast. You have much time ahead of you. Go back again and again, continually.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THEM TO SHARE WITH OTHERS<br />
IN THE MEETINGS</h2>
<p>Also, we should lead them to share with the others in the meeting what they have received from the word of God. You must set forth yourself as an example of one who does this. Share something with them, and then they will learn from you. This will be a deep digestion of the word. To share with others what you have received is not only to eat and not only to masticate but also to digest. Any food that gets into us needs digestion. After digestion it becomes our nourishment. We must help them to digest by sharing with others something which they have received of the Word. This is also the way to build up their home meeting. By doing this, after three to five months, they will be so acquainted with the way to have a living home meeting. Then they also will go out to establish new home meetings.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEADING THEM TO GIVE<br />
TESTIMONIES OF THEIR EXPERIENCE</h2>
<p>Leading the new converts to give a testimony is not only for them to share something. To share is to tell others what they have received instantly. To give a testimony is to testify what they have experienced in their daily life. By your third visit, they surely should have experienced something. Let them speak out what they have experienced.</p>
<p>If you could do all these things, you will not only lead them into the nourishment, but you will also lead them into the proper way to have a living home meeting. Perhaps after two or three months they would not need you to come more than once every two or three weeks because they will have learned how to have a home meeting. They will have been brought into the proper practice. However, you must be faithful to continue going to the same home for at least eight or nine weeks.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARING FOR THE HOMES WE HAVE GAINED</h2>
<p>What we have seen concerning the going out is very good, but this will bring to you a heavy burden. After going out to knock at people&rsquo;s doors for one year, you may have six homes that you must care for. After you have gained homes, you will need to visit them throughout the week. Every weekend you should go out to get new homes, but on the week days you have to go out to visit the homes you have gained. Be prepared for this. You cannot deliver a newborn child and give it no nourishment or care. If you do this, all the newborn children will die. The Bible tells sinners to repent and be baptized (Acts 2:38), and to believe and be baptized (Mark 16:16), but you must take care of the ones baptized by you. You need to nourish them.</p>
<p>Perhaps three who go out as a team would gain a home each week. Within four to six weeks, the three will gain three homes. They must keep going out to knock on doors, but at the same time each of the three should take care of one home. However, for only one to go to a home would be inadequate. Therefore, the one needs to pick up a dormant brother or sister. While you are going out to knock on doors, you have to work with the others who do not have the burden to go out. Perhaps out of four hundred saints only one hundred will go out. This one hundred, while they are going out, will also have to work with the three hundred, to testify to them, to convince them, and to bring them into this practice. When you have a home that you need to take care of, you can ask a certain brother or sister to go with you to help you. Most of them would not reject you; they will go with you. It is in this way that you will stir them up and bring them into this flow. You will bring them into this new move of the Lord, and you two will go together. Not only will you be gaining the new homes, but you also will be stirring up the dormant ones.</p>
<p>If you would learn all these things and practice all these things, you could take care of a home for six or seven weeks. Then the ones in that home will learn these things, and they will begin to take care of other homes. On the one hand, we must get new homes, but on the other hand, we must produce more saints to take care of the new homes. You will have many things to do. Out of four thousand active saints in Taipei, one thousand may go out. Within one year they will bring in ten thousand homes. Who will take care of the ten thousand homes? You can see the great burden. It is in this way that every saint will be brought into the service. No one will be left idle. At that time everyone will love the homes because they will realize that in the homes they could better render their service to the Lord.</p>
<p>In this new way, the Lord is going to change us. We will forget about always coming together to meet in large gatherings. We have been coming together for many years. Many faithful ones came to the big meetings four or five times a week, yet we have not accomplished much in the way of bringing all the saints into function or for the increase and spread of the church. However, the new way will open the door and bring in a new way of service, which will require all the saints to rise up and do something. When you do something as part of a definite service in the homes, the Bible will be new and sweet to you. When you are going to nourish others, the messages will become your nourishment. Then the whole church will be a living church and a serving church. Everyone will be busy. Everybody will be occupied, not with the worldly things, but with the service of the Lord, either to bring people to the Lord, to nourish them, or to teach them.</p>
<p>We need the foresight to see the long term goal, and we have to reach the goal. We also have to learn to help the home meetings practically in a detailed way. The new ones will be nourished and built up, and then will be taught and trained to do what you are doing. This will increase not only the number of saved ones but also the number of serving ones. Every new convert under this kind of nourishing will be a good serving one within half a year. They will begin, at least, to help to take care of a home.</p>
<p>This will arouse within you many prayers. I believe you will pray much more because you will have a burden. You will have somebody that you have to pray for. While you are driving your car, you will pray. Quite often many have considered for whom or for what they should pray. It may have seemed that everything was right and settled, not requiring any prayer. But now every week there will be new homes and new persons requiring our prayer. To touch the homes and to gain the homes is the way for us to go on. We must go along with the Lord in this way. If we will be faithful, He will have a way to come back.</p>
