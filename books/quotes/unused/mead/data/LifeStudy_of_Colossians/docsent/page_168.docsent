   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>DEFRAUDED OF THE SUBJECTIVE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ENJOYMENT OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some of the saints in Colosse were Jews, and others were Greeks.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Both paid a price in turning to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Having paid a price, they could receive the enjoyment of Christ as their prize.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Both the Jewish and Gentile believers had suffered much because of their faith in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, they could have the subjective enjoyment of Christ as their prize.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The same is true of us today.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many saints have suffered persecution because they have turned to Christ and to the way of the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But now they may enjoy Christ as their reward, as their prize.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This prize is not only the objective Christ, but in particular it is the subjective enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Colossians 2:16 and 17 indicate this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>These verses reveal that Christ is not only objective, but that He is also the One for us to enjoy daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Christ we experience daily in matters of eating and drinking is a very subjective Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The same is true of the Christ we experience as our weekly completion and rest the Sabbath , as a new beginning in darkness the new moon , and as our yearly enjoyment the feasts .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Therefore, according to verse 18, to be defrauded of our prize is to be deprived of the subjective enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly we should enjoy Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not allow anyone to defraud us of this prize.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Colossian believers, however, were being defrauded of their prize of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Jewish believers were distracted from Christ by the Judaizers, whereas the Gentile believers were carried off by certain philosophical concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Both were defrauded of the daily experience and enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Furthermore, they had lost the weekly, monthly, and yearly enjoyment of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This indicates that the Jewish and Gentile believers alike had been led astray, deprived of the very prize for which they had paid such a price.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we have indicated again and again, this prize is the subjective experience of Christ daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to check whether we experience and enjoy Christ in a practical way daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is very possible that we, like the Colossians, have also been defrauded of our prize.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Satan, the Devil, may defraud us of Christ, and we may not even realize it.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Once I had my briefcase, which contained my passport, stolen from beside my chair while I was talking to someone in an airline company office.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, at the time of the theft I did not realize what was happening.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I was defrauded of my briefcase, but I was totally unconscious of the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In like manner, we may not be conscious of the fact that the enemy has deprived us of the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may have lost the daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly enjoyment of Christ and not even realize it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BACK TO CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In His recovery the Lord is bringing us back from religion and everything other than Christ to Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God s economy is to dispense Himself into us for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God wants Christ to be not only our Savior and not even just our life, but also to be our daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>But as we consider the situation among the vast majority of Christians today, we see that this enjoyment has been lost.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Instead of enjoying Christ, believers are occupied with religion, so-called worship services, and theological teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is very little enjoyment of Christ in a practical and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No doubt it is necessary for the Lord to have a recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We need to be brought back to Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In particular, we need to be recovered to the continual enjoyment of Christ in a daily, weekly, monthly, and yearly way.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>My burden is not to give more messages on doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>My concern is that the saints experience Christ in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If such is not our situation, then we have subtly been defrauded of Christ as our prize by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to enjoy Christ in all the small details of our daily living.</S>
