   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE INDWELLING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Who was this One who got into them?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The almighty Creator, the Triune God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Son of God was not separated from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Where the Son was, the Father was also.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The same is true of the Spirit: where the Spirit was, the Son was also.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, the One who entered into the disciples was the very Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>He was not merely the Creator described in Genesis 1.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By now He had gone through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>How qualified and equipped He was to enter into man!</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He had accomplished redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He had destroyed death.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>He had defeated the Devil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He had released His life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He had become the available, life-giving breath, pneuma, Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Satan might say, God, You cannot enter into these sinful human beings, but God would reply, Yes, they were sinful, but I have redeemed them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>My blood was shed for them.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Let them be!</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>You have been defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You have no ground to speak against them.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The full liberty is Mine to enter into them!</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This One is the Spirit of God, the Spirit of Christ, and the indwelling Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This realization goes far deeper than what is commonly understood of Christ s incarnation, death, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many Christians have only an objective, superficial belief that we were fallen sinners; that God the Father loved the world and sent His Son to be our Savior and Redeemer; that He came as the Lamb of God and died on the cross for our sins; that He was buried; that after three days He was resurrected; that He ascended to heaven and is now seated on the throne; that He sent down the Holy Spirit as His instrument to inspire sinners to repent and believe in Him; that this Holy Spirit as the Representative of the Christ in heaven indwells those who thus believe; that when we have problems we pray to the Father about them; that our Mediator is there on the throne praying for us, taking care of our case and seeing that our prayers are answered.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To think in this way is not wrong, but it is superficial.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It also borders on believing that there are three Gods.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In the Vatican there is a floor-to-ceiling painting depicting an old father with a long white beard, a young son standing nearby, and a dove hovering overhead.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Such is their concept of the Trinity!</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Alongside is another painting, with an extra person added.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Besides the father, the son, and the dove, there is a young woman, supposedly the son s mother, the mother of God!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is their God!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>How repulsive!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It shows an ignorance of God s economy to dispense Himself into His redeemed people by being triune.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Christ is a mystery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>While He is abiding in you, He is still seated on the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When He comes to you, He comes with both the Father and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When one comes, all three come.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is what triune means.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We cannot explain the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But then, there are things about electricity that we cannot understand either; nonetheless, when we turn on the current, we can utilize its power.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Triune God cannot be fully understood.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is called Wonderful Isa 9:6 for this very reason.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He is a totality of wonder, a mystery impossible to comprehend.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is true more than ever, now that He has gone through incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is divinity in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>There is humanity in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is human life in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Who can understand such a One?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is the very One who is within us to be our contents.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Some may say that our teaching is heretical, but it is altogether according to the divine revelation in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE INDWELLING TO PRODUCE THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>What is the issue of God s entering into us?</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is also mysterious.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To have the church as the Body of Christ, as Ephesians 1 tells us, involves Christ s resurrection, His ascension, and His headship.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It was the divine power which raised Christ from the dead, uplifted Him to the heavens, and made Him Head over all things to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Body of Christ is produced by His ascension and headship.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the church were simply an assembly of Christ s believers, there would probably be no need for so many factors to be involved.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>But for the church to be the Body of Christ is not a simple matter.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Even for us to have a physical body is not simple.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yes, we can have false teeth and artificial limbs, but to organically produce a member of the body is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Perhaps a transplant is the best modern medicine can do.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Who can make us dead human beings part of Christ s living Body?</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The crucified, resurrected, ascended Christ can!</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are not like false teeth; we are organically part of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Creator could create us as human beings, but without passing through a process even He could not make us organically part of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He first had to be incarnated, crucified, and resurrected in order to be qualified to make us the living members of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Creative power was not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It took Jesus Christ the incarnated, crucified, resurrected One, the One who has been made Head over all to accomplish this.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Because He is now within us, we have become organically members of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We are also members one of another.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The arm and the shoulder, as joint members, are related organically to each other.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The building up of the Body is the growing together of the members.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The hand is built with the arm and the arm with the shoulder.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The relationship is not mechanical like a robot.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We do not function in the church like robots, regulated and controlled by the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Do we function in the meetings because we are told to by the elders?</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Do we come to the Saturday morning service because they have told us we should?</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We are not parts of a mechanical being but living members of an organism!</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This living organism is being produced, not by a creative act, but by the qualified Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Whatever He has gone through, whatever He has obtained and attained, whatever He has entered into, is all for the producing of His Body.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Ephesians 1:19-23 makes this clear.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In Ephesians 3 the church is called the mystery of Christ v. 4 . Christ is the mystery of God; similarly, the church, this organic entity, is the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>It was purposed, planned, and designed in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In Ephesians 4:4-6 it is clear that the Body is wrapped up with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>One Body and one Spirit, as also you were called in one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism; one God and Father of all, Who is over all and through all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>There is one Body, one Spirit, one Lord, and one God and Father.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>All three of the Godhead are blended with the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Just as we cannot separate the three of the Godhead, neither can we separate the church as the Body from the three.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>They are blended together.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Some object to our saying that we are mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>In the preface to Darby s New Translation , Darby comments on the difficulty of using a large or small s for the word spirit when it is not clear whether the Holy Spirit or our spirit is meant.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Three times in this one paragraph Darby uses the word blended.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>He says that the way spirit is used indicates our state.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>That is, God as the Spirit is blended with our spirit; this is the state we are in.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Hallelujah that the divine Spirit, having passed through so many processes, has become one spirit with us!</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Christians like to hear about miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Surely this is the top miracle: that God has gone through so much and has accomplished so much that He is fully equipped to be blended with us!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>What a state we are in!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We are the living members of the organic Body of Christ.</S>
