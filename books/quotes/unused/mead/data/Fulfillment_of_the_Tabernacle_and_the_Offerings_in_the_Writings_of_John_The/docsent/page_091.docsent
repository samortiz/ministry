   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>TO RELEASE MAN FROM THE BONDAGE OF SIN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As the Emancipator, the Lord releases us from the bondage of sin and makes us sons of God free from death 8:32-36, 51 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord is the One who frees us from sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 51 He says, "If anyone keeps My word, he shall by no means see death forever."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that when we become sons of God, we shall never die.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Son of God is everlasting.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Son of God is eternal because the life of the Son of God is eternal life, which never dies.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hence, He can release us from the bondage of sin and, by imparting eternal life to us, make us sons of God free from death.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>LIFTED UP ON THE CROSS AS THE SON OF MAN</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In verse 28 the Lord Jesus referred to His being lifted up on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>According to this verse, the Lord was lifted up on the cross as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus is the Son of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As such, He is the great I Am, the eternal To Be.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But when He was lifted up on the cross, He was the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This Son of Man is also one of the elements in the divine extract.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus far we have seen a number of elements contained in the divine extract.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The first element is the Son of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The second element is the light of the world, which becomes the light of life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The third element is the universal I Am.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Now we see a fourth element the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Because the life-giving Spirit is an extract containing all these elements, this extract is truly powerful and effective.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In chapter eight of the Gospel of John there is no mention of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But there is a clear word concerning the Spirit in 7:37-39.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the last day of the feast the Lord cried out and said, "If anyone thirst, let him come to Me and drink.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He who believes in Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>37-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then verse 39 follows to say, "But this He said concerning the Spirit, whom those who believed in Him were about to receive; for the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In chapter eight we can see Christ glorified, for here we have the lifting up of Christ as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This lifting up was followed by resurrection, and in resurrection the Spirit as the Spirit of Jesus Christ came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In chapter seven the Spirit was "not yet."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But in chapter eight, after the lifting up of the Son of Man, the Spirit came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This Spirit is the extract of the Son of the Father, the light of life, the eternal I Am, and the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In this extract we have all these elements.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>HONORING THE FATHER AND NOT SEEKING HIS OWN GLORY</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The One who is the great I Am and also the Son of Man honored the Father and never sought His own glory 8:49-50, 54 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Here we do not have an element of the divine extract, but we do have the nature of the element of the Lord's living as the Son of Man.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The nature of this element is the Lord's honoring the Father and not seeking His own glory.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord always honored the Father, and He never sought glory for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we do not honor the Father but instead seek our own glory, in principle we commit spiritual fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to be set free from this.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that to be set free from sin in John 8 includes to be set free from honoring ourselves and from seeking glory for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we seek glory for ourselves, in principle we are committing fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Here we have a deeper understanding of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even if we seek a little glory for ourselves, we are committing sin, in principle committing fornication.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>For example, when you give a testimony in the meetings, you may desire to hear many "Amens."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If this is your desire, you are seeking glory for yourself, and you are not honoring the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is sin.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What can deal with this sin?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Only the divine extract can deal with it.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The nature of this extract is that it does not seek self-glory but always honors the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>EXPECTED WITH EXULTATION BY ABRAHAM</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In 8:56 the Lord Jesus said, "Your father Abraham exulted that he should see My day, and he saw it and rejoiced."</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although Abraham expected the Lord with exultation, we are no longer expecting Him we are enjoying Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>SLANDERED BY RELIGIOUS PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord Jesus as the Son of the Father was slandered by religious people, who regarded Him as a Samaritan possessed by a demon 8:48, 52 .</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>According to verse 48, they said, "Are we not right in saying that you are a Samaritan and have a demon?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here we see that they slandered the Lord by accusing Him of being impure.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>A Samaritan is a person of mixed blood, a person who is part Jewish and part pagan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The religious people not only accused the Lord of being a Samaritan, but accused Him of being a Samaritan possessed by a demon.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What slander this is!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In principle, religious people are doing the same thing today by opposing those who take the Lord's way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>TEMPTED AND PERSECUTED BY THOSE SEEKING TO KILL HIM</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Lord Jesus also was tempted and persecuted by those who sought to kill Him vv.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>6, 20, 37, 40, 59 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Lord was slandered, tempted, and persecuted, and certain ones were looking for the opportunity to kill Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Those in the religious world slandered this Emancipator or persecuted or sought to tempt Him.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The church in the Lord's recovery today is in a similar situation of being slandered and persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>But while others slander, tempt, and persecute, we enjoy the wonderful One who is our Emancipator.</S>
