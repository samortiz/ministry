With the exception of chapter four, the messages were delivered in Shanghai during September and October of that year. Chapter four was delivered in Chuenchow, Fukien province, in November of the same year. We have included it in this volume because its subject and emphasis are consistent with the content of the Shanghai messages. These messages reveal the excellent Christ who is in us as our victory. Their content is rich and precious. May the God who commands light to shine out of darkness shine in our hearts through these words and lead us into the experience of the riches of life! Amen!</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_001.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_003.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 24: The Overcoming Life &nbsp; pg 2</div><br></body></html>
