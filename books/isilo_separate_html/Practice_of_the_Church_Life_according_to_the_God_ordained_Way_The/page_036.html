His move is very great, and His work has become a great activity. Any kind of move or activity involves some kind of economy, plan, arrangement, or way to carry out a certain purpose. The economical Trinity concerns God's economy for His move, for His activity, to fulfill His plan. Hence, the Triune God has His essential aspect&#151;the essential Trinity, and His economical aspect&#151;the economical Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. Concerning God's Creation</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. With Man as the Center</H2><P>In our practice of prophesying, we must also learn the truth concerning God's creation with man as the center (Gen. 1&#151;2). God's creation has billions of items, but the center of this entire creation is man. Man as the center of God's creation bears God's image (1:26). A photograph of a person is the image of that person. In this aspect man is like God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. Man Created in Three Parts&#151;Body, Soul, and Spirit</H2><P>Man as the center in God's creation was created in three parts&#151;body, soul, and spirit (Gen. 2:7). Because man is so crucial in God's creation, he corresponds to God. God is triune and man is tripartite. The Third of the Triune God is the Spirit, and the third part of the tripartite man is also the spirit. These two spirits correspond with each other, communicate with each other, and are mingled with each other to be one spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>c. Man to Take God as Life</H2><P>The man created by God in three parts was supposed to take God as life (Gen. 2:9). God created man and brought him to the tree of life, indicating that man should take in the tree of life. The tree of life is a symbol of God as life to man. The God-created man should take God as his nourishment, so that God could be man's life and life supply.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>d. Man to Be Increased with a Counterpart</H2><P>Man was also to be increased with a counterpart, a wife (Gen. 2:18-24). God also desires a counterpart, a wife. In eternity past, God was a bachelor. He was alone, yet He wanted to be increased. He wanted to have a counterpart. Christ also wants a counterpart. His counterpart is the church (Eph. 5:25). In Genesis 2 Adam received Eve as his counterpart. Before Eve came into existence, Adam was single. Eve was the increase of Adam.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. Concerning Man's Fall</H2><P>We also must learn the truth concerning man's fall (Gen. 3; 4; 6:1-13; 11:1-9). Our understanding concerning the fall of man in Genesis has been printed in the Life-study Messages of Genesis.</P><P>Beginning from 1974, I spent fourteen years to finish the life-study of the New Testament. I am now working on the life-study of the Old Testament, and by the Lord's mercy, within another three years, I hope to finish it. My burden in having the life-study of the entire Bible was to open the Bible to the Lord's children by interpreting it. Today you may have the Bible in your hand, but it may not be open to you. The holy Word has been inspired, written both in Hebrew in the Old Testament and in Greek in the New Testament, and translated into other languages. Now the inspired, written, and translated Bible must be interpreted and defined.</P><P>The Life-study Messages are intended to be a guide. In Acts 8 the Ethiopian eunuch was reading the fifty-third chapter of Isaiah in his chariot (vv. 28, 32-33). The Spirit told Philip to join himself to the chariot, and as Philip ran up to the chariot, he heard the eunuch reading the prophet Isaiah. Philip then asked the eunuch if he understood what he was reading. The eunuch answered, "How could I unless someone guides me?" (v. 31).</P><P>One of my burdens in completing the life-study of the entire Bible was to solve the common and hard problems in the Bible and to open up every book of the Bible. If you have a question and turn to the notes in the Recovery Version or the Life-study Messages, you can get the answer. When the life-study of the Old Testament is finished, the Bible will then be an open Bible. At that time the Bible will not only have been inspired, written, and translated, but will also have been entirely interpreted. We should spend our time and energy to study the Word.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_035.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_037.html">Next</a> </body></html>
