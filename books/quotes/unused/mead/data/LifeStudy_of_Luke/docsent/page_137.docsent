   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LUKE MESSAGE FORTY-SIX THE MAN-SAVIOR S PRESENTATION OF HIMSELF</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO DEATH FOR REDEMPTION 3 Scripture Reading: Luke 20:1 21:4 A QUESTION CONCERNING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 20:1-38 the Man-Savior is examined by the chief priests, scribes, and elders vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>1-19 , by the Pharisees and Herodians vv.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>20-26 , and by the Sadducees vv.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>27-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In 20:39-44 the Lord muzzles all the examiners.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The scribes answered and said, Teacher, you have spoken well v. 39 . We are told that they no longer dared to question Him about anything v. 40 . In 20:41-44 the Lord went on to ask the examiners a question, a question concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In 20:1-38 the Lord was surrounded by the chief priests, elders, Pharisees, Herodians, and Sadducees, who tried to ensnare Him by asking insidious questions.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>First, the chief priests, scribes, and elders, representing the authority of the Jewish religion and the authority of the Jewish people, asked Him concerning His authority v. 2 . This was a question according to their religious concept.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second, the fundamental Pharisees and political Herodians asked Him a question related to politics.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Third, the Sadducees questioned Him concerning the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After answering all their questions wisely, the Lord asked them a question concerning Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the question of questions.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Their questions were related to religion, politics, and belief.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His question was concerning Christ, who is the center of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They knew religion, politics, and belief, but they paid no attention to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verses 41 through 44 the Lord said to His examiners, How can they say that the Christ is David s son?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For David himself says in the book of Psalms, The Lord said to my Lord, Sit at My right hand, until I place Your enemies as a footstool for Your feet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>David therefore calls Him Lord, and how is He his son?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As God in His divinity, Christ is the Lord of David.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As man in His humanity, He is the Son of David.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His examiners had only half the scriptural knowledge concerning Christ s Person, that He was the Son of David according to His humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They did not have the other half, concerning Christ s divinity as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord s intention in 20:41-44 was to help His examiners to see that the One they were questioning was actually the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>THE EXAMINATION OF THE GOD-MAN</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to realize that the One being examined here was the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Yes, in that situation the Man-Savior was a man, but He was also God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This means that as God He was surrounded by opposers who were examining Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>How blind, foolish, and ignorant they were!</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They did not realize that the One they were examining was God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we have this understanding, we shall see what patience the God-man exercised when He was examined by the chief priests, scribes, elders, Pharisees, Herodians, and Sadducees.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Although He was frank, straightforward, and wise, He was not angry with them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He was God, but He was willing to be examined by His creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to be deeply impressed with the fact that the One being examined was the God-man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The very Creator of all was surrounded by His creatures and was examined by them in an insidious and insulting way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Nevertheless, He was patient and was not at all angry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He answered them properly and wisely.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this chapter we have a clear picture of the highest standard of morality.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This morality is expressed in the Lord s human virtues with His divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Here we see the riches of the Man-Savior s human virtues with His divine attributes.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After being questioned by His examiners, He tried to help them, His creatures, to realize that He was both man and God, both a human son and the Lord God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>His question concerning Christ silenced them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the type, the Passover lamb was examined for four days before it was killed Exo 12:3-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Man-Savior, as the real Passover Lamb 1 Cor 5:7 , was also examined for four days before He was killed.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He came to Bethany six days before the Passover John 12:1; Mark 11:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The next day He came into Jerusalem and went back to Bethany John 12:12; Mark 11:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The third day He came to Jerusalem again Mark 11:12-15 and began to be examined by the leaders of the Jews according to the Jewish law Mark 11:27 12:37; 14:53-65; John 18:13, 19-24 , and by Pilate, the Roman governor, according to the Roman law John 18:28 19:6 until the Passover day when He was crucified Mark 14:12; John 18:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This insidious and ensnaring examination from many angles took exactly four days.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Man-Savior passed this examination, proving that He was fully qualified to be the Lamb required by God for the accomplishment of His redemption so that God might pass over the sinners, both the Jews and the Gentiles.</S>
