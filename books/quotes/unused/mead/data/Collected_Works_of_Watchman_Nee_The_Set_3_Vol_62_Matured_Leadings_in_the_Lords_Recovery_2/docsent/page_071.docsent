   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE MORE ADVANCED ONES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TEACHING THE MORE RECENT NEWCOMERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We cannot advance to new lessons unless we have first finished the fifty-two Messages for Building Up New Believers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For this reason we have to learn every one of these lessons thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we can help the newly saved ones pass on the same teachings to the next generation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This does not mean that we have to know all fifty-two lessons and learn them all by heart within a year before we can graduate and teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As long as we have learned something in the last month, we can use the same material to teach the new ones this month.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This is like a provisional makeshift military school where the more advanced students serve as teachers to the newcomers.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When I was young I studied at Trinity College.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For a while I substituted for the teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I could teach, but this does not mean that I could sit down and teach as a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When I spoke to the class, I dared not sit like the teacher; I had to stand while I spoke.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Those who have learned a new believers' lesson last month can teach the new ones who show up the next month.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But they can only teach as one student teaching another student; they cannot assume the role of a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All waves eventually are caught up by the waves behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The latter glory is always greater than the former glory.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The last shall be the first Matt 19:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, if the first group does not set a good standard, the ones who follow will not be able to go on in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We have to follow the way of the army in our training; we have to raise up our own teachers and then assign them to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to make up the lessons ourselves first and then help others make them up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>TAKING CARE OF OUR LANGUAGE</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The hidden reef in our visitation and fellowship is our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>James said that we bless the Lord and Father with our mouth and also curse men who have been made according to the likeness of God with our mouth 3:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Satan has his way of dealing with the world.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To him, there is not enough sin in the world; there is not enough to meet his need.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He wants more sins.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To him, murder, theft, idolatry, etc. are not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is why he creates lies to increase the sins of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He thinks that the sins in conduct are too few in this world, and he stirs up man's mouth to multiply sin.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Of all the transgressions in this world, sins in action occupy less than one-quarter; the others are sins in words.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These are produced by Satan through man's mouth when many things are said and many lies and rumors spread.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Satan multiplies the sins of this world through man's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When lies multiply, sins multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Satan was a liar from the beginning, and he is the father of liars John 8:44 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Who are the liars?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everyone who lies is a follower of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>James said that the tongue is a fire that is set on fire by Gehenna; it is the very world of unrighteousness 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Man's mouth can create all the sins of this world.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many people like to speak, and they like to speak inaccurate words, evil words, and idle words.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>These ones are helping Satan multiply sin in this world; they are followers of Satan's way.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If our mouth is clean today, Satan can do nothing in this world.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If sin decreases, Satan will be out of a job; he will be unemployed.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Matthew 5 the Lord Jesus said that our words should be yes, yes, and no, no. Anything more than this is of Satan v. 37 . We should not have any gossip, rumors, or idle talk in our family.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In our fellowship with the brothers and sisters, we should only speak spiritual words and words of building; we should not help Satan multiply sin with our mouth.</S>
