Covered within and without with Pitch</H2><P>Christ is not only the crucified One, but also the One who shed His blood to cover us from the penalty of our sins. So, the ark was pitched within and without with pitch (6:14). The Hebrew word for pitch has the same root as the Hebrew word for atonement. The main meaning of this Hebrew root is "to cover." The word for the cover of the ark of the testimony, the mercy seat, also comes from this same root. This means that in Christ we have the full covering. We all are covered with His redemption. Death cannot damage Him, and so no condemnation or judgment can reach us, because we are under the covering of Christ's redemption. The pitch signifies the redeeming of Christ, which covers God's building within and without. The covering within is for our sight, and the covering without is for God's. Perhaps when the flood was attacking the ark, the people within were frightened. But whenever they looked at the pitch within, they could be at peace. The pitch inside the ark was for their peace. The pitch outside the ark was for God's satisfaction. The covering of the pitch without was also for Satan and the angels. This is a picture of the blood. Whenever we look at the blood, we have peace. Whenever God looks at the blood, He is satisfied. Whenever Satan looks at the blood, he is unable to attack. Whenever the angels look at the blood, they rejoice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. A Type of Christ</H2><P>The whole ark is a type of Christ (1 Pet. 3:20-21). Christ is not a canoe, but an ark. A canoe is a curved piece of wood; an ark is composed of many pieces rightly framed together. An ark is a building. A canoe is individual, but an ark is a corporate entity. My Christ is an ark. We can never be safe in a canoe. However, when I am in the ark, I can sleep well regardless of how terrible the storm may be. We are in the ark. Some Christians may have Christ as a canoe, but our Christ is an ark.</P><P>Since the ark is a type of Christ, how could Noah have built it? Nevertheless the ark was built by Noah. Many Christians simply preach the gospel, expecting that one day God will send the ark down from heaven. If you say that we must work to build the ark, the salvation, people will condemn you, saying, "We are saved by grace, not by work." Noah was saved by the ark which was built by his work. Philippians 2:12-16 says, "Work out your own salvation with fear and trembling; for it is God who operates in you both the willing and the working for His good pleasure..that you may become blameless and guileless, children of God without blemish in the midst of a crooked and perverted generation, among whom you shine as lights in the world, holding forth the word of life." What does it mean to "work out your own salvation"? It means to hold out the Word of life, to illuminate, to enlighten, to live out Christ. This is through God's working within us both to will and to do. As God is working within us, so we have to work out our salvation. Although we have been saved, God is still working in us that we may work out our salvation. Thousands of people have been saved, but how many have the life described in Philippians 2:15? Many are not working out their salvation.</P><P>Are we now working out our salvation? Noah built the ark that eventually saved him not only from God's judgment, but also from that crooked and perverse generation. We must work out this kind of salvation. There is no doubt that we have been saved from eternal perdition. But Noah was not only saved from perdition; he was also saved out of that evil age into a new age. The ark which he built terminated the old generation and ushered in a new one. That was the kind of salvation that Noah was building. It was not simply a salvation from eternal perdition, but a salvation from that crooked and perverse generation. That kind of salvation was not only prepared by God; it was built through the corporate cooperation of the saved ones.</P><P>No one who has been saved will ever perish. Nevertheless, you need a further and higher salvation that will save you from this crooked and perverse generation. Have you been saved? What about the coming age? Will you have a share in it? Will you be there when Christ returns to take possession of the whole earth and to exercise His reigning power over it? Will you share in His reign? Although we all have been saved from eternal perdition, many of us are not working on something which will bring us out of this evil age. The ark which Noah built was a salvation that not only saved him from God's judgment, but that also separated him from that crooked and perverse generation and brought him into a new age. As far as God's judgment is concerned, we all have been saved, but as far as God's economy is concerned, we are lacking. God has condemned the world, but you still love it. God has warned you to escape from this age, but you still keep yourself firmly planted in it. You are short of the further and higher salvation. The salvation mentioned in Philippians 2 is not salvation from perdition, but from the crooked and perverse generation.</P><P>While the apostles were preaching the gospel, they were also building the ark in which they would enjoy full salvation. What was that ark? It was the corporate Christ. While the apostles were preaching the individual Christ, they were building up the corporate Christ. Through that corporate Christ, thousands of people were not only saved from God's judgment, but also from that crooked and perverse generation.</P><P>Today, if we are faithful to God, we must do the same thing. On the one hand, we preach the gospel; on the other hand, we build the ark. What we preach is what we build. What we preach is not a theory or a doctrine. We preach what we are building up. By our life and work, we build up the very thing that we are preaching to others. Eventually, we shall enter into that which we are building. Others may also enter in. The builded ark will save us from this condemned generation. Do you not believe that we are building the ark? I am so happy that we are building the ark. My friends and relatives always ask me, "What are you doing?" I reply, "I am doing something which is difficult for you to understand. The only way for you to understand it is to get in it yourself." We are not just preaching, but also building what we preach. Do we preach Christ? We are building Christ as well as preaching Christ. This means that we are living by Christ and with Christ. We are living out Christ. We hold on to Christ and live Him out. This is our building work.</P><P>At the same time, we are building the church. The church is the corporate Christ (1 Cor. 12:12) which, in a sense, is today's ark. Thousands of people have been saved by entering into the church life. Many can testify how they have been saved by coming into the church. Although you might have been saved for many years, you were not separated from this crooked world until you came into the church. That corporate ark separated you. Once we came into the church, no one had to tell us to come out of the world. We simply began a life of "churching," coming to the meetings again and again. Eventually, the long hair and so many other things of this age disappeared. By churching, everything of this crooked age will disappear. What is able to save us from this perverse age? Churching can save us. We are building the ark that can save us as well as others from the age condemned by God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Not Only for Mankind<br>but Also for All Living Things</H2><P>The ark was not only for the salvation of man, but for the salvation of all living creatures. What does this signify? Hebrews 2:9 says that Christ tasted death not only for every man, but, as the Greek indicates, for everything. So, Colossians 1:20 says that God has reconciled all things to Himself through Christ. The creatures as well as the human beings were in the ark. Christ has accomplished an all-inclusive death for every creature, for all things. Thus, the ark was not only for the salvation of man, but for the salvation of all living creatures.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_197.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_199.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Genesis &nbsp; pg 198</div><br></body></html>
