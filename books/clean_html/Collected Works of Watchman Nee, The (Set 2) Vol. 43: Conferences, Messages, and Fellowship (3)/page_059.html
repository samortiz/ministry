<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">LEARNING THE LESSON OF THE CROSS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 5, 1938<br />Place: Penang<br />Scripture Reading: Jer. 48:11</h1><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO REMOVE THE LEES<br />BEING TO BE EMPTIED CONTINUOUSLY</h2><p>In Jeremiah 48:11 God said, "Moab has been at ease from his youth;/And he is settled on his lees/And has not been emptied from vessel to vessel;.../Therefore his taste remains in him,/And his scent is not changed." Moab was like wine. His lees remained, his taste stayed the same, and his scent was not changed, because he was never emptied.</p><p>Today Christians are filled with lees. This is why God has to pour them from vessel to vessel. If you have never been emptied and if your taste still remains, you are not of much use in the hand of the Lord. In order to perfect us, God must continually empty us. Many times when a task is about to be finished, we find God forcing us to start everything all over again. We expect days of ease, and we want to keep God out of our territory. Day by day we pray for days of peace. But even while we are thinking this, something happens at home, in the church, or among the brothers and sisters. If we do not think about peace, we may have peace. But as soon as we think about it, trouble comes! God is emptying us to purify us. After we are purified once, He empties us again. After we are purified a second time, He empties us a third time. God will not allow us to remain settled on our lees. He continues to empty us.</p><p>If we do not humble ourselves under the mighty hand of God and if there is no joy in us, the lees within us will never be purified. But if we submit and our hearts rejoice, we will find that all of God's dealings are necessary for us. If we accept what God has measured to us, we will be purified from the lees through our willingness to accept, submit, and be poured out. God has placed many undesirable things in our pathway. If we submit to His arrangement, we will be purified again and again. However, if we do not submit and instead react inwardly to His arrangement, then lees will remain within us, and our taste and scent will remain un- changed.</p><p>God allows us to experience shame, pain, and mishaps in the church, at work, and in our homes. These are the crosses that God has given us. They are there for us to learn the lesson of bearing the cross, denying the self, and submitting to God. When we are faced with these things, we should say to the Lord, "Since it pleases You to give me days of affliction, I am happy to pass my days in affliction. If it pleases You that I suffer, I will never ask for ease." We have to learn to satisfy God's heart. We are not only those who believe in the Lord but also those who love Him. The only question we need to ask about anything is whether or not God is pleased with it. Are we living for God? If we are, what more can we say if a thing pleases the Lord? John Bunyan said, "God, if it pleases You that I go to hell, I will jump into it this very moment!" We do not live for ourselves but for God.</p><h2 class="head1">A RAW CHRISTIAN AND A MATURE CHRISTIAN</h2><p>There are two kinds of Christians: raw Christians and mature Christians. Most Christians who are saved have not yet experienced God's dealings. They speak and walk as freely as before. When they argue with others, they want to return an eye for an eye and a tooth for a tooth. Before they were saved, they lost their temper when they were unhappy. Now that they are saved, they still lose their temper when they are angry. These are raw Christians. They have not learned the proper lessons before the Lord. Their will has never been broken, and they have never been humbled under the mighty hand of God; they have never been disciplined by the Lord.</p><p>After a Christian has passed through God's dealings, he will spontaneously accept God's discipline in the environment. When God directs his pathway with the chastening whip, he will go along with all the lessons that God gives to him. This is a mature Christian. The Lord Jesus entered Jerusalem on a donkey's colt which no man had yet sat upon (Mark 11:2). A donkey is very difficult to ride on, more difficult than an elephant, horse, or camel. If the little animal has a fit of temperament, no one can push or pull it. A donkey is an animal with a terrible and stubborn temperament. A donkey's colt that has never been disciplined and trained is an absolutely wild animal. It was born free and has never carried anyone on its back. It walks and eats according to its own way; it is not tame. A tame donkey's colt is one that has been disciplined and chastised. Someone has been running, subduing, pulling, and directing the way it should take. This is the difference between being raw and being tamed. The Lord has to work on most Christians like working on a donkey's colt before He can use them. But we like to choose our own way. Those who choose their own way are raw Christians. However, no matter how raw we are, when the Lord wants to use us, He can ride on us. If we have never been disciplined and chastised, we will never be useful.</p>
