<h2 class="head1">BREATHING THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>What we are speaking about is not anything superstitious. We are talking about a divine fact. Through redemption and by regeneration, we have the Triune God living in our spirit. The Triune God within us is more real than the air we breathe. There is no need for us to fast or cry to the Lord in order to receive the divine dispensing. As we breathe in air to maintain our physical life, we simply need to breathe in the Triune God in order to experience His dispensing. According to Paul&rsquo;s word in Romans 10, the word is near us, in our mouth and in our heart (v. 8). In 10:12 Paul says, &ldquo;The same Lord of all is rich to all who call upon Him.&rdquo; Therefore, we simply need to call on the name of the Lord, and He will be rich to us. The air is available for us all to breathe. By breathing in the air, we are enriched by it. In a similar way, by calling on the name of the Lord, we are enriched by the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SATURATED WITH THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Because redemption has been accomplished and the blood of Christ has been sprinkled upon the propitiation cover, as believers in Christ we have the Triune God in our spirit. There is no need for us to fast or wait in order to experience Him. We simply need to say, &ldquo;Lord, I thank You for Your provision. I thank You for the blood and for the Spirit. I also thank You, Lord, for being so real within me.&rdquo; When you pray like this, the divine dispensing will take place within you. Through this dispensing you will be saturated with the Triune God, and in this way your whole being will be sanctified. By this dispensing we are soaked with the Triune God. As long as we believe in the Lord Jesus, call on His name, and apply His redeeming blood to our situation, we may experience this divine dispensing.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s salvation is not a matter of ethical improvement. Confucius is one who taught people to improve themselves by developing something within them called the bright virtue. But the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is not a matter of improvement, cultivation, or development of a so-called bright virtue. Rather, the Lord&rsquo;s desire is that we enjoy what He has accomplished for us and what He is to us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENJOYING THE INDWELLING TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>Christ is the processed God. He passed through the process of incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection. Having passed through this process, He is now in ascension. Furthermore, through His resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. Therefore, we may now enjoy what He has accomplished through His incarnation, crucifixion, and resurrection and enjoy Him as the life-giving Spirit. This is to enjoy Him as the indwelling Triune God. Hallelujah, the Spirit of God dwells in us! According to Romans 8, the Spirit of Christ and Christ are also in us. It is a fact that, according to 8:11, the Spirit of the One who raised the Lord Jesus from among the dead dwells in our spirit. What a glorious fact this is! Now what do we need to do? We do not need to do anything except enjoy the Lord. Let us enjoy what He has accomplished, what He has obtained, and what He has attained. Let us enjoy all that Christ is. Christ is our redemption and sanctification, our life and life supply. He is our food, our drink, our everything. He is living, rich, and subjective to us. This is the One we experience and enjoy through the divine dispensing of the divine Trinity.</p>
<p>Through the Lord&rsquo;s dispensing we have the cleansing of the Lord&rsquo;s blood and the power of His resurrection. In this dispensing we have the element of sanctification, the very substance of the holiness of God. In this dispensing we also have the divine life, the divine love, and the divine light. Through the dispensing of the Divine Trinity, we have all the divine virtues. How marvelous that these divine virtues are in the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit!</p>
