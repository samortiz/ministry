	 <h2 class="head2">Material Offering</h2>
<p>Another thing recovered by the Brethren is material offering; this is also a great recovery. Even when they were first raised up, the Brethren already knew how to use their earthly possessions for God. They never encouraged or asked the believers to give; they did not even make announcements. They simply lived for God and used their material possessions for Him. In all of church history it is difficult to find a group that can equal the Brethren in the matter of material offering. Once, following a disaster in Central America, the money the Brethren wired to help the brothers exceeded the amount given by the British government, and the Brethren funds arrived sooner. The Brethren used their money for the Lord, and they lived a life of brotherly love.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OTHER RECOVERIES</h2>
<p>After the Brethren were raised up, God&rsquo;s recovery work was almost complete. Subsequently, God&rsquo;s recovery work continued gradually. From the time the Brethren were raised up, the recovery work for the next one hundred years was almost entirely in England; this was marvelous. During these one hundred years of recovery, there are a few matters that we must mention.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Living by Faith</h2>
<p>The recovery of living by faith before God centered on George M&#252;ller, who testified that man could see God&rsquo;s answer to prayer in the practical matter of finances. Therefore, man should not trust in his money but in God. This practice existed in the days just after Pentecost, but later it disappeared. Luther did not recover this matter, and although it was partially recovered with the Moravian Brethren, it was not recovered in a clear way. The recovery of living by faith did not become crystal clear until George M&#252;ller. He and Darby lived at approximately the same time, although M&#252;ller was five years younger than Darby.</p>
<p>These brothers lived under the principle of living by faith because they all lived by faith before God, freed from religious organization and human methods. The expenses related to the work and the financial support of all the serving ones were a big temptation. But they relied on God, and God looked upon their faith and answered their prayers of faith by specially caring for them. They had many testimonies of this kind of care.</p>
<p>Before M&#252;ller passed away, Hudson Taylor was raised up. Brother Hudson Taylor testified to many things, but his living by faith and looking to God in faith were a strong and important element in his overall testimony. Prior to Hudson Taylor, every mission board used human methods to obtain offerings in support of their foreign mission works. Brother Hudson Taylor was the only one who stood up to say, &ldquo;I do not do anything by asking for donations; I rely only on God&rsquo;s mercy.&rdquo; He received much help from M&#252;ller in this matter. All of us today have also received this help; this is an important matter of recovery.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Overcoming</h2>
<p>Next is the recovery of the matter of overcoming. In the historical record and biographies of the past one hundred years of church history, there has been a line of believers who have emphasized the matter of overcoming; moreover, they have lived overcoming lives. One of these believers was Mrs. Hannah Whithall Smith, who wrote a book called <em>The Christian&rsquo;s Secret of a Happy Life.</em> This book was very popular and was appreciated very much. Mrs. Smith and her husband, Robert Pearsall Smith, together with Evan Hopkins in England and Theodore Monod in France, influenced the Keswick Convention. These believers preached only the truth of consecration. Most of the messages at the Keswick Convention dealt with the matter of consecration. God blessed these brothers and sisters very much. They considered that all spiritual experiences are based on consecration. If a person could not pray, overcome sin, or preach the gospel with power, it was because he had not consecrated himself. These messages were very strong at that time, and they helped many people.</p>
<p>In principle, when there is a recovery, the Lord&rsquo;s presence is there initially, but as time goes on, the spiritual level gradually falls. Although the Keswick Convention had the Lord&rsquo;s blessing in the past, if someone today were to preach the consecration of the Keswick Convention, it probably would not touch others as it did before, because the times have changed. Later, Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis rose up to preach the believers&rsquo; co-crucifixion with Christ, which is the truth of the cross. She explained how the cross has dealt with our old man.</p>
<p>With regard to the matter of life, we must also mention Brother Andrew Murray. He was a little earlier than Mrs. Penn-Lewis, and he genuinely knew the indwelling Christ. After Mrs. Penn-Lewis came Brother T. Austin-Sparks, who saw the matter of resurrection. It is right to put the writings of Andrew Murray in sequence before the writings of Mrs. Penn-Lewis, because his writings carried on the line of thought of the Keswick Convention. By the same principle, the writings of Mrs. Penn-Lewis must be placed before the periodical called <em>A Witness and a Testimony</em> by T. Austin-Sparks, because the central message of Mrs. Penn-Lewis is the cross of Christ, and T. Austin-Sparks, emphasizes the resurrection of Christ. In all of church history, not many people have known and developed the matter of resurrection as much as the periodical put out by Brother T. Austin-Sparks, <em>A Witness and a Testimony.</em> This is the line of overcoming: (1) the secret of the believer&rsquo;s happiness, (2) the indwelling Spirit, (3) dying with Christ, and (4) resurrection. The order of these items is appropriate.</p>
