<div class='line'><b>1</b> Our old man has been crucified with Christ;</div>
<div class='line'>Yes, all we are in oldness He sufficed</div>
<div class='line'>To bring to naught upon the cross that He</div>
<div class='line'>Himself as our new Husband fully be</div>
<div class='line'>Enjoyed by us.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>2</b> Yes, all our strength of independence died,</div>
<div class='line'>For we with Christ were fully crucified.</div>
<div class='line'>Now we're so glad to be His proper wife,</div>
<div class='line'>Dependently enjoying Him as life</div>
<div class='line'>Forevermore.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>3</b> Our dying was not such a sad affair,</div>
<div class='line'>The new man was rejoicing to be there;</div>
<div class='line'>The old man dead and buried, we were free</div>
<div class='line'>To marry Christ, and live eternally,</div>
<div class='line'>His wife, fore'er.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>4</b> Now as the new, regenerated man,</div>
<div class='line'>We do two things, according to God's plan:</div>
<div class='line'>Bear fruit to God and serve in spirit new</div>
<div class='line'>So God becomes the fruit of all we do,</div>
<div class='line'>And all we are.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>5</b> There are three laws in Romans seven, see -</div>
<div class='line'>The law of God; the mind, the good old me;</div>
<div class='line'>The sinful law indwelling bodily;</div>
<div class='line'>Yet from these all the Lord has set us free,</div>
<div class='line'>To live by Him.</div>
</div>
<div class='stanza'>
<div class='line'><b>6</b> In Romans eight the law of Spirit is,</div>
<div class='line'>Where we're in Christ, and we are fully His,</div>
<div class='line'>The law of life has set us wholly free</div>
<div class='line'>And Christ becomes our life eternally,</div>
<div class='line'>Hallelujah!</div>
