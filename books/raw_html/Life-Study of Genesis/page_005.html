<H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE GENERAL SKETCH</H2><P>With every book of the Bible, there is a general sketch. The general sketch of Genesis is:</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD7>God created, Satan corrupted, man fell, and<br>Jehovah promised to save.</H2><P>Never forget these four items!</P><P>Although Genesis has 50 chapters, it is so simple; it is divided into three sections. Chapters 1 and 2 are the first section, chapters 3 through 11 the second section, and chapters 12 through 50 the third section. Each section begins with a name. The names in sections one and three are wonderful, but not the name in section two. In the first section we have "God," in the second section the "serpent," and in the third section "Jehovah." (In the King James Version "Jehovah" is translated as "the Lord.") God created, the serpent corrupted, and Jehovah called.</P><P>What did God create? God created the heavens and the earth. But this is not all. Ultimately God created man because the heavens are for the earth and the earth is for man, and man is for God. After God's creation, the subtle one, that is the serpent, crept in to corrupt. He really corrupted God's creation, starting with rebellion and ending with rebellion. Chapter 11 reveals the rebellion of the fallen race to the uttermost. There was no hope. Nevertheless, there was hope because Jehovah came in to call out Abraham for a new start. Hallelujah! God created, the serpent corrupted, but Jehovah called.</P><P>In which section are you? I can testify that fifty years ago I was in the second section, but today I am in the third section. Fifty years ago I was one corrupted by the serpent, but now I am one called by Jehovah.</P><P>The first two chapters are apparently a record of God's creation. Then, in the following 48 chapters we find biographies of eight great persons: Adam, Abel, Enoch, and Noah&#151;a group of four; Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, and Joseph&#151;another group of four. Each group belongs to a different race. The first four belong to the Adamic race, and the last four belong to the Abrahamic race. In the book of Genesis are two fathers: Adam, the father of the created race, and Abraham, the father of the called race.</P><P>Do you belong to the created race or to the called race? All the called ones are sons of Abraham. Galatians 3 tells us that whoever believes in Jesus Christ is a son of Abraham (vv. 7, 29). Hallelujah! Once we were created, but now we are called. First Corinthians 1:24 says that to the called ones Christ is the power of God and the wisdom of God. We are no longer the created race, but are forever the called race, called to partake of and enjoy Christ.</P>
