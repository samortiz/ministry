        <h2 class="head1">EATING AND DRINKING THE LORD JESUS<br />
TO ENJOY THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>In Christ the church is a corporate man composed of all who are saved; hence, no believer can be an independent individual. The church life consists of members of the Body of Christ, not independent individuals. On the surface it seems as if we are complete persons and even independent individuals. For example, I can speak, and you can speak. I can walk, and you can walk. I can hear, and you can hear; whatever I can do, you can do as well. In the church life, however, we are members, each of whom has a respective function, and not all the members have the same function (Rom. 12:4). A hand is a member, an ear is a member, and an arm is also a member. The hand can do only what a hand can do. If it wants to walk, it must depend on the feet. So Brother Hand needs to say to the feet, &ldquo;Brothers, if you do not walk, I cannot move.&rdquo; Then Brother Foot may say, &ldquo;Brother Hand, if you do not take the bread, I cannot receive the supply.&rdquo; Brother Hand then may say, &ldquo;Brother Mouth, if you do not eat the bread, we still cannot receive the supply.&rdquo; Then Brother Mouth will say to the eyes, &ldquo;Sisters, we want to eat, but if you do not look, we will not be able to eat either.&rdquo; Every member needs the other members.</p>
<p>Since we are members, we cannot be individualistic. It is easy for sisters to be individualistic. When they are angry, for example, they only want to be left alone. When I was young, I was full of energy and wanted to do everything by myself. I am not this way now. The more a person grows in the Lord, the more he feels a need for the other members. Without other members, many things will be left undone. If I am a mouth, I can only eat and speak; for everything else, I must depend on others.</p>
<p>According to the human life and nature, we all have a need for community. Our nature produces a desire within us to live and have a community life with others. This is a need that God created within man. People flock together by nature and need to live a community life. It is part of human nature to want to live with others in a community. However, because Satan injected his corrupt nature into man through the fall, man has a difficult time getting along with others. It is very easy for us to be in conflict with others. This is possible even among believers. On the one hand, we recognize our need for the brothers and sisters and sense a sweetness when we are with them, but on the other hand, it is easy to judge and criticize them. We need the Lord. His humanity is the meal offering, which is seasoned with salt (Lev. 2:13); the &ldquo;germ-killing&rdquo; function of the salt acts as a &ldquo;spiritual antibiotic.&rdquo; The more we eat the Lord Jesus, the more the Lord kills our &ldquo;germs&rdquo; and removes the negative elements, such as bitterness.</p>
<p>Human beings need to live together in a social setting, but society is filled with all kinds of wickedness because of the corruption in our human nature. However, those of us who eat the Lord Jesus have the church, and in the church these evil &ldquo;germs&rdquo; are killed by the &ldquo;germ-killing&rdquo; element in the Lord Jesus as our meal offering. If we do not eat the Lord Jesus and do not pray-read the Word, we will have problems in the church. If those who live in the brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses do not eat Jesus and pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word, problems will quickly arise. When a brother and a sister are married, they should eat the Lord Jesus and pray-read the Lord&rsquo;s Word together. They must eat the Lord Jesus in order to live the married life. This will kill any &ldquo;germs.&rdquo; Since we live in a social setting but have been poisoned by the fall, we must enjoy Christ to let Christ kill the &ldquo;germs&rdquo; within us. Additionally, because the Lord Jesus&rsquo; life is not an individual life but a corporate life, the more we eat the Lord, the more we will desire to live with the brothers and sisters in the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PUTTING OFF THE OLD MAN<br />
AND PUTTING ON THE NEW MAN</h2>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s subtlety is to divide men, and he uses ordinances related to our living to accomplish this. Different nations and people have different ordinances related to their living. The greatest distinction in this regard is between Jews and Gentiles. The Jews have numerous dietary regulations that separate them from Gentiles. In addition to the Jews, however, every ethnic group has particular ordinances, and sometimes there are even different ordinances within an ethnic group. For example, in China there are great differences between southern and northern Chinese. The Chinese who live in the south like to eat rice-based foods, while those in the north like to eat wheat-based foods. Those who live in the south regard those who live in the north as barbarians, and those in the north also regard those who live in the south as barbarians. Americans also have different ordinances based on where they live. Those who live in the north look down upon those who live in Texas, and those who live in Texas do not like those who live in the north. Various ordinances related to living cause people to be divided, and it is the same with language. When someone from Foochow meets a fellow countryman abroad who speaks with a Foochow dialect, he has a sweet and friendly feeling toward him. Those who speak with a Shanghai dialect feel quite happy when they encounter someone who speaks the same dialect. In the end, those who speak with a Foochow dialect and those who speak with a Shanghai dialect form separate groups that are divided from other groups. Thus, ordinances related to living and language divide people.</p>
<p>Ephesians 2 tells us that on the cross the Lord Jesus abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances and broke down the middle wall of partition separating Jews and Gentiles, slaying the enmity. This enmity is equal to the ordinances. Because of Christ&rsquo;s work on the cross, there is no longer any distinction between Jews and Gentiles who have believed into Christ. Similarly, in Christ there are no distinctions between the Chinese who live in the south and those who live in the north and even between Chinese and Japanese. All the differences have been nailed to the cross. The cross has terminated every distinction based on nationality. In order to live the church life, we must see that the ordinances related to our natural living have been abolished on the cross. Since the enmity has been fully slain by the Lord, there should be no separation based on nationality or region, such as Americans or Chinese and southern or northern Chinese. Every separating ordinance has been nailed to the cross.</p>
<p>When the Lord abolished the law of the commandments in ordinances on the cross, He created in Himself one new man out of Jews and Gentiles, Americans and Chinese, and so forth. Today everything natural has been abolished in Him. Consequently, after speaking in chapter 2 of the one new man, verse 22 of chapter 4 says, &ldquo;Put off, as regards your former manner of life, the old man.&rdquo; We need to put off the old man, which is our former manner of life. All manners of life concern societies and communities. Without a community there is no manner of life; the more we have a social life, the more we will have a manner of life. By ourselves, we have no manner of life. For example, a person does not need to honor his parents if he has none, or rear children if he has none, or love his wife if he has none. Without a community life there is no need for a manner of life. Therefore, our manner of life is a matter of community.</p>
<p>To put off, as regards the former manner of life, the old man, is to put off our old social way of living. Formerly, we were part of a social group with whom we participated in unfit things. That was our old man, as regards our former manner of life. Now that we are saved, we have put off that manner of life. Verse 24 continues, saying, &ldquo;Put on the new man.&rdquo; The new man is the church life. We put on the church life by being fellow members with the brothers and sisters, by loving one another, and by singing and psalming with our heart to the Lord (5:19). To put off the old man and to put on the new man are to put off our former social and community living and to put on the church life, to live in the church life. When we live in the church life, we will have no desire to hold on to anything but the church life, and we would be empty and full of bitterness without the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING SATURATED AND FILLED WITH CHRIST<br />
UNTO ALL THE FULLNESS OF GOD</h2>
<p>The young people who live in brothers&rsquo; and sisters&rsquo; houses will always have some trouble living together because our human nature still exists, and it irritates others. Nevertheless, it is truly sweet when all are in spirit and enjoying the Lord together. Therefore, in order to put off the old man and to put on the new man, we need to eat Christ so that He can grow in us. Otherwise, our putting off will be painful rather than enjoyable. When parents discipline their children, it is always a painful matter to the children and even to the parents. Parents often are angry when discipline is needed, and children also resist the discipline of their parents. By eating Christ and letting Christ grow in us, we will spontaneously put off the old man and put on the new man. This is like the transformation of a silkworm into a butterfly. When a silkworm grows, the cocoon is spontaneously shed.</p>
<p>In the church we have to lead people to eat Christ. The more we eat Christ, the more He will make His home in our heart. Furthermore, Christ spontaneously becomes our person as our old manner of life is put off. It is useless to tell others to be humble and overcoming, but if we help them to eat and enjoy Christ, they will spontaneously experience these things. The way that the Lord leads us is practical as well as simple. We have heard many doctrines and tried many methods, but today the Lord has given us the simple way of eating, drinking, and enjoying the Lord. The Lord is edible. He is in the Spirit, and He is in the Word. The Spirit is in us, and the Word is in our mouth. If we pray-read and digest the Lord&rsquo;s Word every day, the Lord will make His home in our hearts. Thus, the Lord will not only become our life but also our person. As a result, we will see the reality of all the saints being the one new man. We are a part of this new man, and we can apprehend what the breadth and length and height and depth are only with all the saints (3:18). The breadth and length and height and depth are the dimensions of the universe. Christ is the breadth, Christ is the length, Christ is the height, and Christ is the depth. The universe is limitless; no one can say clearly how broad the breadth is, how long the length is, how high the height is, and how deep the depth is. These signify Christ and His boundlessness. Christ is the breadth and length and height and depth of the universe. Even though He is immeasurable, He can be enjoyed by us. When we enjoy Him, we are filled unto all the fullness of God (v. 19), which is the expression of all God&rsquo;s riches.</p>
<p>Eating, drinking, and enjoying the Lord cause us to be full of Christ, and this is the church. Our being in Adam, in the flesh, and even in our self, that is, in our prejudices, religious concepts, and natural thoughts, has been dealt with in Christ. Now Christ can saturate us to the point that we are filled unto all the fullness of God. This is the one new man, which is the reality of the church life. The one new man accomplishes God&rsquo;s purpose and will defeat God&rsquo;s enemy to bring in the kingdom and bring the Lord back so that we can reign together with Him. This is God&rsquo;s will, and this is the role of the third man&mdash;the church as the one new man&mdash;in the Bible.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
