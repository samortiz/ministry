The first part covered the Old Testament. The second part covers the New Testament.<h2 class=head1>II. THE NEW TESTAMENT—THE PRACTICAL FULFILLMENT OF GOD’S ETERNAL ECONOMY</h2><p>We have seen that the Old Testament is a figurative portrait of God’s eternal economy. The New Testament is the practical fulfillment of God’s eternal economy. The Old Testament is a portrait, and the New Testament is a fulfillment. A portrait is a picture, a photo. People may say that they have seen someone on a videotape, but actually they have not seen that person. They have seen his photo, his portrait. Later they may be glad to see the real person whom they saw on the video. The Old Testament is like a video. The New Testament is the real thing. It is not a portrait, but a fulfillment. The person in the fulfillment is exactly the same as his photo. There are twenty-seven books in the New Testament in three sections: the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles. The Gospels are of four books; the Acts is one book; and the Epistles are of twenty-two books.
