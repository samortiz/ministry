   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE PROPER ATTITUDE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THOSE WHO ARE BEING WORKED ON</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Mary had a proper attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>There are at least four aspects to a proper attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>1 She was at the feet of the Lord Jesus, and not at the feet of anyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>She was drawing near to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is the shortest and quickest way to grow in life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No method is better than coming to Him moment by moment, loving Him, worshipping Him, and unceasingly fellowshipping with Him and remaining in His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Many who know God in a deep way have found this way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Madam Guyon said, "Our drawing near to God constitutes all service."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Paul also charged us to pray unceasingly 1 Thes 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If a man unceasingly fellowships with the indwelling Christ with an unveiled face, he will be changed into the Lord's likeness 2 Cor 3:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>2 She sat at the feet of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that she put herself in a humble position.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Humility is a crucial condition for receiving God's blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God resists the proud and gives grace to the humble 1 Pet 5:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Humility is not belittling ourselves; humility is ignoring ourselves, negating ourselves, and considering ourselves as nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we draw near to God with deep humility, He will give grace to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>3 She was sitting down.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She was not busy like her sister.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Quietness is often the source of spiritual strength.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The greatest challenge man faces is being quiet before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>His eyes and thoughts often are distracted to the outside world.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Of all the members in the body, the eyes are the busiest, and of all the faculties in the soul, the mind is the busiest.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Those who are busy cannot receive revelation easily.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A wandering mind and vacillating thoughts are like restless waves on a lake; the lake will never be able to clearly reflect the flowers and trees on the shore.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If a man wants to have the Lord's image imprinted in him and to be transformed into the Lord's image, quietness is a necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>4 She was listening to the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The words that the Lord speaks are spirit and life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Through this word, the Lord dispenses Himself to men.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Her listening to the Lord's word afforded the Lord the opportunity to communicate Himself to her so that she would gain the Lord and become like Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She was continually receiving the Lord Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>She did not just hear words; she was meeting the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Brothers and sisters, it is a pity for anyone to just hear man's voice in a sermon and not meet the Christ behind the voice.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THOSE WHO CONVEY GOD'S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In conveying God's word to others, a servant of God has to take care of the following points:</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>1 He should speak in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>On the one hand, he should be in fear and trembling concerning himself.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the other hand, he should be strictly controlled, restricted, and directed by the indwelling Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Anything spiritual must be spoken in the Spirit; otherwise, it will make the listener feel extremely uncomfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Your inner sense the spiritual consciousness will tell you if the source is wrong, even though the words may be right.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There may be nothing wrong with the wording, but the condition of the speaker may be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When this happens, God will not seal His presence on the words.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A more descriptive way of putting it is to call this a jewel of gold in a swine's snout Prov 11:22 ; the two things do not match one another.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>2 He should not speak under an atmosphere dominated by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When others are jesting and there is an absence of any spiritual atmosphere whatsoever, one cannot speak.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is like putting an egg in a refrigerator; it is impossible to hatch an egg this way.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>3 He should dispense spiritual reality to others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>God's revelation always conveys spiritual things, which are as real as physical things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>A cup is an object, and a chair is an object; they are real things.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Spiritual things are just as real as physical objects.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They are not theories or philosophies.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In conveying the word, one should present real things to others.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>4 He should ask the Lord for suitable spiritual utterance to convey spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For example, in explaining self-analysis, Brother Lawrence said, "Self-analysis is the dying flicker left behind from self-love; it is the activity of self-love under the zealous mask of one's pursuit for perfection."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Self-analysis is an undesirable element in our spiritual experience; it is a kind of introspection.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Brother Lawrence explained this spiritual thing with a spiritual utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is what it means to interpret spiritual things with spiritual words 1 Cor 2:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>5 Spiritual things can only be understood by a spiritual man; a carnal man cannot understand them 1 Cor 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since there is nothing spiritual within the carnal man, he cannot understand them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The spiritual man has the real thing within him; therefore, he can understand.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Suppose you met a man who had never seen a watch before.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It would not matter how much you explained what a watch is like; he would not understand.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But if you showed him a watch and then told him what it was and what it was used for, he would understand.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, one must first see a thing before he can understand anything that is spoken concerning it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The same is true with spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>For example, the matter of regeneration is the first spiritual experience of a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many people have listened to sermons for years without being regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If you tell them about the experience of regeneration, it is like telling a naturally blind person about the light of the sun; he will not understand it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is because he does not have that very thing within him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is no wonder that he cannot understand.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Some people are indeed regenerated.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They have had the experience of regeneration, yet the gospel they received was not very complete.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>They do not know that they are regenerated and saved; they are still hoping to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>One needs to tell such people the truth of regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Since they have the fact of regeneration, they will understand it once they hear.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hence, those who convey God's word to others must first show them the real thing and then use suitable words to convey it to them so that the listener will receive not only the spiritual fact but also the spiritual knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The principle that applies to regeneration applies to every subsequent experience.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The more revelation a believer receives, the more his life grows.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If someone with spiritual utterance points out the revelation, that is, if he points out the very thing he has received, others will not only see, but also understand.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If a man preaches the word this way, the church will receive real edification.</S>
