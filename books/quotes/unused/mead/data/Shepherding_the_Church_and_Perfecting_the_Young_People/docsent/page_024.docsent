   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE NEED AND ARRANGEMENTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>FOR THE WORK ABROAD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The places abroad that need our help are Japan, South Korea, Hong Kong, Manila in the Philippines, Singapore, and Malaysia.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Malaysia is divided into two areas: the center of one area is Penang, and the center of the other area is Sarawak.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In addition, Thailand, mainly Bangkok, and Indonesia also need our help.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Altogether there are nine places, and every place needs co-workers to render them help.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We need a dozen brothers to take turns in bearing the work in these places.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A co-worker who goes abroad should fellowship with the other co-workers when he returns.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Through the fellowship it may be that when a co-worker returns, he visits the various local churches in Taiwan to supply the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Or he may remain in one large local church to serve there.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This arrangement of the co-workers spending time abroad will take care of the need by rendering a considerable amount of help.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Moreover, it will not have a negative effect on the work in Taiwan; rather, it will be beneficial.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The co-workers being away will give the local elders the opportunity to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I hope that all the co-workers will be perfected to go abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Taiwan has been the center of the work in Southeast Asia, but this does not mean that Taiwan controls the churches in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We must be clear that the work is regional, but the church is local.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Every local church should take care of its own administration; however, the work, being regional, has a center.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the early days we considered Taiwan as the Jerusalem, the center, of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The co-workers should go out from here to labor in other places.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>There are three kinds of work among the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The first kind of work is to serve in a local church, to help that church, by diligently training and perfecting the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The next kind of work is to go abroad and minister to, serve, the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The third kind of work is to visit local churches in Taiwan.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The co-workers who serve in this way can be likened to a mobile support unit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They can visit a local church if there is a need, and then they can visit another local church if there is a need.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The co-workers should spend their time to do these three kinds of work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Some co-workers may work only in a local church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Some co-workers may work in a local church and also set aside time to work abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Other co-workers will spend time laboring abroad and visiting the local churches in Taiwan that have a need.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only a few co-workers are needed in the third kind of work.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The co-workers who work in a local church should not replace the saints in their service; rather, they should work in coordination with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The co-workers should help the saints, lead the saints, and raise up the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As the co-workers become skilled, they will be able to go abroad and serve.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The nine places that we mentioned are open to the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They are willing to receive the help from the work.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The brothers in Indonesia sent an invitation, but they did not say that they need my help or ask me to spend time with them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>They wrote to me, saying, We would like to hand over the work in Indonesia completely to your ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All you need to do is to come and start the work, and later you can arrange for the co-workers to come.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We will accept whatever arrangement you make.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We would like to hand over this whole region to the work.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The brothers in Japan said the same, and the brothers in Hong Kong also said the same.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Hence, the need abroad is great.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But we cannot go immediately, because the churches in Taiwan are not ready to let the co-workers go.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We must take one step at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This fellowship is related to taking one step at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I hope that through this fellowship not only the co-workers but also the elders will understand our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although the elders are not directly involved in the work, the work and the churches are the one testimony; they are intimately related.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hence, the elders also need to know the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I hope that when the elders return to their respective localities, they will fellowship with the local saints so that the saints know the development and the line of the Lord s work.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is the Lord s mercy that every region in East Asia, except mainland China, is open to us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>THE CO-WORKERS ENDEAVORING TO LEARN</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>AND TO BE USEFUL TO THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Presently, we do not have many co-workers who can go abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The co-workers must endeavor to learn in the word and in the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The regions abroad are open to our work, so our sending the co-workers can be likened to sending our cargo.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>A co-worker s work concerns all of us, not just him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must not ruin the reputation of our cargo.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When the co-workers go abroad, they must do a better job than they do in Taiwan; they must be able to help the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We should gain the trust of the saints, and we should be useful to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All the local churches need our help, but we cannot meet the need by merely holding a two-week conference.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The churches also realize that this way is of no avail.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hence, they do not invite itinerant preachers.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The churches have learned the lesson and realize that giving a few messages might be of a little profit, but nothing is accomplished afterward.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>All the churches have entered into the stage of building.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Hence, we must be diligent and dedicated and do a thorough work.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The co-workers must be serious and learn, because the need abroad is great.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>When a co-worker is definitely manifested, we will be able to send him abroad to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, we should do this gradually and take one step at a time.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Presently, there are about a dozen co-workers who can go abroad.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Most of them will go for three months, and a few can go for six months.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I hope that the co-workers understand this need, pray for this, and fellowship with the elders in the local churches concerning this.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>THE EAST AND THE WEST RENDERING</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>HELP TO EACH OTHER</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The development of the work in the Western Hemisphere depends on the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We cannot send co-workers there.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Perhaps some American brothers can go to the Philippines or Indonesia.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, it should be their responsibility to go to Europe.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The door to Europe is open.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The brothers in America can also go to New Zealand.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>If the brothers in America are willing to migrate to New Zealand, the New Zealand government will cover the expenses of their travel and relocation and will even give them a plot of land with a loan for them to farm it.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is easy for Americans to migrate to New Zealand.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>New Zealand has rich soil, good climate, and bountiful produce but a small population; it needs to be developed.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>However, New Zealand welcomes Caucasians more than any other race.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The same applies to Australia.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>For this reason, the burden for New Zealand and Australia falls on the saints in America.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Some American brothers should migrate there.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Some saints have already moved to France.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The burden for Europe, New Zealand, and Australia rests mainly with the American saints.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The work in East Asia is enough to keep us busy.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Of course, this does not mean that the brothers in the East should not go to the West or that the brothers in the West should not come to the East.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It is good to exchange co-workers between the East and the West, because this is a kind of fellowship and help.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>As we advance spiritually, the brothers in the West can come to help us, and we can also go to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>The churches in the East and the West are advancing because we share the same life and the same leading.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>As we come to understand and know one another more and as we also grow in life, there will be more traffic between the East and the West.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Some co-workers in the East may go to the West, and some from the West may come to the East.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Our present situation, however, does not allow this, and besides, the need is not yet that great.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Hence, the co-workers here should use Taiwan as a base for their going to the places in East Asia for the spread of the work.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I believe that this will surely bring in the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>I hope you will not feel that this burden is too heavy.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We must be in one accord so that all the churches reap the benefit.</S>
