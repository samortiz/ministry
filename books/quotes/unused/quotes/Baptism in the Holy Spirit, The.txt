The inward aspect of the work of the Holy Spirit is seen very clearly in the Gospel of John, chapters seven and twenty
In these two chapters, the Holy Spirit is likened to drinking water , and breath , things which are vital to life
It tells how Christ came to be our life and our life supply: He came to be the bread of life and the water of life
In these four chapters, the main emphasis is the transition of the Lord from the flesh to the Spirit through death and resurrection
In Luke 24:49, the disciples were told to tarry in Jerusalem until they were 'clothed' with power from on high
Inwardly we need to drink of the Holy Spirit for life, and outwardly we need to be clothed with the Holy Spirit for authority
The inward aspect of life is for our inward experience, and the outward aspect of power is for our outward experience
After we have been baptized in the Spirit into one Body, we must drink of the Spirit that we may grow in life and be built up in the Body
In these two instances, Christ as the Head baptized the Jewish and Gentile parts of His Body in the Holy Spirit once and for all
The baptism in the Holy Spirit is uniquely one and was accomplished upon the Body of Christ more than nineteen hundred years ago
Many Christians and even many Christian teachers confuse the outward baptism in the Holy Spirit with the inward filling of the Holy Spirit
The baptism of the whole Body of Christ in the Holy Spirit is something which is already accomplished and still exists
It is not to be accomplished in the future or even in the present, but it has already been accomplished and still exists
If we would believe in Him, we need not ask Him to die again for us, because His redeeming death has already been accomplished
The incarnation, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension of Christ are all accomplished facts, as well as His descension in the Spirit
Now this wonderful Christ-who was incarnated, crucified, and resurrected-ascended to the heavens and was there enthroned
Everything was finished and accomplished; so He descended in the Spirit to clothe His Body as authority and power
Christ, the Giver of the will, not only has died to make the will good, but as the resurrected Christ, He is also the Executor of the will
Because in this Will we are told, as one of the items, that He has already died and all our sins were laid upon Him
We can be saved immediately by simply taking what the Lord has already accomplished and itemized in the Will of God
The baptism in the Holy Spirit has not only been accomplished, but it has been passed on to us through the Will
Some Christians always insist that speaking in tongues is a necessary manifestation of the baptism in the Holy Spirit
With two of the five cases in Acts-the Samaritans and Saul of Tarsus-nothing is mentioned about speaking in tongues
Students of the Scripture admit that many times what God does not mention is more meaningful than what He does mention
Acts 19:6 states, 'And when Paul had laid his hands upon them the Holy Spirit came on them: and they spake with tongues, and prophesied'
There have been many powerful and deeply spiritual persons over the centuries who have never spoken in tongues
To insist that all must speak in tongues is unscriptural, but to say that speaking in tongues is dispensationally over is also wrong
It is not in 1 and 2 Thessalonians, 1 and 2 Timothy, Titus, Philemon, Hebrews, James, 1 and 2 Peter, 1, 2, and 3 John, Jude, or Revelation
Christ crucified is God's power and wisdom, and God has made Him wisdom to us: both righteousness, and sanctification, and redemption
In chapter fourteen, Paul encourages us to seek the gifts which are most profitable for the building up of the church
If we read the entire book, we see that the matter of tongues is not touched in a positive way, but rather the contrary
It is an item of the Testament, the Will given to us all, and we are all entitled to it as members of the Body
Any sin, anything wrong between us and God, must be thoroughly dealt with through the cleansing of the blood of Christ
A real identification and proper relationship with the Body are necessary for the experience of the baptism in the Holy Spirit
The Will also tells us that the baptism in the Holy Spirit is accomplished upon the Body of Christ and waiting to be taken
The third chapter of Hebrews tells how the children of Israel tested and proved the Lord in the wilderness because of their unbelief
Before their martyrdom, they may not have been so concerned with the baptism in the Holy Spirit, but they loved the Lord
