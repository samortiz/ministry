   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Veil</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A person could enter the outer court by passing through the linen hangings of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In order to go from the Holy Place into the Holy of Holies, it was necessary to pass through a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The outer boundary of the tabernacle consisted of linen hangings, and within the tabernacle was a veil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The linen hangings formed a separating line, and the veil within also formed a separating line.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Even though the tabernacle was divided into three sections, there was only one separating line within the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>While there was a distinction between the Holy Place and the outer court, they were connected.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The distinction between the Holy Place and the outer court was not absolute.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There was a distinction but not a division between them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The separation between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies, however, was quite different.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There was not merely a distinction but a division, a complete separation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Strictly speaking, the tabernacle was divided into three sections with one separating line, the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If a person in the church wants to progress from being an outward Christian to being an inward Christian, he must pass through the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>An outward Christian is typified by one who is either in the outer court or in the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It does not matter if, according to the type, he is offering sacrifices, washing his hands and feet, putting the bread of the Presence on the table, lighting the lamps, or offering incense at the incense altar; in all these matters he is an outward Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is within the boundary of the fine white linen hangings, yet he is not within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>He has passed the separating boundary between the world and the church, but he has not passed through the separating line of the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He has entered into the outer court and even into the Holy Place, but he has not entered into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hebrews 10:20 says, The veil, that is, His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the flesh that is spoken of in John 1:14.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to the human understanding, flesh is not positive.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, when the Lord became a man, He actually became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He was exactly the same as us in outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The serpent that was lifted up on the pole was exactly the same in appearance as the serpents that bit the people Num 21:4-9 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord came to be a man by becoming flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The veil in Hebrews 10 is His flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, flesh denotes fallen human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The veil signifies our flesh, and thus it also signifies us as fallen human beings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord Jesus was sinless, but He came in the likeness of the flesh of sin on our behalf Rom 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Lord Jesus Himself never fell and was without sin, but we, His redeemed ones, are fallen and sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He was not fleshly, but we are fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The separating line in this verse is our fallen being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The separation between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies is the veil, the fallen man, the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This separation is not the same as the white linen hanging along the outer boundary of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The separation of white linen is a matter of making a distinction between righteousness and unrighteousness, cleanliness and filthiness, darkness and light, and fineness and coarseness.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, the main emphasis in regard to the veil is whether it has been rent and whether the man of the flesh has been cleft.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not understand Hebrews 10 in a manner that is too objective.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While the rent veil signifies the Lord Jesus being cleft on the cross and eliminating the barrier between God and man, this view is still objective.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We must check with ourselves: He has been cleft, but how about us?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord was cleft on the cross, but have we been cleft?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that there is still a veil between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In fact, we ourselves are the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We may have been saved and bear an expression that is clean and fine; nevertheless, the veil of our flesh may still be whole and not rent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The veil is not a matter of being good or evil or of being sinful and worldly; rather, it is something that must be rent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The veil separating the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies was not something evil.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was not a matter of good or evil.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This veil, typifying the flesh of Christ, had to be rent so that the separation between God and man could be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Ephesians 2:14 says that He has broken down the middle wall of partition.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This wall of partition refers to the wall between the Jews and the Gentiles; it has been broken down by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If we read the context of this verse, we will see that the wall of partition refers to the law of the commandments in ordinances vv.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The ordinances in the law say that Jews cannot have any dealings with Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>However, this wall of partition between the Jews and the Gentiles has been abolished by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The base of the wall is man s flesh v. 15 . The law is a wall, and the flesh is the base of the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The wall of the law is built upon the base of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Without a base, there cannot be a wall; hence, if there were no flesh, the problem of the law would not exist.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The cross has already abolished the base of the law, which is the flesh; therefore, the wall, which is the law, has spontaneously been eliminated.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Today in our experience the wall of partition between us and God has not been broken down, and so the wall of partition between us and other people remains.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is not a matter of sin or the world but a matter of our self.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The brothers and sisters who live in the workers homes share a room with two or three other people.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Outwardly speaking, they may not have any opinions or differences and consequently do not quarrel, but inwardly there is a wall of partition, hindering them from having a thorough fellowship and a deeper knowledge of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This indicates that we ourselves are the veil between ourselves and God and between ourselves and the other saints.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Neither sin nor the world separate us from God; we are the separation.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The reason that we are not able to have thorough fellowship with the brothers and sisters and thus a deeper knowledge of them is because of who we are in our very being.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We are the veil, the wall of partition.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The separation of the linen hangings is a matter related to whether or not our behavior is clean and white.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The separating line between the church and the worldly people indicates that the latter is filthy, but the church is clean and white.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is a matter of righteousness versus unrighteousness, which is related to behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Righteousness is God s action.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>This is the first line of separation.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The separation of the veil, the second separation, however, is not related to behavior but to nature.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In scriptural terms, it requires the rending.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Once the veil is rent, man is able to pass to the other side of the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If the veil is not rent, man remains outside the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The linen hangings are a matter of being righteous or unrighteous; the veil is a matter of being holy or unholy.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Holiness is the nature of God, that is, God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Righteousness is a matter of behavior, but holiness is a matter of nature.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Righteousness is related to God s hand, and love is related to God s heart; holiness is simply God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The line separating the church from the world is the righteousness of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The world is unrighteous and filthy; however, the church is righteous, clean, and white.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This refers to living and behavior, and it is not related to the inward nature.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We may not watch movies, go dancing, or enjoy leisure like worldly people, and we may not have worldly hobbies, much less blatant sins.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Nevertheless, we may still live in our self.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In the eyes of the worldly people, we are clean, and white.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We cannot deny that this is the result of the work of the Spirit of God within us; nevertheless, we remain whole.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We have passed through the first separating line, but there is another separation that keeps us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This separation is neither the world nor sin; rather, it is our self.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We are not a corrupted or defiled person but a redeemed and sweet person.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Nevertheless, even a redeemed and sweet person can be separated from God.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Although the veil signifies the flesh that the Lord Jesus put on, it was not made of goats hair.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>It was exactly the same as the first layer of the covering of the tabernacle; it was made of blue, purple, and scarlet strands and fine twined linen with embroidered cherubim Exo 36:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The rending of this veil indicates that a good man, a man with the glory of God, was broken and cleft.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If the veil had been made of goats hair, the material of the second layer of the covering, it would indicate that a fallen and corrupted sinner under God s condemnation had been cleft.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Those who have been saved by God are clean and white in the eyes of others.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We can even acknowledge that we are good men.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>However, what we are as good men still separates us from God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Consequently, the creature needs to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The creature that expresses God needs to be broken, not the fallen, sinning creature.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Cherubim, on one hand, signify God s glory and, on the other hand, signify God s creatures.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>The glory of God is upheld by creatures, the cherubim.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Even creatures such as the cherubim need to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>The creature that needs to be broken is not the sinful creature who loses his temper but rather the creature who expresses God.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The first half of Romans speaks of the matter of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Chapters 1 through 5 are related to behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>Chapter 1 records all kinds of filthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Romans 1 can be compared to a person clothed in a garment that was taken from a garbage dump, a person covered with filthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In chapter 3 the blood is introduced, and in chapter 4 man is justified.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In the first half of chapter 5, we see a person clothed in a clean, white garment without any defilement.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>He is able to stand before God and is in accordance with God s righteous law; he is able to stand before the great white throne and match the color of the throne.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>In chapter 5 the person is clean and white; he has been reconciled to God and has peace with God.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The matter of righteousness has been satisfied, and this forms a white boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Anyone who has gone from chapter 1 to chapter 5 is within the white boundary and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Anyone who stays in chapter 1 is outside of the white boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Roman 1 through 5 speaks of entering the first boundary of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The second half of Romans is on the matter of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Beginning in chapter 5, the focus is on our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>In chapter 8 there is the matter of being conformed to the image of His Son v. 29 . Before speaking of image, chapter 8 begins with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We should live in the spirit, not in ourselves or in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>This is a matter related to a change of nature, not behavior.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>The matter of behavior was dealt with prior to 5:12.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Now our nature needs to be dealt with and changed.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>This means that merely changing a garment is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We musthave a change in the inward source.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>We need an inward change from the flesh to the spirit and from man to God.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>In the second half of chapter 8, the matter of image is mentioned.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>A person may have clean, white behavior but still be void of the image of God.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Hence, it is not merely a matter of being clean and white but of having the likeness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Does our cleanness come from ourselves or does it come from God living in us?</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>There is a great difference.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Then in chapter 12 the Body is presented, not as a matter of behavior but as a matter of enlargement.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>It is Christ being enlarged in us.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Our behavior cannot produce the church; only the enlargement of Christ can produce the church.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Whether or not the church is righteous is related merely to how the worldly people see the church; it is not directly related to God s dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>In other words, God s dwelling is not directly inside the hangings of fine white linen.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>The hangings are merely a separating line.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>Only in the Holy of Holies is there a dwelling place where God and man can be joined together.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>The white linen hangings are related to the matter of behavior; however, the separation between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies is related to the matter of nature, which is related to our union with God and the presence of God.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>The reason that the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies are holy is that the presence of God is there.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>If we want to enter into God, into His presence, we as the veil must be rent.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>This veil does not refer to things or matters outside of us; it refers only to our created and redeemed being.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>We, the created and redeemed people, are a veil, which must be rent.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>This rending enables us to know God s presence, to be joined to God as one.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>This rending enables us to be in God s holiness, in God Himself, instead of merely being in the realm of God s righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>This is a radical separation.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Sadly, there are too few in the church who are this kind of person and who pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>Many pay attention to the first separating line, but hardly anyone pays attention to the second separation.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Not only are there few who pay attention to this matter, but there is also little light regarding this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Many messages have been released related to the first separating line at the white linen hangings, but very few people speak concerning the veil, the second separating line.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>We are the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>We are a separation.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>We refers to those who are created and redeemed, not to those who are fallen and not redeemed.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>We, the created and redeemed ones, are the veil between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>We may be good, but we are still outside of God s countenance; we may be good, but we are still apart from God; we may be good, but we still have not been mingled with God.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>We are the veil, and this veil needs to be rent.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>Although this kind of person is rare in the church, some are like this.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>If we look at the ratio of the size of the sections in the tabernacle, we will realize that the outer court was quite large.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>More people were able to fit there.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>Also, the Holy Place was twice the size of the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='159' RSNT='1' SNO='159'>The Holy Place was twenty square cubits, and the Holy of Holies was ten square cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='160' RSNT='1' SNO='160'>Twenty square cubits equals ten square cubits multiplied by two.</S>
   <S PAR='161' RSNT='1' SNO='161'>This means that there are few in the Holy of Holies, more in the Holy Place, and many more in the outer court.</S>
   <S PAR='162' RSNT='1' SNO='162'>Those in the Holy of Holies have been broken in their natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='163' RSNT='1' SNO='163'>They have been broken before God.</S>
   <S PAR='164' RSNT='1' SNO='164'>There are few such persons in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='165' RSNT='1' SNO='165'>However, this group of people can touch God s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='166' RSNT='1' SNO='166'>The Old Testament shows that all the actions in the Holy Place and all the activities in the outer court were governed by the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='167' RSNT='1' SNO='167'>When the condition of the Holy of Holies was proper, the actions in the Holy Place and the activities in the outer court were also proper.</S>
   <S PAR='168' RSNT='1' SNO='168'>Whenever the condition of the Holy of Holies was even slightly off, the condition of the Holy Place and the outer court were also affected.</S>
   <S PAR='169' RSNT='1' SNO='169'>It is the same in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='170' RSNT='1' SNO='170'>If even one of us or a few among us are in the Holy of Holies, our outward activities will be proper; however, if none of us enter into the Holy of Holies, the condition of the Holy of Holies will be poor, and all our outward activities will have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='171' RSNT='1' SNO='171'>All the activities in the outer court were governed by the Holy Place, and all the actions in the Holy Place were governed by the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='172' RSNT='1' SNO='172'>If there is hardly anyone in the church living in the Holy of Holies, the outward activities of the church will have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='173' RSNT='1' SNO='173'>The activities of the church depend upon the condition of those who are in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='174' RSNT='1' SNO='174'>If there are some in this condition, the outward activities will be proper; otherwise, the outward activities will be improper.</S>
   <S PAR='175' RSNT='1' SNO='175'>The Holy of Holies is the kernel, the center of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='176' RSNT='1' SNO='176'>A peach has a stone, or pit, and within the pit is a kernel.</S>
   <S PAR='177' RSNT='1' SNO='177'>The life of the peach is contained in the kernel.</S>
   <S PAR='178' RSNT='1' SNO='178'>In the same way, the life of the church is contained in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='179' RSNT='1' SNO='179'>If no one lives within the Holy of Holies in the church, the life of the church and the outward activities of the church will have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='180' RSNT='1' SNO='180'>In order to enter into the Holy of Holies, a person must pass through two separating lines.</S>
   <S PAR='181' RSNT='1' SNO='181'>If he passes through only the first line, he is still an outward person.</S>
   <S PAR='182' RSNT='1' SNO='182'>He can be considered to be an inward person, an inward Christian, only after passing through the second line.</S>
   <S PAR='183' RSNT='1' SNO='183'>To enter from the outer court into the Holy of Holies requires that we pass through the Holy Place.</S>
   <S PAR='184' RSNT='1' SNO='184'>The Holy Place is not inward, because the items in it are apparent and visible; hence, they are still outward.</S>
   <S PAR='185' RSNT='1' SNO='185'>It is only when we enter into the Holy of Holies that all the items become hidden and invisible; this is something deep and inward.</S>
   <S PAR='186' RSNT='1' SNO='186'>Thus, there are two separating lines.</S>
   <S PAR='187' RSNT='1' SNO='187'>There is also a separating line between the Holy Place and the outer court, but it is not of vital importance.</S>
   <S PAR='188' RSNT='1' SNO='188'>Although there is a difference between the Holy Place and the outer court, the difference is not that great.</S>
   <S PAR='189' RSNT='1' SNO='189'>However, between the Holy Place and the Holy of Holies there is a strict, impenetrable separation, the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='190' RSNT='1' SNO='190'>A person may never have seen that Christ is his life and thus may remain in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='191' RSNT='1' SNO='191'>However, another person may have seen that Christ is his life and may also remain in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='192' RSNT='1' SNO='192'>One person, who remains in himself, may think that it is boring and tasteless to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='193' RSNT='1' SNO='193'>However, another person, who remains in himself, may pray livingly and strongly.</S>
   <S PAR='194' RSNT='1' SNO='194'>This is because he has not passed from outside the veil to within the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='195' RSNT='1' SNO='195'>His being forms a separation that has not been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='196' RSNT='1' SNO='196'>His separation is nothing other than himself.</S>
   <S PAR='197' RSNT='1' SNO='197'>Those who enter through the fine white linen hangings are in the tabernacle and have been separated from those outside of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='198' RSNT='1' SNO='198'>Within the tabernacle, however, there is another separating line the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='199' RSNT='1' SNO='199'>Only those within the veil live in God.</S>
   <S PAR='200' RSNT='1' SNO='200'>Everyone in the church should bear an expression of fine white linen and be inside the white hangings made of fine twined linen.</S>
   <S PAR='201' RSNT='1' SNO='201'>Among these people, however, some are within the veil, and others remain outside.</S>
   <S PAR='202' RSNT='1' SNO='202'>Those outside the veil are great in number, and those within the veil are small in number.</S>
   <S PAR='203' RSNT='1' SNO='203'>Turning from being an unbeliever to being a believer is to pass through the separating line of the fine white linen hangings; turning from the outer man to the inner man is to pass through the separation of the veil.</S>
   <S PAR='204' RSNT='1' SNO='204'>The purpose of our studying these types is to be deeply impressed with a picture.</S>
   <S PAR='205' RSNT='1' SNO='205'>Our intention is not merely to expound the Bible; instead, we look to the Lord that He would open our eyes to see the church and the spiritual boundaries in the church so that we may advance.</S>
   <S PAR='206' RSNT='1' SNO='206'>May the Lord have mercy on us that some among us would enter into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='207' RSNT='1' SNO='207'>In this matter we cannot help one another.</S>
   <S PAR='208' RSNT='1' SNO='208'>No one except God can bring us into the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='209' RSNT='1' SNO='209'>The veil was not rent by itself or by others.</S>
   <S PAR='210' RSNT='1' SNO='210'>We need to see that the veil was split in two from top to bottom, indicating that it was split by God Matt 27:51 .</S>
   <S PAR='211' RSNT='1' SNO='211'>We have no way to break one another.</S>
   <S PAR='212' RSNT='1' SNO='212'>The more we try to break each other, the harder we will become.</S>
   <S PAR='213' RSNT='1' SNO='213'>Often when we try to deal with a certain brother, he only becomes stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='214' RSNT='1' SNO='214'>We have no way to make other people spiritual, and they have no way to make us spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='215' RSNT='1' SNO='215'>Only God can do this.</S>
   <S PAR='216' RSNT='1' SNO='216'>One day God will come to tear us down, just as He did with Job Job was the best veil.</S>
   <S PAR='217' RSNT='1' SNO='217'>The veil was made of fine white linen with a heavenly color and the condition of being redeemed, royal, and noble.</S>
   <S PAR='218' RSNT='1' SNO='218'>Job was such a person.</S>
   <S PAR='219' RSNT='1' SNO='219'>One day, however, God came to split this veil in two.</S>
   <S PAR='220' RSNT='1' SNO='220'>After God accomplished this, Job was able to say, I had heard of You by the hearing of the ear, / But now my eye has seen You Job 42:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='221' RSNT='1' SNO='221'>This is when Job entered into the Holy of Holies to see God and to enjoy His presence.</S>
   <S PAR='222' RSNT='1' SNO='222'>This was God s act, and no one could render any help.</S>
   <S PAR='223' RSNT='1' SNO='223'>The Lord will do such a work in us for the sake of His church.</S>
   <S PAR='224' RSNT='1' SNO='224'>Our responsibility is to allow Him to do His work.</S>
   <S PAR='225' RSNT='1' SNO='225'>God s rending work can be done only in a person like Job God will not do such a work in those who do not love Him, in those who love the world and act wildly.</S>
   <S PAR='226' RSNT='1' SNO='226'>God does a rending work only in those like Job We must see that the number of people among us who enter the Holy of Holies is the number of those who have been rent.</S>
   <S PAR='227' RSNT='1' SNO='227'>The life and the activities of the church depend entirely upon this.</S>
   <S PAR='228' RSNT='1' SNO='228'>If some are in the Holy of Holies, the outward activities will be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='229' RSNT='1' SNO='229'>But if some are not in the Holy of Holies, then the outward activities will have problems.</S>
   <S PAR='230' RSNT='1' SNO='230'>Though the tabernacle presents a clear picture of the church, we do not claim that we have seen it thoroughly.</S>
   <S PAR='231' RSNT='1' SNO='231'>We simply walk about Zion and go around her, counting her towers Psa 48:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='232' RSNT='1' SNO='232'>I believe that the Holy Spirit will grant us more light that we may clearly see the church.</S>
   <S PAR='233' RSNT='1' SNO='233'>When we advance and grow in life, the light will follow and shine upon us.</S>
