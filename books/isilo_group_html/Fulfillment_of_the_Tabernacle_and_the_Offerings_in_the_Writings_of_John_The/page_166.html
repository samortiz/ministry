The Son came through incarnation, but the Spirit comes through the Son&#8217;s death and resurrection.<h2 class=head3>Receiving All That Is of the Son to Disclose It to the Believers</h2><p>The Spirit of reality receives all that is of the Son in order to disclose it to the believers. Regarding this, the Lord Jesus says, &#8220;He shall glorify Me, for He shall receive of Mine and shall disclose it to you. All that the Father has is Mine; therefore I said that He receives of Mine and shall disclose it to you&#8221; (John 16:14-15). All that the Father is and has is embodied in the Son (Col. 2:9), and all that the Son is and has is revealed as reality to the believers through the Spirit. Therefore, the Spirit of reality reveals to the believers all that the Son is. This means that our understanding of the Son is by the Spirit, who has received whatever the Son is and then reveals this to us.<h2 class=head3>To Testify concerning the Son and to Glorify Him</h2><p>We have already pointed out that the Spirit testifies concerning the Son and glorifies Him (John 15:26; 16:14). Now we would point out that, in particular, this is a function of the Spirit of reality, who comes through the Son&#8217;s death and resurrection. Because the Spirit of reality testifies concerning the Son and glorifies the Son, we know the Son through Him.<h2 class=head3>To Guide the Believers into All the Reality</h2><p>In John 16:13 we see that the Spirit of reality guides us into all the reality: &#8220;But when He, the Spirit of reality, comes, He will guide you into all the reality; for He will not speak from Himself, but whatever He hears He will speak; and He will disclose to you what is to come.&#8221; The Spirit of reality guides the believers into all the reality of the Triune God and of all divine matters. The Spirit of reality guides us into the reality of justification, holiness, love, and all other divine things. He leads us into, brings us into, the reality of these things.<h2 class=head3>To Convict the World concerning Sin, Righteousness, and Judgment</h2><p>John 16:8-11 reveals that the Spirit of reality convicts the world concerning sin, righteousness, and judgment: &#8220;And having come, He will convict the world concerning sin, and concerning righteousness, and concerning judgment: concerning sin, because they do not believe in Me; and concerning righteousness, because I go to the Father and you no longer behold Me; and concerning judgment, because the ruler of this world has been judged.&#8221; The Spirit always convicts the world, that is, mankind, concerning the three matters of sin, righteousness, and judgment. Sin entered through Adam (Rom. 5:12), righteousness is the resurrected Christ (1 Cor. 1:30), and judgment is for Satan, who is the author and source of sin (John 8:44). We were born of sin in Adam. To be freed from sin, the only way is to believe in Christ the Son of God. If we believe in Him, He will be righteousness to us, and we shall be justified in Him (Rom. 3:24; 4:25). If we do not repent of the sin in Adam and believe in Christ the Son of God, we shall remain in sin and share the judgment of Satan for eternity (Matt. 25:41).<p>In 16:8-11, the convicting work of the Spirit is related to three persons: Adam, Christ, and Satan. We all became fallen in Adam. But we may believe in Christ and be justified. Because Christ was accepted by God in His death, God raised Him up from among the dead, and now He becomes righteousness to all who believe in Him. Satan, the source of sin, has been judged and destroyed through Christ&#8217;s death (Heb. 2:14). The three main items in these three verses are related to these three persons: sin is related to Adam, righteousness is related to Christ, and judgment is related to Satan. We were born of Adam, but we have believed in Christ and have received Him as our righteousness. All those who do not believe in Christ will suffer the judgment of Satan. Because they remain followers of Satan, they will have the same destiny as Satan. Hallelujah, we have believed in Christ, and we have been transferred out of Adam and into Christ! No longer are we followers of Satan, and our destiny certainly will not be the same as his.<p>The Spirit came to us to convict us of sin, righteousness, and judgment. We repented, believed in the Lord Jesus, and escaped the judgment that is upon Satan. We also became children of God and members of Christ. Now we can be filled and saturated with the Triune God, who is dispensing Himself into us and mingling Himself with us.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_165.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_167.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Fulfillment of the Tabernacle and the Offerings in the Writings of John &nbsp; pg 166</div><br></body></html>
