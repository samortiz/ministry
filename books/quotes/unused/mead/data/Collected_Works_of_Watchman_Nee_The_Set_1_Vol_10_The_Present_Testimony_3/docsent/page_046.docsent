   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TWO SIDES OF THE TRUTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SUBJECTIVE AND OBJECTIVE Notes from a Meeting Held in 1932 Issue No. 29 Scripture Reading: John 3:16; 14:16; 15:4-5; 14:17; 6:47; 4:14; 1 John 2:8; Phil 1:20-21; 1 Cor 1:30; Col 1:27</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We often speak about the matter of subjective truth and objective truth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All the truths in the New Testament are divided into these two categories, and similarly all the Old Testament truths are divided into these two categories.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To make this matter clear to many of you, I would first like to explain the meaning of the words objective and subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The literal meanings of the Chinese words for objective and subjective are "guest's view" and "host's view."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Being objective is viewing things from the position of a guest or an outsider, and being subjective is viewing things from one's self as a host.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Viewing things from the position of an outsider is being objective, and viewing things from within is being subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whatever occurs in others is objective; whatever occurs in me is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>All the truths that are not in me are objective truths; all the truths that are inside of me are subjective truths.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the truths outside of me are objective truths; they are truths, even though they are outside of me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the experiences within me are subjective and are also truths.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible places equal weight on both aspects of these truths.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I would now like to give you some illustrations.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>John 3:16 says, "For God so loved the world that He gave His only begotten Son."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>John 14:16 says, "And I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is sad that many who can recite John 3:16 so well cannot recite John 14:16.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Actually these two verses are of equal worth.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God had two "givings."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In John 3:16 He gave His Son to us, and in John 14:16 He gave the Holy Spirit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God gave His Son to sinners, and He gave the Holy Spirit to the ones who believe in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God gave His Son to the world that they may be saved through Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God gave the Holy Spirit to those who believe in His Son that they may be empowered to overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>One is the giving of the Son, and the other is the giving of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Everything accomplished in the Son is an objective truth, and everything done in us through the working of the Holy Spirit is a subjective truth.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Everything that is done in Christ is objective, while everything that is done in us through the Holy Spirit is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When the Lord was crucified on the cross, we were crucified there with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is an objective fact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we search within ourselves to see whether we have died, we surely will not feel that we have died.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Likewise, if we preach the gospel to a sinner, telling him that he is a sinner and Christ has died for him, will he realize he has died with Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>No matter that is in Christ is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everything in Christ is objective, and all the work done by the Holy Spirit in us is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Holy Spirit does not work in Himself; all the work of the Holy Spirit is done within us.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>What Christ has accomplished is in Himself, and what the Holy Spirit has accomplished is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>As long as something or some work is done in Christ, it is objective; as long as something is accomplished by the Holy Spirit, it is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Please remember this point: objective matters are in Christ, and subjective matters are within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In John 15:4 the Lord repeated the phrase abide in Me twice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>What is it to "abide in Me"?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It is just to abide in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Abiding in the Lord is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We must first have the objective aspect before we can have the experience of "I abide in you," which is the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must remember that the words "I abide in you" are preceded by the words "Abide in Me."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Every subjective experience is based on an objective fact.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>No one could ever be saved if there was just the working of the Holy Spirit without the accomplishment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Neither could people be saved by only having the accomplishment of Christ without the working of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>As I have said before, a man must have two feet to stand firm and two eyes to see clearly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Birds must have two wings to fly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Similarly, we must first be in the Lord, and then He will be in us.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>John 6:47 says, "He who believes has eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Every believer knows this verse.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is true that we have believed, and it is true that he who believes has eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, no one can locate the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What does John 4:14 tell us?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It says, "But whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The water that He will give us is the water of life, and it will well up from within again and again until we sense its flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>On the one hand, the Lord talks about the eternal life, and on the other hand, He talks about a well of living water springing up which enables us to taste the flavor of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>John 6:47 speaks of the objective aspect, and John 4:14 speaks of the subjective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>First John 2:8 says, "...which is true in Him and in you."</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Some of the truths are in Him, and some of the truths are in us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They are all truths, and we should pay attention to all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>John 15 tells us how to bear fruit: "He who abides in Me and I in him, he bears much fruit" v. 5 . In other words, whenever the objective truth is balanced by the subjective truth, there will be much fruit-bearing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>John 14:17 says, "The Spirit of reality...because He abides with you and shall be in you."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He abides with you is objective.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This phrase points out the fact that the Holy Spirit through Christ was with the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The phrase shall be in you is subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>It points to the fact of Christ dwelling in the disciples through the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>At one time this word was objective and outside of them, but once the Holy Spirit came and dwelt in them, the objective facts became their subjective experience.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>On one hand, Paul in 1 Corinthians 1:30 said, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>On the other hand, in Colossians 1:27 Paul said, "Christ in you, the hope of glory."</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>To be in Christ is the objective aspect, and to have Christ in us is the subjective aspect.</S>
