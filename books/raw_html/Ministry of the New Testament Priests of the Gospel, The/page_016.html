<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FIVE</h1><h1 class=msg>THE REQUIREMENTS FOR THE MINISTRY OF THE NEW TESTAMENT PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Prov. 4:18; 2 Cor. 4:16; Gal. 5:25; Rom. 8:4; Phil. 2:14; Gal. 5:26; 1 Cor. 1:10; Eph. 4:14; 1 Tim. 1:3-4; Matt. 26:41; Rom. 12:11; Col. 1:29; 1 Cor. 15:58; Phil. 3:20; 2 Cor. 5:10</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Being revived every morning—Prov. 4:18.</li><li>Overcoming every day—2 Cor. 4:16.</li><li>Living in the Spirit every moment—Gal. 5:25.</li><li>Walking according to the spirit in everything—Rom. 8:4:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Without murmurings and reasonings—Phil. 2:14.</li>	<li>Without selfish intentions and greedy ambitions—Gal. 5:26.</li>	</ol></li><li>Being in one accord and in harmony with the saints—1 Cor. 1:10.</li><li>Not being blown by the winds of teaching—Eph. 4:14.</li><li>Not teaching anything different from the truth concerning the New Testament priesthood of the gospel of God—1 Tim. 1:3-4.</li><li>Watching prayerfully, laboring diligently, and struggling earnestly to carry out each step of the duties of the New Testament priests of the gospel of God—Matt. 26:41; Rom. 12:11; Col. 1:29; 1 Cor. 15:58.</li><li>Awaiting the Lord’s coming by living and working in the light of His judgment seat—Phil. 3:20; 2 Cor. 5:10.</li></ol><p>In the past few messages we have seen that the New Testament priests of the gospel of God should do the following four main things: first, go out to preach the gospel to save sinners; second, nourish and care for the new believers; third, teach and perfect the saints; and fourth, prophesy for the building up of the church. These matters, especially the last two, are very much involved with the aspect of practice. How should we ask and answer questions in the group meetings? How should we learn? How should we teach? Furthermore, prophesying in the meetings is a particularly new matter. How can we change our meetings from one person speaking and everyone else listening to all speaking and listening mutually? We all want to learn these matters.
