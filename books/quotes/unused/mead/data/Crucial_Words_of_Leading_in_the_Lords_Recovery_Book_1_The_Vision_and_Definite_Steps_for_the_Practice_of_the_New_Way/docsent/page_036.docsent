   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Preparing Life Messages</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The elders also need to study how to make the small groups attractive to people.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The most important thing is to spend much time in prayer and study.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can then arrange message after message from the ministry publications to lead the small groups in pursuing the truth, fellowshipping, and reading in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Even though the characteristic of the small group is dragging, you should have a life message to supply people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If the saints are not fully fed, they should at least be half fed; do not let them go home with an empty stomach.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Do not wait until the last minute to prepare such a message.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because some people are lazy in preparing dinner, they merely open a can of food or buy a loaf of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But we cannot do this in the small groups.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We must plan everything ahead of time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The small group meets only once a week.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should be well prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>There is not a lack of rich messages among us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Hence, whether a small group has a life supply depends on whether or not the serving ones are enlivened and prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Today we have the meeting place, the meeting ones, and the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The question is whether or not we are willing to labor.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Promoting merely by words does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Only when we carry it out earnestly will there be a result.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Way of Propagation</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In order to propagate the small groups, we need to subdivide the groups.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Once there are twelve people meeting in a small group, we must prepare to be subdivided into two groups.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Some may think that it has taken them awhile to reach this number and that once they divide, their group will be finished.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For this reason, they are not willing to be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At the beginning a group may seem weak after dividing, but gradually the group will be enlivened.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After a group of twelve is subdivided into two groups of about five to six people, gradually, each group will increase to twelve.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to remember that the small group is for the Lord s increase and not merely for our own enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>THE IMPORTANCE OF THE ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The practice of the new way requires our coordination in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Having the same goal, we can study the definite steps to practice.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we merely talk or sit on the fence without any progress, we will waste our time.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We will not gain anything, the church will not gain anything, and the Lord will not gain anything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Our goal is to gospelize Taiwan in five years.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One and a half years have already passed, and the remaining three and a half years will pass by quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I hope that we all can see this goal clearly and share this burden.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A FURTHER WORD ON TEACHING TRUTH LESSONS</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the previous chapter I pointed out that the key to teaching Truth Lessons is not to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Now I repeat: we should not try to expound Truth Lessons; we should simply teach them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Take mathematics as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The principle of addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division can only be taught, not explained.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>One plus one is two; one plus two is three.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This can only be taught but not explained.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The content of Truth Lessons is very solid, and some lessons may require two sessions.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Some lessons may be very difficult.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we try to expound these lessons, we may not be able to finish them in several years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hence, do not explain.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Simply teach the saints to read livingly, to read with repetition, to read with emphasis, and to pray-read.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may not understand what we read at the beginning, but later we will understand.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This can be compared to the ancient Chinese teachers teaching the Three-character Classic.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the beginning, the students recited the book, and no explanation was given to them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Later, they gradually received an understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In order to enter into the truths of the Bible, we first must recite them.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As our growth in life reaches a certain degree, we will spontaneously understand the meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, the purpose of Truth Lessons is to show the saints that there are certain truths in the Bible that we should know.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As we reach a certain degree in our growth in life, we will spontaneously receive understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>For example, in Taiwan we have intercollegiate entrance examinations.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The content of the examination is not what the teachers have explained but what is written in the teaching materials.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>A good teacher must be able to teach and convey everything that is in the teaching materials to the students.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In this way, the students will know how to answer the test questions.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>I hope that the whole church can teach Truth Lessons and impart the truths into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Perhaps we also need an examination with rewards in order to encourage the saints to study diligently.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In this way, even if a famous professor has his own way of teaching, we still must teach based on the teaching material.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This way is worth practicing.</S>
