There are two great mysteries in the Bible, one is the Triune God-the Father, Son, and Spirit, and the other is the Person of Christ
The Gospel of John refutes them at its very beginning by declaring that Christ is the Word and that He is God who became flesh
They said that Christ's divinity is incomplete and that He came into being through the union of the Logos and the human body
He further affirmed that because Christ died without sin, He could be resurrected, ascend to the heavens, and thus become God
The Scripture says that Christ is the very God who exists from the beginning and who is self-existent and without beginning
The Arians said that there was a time when Christ did not exist and that He became God only after His resurrection and ascension
In summary, they totally denied Christ's uncreated divinity and were too dogmatic concerning the time of Christ's becoming a created one
The Scripture clearly reveals to us that Christ is a man complete with spirit, soul, and body and that He possesses perfect humanity as well
In the Old Testament, the Bible shows that the meal offering which typifies Christ consists of oil mingled with fine flour
Although oil and fine flour are mingled into one, they are still two in nature-they are not merged into one to become a third nature

He was born in the flesh as a child, yet He is the 'Mighty God'; He came into time as a son; yet, He is the Father in eternity
Isaiah 11:10 says, 'And in that day there shall be a root of Jesse, which shall stand for an ensign of the people
Based upon Matthew 3:3 which quotes the word 'the voice of him that crieth,' we understand this passage here in Isaiah 40 refers to Christ
He is the God of God's people, when He comes, it is the Lord coming to His people, as a Mighty One, and also as a Shepherd
Jeremiah 2356 says I will raise unto David a righteous Branch and this is his name whereby he shall be called The Lord Our Righteousness

When the Pharisees said that Christ is the Son of David , the Lord said, 'How then does David in spirit call Him Lord'?
There were certain of the scribes sitting there, and reasoning in their heart, Why doth this man thus speak blasphemies?
By saying this, the Lord wants the one who confesses that He is good to confess also that He is God, the only good One
The Gospel of John further states, 'No one has ever seen God; the only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, He has declared Him'
He is in the Father, and the Father is in Him, because He and the Father are one; He is the Father, and He is also God

Later He actually was born of a woman and became the seed of woman; that is, He became a man, and through His death destroyed the devil
When God promised Abraham, 'And in thy seed shall all the nations of the earth be blessed' , the promised seed He referred to was Christ

Isaiah 11:1 says, 'And there shall come forth a shoot out of the stock of Jesse, and a Branch shall grow out of his roots'
There was given him dominion, and glory, and a kingdom, that all people, nations, and languages, should serve him'
It is with the status of a man that He receives the kingdom from God and comes back to rule over the nations of the earth
In order to be a man He needed to become the seed of the woman as well as a seed of Abraham, Isaac, Jacob, Judah, Jesse, David, etc
He definitely became 'the seed of the woman,' to be a real man, just like any ordinary man, having ancestors and genealogy
When the days of His mother's purification were fulfilled, He was brought to the temple and was presented to God
Finally, in Matthew 26:63-64 before His crucifixion the high priest who was judging Him asked Him if He was the Son of God
When He was crucified, the soldiers divided His garments , thus proving that He put on clothing just like a normal human being

The Bible clearly reveals to us that our Lord is God as well as man, the true God and the true man, the perfect God and the perfect man
He is God who knows everything and sees everything , who is omnipresent, and who descended out of heaven yet is still in heaven
These verses explicitly tell us that Christ is the Creator of all things; all things have been created and came into being through Him
According to His eternal plan and before the foundation of the world, God ordained that the Son become flesh and accomplish redemption
Prototokos means the first one born, the one produced in the beginning; it can thus be translated 'the firstborn'
In verse 15 it says the Lord is the 'firstborn of all creation'; in verse 18 it says He is the 'firstborn from among the dead'
All in all, whether among the created ones or resurrected ones, the Lord is the Firstborn, the Beginning, and occupies the first place
Verse 18 is concerned with the second category, including the church, among whom also the Lord is the Firstborn, the first One
Unless He is the Firstborn of all creation and the first One of all creation, how could He have the preeminence among all creation?
Christ is a creature because He became 'flesh' , took part of 'blood and flesh' , was born a 'child' , and became a 'Man'

He still wears the created human nature in heaven today just as the last line of stanza 5 in Hymn 113 says He wears our nature on the throne

As to His being the Firstborn of the resurrected, He has the uncreated, divine nature and the created, resurrected human nature as well
As to His uncreated divine nature, He is God's only begotten Son and is the same as God, without beginning and self-existing
In God's plan and in His eternal view, Christ is the first one created-He is the Firstborn of all creation, the Head of all the created ones
Our knowledge of the Lord should not be limited by our own view; rather, we should accept the whole revelation of the Bible
Although they believe the Lord is God and man as well, they only believe Him to be the Creator, not a creature
We must know and accept the various aspects of what the Lord is and not ignore or deny any aspect of what He is
The Scripture on one hand, says that Christ is the Creator; on the other hand, it also says that He is a creature
Now He is the allinclusive Christ who has both divinity and humanity and who has the uncreated divine life as well as the created human life
