   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse Nine</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 9: "I know your tribulation and poverty but you are rich and the slander from those who call themselves Jews and are not, but are a synagogue of Satan."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"I know."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The condition of the church and her trials are under the Lord's discernment.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He knows how the church has suffered for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He knows how the church has become poor for His sake, and He knows what the suffering and poverty of the church mean.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is well-acquainted with these things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His past experience enables Him to comfort them in an understanding way: "I know your tribulation."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Moreover, He can praise them in the sweetest manner: "I know your poverty."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>"Blessed are you when they reproach and persecute you, and while speaking lies, say every evil thing against you because of Me. Rejoice and exult" Matt 5:11-12 . The Lord took note of how they had suffered for Him and had persevered in silence.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To us, the day of rejoicing comes only when suffering has ceased.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But the Lord charged us to rejoice in sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is the overflow of salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He remembers with what spirit we bear persecution and does not forget our faithfulness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If we would trust Him as we would trust our Maker, we will see His comforting hands.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To almost all the other churches, the Lord said: "I know your works."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But the Lord did not say the same thing to the church in Smyrna.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Lord considers it more important to suffer for Him than to work for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Suffering is the best work.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The believers may have many accomplishments in working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, if there is no suffering for the Lord, these accomplishments are of little worth before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>During the time of persecution, it is true that the church cannot have much outward endeavor.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, faithfulness in loving the Lord is what pleases Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A testimony of a suffering life is the best testimony; here the wordless prevails over the wordy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Tribulation and poverty" are two characteristics of a faithful lover of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Those who truly live up to the standard of the Lord's holiness in this evil world have no choice other than to forsake the world, for the world has forsaken them.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Tribulations, sufferings, and persecutions are the unavoidable portion of the saints in the world 1 Thes 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In order to be for the Lord, to obey His word, and to carry out His will, surely there will be much misunderstanding from the world, and there will even be persecutions.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, though the suffering is deep, is not the love of the Lord manifested in these sufferings deeper than the sufferings themselves?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Often the love of the Lord is poured out from the Holy Spirit upon our hearts at the time of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Other than suffering, there is no way for us to have such a sweet taste of the Lord's love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every suffering that we encounter in our heart and soul and every wound in our body that we suffer for the Lord draw us closer to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Do not our outpoured tears and crying before the Lord set our heart on fire to yearn for Him?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Tribulations are often the forerunners of poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sufferings usually lead to poverty, that is, to the loss of our legitimate blessings in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is harder for a rich man to enter the kingdom of heaven than for a camel to go through the eye of a needle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The reason for this is that in the kingdom of heaven, though one will be rich, he will at the same time be poor; one becomes poor for the Lord's sake.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although the so-called "standard of living" can become an excuse for comfortable living, what "standard of living" can be a justifiable reason when it is compared with the way the Son of God lived when He descended from heaven?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Lord may not have called us to give up everything and to live a life of utter poverty for His sake.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But then, how much have we been stripped in our eating and clothing for His sake?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word poverty should at least be a practice in our daily life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Those who become poor and who suffer for the Lord will surely be rewarded in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As for those who have already satisfied their heart's desire today, how can they hope to receive special praise at the judgment seat of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>"But you are rich."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The believers at Smyrna were greatly pressed and had become poor.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Yet they gladly bore everything.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord told them that while their treasure is accumulating in heaven, their portion now is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It is indeed true that "There is that scattereth, and yet increaseth" Prov 11:24 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Their poverty is the result of their tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Hence, poverty is mentioned after tribulation and before slander.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The goal of such a great persecution is but the ushering in of spiritual riches.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The tribulation of the church halts her degradation and turns her to a greater trust in God.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>"Poverty but you are rich ."</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>How contrary is this to the condition of Laodicea!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The latter boasted: "I am rich and have become rich and have need of nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Actually, they were ignorant that they were "wretched and miserable and poor and blind and naked" 3:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>"Poverty...rich"!</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>"Poverty...rich"!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The Lord considers Smyrna who is poor in the world to be rich, and Laodicea who is rich in the world to be poor.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Blessed are those who are aware of this.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>"And he who will exalt himself shall be humbled, and he who will humble himself shall be exalted" Matt 23:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is an unchanging law.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>To boast about success and prosperity in the present condition of degradation and desolation is to be ignorant of oneself and to be beguiled by worldly foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Only a spiritual discernment can search all things and can see riches in poverty, and poverty in riches.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One may be prosperous in his enterprise, successful in his work, and may see growth and profit all around.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Yet the Lord may not have the same valuation as he does.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>On the other hand, those who are faithful for the Lord, who love the Lord zealously, and who are willing to suffer opposition and persecution from the world and from the church for the Lord's sake and for His truth's sake, though void of great endeavors in the world, are precious in the Lord's eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only those who are truly spiritual can be free from the desire for worldly prosperity, and only those who have truly died to self can humble themselves to seek after the Father's will with a single heart.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The cross is in fact the greatest and the first victory.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But to the world, the cross was a complete defeat!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If the Lord Himself had to go through this "defeat" to gain victory, what else can we expect?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Those who are poor for the Lord's sake should realize that they gain the Lord's heart more than those who are rich in the world.</S>
