   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The Difference between the Gifts and the Ministry</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We may ask what the difference is between the gifts and the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The book of Numbers records how Balaam's donkey spoke a human language 22:28 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Was that a ministry?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>That was not a ministry but a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This difference may also be illustrated by a Chinese person who speaks both Chinese and English.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Because the Chinese language has been wrought into him, he speaks in Chinese spontaneously without effort.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Because Chinese has been constituted into him, his speaking in Chinese is a "ministry."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Because English has not been wrought into him, his speaking in English is a "gift."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>What is a ministry?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A ministry is the expression of what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To minister is to express what you are.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To exercise a gift, though, may be a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When a man walks, moves, acts, and speaks, he expresses what he is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>His expression of what he is, is his "ministry."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>A monkey can sometimes be trained to act like a man, but that is just a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That is a "gift."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In today's Christianity there are many performances.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If the apostle Paul were to stay with us for a month, we would see that he himself is what he ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Paul was really what he ministered because what he had seen was wrought into his being.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Eventually, he ministered what he was.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The person was the message.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In today's Christianity, a person may be merely eloquent and learned.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>His speaking may even be with a certain kind of religious tone.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That is a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not the real thing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul, however, was different.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I came to know some famous Christian workers who talked much about the lessons of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When I was with them, though, I did not see these lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>My experience with Brother Nee was different.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I was with him for over eighteen years.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Sometimes he spoke about the cross, but I saw the cross in him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The sufferings that came to him from many directions were the working of the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The cross had been worked into Brother Nee.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What he ministered was not merely a teaching by a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>What he had was a ministry, and that ministry was what he was.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not appreciate the gifts so much.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It was miraculous for Balaam's donkey to speak a human language, but we should not be overly excited about something like that.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead, we have to gain the proper ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then we will minister what we are to people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our eloquence and our gift mean very little.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is easy for the devil to take advantage of our eloquence and gift to cheat us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not trust or appreciate our eloquence, our gift, or our talent.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We may admire a certain person because he is so talented, but to be talented alone is terrible.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In order to build up the church, we do not need mere gifts and teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need brothers and sisters who have been burned with some things revealed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Then they will have the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When a person has a ministry, he may not need to speak very much.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>His very presence ministers life to people.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His presence in a meeting means much.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If he is there, the meeting will be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If he is absent, the meeting will have a lack.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Even his silent presence in the meetings makes a difference because he is a person who has a real ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He does not have mere teachings, knowledge, or gifts, but something of God in eternity has been wrought into his being.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The presence of such a person makes a difference.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When the saints bring their troubles and problems into the presence of such a person, sometimes there is no need for him to say a word and the problems will be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I saw this in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When the saints bring their problems into such a person's presence, they receive the light.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This person's presence becomes the light because light has been wrought into his being.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When others are in his presence, they are under the enlightening.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They see light in his light.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Today in the church we need the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Brother Nee always belittled and even condemned the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>He always stressed the ministry again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>First and Second Corinthians show the distinction between the gifts and the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The first Epistle deals negatively with the gifts; the second speaks positively about the ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The church needs the ministry much more than the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the first Epistle to the Corinthians, Paul depreciated the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the second Epistle, the ministry is emphasized again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We have received this ministry, and this ministry is the ministry of the Spirit and of life 2 Cor 3:6, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>What is needed in the churches today is the ministry, not the gifts.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>After receiving the revelation, Brother Nee passed through many sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then the ministry came out of him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>He had the ministry.</S>
