<h2 class="head2">Being out of God Himself</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1:9 shows that the church was purposed in God in eternity according to the good pleasure of His will. Hence, this plan is out of God Himself.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being according to the Good Pleasure of God&rsquo;s Will</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1 tells us that this plan, this arrangement, is according to the good pleasure of His will. This chapter tells us of God&rsquo;s desire. Just as man has a desire for pleasant things, God too has a desire. Based on His desire He has a purpose, and this purpose has become His will. His purpose is His will according to His good pleasure. God&rsquo;s plan is out of the good pleasure of His will. Hence, the church makes God happy; it is very much in God&rsquo;s heart and what God has planned for Himself.</p>
<p>The Chinese have bridal chambers for their weddings. A bridal chamber is a new house that is used for a wedding. A father prepares many wonderful things for his son in the bridal chamber. We may ask, &ldquo;Why does a father need to prepare a bridal chamber for his son?&rdquo; The father would say that it is because he is obtaining a wife for his son. The entire universe can be compared to a large bridal chamber. All things make up the furnishings of this chamber. God desires to obtain a wife for His Son; this wife is the church. Hence, the church is what pleases God the most. This is not merely a matter of God&rsquo;s love but of His taste. God delights in the church and has a special love for the church.</p>
<p>We should never think that God had no interest in man until He saw that man had sinned and become fallen, at which time He was moved with compassion and set up a way for salvation in order to save men and gather them together as the church. If this were the case, the church would be too low. Rather, the church is something exceedingly great and profound; it is what pleases God the most. Before all things were created, God had a good pleasure in Himself and purposed to have the church. This purpose became the good pleasure of His will. Based on this will, He made a blueprint, a plan for the building of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being in Christ</h2>
<p>Ephesians 1 tells us that God&rsquo;s economy concerning the church is in Christ. Being in Christ is a great matter.</p>
<h2 class="head3">God Appointing Christ<br />
for the Fulfillment of His Plan</h2>
<p>The Lord has two particular titles: one is <em>the Son of God,</em> and the other is <em>Christ.</em> In Matthew 16:16 Peter answered the Lord Jesus, saying, &ldquo;You are the Christ, the Son of the living God.&rdquo; In Luke 2:11, when the angel announced the good news, he said, &ldquo;Today a Savior has been born to you in David&rsquo;s city, who is Christ the Lord.&rdquo; In addition, John 20:31 says, &ldquo;That you may believe that Jesus is the Christ, the Son of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p><em>The Son of God</em> refers to the Lord&rsquo;s person, and <em>Christ</em> speaks of His commission, His work. The Lord Jesus was the Son of God, and He was appointed by God to be the Christ. In God there is no element of time, but if we put eternal things into time, one might say that the Lord was the Son of God in eternity and that He was appointed to be the Christ before the foundation of the world. The Greek word for <em>Christ</em> is <em>Christo,</em> an equivalent of <em>Messiah</em> in Hebrew. <em>Messiah</em> means &ldquo;anointed One.&rdquo; Christ is the anointed One. In principle, when God intends that someone work for Him, He anoints him. The priests, kings, and prophets in the Old Testament were anointed by God before they were used to accomplish His purpose. The word <em>Christ</em> means that God appointed His Son to accomplish His plan. In other words, God appointed His Son to be the anointed One in His plan. God has a plan, and this plan depends upon His Son for its accomplishment. Hence, the Son of God was anointed to be the Christ.</p>
<p>Ephesians 1 does not say that God&rsquo;s plan was made <em>in the Son of God,</em> but rather that it was made <em>in Christ.</em> What is the distinction between the Son of God and Christ? Or we may ask: When did the Son of God begin to exist, and when did Christ begin to exist? As God, the Son of God existed in eternity and is without beginning or end, but Christ came into being after God made His plan for the church.</p>
<p>In the Old Testament there are three groups of people who worked for God and required the anointing of God. They were the priests, kings, and prophets. David was the only one who possessed all three statuses at the same time; nevertheless, they were not very apparent in him. In contrast, it is apparent that the Lord possesses all three statuses at the same time for the purpose of fulfilling God&rsquo;s plan.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Jehovah has anointed Me&rdquo; (cf. Isa. 61:1; Luke 4:18). This creates a difficult theological question regarding when God anointed His Son. In man&rsquo;s eyes God anointed the Lord Jesus after His baptism, but Hebrews 1:2 tells us that God appointed His Son to be the Heir of all things. Prior to His being appointed to be the Heir of all things, He was always the Son of God. At a certain point in eternity God had a good pleasure, and based on His good pleasure, He had a will. According to His will, He made a plan to obtain the church. At this point, He appointed His Son to fulfill His plan. From that moment, the Son of God became God&rsquo;s anointed One. This is the first significance of God&rsquo;s plan being made in Christ.</p>
