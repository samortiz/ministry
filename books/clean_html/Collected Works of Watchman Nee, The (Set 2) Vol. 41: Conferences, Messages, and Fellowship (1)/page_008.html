God is in Christ. At the most the universe can reveal God's glory (Psa. 19:1; Rom. 1:20); only Christ can reveal God Himself, because God is in Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">There Is a God (July 25)</h2><p>Once I spoke with a college student about the existence of God. The student argued that there is no God, and I said to him, "Then you must be God. If you know that there is no God, you must be God yourself. If you know that there is no God, you must have travelled throughout the whole earth. If one cannot find God in Shanghai, He may be in Nanking. In order for you to say that there is no God, you must have been to Shanghai and Nanking. But if God is not in Nanking, He may be in Tientsin. Therefore, you must have been to Tientsin as well. If God is not found in China, He may be found in another country! This means that you have been to all the countries in the world. If God is not in one place, He may be in another place. In order for you to say that there is no God, you must have been to all these places! God may be hiding at the North Pole or the South Pole, or He may be hiding in the jungle or the wilderness. You must have been to the North Pole, the South Pole, and all the jungles and wildernesses in the world. In order for you to say that there is no God, you must have been to all these places! Perhaps God is not living on this earth, but is living on the moon. This would mean that you must have been to the moon also. God may also be living on other planets or hiding in outer space. This means that you also must have been to all the planets and to outer space as well. Hence, you must have been all over the universe and have searched everywhere. If you are qualified to say that there is no God, then you must be God.</p><p>"This is not all. You can say that there is no God today. But how can you be sure that there was no God in Shanghai yesterday. Perhaps God will come tomorrow. If you cannot find God this year, how do you know that there was no God last year? How can you be sure that you will not find God next year? Moreover, even if you are sure that there is no God today, how can you be sure that there was no God a thousand years ago? You must be a person who lives forever. You must be one who knows everything about the future, and one who is not bound by time and space. You must be one who can be simultaneously in Tientsin as well as in all the other countries of the world. You must be able to be in the east, the west, the North Pole, and the South Pole at the same time. You must be omnipresent. You must have searched through time and space in order to conclude that there is no God. If this is the case, I do not need to look anywhere else. You are God! If you are not God, you are not qualified to say that there is no God."</p><h2 class="head2">The Error of Modernism (July 25)</h2><p>Brother Jiang's father-in-law received a wrong diagnosis from the doctor; therefore, his sickness never healed. This is analogous to the Modernists who claim that a man can be saved only if he performs good works. Saying this proves that one is ignorant of the true nature of man. Those who say this do not know man's true self. The Bible says that man is born in sin (Psa. 51:5). Man's nature is constituted of nothing but sin. Sin is something that originates from man's inward being.</p><h2 class="head2">The Definition of the Church (July 28)</h2><p>The definition of the church: All that is of Christ in all the saints.</p>
