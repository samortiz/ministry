   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. "Like a Deaf Man"</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Psalm 38:13-14 says, "But I, like a deaf man, do not hear; /And I am like a dumb man, who does not open his mouth./Indeed I am like a man who does not hear/And in whose mouth there are no reproofs."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many people indeed need to be as a deaf man who does not hear.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When others speak unbecoming things, you should act like a deaf man who does not hear anything.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You should simply say, "I cannot hear."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>If you want to be a little stronger, you can testify something to him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you want to be stronger still, you can rebuke him, saying, "Brother!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What do you think I am?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Why do you dump so many words on me?"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>You can also give a word of testimony: "I think a Christian should not say such things.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Such words should not come out of a Christian's mouth."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may also say, "Brother!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Wait a minute before you continue to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I am leaving."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you are a deaf man, you will be blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many times you have to act like a deaf man who does not hear anything.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You must also learn to be like the dumb who cannot speak anything.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Words are a great temptation, and you must learn to overcome them.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In Isaiah 42, which is altogether a prophecy concerning the Lord Jesus, verse 19 says, "Who is blind except My servant, /And as deaf as My messenger, whom I will send?/Who is as blind as the one at peace with Me,/And as blind as the servant of Jehovah?"</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Lord was on the earth, there were many words He would not listen to.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Please remember that the less filth and gossip we hear, the less trouble we will have.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have enough troubles, problems, and filth within ourselves already.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If we add more to them, we will not be able to go on at all.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>A new believer must learn from the beginning to reject the temptation of listening.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must be deaf like the Lord Jesus was.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Who is deaf like our Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The way of our Lord is most upright.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is why He is not bound by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>C. Making a Conscious Effort to Learn</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>New believers must be taught in the matter of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>They must be taught the way to speak, and they also must be taught the way to listen.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They must learn to fear God in the matter of speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is a great matter, and it is a definite threshold which one has to cross definitely.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This lesson does not come without a price.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We need to spend much time to develop the habit of speaking accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I do not believe a new believer in the Lord can overcome in this matter in a short time.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I have found out that accurate words are more difficult to come by than many other things.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we allow a little carelessness to come in, we will find mistakes in our words and motives.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Lying is one example of this.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Speaking inaccurate words is a form of lying, and so is any attempt to mislead others.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Sometimes a person may say the right thing with the intention of misleading others.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is lying as well.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A new believer must pay attention to this matter and must exercise considerable effort to deal with it from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Psalm 141:3 says, "Set a watch, O Jehovah, before my mouth;/Keep the door of my lips."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We need to have such a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to say, "Set a watch over my tongue so that I will not speak rashly."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Perhaps some will need to pray, "Set a watch over my ears so that I will not listen carelessly."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we do this, the church will be spared many troubles and we will advance in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>One thing surprises me greatly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many brothers are bold to speak carelessly, and many people listen to them with no sense of fear at all.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is a great sickness among us!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Clearly this is a grave malady!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Whenever we lend our ears to improper words, we are sick!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a serious sickness for anyone to accept words without reservation or discretion!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We must learn to reject filthy fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Any kind of poison will spread among God's children and will bring in ungodliness, rebellion, and looseness.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>May God be gracious to us and have mercy on us so that we would learn to speak in a proper way from the very beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>May we learn to run the straight race before us!</S>
