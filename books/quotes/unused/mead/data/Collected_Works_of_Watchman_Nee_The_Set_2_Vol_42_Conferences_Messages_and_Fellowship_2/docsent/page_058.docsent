   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BELIEVING IN GOD'S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>You may ask, "What should I believe now that you have told me to believe?"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How does faith work in reality?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Please remember that our faith is based on God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Believing in God's Word means that when God says in His Word that certain things have been accomplished, we believe that they have been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A missionary once asked me, "What is the difference between God's Word and His work?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I was shaking his hand and I had my gloves on.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I explained that God's work is like the hand, while His Word is like the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When someone holds my glove, he is holding my hand.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the same way, when we hold onto God's Word, we hold onto His work.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When I explained it in this way, he became clear.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All we have to do is to hold onto God's Word; His work is in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If the hand is not in the glove, it would be useless for anyone to shake the glove.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But God's work is now in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We should say to the Lord, "You have said that Your work is accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I believe in what You said."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If God's Word says it, we should also say it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>God's Word says that our sins are forgiven in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should respond by saying that our sins are forgiven in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's Word says that our sins have been judged in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We should respond by saying that our sins have been judged in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God's Word says that the old man has died.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We should respond by saying that our old man has died.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>God's Word says that we have received a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should respond by saying that we have received a new life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we do this, everything in Christ will be ours.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>John 15 says that the Lord is the vine and the Christians are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>To outsiders this may not seem like anything sensational, but to a Christian this is a revolutionizing fact.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All the sap in the vine flows into the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The fruit, leaves, and branches all derive their growth from the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>A Christian is a branch on Christ the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He does not need to struggle to grow leaves or bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>All he has to do is remain in the vine.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>However, many Christians feel that they do not look like a branch.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They pray and ask to become a branch.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>These prayers are absolutely useless.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We are branches already, and there is no need for us to pray to become a branch.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We only need to see that we are branches.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we see that we are branches, we will no longer pray to be one, but will acknowledge that we are one already.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the meaning of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>BELIEVING IN WHAT GOD HAS DONE</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>RATHER THAN IN WHAT HE WILL DO</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once I was very sick, and I prayed to the Lord: "Heal me, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The doctors can do nothing about me now.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Please heal me."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I had seen many promises of God in the Bible prior to this.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But the Lord spoke to me through one word.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>"He Himself took away our infirmities and bore our diseases" Matt 8:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At first I prayed for the Lord to bear my disease.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then He gave me a promise, but my illness was still there.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>I prayed again and the Lord rebuked me and showed me that this was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He opened my eyes, and I saw that He had already borne my disease.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>When I believed in this word, I did not pray any longer; instead, I began to praise Him for bearing my disease even though outwardly everything was still the same and the illness was still with me.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Faith is not believing in what God will do; it is believing in what God has done.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It is not believing that God will heal me, but that He has healed me.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Bible does not mention faith as something belonging to the future.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Faith is believing in what God has done in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we believe in what God has done and accept His accomplished facts, we have genuine faith.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>STANDING ON GOD'S WORD</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>There was another time when I was sick.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I asked the Lord to heal me, and He told me that the Holy Spirit is living in me and will give life to my mortal body Rom 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I knew that the Lord had healed me, yet I could not go to sleep that night.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The fever was high and the condition was worse than before.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Satan came to me and said, "You say that God has healed you.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But look at yourself, your temperature is very high and you cannot sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>You say that you are healed, but your sufferings are worse than before.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>How can you say that God has healed you?</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is not true."</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I thought that perhaps I was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But then I realized that this was nothing more than a mood that came from Satan, and I began to ignore it.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I told Satan, "God said that He has healed me.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>My temperature may be high, and I may still feel pain and be unable to go to sleep, but none of these conditions are trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>There is only one thing which is real in this world God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>All pains and problems are false.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Only God's Word is real."</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>After I said this, I fell asleep within a few minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Satan may say, "Look at yourself!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You are so filthy within."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>You have to tell him, "Yes, I am filthy in myself.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>But I am in Christ, and everything in Christ is clean."</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If you stand on God's side, Satan will be defeated immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In reading the Bible, we have to pay attention to two matters being in Adam and being in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>There is a great difference between these two things.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>They have a great deal to do with the way we live our Christian life, and we must deal with these two matters properly.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>When our life does not match the biblical description of being in Christ, we have to stand on God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must not trust in our feelings or consider our conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have to stand on God's Word and believe in His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we do this, He will lead us into all the riches that are in Christ.</S>
