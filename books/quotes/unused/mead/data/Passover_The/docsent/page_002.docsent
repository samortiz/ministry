   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE THE PASSOVER A TYPE OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: Exo 12:1-10, 13, 23, 46b; 13:4; Luke 22:7-8, 14-15; John 19:33, 36; 1 Cor 5:7 A TYPE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All Christians know that Christ is the Lamb of God who accomplished redemption for us John 1:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>However, not many have seen a clear picture of Christ as the redeeming Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Passover portrayed in Exodus 12 is a clear, adequate, and even all-inclusive type of the redemption of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Nowhere else in the Scriptures is the redemption of Christ presented in such a full way.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There it is presented, not as a doctrine, but in relation to a practical need.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all need to see a clear picture of Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although the New Testament reveals the various aspects of redemption, these aspects are not systematized in a doctrinal way.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>John 1:29 says that Christ is the Lamb of God, and in 1 Corinthians 5:7 Paul speaks of Christ as the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here and there in the New Testament we see aspects of Christ's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In Exodus 12, however, we have a complete picture.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We need to consider this picture carefully; then to interpret it properly, we need to turn to other portions of the Word, especially to the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Passover is a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In 1 Corinthians 5:7 Paul says that "Christ our passover is sacrificed for us."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here Paul does not say that Christ is our lamb; he says that Christ is our Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But how could the Passover be sacrificed?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The answer is that Christ is not only the Passover lamb, but also every aspect of the Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The lamb, the bread, and the bitter herbs are all related to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In principle, therefore, Christ is not only the lamb of the Passover, but the very Passover itself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The word Passover means that the judgment of God passes over us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Exodus 12:13 the Lord says, "When I see the blood, I will pass over you."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Eventually, the Passover became a proper noun in English.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The proper noun Passover has its source in the words "pass over" in 12:13.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But why is Christ called our Passover?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to Exodus 12, God passed over the children of Israel because the blood of the Passover lamb had been sprinkled on the lintel and the doorposts of their houses.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The children of Israel had been commanded to eat the flesh of the lamb in their houses.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This indicates that the house was to be their covering under which and in which they could eat the flesh of the Passover lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The house that covered them was to have blood sprinkled on the lintel and the doorposts.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When God saw the blood, He passed over the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, this passing over was due to the sprinkled blood.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to Paul, however, we see that the Passover is related not only to the blood, but to Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Are we today under the blood, or are we in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Strictly speaking, to say that we are under the blood is not scriptural.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This phrase is not found in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But the New Testament says repeatedly that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to 1 Corinthians 1:30, it is of God that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because we are in Christ, He Himself becomes our Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This means that before Christ can be our Passover, He must first be our covering.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Our covering today is not the blood; it is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Exodus 12 the Passover was based on the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But today our Passover is based on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is the reason Paul could say that Christ is our Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you were asked to list the items of the Passover in Exodus 12, you would probably mention the lamb, the flesh, the blood! the unleavened bread, and the herbs.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But probably you would not include the house.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The house in Exodus 12 is also a type of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>At the end of Genesis 3, we see that God used skins to cover Adam and Eve v. 21 . In Genesis 4 Abel "brought of the firstlings of his flock and of the fat thereof" and presented them to the Lord v. 4 . Through this offering, Abel was accepted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Later we read that Noah was charged to build an ark, which may be regarded as a floating house.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This ark was a type of Christ into whom we have been placed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Noah and his family entered into the ark and in it they were saved from the flood.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These instances indicate that the revelation in the Bible is progressive.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In Genesis 3:21, we have the coats of skins; in Genesis 4:4, the offering of the firstlings of the flock; and in Genesis 6 and 7, the ark made by Noah.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the lives of Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob we do not have a clear record of redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>For this, we must go to the experience of the children of Israel recorded in Exodus 12.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Here is the full development of God's redemption which was first indicated in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In Genesis 3 we have the skins, in Genesis 4 we have the offering, and in Genesis 6 and 7 we have the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now in Exodus 12 we have set before us the full development of God's redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Here the ark becomes the house, a type of Christ, in which and by which the children of Israel were covered.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the reason that no verse in the New Testament says that we are under the covering of the blood of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, a number of verses, especially in the Epistles, indicate that we are in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>According to Galatians 3, God has put us into Christ, and we are now in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Because Christ is the house that covers us, He is our Passover.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He is not only the lamb, the unleavened bread, and the herbs; He is also the house whose lintel and doorposts have been sprinkled with the redeeming blood.</S>
