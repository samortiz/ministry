   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>by All the Gifted Saints</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>for the Perfecting of the Saints</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A local church should be under the leadership of the elders and should be ministered to by all the gifted saints, such as the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints that they may participate in the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thus, all kinds of members of Christ can be useful in the building up of His Body, and not one will be rejected or left idle in the house of God and in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In order for the local churches to go on, they need the leadership of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The New Testament reveals that the elders are not voted in by their congregations, but they are appointed by the apostles in every city, that is, in every church Acts 14:23; Titus 1:5 , according to their maturity in life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The elders are the overseers in the churches Acts 20:17, 28; Phil 1:1; 1 Tim 3:1-2; Titus 1:5, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As overseers, the elders should look diligently after the church to be aware of the practical and spiritual situation of the church and the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The main responsibility of the elders as overseers is not to rule over but to shepherd, to take all-inclusive, tender care of the flock, the church of God, which He purchased with His own blood Acts 20:28; 1 Pet 5:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The church as the flock of God is not the elders' possession but God's possession, allotted to the elders as their allotment, their portion, entrusted to them by God for their care.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The elders should also take the lead in the church by becoming a pattern in preaching the gospel, in shepherding and perfecting the saints, in growing in life, in laboring in the Word, and in serving and caring for the church, so that all the saints can follow 1 Pet 5:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In addition to the leadership of the elders, the local churches also need to be ministered to by all the gifted members in the Body for the perfecting of the saints that they may participate in the building up of the Body of Christ Eph 4:11-12, 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Ephesians 4:11 Paul mentioned that Christ, the Head of the church, gave four kinds of gifted persons to the Body apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These four kinds of gifts were given to the Body for the perfecting of the saints, that all the saints may be equipped and furnished with organic functions and thus be able to do the direct work of building up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>An apostle is one who is sent out by the Lord with the Lord's authority to preach the gospel of God, to teach the divine truth, and to establish the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>According to the clear revelation of the New Testament, after the churches are established by the apostles, they need the continual care and ministry of the apostles for the perfecting of the saints and the appointing, instructing, and leading of the elders Acts 18:1, 11; 20:17-38 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A prophet is not one who primarily predicts the future, but one who speaks for the Lord and speaks forth the Lord to minister Christ to people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The saints in the churches need to be perfected by the prophets so that all will be able to prophesy for the building up of the church as the Body of Christ 1 Cor 14:3-4, 31 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The evangelists are those who are specially gifted in preaching the gospel of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Philip was such an evangelist Acts 8:5-40; 21:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The saints in the churches also need the perfecting of the evangelists so that they may be equipped and stirred up in their spirit to preach prevailingly the unsearchable riches of Christ as the gospel Eph 3:8 by contacting people for the increase of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the grammar of Ephesians 4:11, the term shepherds and teachers refers to only one class of gifted persons.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A shepherd should know how to teach, and a teacher should be able to shepherd.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we preach the gospel, some will believe and be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After being saved, the new ones need to be taken care of.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They need to be shepherded, and they need to be taught.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The shepherds and teachers perfect the saints by teaching them how to feed and nourish the young saints and the new believers, and also how to teach the growing saints Acts 11:25-26; 13:1 , so that the saints may do the work of the New Testament ministry, that is, to build up the Body of Christ, as the shepherds and teachers do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Today all the saints in the local churches need to be perfected unto the work of the ministry, that is, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The light concerning Ephesians 4:11-12 and 16 has never been as bright and clear as it is today.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Body of Christ is built up not by the four kinds of gifted persons directly, but by the functioning of all the perfected members of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the church of God, the Body of Christ, all the members should be living, vital, and functioning members.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>After being perfected, all the saints become the building members to build up the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>8 brothers</S>
