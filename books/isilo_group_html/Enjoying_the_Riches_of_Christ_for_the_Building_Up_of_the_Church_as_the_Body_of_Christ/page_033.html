The word transformed is used in 2 Corinthians 3:18, which says, &#8220;But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&#8221; Transformation is also indicated in 1 Corinthians 3:9 and 12. Verse 9 says, &#8220;For we are God&#8217;s fellow workers; you are God&#8217;s cultivated land, God&#8217;s building.&#8221; Verse 12 says, &#8220;But if anyone builds upon the foundation gold, silver, precious stones, wood, grass, stubble.&#8221; A farm is not a mine; a farm is for growing plants. But in verse 12 we do not have plants; we have gold, silver, and precious stones which are good for building. The farm grows plants, yet eventually we have precious stones. This indicates transformation. Transformation may also be illustrated by petrified wood. Petrified wood is from trees that have become stone.<p>The matters of eating, drinking, growing, transformation, and building are not merely our teaching. They are the revelation in 1 Corinthians. Many in Christianity often refer to 1 Corinthians. The Brethren published books dealing with the eleven problems in this book. The first of the eleven problems is the problem of division (1:10-4:21). Some said they were of Paul, some were of Apollos, some of Cephas, and some said they were of Christ (1:12). To this Paul said, &#8220;Is Christ divided?&#8221; (v. 13). Secondly, this book deals with the excommunication of an evil brother (5:1-13). A sinful brother committed incest with his stepmother, so Paul told the Corinthians to remove the evil man from among them (v. 13). In chapter six is the dealing with lawsuits among believers (6:1-11) and dealing with the abuse of freedom (6:12-20). In chapter seven is the dealing with marriage life (7:1-40). Following this is the dealing with the eating of things sacrificed to idols (8:1-11:1) with the vindication of Paul&#8217;s apostleship and authority (9:1-27). In chapter eleven are the matters of head covering (11:2-16) and the Lord&#8217;s supper (11:17-34). Then in 12:1-14:40 is the dealing with the gifts. Lastly are the dealings with the matter of resurrection (15:1-58) and the collection of the gift (16:1-9).<p>According to teaching, the Brethren were right, and we have come to know their teachings very well, but I have the burden to convince you that teachings alone are not sufficient. We ourselves can publish many books on the eleven problems in 1 Corinthians. Just on the matters of division and excommunication there are many things to say. However, what would be the use of mere knowledge about these things? None of these problems is the central concept of this book. The central concept, on the negative side, is that the Corinthians were sick with all these problems. This sickness was due to their emphasis on knowledge and the gifts. They were sick with divisions, sinfulness, lawsuits, wrongness toward marriage, idol sacrifices, and many matters. On the one hand, this is because they had too much teaching, too much knowledge. Knowledge puffs up (8:1). Likewise, they overemphasized and misused the gifts.<p>On the other hand, however, the Corinthians were short of the eating and enjoying of Christ. Medical doctors today tell us that certain sicknesses are due to the shortage of vitamins. The best cure for these sicknesses is not to take medicine but to take the proper vitamins. Some diseases, however, require an antibiotic, a germicide to kill the germs. In 1 Corinthians Christ is the real vitamin, and the cross is the real germicide, the antibiotic. Paul said, &#8220;For I did not determine to know anything among you except Christ, and this One crucified&#8221; (2:2). The Corinthians were sick with many divisions because they were short of the proper &#8220;vitamins.&#8221; To feed a patient quickly, doctors may feed him intravenously. When a patient is brought into a hospital in serious condition, he is fed through the veins. Then after a few days, he can be fed through the mouth. The main thing the doctors care for is the feeding. In this book Paul was feeding the Corinthians. The best cure for problems is eating.<p>Regrettably, both the fundamentalists and the Pentecostals have not seen the crucial matters in 1 Corinthians. It is hard to hear a message in Christianity telling us that 1 Corinthians is for eating, drinking, growing, transforming, and building. Rather, all the messages from this book are on teaching, doctrine, gifts, and the manifestation of gifts. The King James Version translates build as edify in 1 Corinthians 14 (vv. 3-5). In Greek, edify means to build; it is the verbal form of the noun for house. However, most people do not understand it in this way. Not many speak of building up. Many say that to speak in tongues edifies them. As long as they are edified, they are satisfied. Speaking in tongues may edify the speaker, but it does not build up the church (vv. 4-5).<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Enjoying the Riches of Christ for the Building Up of the Church as the Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
