His desire is to have a kingdom. "Your kingdom come" shows God's goal and desire. God wants to see His kingdom come soon. Once His kingdom comes, Satan will be overturned (Matt. 12:28). In the age of the kingdom, the overcomers will share Christ's glory, and Satan will be cast into the abyss and suffer shame. This is God's goal and desire. God wants man to pray according to this goal and desire. The Lord wants men to pray for God's kingdom to come to earth, which means for God's rule to come to earth and for God to gain His kingdom on earth.</p><h2 class="head3">"Your Will Be Done, as in Heaven,<br />so Also on Earth"</h2><p>God's will is never hindered in heaven. His will is frustrated from being executed on earth because the earth has been corrupted by Satan. It has been usurped by God's enemy. However, when the kingdom comes, the earth will be completely recovered, and God's will and desire will be executed on the earth as it is in heaven. Satan will be bound in the abyss (Rev. 20:3; cf. Luke 8:31, Dan. 10:13) and will no longer be able to frustrate God's will. Today the Lord wants men to pray for this and to hasten the manifestation of His will.</p><h2 class="head2">Section Two</h2><p>When a man stands on God's side to contend for His name, His kingdom, and His will, the enemy will attack him constantly. Everyone who makes a stand for God will come under the enemy's attack. This is why there is the need for protection. If there is no protection from God, we would fail. God protects us in four areas.</p><h2 class="head3">Food</h2><p>"Give us today our daily bread." Without food, man cannot survive, and he cannot live for God's will. Man cannot give up ground to the enemy through the matter of food. It says, "Our daily bread." An individual may not be lacking in anything, but God wants the corporate "us" to be without want.</p><h2 class="head3">Forgiving Debt</h2><p>"Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors." "Debts" here does not refer directly to the offenses we have committed against others. Our sins are forgiven through the Lord's blood, yet our debts are forgiven through our forgiving our debtors.</p><h2 class="head3">Not Brought into Temptation</h2><p>"Do not bring us into temptation." We should not anticipate temptation; rather, we should ask God to not bring us into temptation.</p><h2 class="head3">Deliverance from the Evil One</h2><p>"Deliver us from the evil one." This is an opposing prayer that deals with Satan.</p><h2 class="head2">Section Three</h2><p>"For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen." This section mentions three things that are God's: the kingdom, the power, and the glory. All three things belong to God forever. Satan will eventually be removed. The word "forever" signifies that Satan can never prevail. "Amen" means "yes." It is like signing a signature; everything is sealed.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD NEEDS MAN'S PRAYER</h2><p>God's Word repeatedly shows us that He wants man to pray. Isaiah 45:11 says, "Thus says Jehovah,/The Holy One of Israel and the One who formed him,/Ask Me about the things to come concerning My sons,/And concerning the work of My hands, command Me." Jeremiah 29:12 says, "Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you."</p><p>Many people do not want to pray. God even wonders why men do not intercede. Isaiah 59:16 says, "And He saw that there was no man,/And He was appalled that there was no intercessor./Therefore His arm brought salvation to Him,/And His righteousness sustained Him."</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_006.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_008.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 44: Conferences, Messages, and Fellowship (4) &nbsp; pg 7</div><br></body></html>
