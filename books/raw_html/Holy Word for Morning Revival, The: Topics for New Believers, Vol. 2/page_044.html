 <p><strong>WEEK 14 &mdash; DAY 1</strong></p>
<h2 class="head3u">Scripture Reading</h2>
<p><strong>Rev. 1:1 The revelation of Jesus Christ which God gave to Him to show to His slaves the things that must quickly take place; and He made <em>it</em> known by signs, sending <em>it</em> by His angel to His slave John.</strong></p>
<h2 class="head2">The New Jerusalem</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Conclusion of the Whole Bible<br />
and of the Entire Divine Revelation</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem revealed in the last two chapters of the book of Revelation is not only the conclusion of the book itself and of the New Testament; it is also the conclusion of the whole Bible. In the sixty-six books of the Bible, all the records of plain words, prophecies, and types in the Old Testament, beginning from God&rsquo;s creation, progressing through Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, man&rsquo;s fall, God&rsquo;s promise of redemption to fallen man, God&rsquo;s dealings with the Patriarchs, God&rsquo;s calling of His chosen people, their redemption, their being formed into a nation, their failure, and their recovery, and concluding with their looking to and waiting for Christ; and all the records of plain words, prophecies, and signs in the New Testament, beginning from John the Baptist and the ministry of the Lord Jesus, progressing through the Lord Jesus&rsquo; death, resurrection, ascension, and ministry after His ascension, the work of the apostles, the calling, salvation, and maturity of the believers, the establishment and building up of the church, the Lord Jesus&rsquo; second coming and the things that He will do in His second coming, the establishment of the millennial kingdom, the termination of Satan and his followers, including demons and human beings, and the passing away of the old heaven and the old earth, and concluding with the coming of the new heaven and new earth, are consummated in the New Jerusalem. She is the goal of God&rsquo;s eternal economy and the crystallization of God&rsquo;s work throughout the ages.</p>
<p>The New Jerusalem is the conclusion not only of the whole Bible, but also of the entire divine revelation.<sup>275</sup> The Triune God, His economy, Christ&rsquo;s redemption, God&rsquo;s salvation, the believers, the church, and the kingdom all consummate in this one item&mdash;the New Jerusalem,<sup>276</sup> which is the greatest and highest divine sign in the New Testament, and the one richest in meaning. She is the heart&rsquo;s delight of the loving God; she is also the meaning of life of God&rsquo;s beloved in eternity. This shows the important position of the New Jerusalem in the Bible and her profound contents in the divine revelation. We must not interpret this noble revelation in God&rsquo;s Word according to our natural view or religious superstition.<sup>277</sup></p>
<h2 class="head3">A Sign</h2>
<p>The book of Revelation itself indicates that we should interpret the New Jerusalem not according to the letter but as a sign [1:1].<sup>278</sup> If we would understand the significance of the New Jerusalem as a sign, we need to see the crucial importance of the first verse of Revelation. This verse is the key to open up the entire book. Without this key, the book of Revelation will be closed to us.<sup>279</sup> A sign is a symbol with a spiritual significance, such as the seven lampstands, signifying the seven churches; the seven stars, signifying the messengers of the churches (v. 20); and the beast from the sea, signifying Antichrist (13:1). In 5:6 Christ is presented as a Lamb. Since Christ is not literally a lamb, the Lamb here must also be a sign. In John 1:29 Christ is called &ldquo;the Lamb of God.&rdquo; In the typology in the Old Testament, the Passover lamb (Exo. 12:3) signifies Christ as the One offered to God for our redemption. This is the spiritual significance of the sign of the Lamb in the book of Revelation. Just as the Lamb in Revelation 5 is a sign, so the New Jerusalem in Revelation 21 and 22 is also a sign. Only when we interpret the New Jerusalem as a sign with a spiritual significance will we have a clear view and a proper understanding of the New Jerusalem.<sup>280</sup></p>
