   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SHORTAGE OF THE VISION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I have been with many of you brothers in the English-speaking world for over twenty-two years.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Truthfully speaking, many of you are still under a kind of ignorance.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What you do, what you say, and how you take care of the churches, indicates that you are short of the vision that I have seen and that the Lord has been speaking to us for the past twenty-two years.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I am especially regretful that it is as if some of you have never heard the messages given in the elders training of 1984.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>What a revelation was in those messages!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Since those messages were delivered, though, has there ever been a change in you?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Has there been a change in your being, in your service, and in your taking care of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to my observation, there has not been much change.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>That training of twelve days with three messages each day may have become a vanity to some of you.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In those messages the New Testament ministry, the vision of the Lord s recovery, the way to carry out the vision, and other crucial matters concerning the practice of the Lord s recovery were stressed very much.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One strong point in these messages is that the elders should not control the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Even after that fellowship, in some churches, stronger control was exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The more the Lord in His ministry tells us not to control the church, the more control is exercised by some.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is a cause for much suffering, and this is a proof that those messages were not effective for some.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To control the saints is a shame.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you control a church you will suffer spiritual death.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>History testifies to this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>You cannot control God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Holy Spirit would not allow you to do such a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even the spirits within the saints would not allow this.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The leading ones are slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the Life-study of Matthew I told the sisters who are the wives of the elders to consider themselves as the wives of slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Although I gave such a strong word in 1976, many went back afterwards to be nearly the kings in their locality.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul, in his ministry, considered himself as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In 2 Corinthians 4:5 he said, For we do not preach ourselves, but Christ Jesus as Lord, and ourselves as your slaves for Jesus sake.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I do not control the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I simply speak the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I do not have the intention to control anyone, but I do have a burden to release the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because of this, so many of the saints listen to me.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You may try to get people to listen to you, but the more you do this the more they will go away from you.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Whether or not the saints would listen to you depends upon how much you could minister to them.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You are here because you received the help from the ministry of the holy Word, but regrettably you only received the help according to your taste.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You did not take the ministry that comes from the Lord absolutely.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a result, you have suffered.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You should pray, Lord, help me to take my hands off.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I would go back only to serve your flock as a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I would not control anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The holy Word is more than clear on this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Matthew 23:8-11, the Lord told the disciples, But you, do not be called Rabbi; for one is your Teacher, and you are all brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>And do not call anyone your father on the earth; for One is your Father, He who is in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Neither be called leaders, because One is your Leader, the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>And the greater among you shall be your servant.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Because of these verses, some brothers in England in the last century picked up the term brethren.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>First Peter 5:3 says to the elders, Nor as lording it over the allotments, but becoming patterns of the flock.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The elders must set themselves up as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Labor to be an example.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If there is the need of cleaning, you have to do the cleaning first.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If there is the need of vacuuming, you have to do the vacuuming first.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If there is the need of cleaning the restroom, you have to do it as a pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You should not sit on a throne giving orders, ruling others.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is not such a thing as a local headship.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The only headship in the church is the heavenly headship.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When some referred to me as an elder or an apostle, this was an insult to me.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am just a small man, without fame, without degree, trying the best to be a slave to serve not only the saints but also the sinners by ministering the Word which the Lord has opened up to me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Many of the brothers can testify for me that I never exercised any kind of authority to control anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do not think that I am deaf or I am blind to the problems in the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>I have a lot of feeling concerning all the churches, but I would never control the churches or say anything to control them.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whenever I hear something concerning some problems in the churches my practice is to pray for them.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>I exhort all of you brothers not to control the church you are caring for.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If possible, some of you should resign from the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In the Bible there is a way for the appointing ones to deal with the wrong elders 1 Tim 5:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is very rarely done because we do not believe in controlling, and we do not believe in adjusting.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>I only believe in the Lord s mercy and grace and in His holy Word moving in you by His gracious Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is all that I trust in. I trust in His mercy, His grace, the Word, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>I do not like to control anything, to adjust anything, or to direct anything, but I like to pray for you to receive mercy, grace, the Word, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I do have a full trust in these four things, but it depends upon your attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Will you receive the mercy?</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Will you receive the grace?</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Will you receive the Word in an absolute way and not according to your choice, to your taste, to your preference, or to your priority?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Just receive His mercy, His grace, and His Word absolutely and His Spirit unconditionally.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>THE UNIQUE MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>GOD S ECONOMY IN FAITH</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the elders training of 1984 we spoke strongly concerning the unique ministry of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>However, in the time since then some have endeavored to teach something different, to carry out something that differs from the unique ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In 1 Timothy 1 Paul says, Even as I urged you, when I was going into Macedonia, to remain in Ephesus in order that you might charge certain ones not to teach differently.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>To teach differently mainly does not refer to heresy.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Rather it refers to the Old Testament things, such as the law and the genealogies 1 Tim 1:4, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>These are the things which are different from the testimony of Jesus and from God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This economy of God is not by any feeling or by an outward seeing.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Faith is a term that concerns the entire New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Galatians 3:23-25 says that before faith came we were under law.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Now that faith is come, we are no longer under the law.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>We have received the Holy Spirit not by an outward work, but by the hearing of faith Gal 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Christ makes His home in our hearts through faith Eph 3:17 not through our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Paul said in 2 Corinthians 4:13 that he spoke by the spirit of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>In the following chapter he said that we walk not by appearance, not by anything seen or felt, but by faith 2 Cor 5:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Regeneration is not something you can see.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Sanctification is not something that you can see.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Transformation is not something you can see.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Can you see the conformity to Christ s death?</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Probably the only thing that people will see will be our glorification.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>We all will be in glory; then all will see.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>But before that consummating item of God s salvation, nothing is visible.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>Nothing is by sight.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Everything is by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Often when we quote Ephesians 3:17 and 1 Timothy 1:4, we do not include the words through faith or in faith.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In Hebrews 6:4-5 Paul said that we have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have tasted the good word of God, and the works of power of the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>God has given us a foretaste of the things of the coming age, and many of the things of the coming age will be by sight, not by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>When the millennium comes, there will be a great restoration Isa 11:6-9, 35:5-10; 65:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>But today all the bequests of the New Testament blessings are by faith, not by sight.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In last year s elders training, this was stressed very much.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>But it seems that in the months since that time this word has become a vanity to some of you.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>At that time the entire vision of the Lord s recovery was presented to you concerning God, concerning Christ, concerning the Spirit, concerning the believers, concerning the church, concerning the kingdom, and concerning the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>According to my observation nearly all of the elders labor quite much, but in your labor you do not care much for the vision.</S>
