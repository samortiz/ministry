   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BETWEEN SLAVES AND MASTERS A. Slaves</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 6:5-9 Paul deals with the relationship between slaves and masters.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Concerning this relationship, he exhorts the slaves first because the source of trouble is mostly with them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 5 says, The slaves, obey your masters according to flesh with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the apostle s time, slaves were purchased by their masters, and the masters had the right over their lives.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some slaves and some masters became brothers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>As brothers in the church, they were equal.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But in their homes those who were slaves still had to obey the brothers who were their masters according to flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Paul exhorts the slaves to obey with fear and trembling, in singleness of heart, as to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Fear is the inward motive, and trembling is the outward attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Singleness means to be pure in motive, with only a single purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The slaves are to be single; they are not to have a double purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>That is, they are not to serve their masters with the intention of receiving some gain for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The slaves are to be in obedience to their masters as to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that the slaves are to regard their masters as if they were the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The relationship between slaves and masters is a type of our relationship with Christ, our Master.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should obey Him as a slave, in singleness of heart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In verse 6 Paul goes on to say, Not with eye-service as men-pleasers, but as slaves of Christ, doing the will of God from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a brother in slavery stands in his position and obeys his master, he is in the eyes of the Lord a slave of Christ, doing the will of God, and his service is as to the Lord and not to men v. 7 . Such a slave is to do the will of God from the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The words from the soul here equal from the heart, from the inner being.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This means to serve not only with the physical body, but with the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The slaves were to serve as to the Lord and not to men.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that Paul s intention was to direct the slaves to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His desire was that they would learn to serve their masters as the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Concerning the slaves, Paul concludes in verse 8, Knowing that whatever good thing each one does, this he shall receive from the Lord, whether a slave or a freeman.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The word this refers to the good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Whatever good thing we do, we shall receive the same from the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If the slaves do something good, the Lord will return to them that same good thing.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This means that the good thing they do will become a reward to them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>B. Masters</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In verse 9 Paul says, And the masters, do the same things toward them, giving up threatening, knowing that both their Master and yours is in the heavens, and there is no respect of persons with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The masters who had the right over the lives of their purchased slaves should give up threatening, because the Lord in the heavens is the real Master of both them and the slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the flesh, some may be slaves, and others may be masters.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But in the eyes of the Lord, there is no difference between slaves and masters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>According to Colossians 3:11, in the new man there is no slave or freeman.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In the church, we all are brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, in the flesh there still is the distinction between slaves and masters.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Regarding all these exhortations, Paul is making one key point: For the sake of the church life, we need to have a proper human living in this present age.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is an extremely important lesson for us all to learn.</S>
