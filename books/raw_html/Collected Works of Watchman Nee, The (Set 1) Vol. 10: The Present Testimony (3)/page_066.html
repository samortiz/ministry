<H1 CLASS=TITLE>AN OPEN LETTER</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 31</H2><P>Brothers, I have recently felt, more strongly than ever before, that if we want to serve the Lord, we must specifically know the Lord. Many experiences, many gifts, and considerable Bible knowledge cannot present Christ in a living way to people. We must know what He can do for us. Each day we must depend on Him to do what we cannot do, to live a life which we cannot live. Nothing should be out of us, everything should be out of Christ! It is not a matter of what we can or cannot do. It is a matter of what Christ can do. To see this, realize this, and experience this is life, power, and a miracle! Christ is all. Blessed are those who realize this. Only they can lead others to enter into the life of Christ.</P><P>Under God's further shining, I have seen that there is nothing in me but failure. In the last few years, although we have seen God's blessing in many ways, God has still been limited. Many times I waited for the sympathy of the Body or for confirmation in the environment. But in the end, because of our fear of men, these only became snares. Henceforth, may there be "only Christ." May we all be able to say, "Henceforth let no one trouble me, for I bear in my body the brands of Jesus."</P><P>Many brothers have written to me and asked if and when we are going to have a special conference this year. Let me answer these questions all at one time. For many reasons we will not have time for a conference this fall. Some co-working brothers felt that the dry, clear weather in the fall would be a better time for us to go out to preach the gospel and that it would be a pity to use this good weather for a conference. They felt that since the rainy, windy weather in the spring hinders us from going out to preach the gospel, it would be better for us to use the spring for a conference. Concerning this matter, we now are waiting for God's confirmation in our spirit. If it is according to His will, we may have a conference during this winter vacation. We have not made any decision at this point in time. After we have decided, we will, of course, send forth an open announcement.</P><P>May the peace of Christ be with you all!</P><P>A servant of Christ<br>Watchman Nee, Shanghai<br>October 20, 1933</P>
