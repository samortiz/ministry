   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Second, truth in the New Testament denotes Christ, who is God incarnated and in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily Col 2:9 , to be the reality of: a God and man John 1:18, 51; 1 Tim 2:5 ; b all the types, figures, and shadows of the Old Testament Col 2:16-17; John 4:23-24 ; and c all the divine and spiritual things, such as the divine life and resurrection John 11:25; 14:6 , the divine light John 8:12; 9:5 , the divine way John 14:6 , wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, redemption 1 Cor 1:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Hence, Christ is the reality John 14:6; Eph 4:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Third, truth is the Spirit, who is Christ transfigured 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 3:17 , the reality of Christ John 14:16-17; 15:26 and of the divine revelation John 16:13-15 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Hence, the Spirit is the reality 1 John 5:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now we can see that truth, aletheia, in the New Testament refers to God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Truth is God as the divine light and love incarnated to be the reality of all the divine things for our possession so that we may enjoy God as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that the very God is the truth, the reality, of the divine things for our possession.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, we need to possess God as the reality and then enjoy Him as grace.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, the divine reality is actually God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He is the reality of all the divine things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Truth in the New Testament also denotes Christ as God incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ is the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As the embodiment of the fullness of the Godhead, Christ, who is God incarnate, is the reality of God and man, the reality of all the types, figures, and shadows of the Old Testament, and the reality of all the divine and spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What is truth?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>What is reality?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Reality is Christ as God incarnate.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Reality is Christ as the One in whom all the fullness of the Godhead dwells bodily to be the reality of God, man, the types, figures, and shadows, and all divine and spiritual things.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the Old Testament we have many types, figures, and shadows.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Christ is the reality of them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the Bible we also read of many divine and spiritual things, such as life, light, wisdom, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Christ Himself is the reality of all these things.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, when we read the word truth or reality in the New Testament, we need to realize that it refers first to God and also to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We have indicated that in the New Testament truth denotes the Spirit, who is Christ transfigured and also the reality of Christ and of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>For this reason, in 5:6, John says, The Spirit is He who testifies, because the Spirit is the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is surely worthwhile for us to study thoroughly the meaning of truth in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In this message we have pointed out in a very brief way that truth, reality, is God, Christ, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the following message we shall go on to consider other aspects of truth according to the Word of God.</S>
