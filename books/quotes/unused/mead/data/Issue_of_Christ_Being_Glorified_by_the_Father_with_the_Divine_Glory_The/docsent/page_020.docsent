   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Prayer: Lord, we thank You that we could come back to You to wait on You until You show us this universal view of Your universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lord, we are short of words to utter it.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need You to be our utterance.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Lord, You have to defeat Your enemy, who has been cheating and deceiving Your saints for centuries.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Your elect through the past twenty centuries have been blinded, veiled, from seeing this.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Thank You that today at the consummation of this dark age You are so merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>You have come to Your recovery to open up this matter, to show us something which the angels and the worldly people have never seen.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We ask You to open our eyes, and we are here seeking after You to see this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>With these messages, I feel that we all need to see a vision, not just learn the doctrine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have to see that in the entire universe, there is only one thing that God wants, that is, the universal incorporation of Himself as the consummated God with the regenerated believers.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In these days, this great universal incorporation is before me moment by moment.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The entire world will go into the lake of fire.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The only thing left will be this great universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although the word incorporation is not used in the New Testament, what is actually unveiled in the New Testament in the way of a vision is this universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This incorporation started from God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Triune God does have three parties the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The three in the Divine Trinity were incorporated already in eternity past.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Through His incarnation, this incorporated One came into time.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Whatever He does in time is to incorporate all His chosen ones into His incorporation to make a great universal incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have seen that the way to be incorporated into this unique incorporation is to enjoy Christ, to eat Him, to partake of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why the New Testament stresses the matter of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord said, "I am the bread of life....he who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me" John 6:48, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we eat Him, we live by Him in this great incorporation, which today is the corporate Body of Christ and which eventually consummates the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In John 16:12-15 the Lord said that He had many things to tell the disciples which they could not bear at that time.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But when the Spirit of reality would come, He would unveil these things to them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These things were unveiled in the twenty-two Epistles of the New Testament, including Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Revelation is the longest Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Epistles reveal that God's goal is to have a great universal incorporation of Himself with His believers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Ultimately, this incorporation is the New Jerusalem, which is God's goal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In our ministry we have used three words to describe the believers' relationship with the Triune God: union, mingling, and incorporation.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When I was in mainland China before 1949, we mostly used the word union.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have a divine union in life with God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are united to Him in life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I went from mainland China to Taiwan, we began to put out a paper called The Ministry of the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>That publication served all the churches in southeast Asia in the Chinese language.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>While I was writing for this publication, I realized that the relationship we have with our Triune God is not only one of union but also one of mingling.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When I came to the United States, I began to use the word mingling quite much.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the early history of the church, some taught heresy by saying that the two natures of Christ were merged into one and became a third nature.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is not the proper understanding of the word mingle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We agree with the definition of this word in Webster's unabridged dictionary, which says that to mingle is "to combine or join one thing with another, or two or more things together , especially so that the original elements are distinguishable in the combination."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>According to this definition, when two or more things are mingled together, their original natures are not lost but remain distinguishable.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When God and man were mingled together, they became one entity but no third nature was produced.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This is according to the type in Leviticus 2:4-5 of the fine flour mingled with oil to make the meal offering.</S>
