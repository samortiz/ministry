<h2 class="head2">E. To Be Separated unto God Positionally</h2><p>In order for us to be holy, we first need to be separated unto God positionally. With respect to our family, neighbors, colleagues, and friends, we need to be separated. Many Christians, however, are saved, but not separated. Normally, once a person is saved, he should also be separated. This is the reason a believer is called a saint. Consider the majority of Christians today. They are virtually the same as the worldly people. With them, there is no separation. Many of their relatives and friends do not even know that they are Christians. But to be holy is to be separated unto God. This, of course, is a matter of position.</p><h2 class="head3">1. By the Redeeming Blood of Christ</h2><p>We have been separated unto God by the redeeming blood of Christ (Heb. 9:14). But we cannot see the power of the blood of Christ in many Christians today. All Christians believe that they have been redeemed, but in some there is no sign of the redeeming blood. The sign of the blood is a sign of separation. If you have been redeemed by the blood, then you should bear the sign of separation. Others may be free to say or do certain things, but you are not. Even if you can do those things, you refrain from doing them because you have been redeemed by the blood. With you there is a sign that you are different, separated. Other people may utter certain words, go certain places, or buy certain things, but we cannot because we are separated and bear the sign of the redeeming blood. The blood has sanctified and separated us.</p><h2 class="head3">2. By the Holy Spirit</h2><p>We also are separated unto God by the Holy Spirit (1 Cor. 6:11; 1 Pet. 1:2; Rom. 15:16). Because the power of the Spirit overshadows us, we cannot use certain words, go to certain places, or do certain things. But this does not mean that we are under regulations. No, it simply means that we are under the redeeming blood and in the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head3">3. In the Name of the Lord Jesus</h2><p>We have a sanctified position, not only by the blood and by the Spirit, but also in the name of the Lord Jesus (1 Cor. 6:11). Because we bear the name of the Lord Jesus, we should not shame His name by being common. Others may go to sporting events or to the movies, but we would not go because we do not want to shame the Lord&rsquo;s name. His name must keep us separate. Do not ask whether a certain thing is sinful or not sinful. Separation is not related to whether or not something is sinful; it is a matter of whether we are common or separated. We must bear some sign that we are under the blood, in the Spirit, and in the name of the Lord Jesus.</p><p>Admittedly, separation is not a very deep matter; it is merely positional. But do not think that position is unimportant. It means a great deal. We have a position as saints, as separated ones, and we need to keep it.</p><h2 class="head3">4. Before Justification</h2><p>According to doctrine, this aspect of sanctification comes before justification (1 Cor. 6:11). Positional sanctification precedes justification, but dispositional sanctification follows justification. Before we are justified, we are sanctified by the blood, by the Holy Spirit, and in the name of the Lord Jesus.</p>
