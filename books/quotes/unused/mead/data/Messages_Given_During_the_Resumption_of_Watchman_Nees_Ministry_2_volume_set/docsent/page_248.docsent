   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO BE TRANSPARENT A. Not Trusting in the Mind or the Thoughts,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>but Exercising the Spirit to Contact God</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We must always learn to touch God in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We can never touch Him in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A piece of wood can never conduct electricity; only metal will conduct electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today, God is Spirit, and we have to learn to reject our own thoughts and to exercise ourselves to live in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If our minds are too strong and our thoughts too active, we will not be able to touch the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Some may wonder if this is a kind of strategy to fool ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But this is absolutely not a kind of strategy to fool ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only through the spirit can a person touch God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If you try to touch God with your head, you will not touch Him even if you break your skull.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I have met a few people who are not as intelligent and clever as I am.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Although they are not as clever as I am, and although their minds are not as intelligent as mine is, they have learned to touch the Spirit with their spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The ugliest thing there is for a person to do is to touch the things of God with his own cleverness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What does it mean to use our mind, and what does it mean to use our spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>For example, before you go to see a brother, you should learn to have some fellowship with the Lord within you.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When that brother speaks in his spirit, you should listen quietly and prayerfully before God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But the trouble with us is that many times when we meet the brothers, we exercise our mind without exercising our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you go to see a brother and you prepare a speech first before you go, your speaking will surely be from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This kind of speaking from the mind will damage you and will damage others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You are not being wise by doing that.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Only those who live in the spirit are the truly wise ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a man lives in his soul, he will not be able to see God's revelations.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>What is a babe?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A babe is one who has a simple mind.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Perhaps a man should be weeping when he touches his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But because his mind is too clever, he ends up laughing instead of weeping.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Everything that comes from the mind is deceitful.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A child does not act from his mind, but from his feelings only.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, everything that he expresses is true and not false.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Do not think that you can deceive a spiritual person.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Although a spiritual person may look simple, he can read what is in your innermost being.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A spiritual person discerns all things 1 Cor 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All those who have smart ears and bright eyes are deceitful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some people are very good at talking, but will good answers justify what a person does?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church is not a law court; it is not a place where we arbitrate cases.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Today, we cannot touch others with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to learn to touch others with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even in reading the Bible, we have to learn to exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We cannot read the Bible with our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Day before yesterday I received two letters.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Both of them were written from the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Today, all our problems arise from our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>What we need to do is to put our spirit in the forefront and our mind at the back.</S>
