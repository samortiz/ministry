<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE OVERCOMERS</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Rev. 2:7, 11, 17, 26; 3:5, 12, 21</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>OUTLINE</H2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>Not disappointed or discouraged but strengthened and enabled to stand for and live out the divine economy.</li><li>To conquer all the satanic chaos and carry out the unique divine economy:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>By the processed and consummated Triune God as the all-sufficient grace&#151;1 Cor. 15:10; 2 Cor. 12:9; 2 Tim. 4:22.</li>	<li>According to the truth, of which the church, the manifestation of God in the flesh, is the pillar and base&#151;1 Tim. 3:15-16.</li>	<li>In the following conditions:		<ol class="decimal">		<li>Loving the Lord with the first love&#151;Rev. 2:4.</li>		<li>Enjoying eating Christ as the tree of life in the church as today's Paradise to be a shining lampstand --Rev. 2:7, 5.</li>		<li>Being faithful unto death in suffering poverty and trial for the crown of life&#151;Rev. 2:9-10.</li>		<li>Enjoying Christ as the hidden manna, a special portion of the nourishing supply, to overcome the worldliness of the degraded church with the idolatrous teaching of Balaam and the hierarchical teaching of the Nicolaitans --Rev. 2:12-17a.</li>		<li>Being transformed to be a "white stone," justified and approved by the Lord, for the building up of the house of God, with a "new name" according to the transformation in life&#151;Rev. 2:17b.</li>		<li>Standing strongly against the Romish teaching of Jezebel, which is full of fornication, idolatry, and the deep things of Satan&#151;Rev. 2:20, 24a.</li>		<li>Fleeing the spiritual death, being living in reality with nothing dying in imperfection, and walking in "white garments" without any defilement, that their name should not be erased out of the book of life but confessed by the Lord before His Father and His Father's angels&#151;Rev. 3:1-2, 4-5.</li>		<li>Keeping the Lord's word of endurance and not denying the Lord's name unto the last bit of their power, that they may be kept out of the hour of trial, which is coming to try all those who dwell on the earth, and that they may receive the crown of reward to be pillars in the temple of God with the name of God, the name of the city of God, the New Jerusalem, and Christ's new name written upon them&#151;Rev. 3:8b, 10-12.</li>		<li>Being hot, instead of being lukewarm, to buy gold refined by fire, white garments, and eyesalve that they may not be spewed out of the Lord's mouth, but may be invited to dine with the Lord and to sit with Him on His throne&#151;Rev. 3:15-21.</li>		</ol></li>	</ol></li></ol><P>In the two previous chapters we saw the divine economy and the satanic chaos in the Old and New Testaments. In this chapter we want to see a particular group of persons&#151;the overcomers. The Bible is a book concerning God with man. In between God and man there is a third party, Satan. Satan always makes trouble, and all the trouble is the chaos. The Lord needs a group of people, the overcomers, who will be one with Him to conquer all the destructive chaos and triumph in His unique constructive economy.</P>
