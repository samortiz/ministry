   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PERMEATED WITH THE TRIUNE GOD TO LIVE CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is crucial for us to see that the fullness of the Godhead embodied in the Son becomes the unsearchable riches of Christ, that the riches of Christ, the Son, are realized as the bountiful supply of the Spirit, and that this bountiful supply is now embodied in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we read the Word and pray-read it, we can touch the essence and substance of the Word: the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we merely read the Word without prayer, we may not get anything more than objective knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But by praying with the Word we touch the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As a result, we enjoy the bountiful supply of the Spirit, the riches of Christ, and the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Perhaps now you can understand why this message has such a long title: The Riches of Christ Realized in the Bountiful Supply of the Spirit and the Bountiful Supply of the Spirit Embodied in the Rich Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we would live Christ, we need to read the Word and pray-read it in such a way that we partake of the fullness of God, the riches of Christ, and the bountiful supply of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Oh, we need to be immersed in and saturated with the fullness of the Godhead, the riches of Christ, and the bountiful supply of the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Then, having been permeated with the Triune God, we shall live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We all need to be permeated with the bountiful supply of the Spirit, the riches of Christ, and the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All this is in the Word and in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Thus, we must come to the Word constantly and pray unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>By pray-reading the Word, we shall touch the supply of the Spirit, the riches of Christ, and the fullness of the Godhead.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then we shall partake of all that the Triune God is, and spontaneously we shall live Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Living Christ is not a matter of making up our mind to have a change in our way of living.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We should not say, Now I have learned what it means to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I make up my mind to live Him, and I pray that God will help me do this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>O God, help me to live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This way does not work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If you pray like this, you will find that immediately after praying you will continue to live yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The way to live Christ is to first be permeated by Him with all His riches.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Again and again we have pointed out that these riches are in the Spirit and in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>THE ANTENNA AND THE GROUND WIRE</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We may liken the bountiful supply of the Spirit to electricity, which reaches us by means of an antenna and a ground wire.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Spirit Himself is like the antenna, and the Bible is like the ground wire.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When we have both the antenna and the ground wire, both the Spirit and the Word, functioning together, we receive the bountiful supply of the Spirit as the heavenly electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our experience testifies of this.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When we exercise our spirit to pray-read a verse, we have the sense within of being supplied, refreshed, enlightened, watered, nourished, comforted, and strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the enjoyment of the divine electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Use the antenna and the ground wire, the Spirit and the Word, and you will receive this bountiful supply.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The principle is the same with coming to know the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The way to know God s will is not to pray, O Lord, You know how foolish I am.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Show me Your way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This kind of prayer does not work very well.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Instead of praying like this, simply enjoy the Word and the Spirit, allowing the heavenly electricity to infuse you with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As you receive the infusion of the bountiful supply of the Spirit, the will of God will become clear to you automatically and spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>You will know that you should not do certain things, for they are not the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You will also know that you should do certain other things, for they are God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You will not need others to tell you what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The divine infusion you enjoy inwardly will make you clear.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Furthermore, as you are immersed in the Triune God and permeated with the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ, you will spontaneously live Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Praise the Lord for showing us the way to live Christ!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The way is to enjoy the Triune God by reading and pray-reading the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we touch the bountiful supply of the Spirit, we shall live a life that expresses Christ, a life which actually is Christ Himself.</S>
