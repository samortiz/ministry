   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>EMPOWERED</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Ephesians 6:10 says, For the rest, be empowered in the Lord and in the might of His strength.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Greek word here rendered empowered has the same root as the word power in 1:19.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To deal with God s enemy, to fight against the evil force of darkness, we need to be empowered with the greatness of the power that raised up Christ from the dead and seated Him in the heavens, far above all the evil spirits in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The fact that we are to be empowered in the Lord indicates that in the spiritual warfare against Satan and his evil kingdom, we can fight only in the Lord, not in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Whenever we are in ourselves, we are defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The charge to be empowered implies the need to exercise our will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If we would be empowered for spiritual warfare, our will must be strong and exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We should not be like jellyfish, those who are weak-willed and vacillating.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Actually, it is those with a strong will who are most able to repent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Consider Saul of Tarsus as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As he was traveling to Damascus with the intention of arresting all those who called on the name of the Lord Jesus, he was apprehended by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Because Saul had such a strong will, he could have a strong repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In addition to preserving our conscience, God has sovereignly preserved our will.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If He had not done so, the preaching of the gospel could have no effect on people.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may mistakenly think that it is difficult to preach the gospel to one with a strong will.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to my experience, most of those who were saved through my gospel preaching were those with a strong will and a definite intention.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Such a will is able to function positively in repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Repentance requires the exercise of the will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In like manner, to be empowered also involves our will.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On the day of Pentecost Peter told the people to be saved from that crooked generation Acts 2:40, Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>. This command seems to be both active and passive, with the word be implying something active and the word saved, something passive.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The same is true of Paul s command in 6:10 to be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>An active element be is combined with a passive element empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We need to exercise our will to be empowered in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In chapter four we see that we must be renewed v. 23 and in chapter five, that we must be submissive 5:21 . For the new man, we need to be renewed; for the Bride, we need to be submissive; and for the warrior, we need to be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the warrior, we must go into battle not as a gentleman or as a lovely Bride, but as a lion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Therefore, for the new man, the Bride, and the warrior, let us be renewed, submissive, and empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The fact that we need to be empowered in the Lord indicates that we cannot fight the spiritual warfare in ourselves; we can fight only in the Lord and in the might of His strength.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In 6:10 Paul refers to power, might, and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Firstly, we are empowered by the power that raised Christ from among the dead and made Him to be the Head over all things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we know God s might and strength.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>PUTTING ON THE WHOLE ARMOR OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Verse 11 opens with the words, Put on the whole armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To fight the spiritual warfare, we need not only the power of the Lord, but also the armor of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our weapons do not avail, but God s armor, even the whole armor of God, does.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The whole armor of God is for the entire Body, not for any individual member of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church is a corporate warrior, and the believers together make up this unique warrior.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only the corporate warrior can wear the whole armor of God; no individual believer can.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We must fight the spiritual warfare in the Body, not individually.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The charge to put on the whole armor of God is an imperative, a command.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God has provided the armor for us, but He does not put it on for us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, we ourselves must put on the armor God has provided.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For this, we need to be empowered.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Although God can empower us, we still must exercise our will to cooperate with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the same principle, we must cooperate with God s command to put on the armor.</S>
