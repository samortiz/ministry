   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>It is important in our study of the Word to have our thoughts enter into the thoughts of the writers of the Bible and to have our thoughts enter into the thoughts of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, this is only the initial step.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Without this step, we cannot study the Bible at all.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But even when we have made this step, we may not be reading the Bible correctly.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Bible is not made up just of thought.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The most important thing about the Bible is that God's Spirit is released through this book.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Peter, John, Matthew, Mark, and every writer of the Bible had the same experience: As they were writing the Bible under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, they wrote according to a certain train of thought, but at the same time, their spirits were released along with the release of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The world can never understand that behind the words of the Scriptures there is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the Spirit is released, the prophets come alive, as it were, and speak to us once again.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we hear a prophet speaking today, we have to realize that his speaking contains not only words and thoughts but something else.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This something is mysterious, even though within us we are clear that this "something" is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible contains not only thoughts but the release of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, the basic and most crucial requirement of all in reading the Bible is to be able to release one's spirit to touch the spirit of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have to strike the spirit of the Bible with our own spirit before we can understand the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Suppose a naughty boy breaks a window of a neighbor's house and the owner of the house runs out to scold the child.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When the mother finds out, she will scold the child as well.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>But there is a different feeling associated with the scolding of the owner than with the scolding of the mother.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Outwardly, both are scoldings.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But the "spirits" behind the scoldings are different.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The owner of the house scolds out of anger; his is a spirit of wrath.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The mother's scolding is filled with love, hope, and education.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Her rebuke is a rebuke of love, a rebuke of hope, and a rebuke for education.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The two spirits are entirely different.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a simple illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Spirit behind the writing of the Bible is much stronger than the kind of "spirit" mentioned above.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Spirit behind the writing of the Bible is an eternal Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is still with us today; it forever saturates the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If our outer man is broken and our spirit is released, our thoughts will not only become one with the thoughts of the Bible, but our whole being will touch the very Spirit that is behind the writing of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If our spirit is not released and we are cut off from the spirit of the authors of the Bible, we will never understand God's Word; the Bible will be a dead book to us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, we are back to the same fundamental issue: The outer man has to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our thoughts will become fruitful and our spirit will be free to flow only when the outer man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Only then will God not be restricted by us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The problem we face today is that we are constantly frustrating God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even in the study of the Bible we frustrate God and limit His freedom.</S>
