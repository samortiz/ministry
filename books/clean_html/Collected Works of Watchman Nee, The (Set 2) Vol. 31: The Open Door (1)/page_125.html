<h2 class="head1">NEWS OF THE CHURCHES</h2><h2 class="head2">A Letter from Brother Chou Shing-yi,<br />Shanghai</h2><p>Greetings to X in the Lord:</p><p>My mother, sister, and I arrived safely in Shanghai from Mo-Gan-Shan on the tenth of this month. Brother Tang Shou-ling, Brother Sun Wen-yuan, Sister Yu Siao-ke, Sister Yeh Chui-chung, and their families are temporarily staying on the mountain. The situation on the mountain can still be called peaceful. There is still food; however, it is not a place where one can live permanently. Therefore, the Tang and Yeh families want to come back to Shanghai. The Sun and Yu families have not decided where to go. I was originally going to travel with the brothers and sisters, but God gave me a clear leading and miraculously opened a way for me to come, so I came before Brother Tang and the others. In this time of emergency, it is very difficult to get out of the war zone to a safe place. I thought that since God had opened a special way for me, I should go ahead and take it. If one family can leave, there is one less family to worry about. Brother Tang was hit by bandits in the chest with the handle of a rifle. The wound was very serious at the time, but thank God for His grace; it healed quickly. Although we have passed through many experiences in the past half year, including burning, robbery, plots, sickness, and dangers, we have clearly seen God's gracious doings in all these things. God's presence, protection, and faithful promises and the power of His will were more real to us. I rejoice the most in the fact that I had an opportunity to absolutely seek God and to touch Him in all these things. I was also able to quietly read His Word. In reality, this was God's answer to my prayer. I had been praying to God for some time for a rest of six months to a year. We never stopped meeting during our time of fleeing the war. Brother Tang conducted a Bible study on Revelation. He gave us much new light and showed us that the day of the Lord is pressing close. I deeply believe that we passed through everything so safely because of the brothers' and sisters' prayers. Therefore, please continue to pray for the brothers and sisters left on the mountain. It is almost impossible to send letters to Mo-Gan-Shan unless you find someone to take them for you. A few days after I came back to Shanghai, some people went there, so I gave them some money to take to the ones there. I will stay in Shanghai temporarily. I am considering where I will go next and will tell you when I am clear. My mother and sister send their greetings. They are very healthy now. Peace in the Lord. Greet Sister Chang, Sister Wang, and Brother Yu-zhi. Please greet all the brothers and sisters in Chungking.</p><p>Your brother,<br />Hsing-yi<br />April 18<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Shanghai</h2><p>Dear X in the Lord:</p><p>Sister Jin Bao-jieh from Ping-Hu has arrived safely in Shanghai. The Lord really cared for her and protected her along the way during her flight to safety. (Her own story is printed in the Shanghai Local Newsletter, Issue No. 100. We will not repeat it here&mdash;Editor.) We had a baptism meeting recently, and more than ten brothers and sisters were baptized. We are wiring X dollars for the work in Szechuan, Kweichow, and Yunnan. Please ask Brother X to distribute them. X dollars are from a brother in Chefoo, and the rest is from the church in Shanghai. (We have received the money and will give the full amount designated for Yunnan to Yunnan. We distributed some of the money for Szechuan and Kweichow to the work in western Hunan and Hankow. May the Lord bless these barley loaves and this new ear of grain so that other localities will also receive His blessing&mdash;Editor.) Peace in the Lord!</p><p>Your brothers,<br />Tu Jung-chen, Wu You-an, Lin Kwang-biao<br />March 27<br />[Address omitted]</p>
