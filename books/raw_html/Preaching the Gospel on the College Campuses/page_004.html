<p>In contrast, I have to point out the shortcomings of the present situation in the charismatic movement. In charismatic meetings, they sometimes use rock music, dramas, and all kinds of performances to attract people. These are all gimmicks. The use of these gimmicks shows that the power of the Spirit is lacking. If we have the real power of the Spirit, we do not need any gimmicks. The early disciples did not use any gimmicks, but they had power (Acts 1:8; 4:33; 6:8, 10). On the island of Taiwan, no Christian work can compare or compete with the work of the Lord’s recovery in the preaching of the gospel. There is no use of gimmicks, but the power of the Spirit is there.<p>The power of the Spirit is based upon Christ’s accomplished work. The crucifixion of Christ, the resurrection of Christ, the ascension of Christ, and the baptism in the Holy Spirit have been accomplished. These are all accomplished facts in the universe. If we are going to receive Christ’s redemption accomplished through His death on the cross, we do not need to fast and pray. We just need to exercise our faith to believe in His accomplished redemption according to the Word of God. We can say, “Lord, thank You for Your accomplished work of redemption and for Your resurrection and ascension.” When we say this by faith according to the written Word of God, we get redemption, resurrection, and ascension. In the same way, we should exercise our faith to say, “Lord, thank You for the baptism in the Spirit.”<p>The gospel is constituted with the person and work of Christ. We have to believe that Christ in His person is both God and man to be our Savior. Christ’s work includes His crucifixion, resurrection, ascension, and His baptism of His Body in the Spirit. These are the basic and crucial items of the gospel that we must believe in. The power of the Spirit is based upon Christ’s person and His accomplished work. We should exercise our spirit to say, “Praise the Lord for the baptism in the Spirit. This baptism is mine, and I am right now in this baptism.” We should go to the campus with this faith. Regardless of how we feel, we should only care for the accomplished fact. The baptism in the Spirit has been accomplished.<p>The Spirit today is omnipresent. He is like the air. We do not need to fast and pray to experience the air. Just as the air is in us and we are in the air, so the Spirit is in us and we are in the Spirit. The Spirit is here for us to experience. The Spirit is here because the crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension have all been accomplished, and the Spirit has been poured out. The Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), and according to Revelation 5:6 the Spirit has been intensified sevenfold and sent into the whole earth. He is everywhere. We do not need to fast and pray to experience the baptism in the Spirit. Instead, we should believe in and claim this accomplished fact.<p>Some may argue and say that Peter and the disciples fasted and prayed for ten days. This is true. However, they fasted and prayed before Pentecost. After the Spirit was poured out on the day of Pentecost, the disciples simply exercised their faith to get into the baptism of the Spirit whenever there was a need (Acts 4:8, 31). When you go to the campus, exercise your faith to speak and work in the Spirit.<p>Any proposal to use gimmicks to preach the gospel is a strong proof that we have not exercised our faith. If I only exercised my mentality in the speaking of my messages, my speaking would be poor. I must exercise my spirit to believe that I am in the baptism in the Spirit and that the Lord will speak through me.<p>You do not need any gimmicks to preach the gospel, but you do need to deal with your sins. You do not need to fast and pray, but you do need to open yourself to the Lord and have a renewed consecration. Every day when you go to the campus, you have to say, “Lord, I consecrate myself to You and open up myself anew to You. Cleanse me from all my sins with Your prevailing blood. Thank You that You are the Spirit. I am in You, and You are within me.” Make a thorough confession and apply the blood to all your situations. Then exercise your faith to believe that the Spirit is in you and that you are in the Spirit, under the outpouring of the Spirit. If you do this, you will have such a bold faith, and when you go to the campuses, you will see the difference.
