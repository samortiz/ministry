   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PAUL'S SERVICE AFTER HE GOT SAVED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Let us now contrast Paul's service after he got saved with his service before he got saved.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In every aspect, his service now was opposite to the way he had served before.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Serving with a Vision</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, instead of serving without a vision, Paul served with a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He served with a vision not only in big things but even in small things.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For example, in Galatians 2:1-2a he tells us about his going up to Jerusalem, the capital of the Jewish religion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"After a period of fourteen years I went up again to Jerusalem with Barnabas, taking Titus with me also.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And I went up according to revelation."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The fact that even such a move was done by revelation indicates that Paul was serving with a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Serving Spiritually</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Second, instead of serving traditionally and religiously, Paul now served spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In Romans 1:9 he says, "God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit in the gospel of His Son."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Can you discern what is traditional and religious from what is spiritual?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Anything in the service of God that is not in the spirit but is according to the past is traditional and religious.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We need to learn to serve not according to the past but in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that we should not imitate others and not even imitate our own past.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we imitate, our service will become religious and traditional.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We need to have fresh contact with the Lord in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>However, if we serve merely according to what we know or according to what we remember, our serving will be traditional and religious.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We need to exercise our spirit to contact the Lord to have something new and fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then we will serve with our spirit, not with anything old.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Serving in Spirit</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In contrast to serving according to the knowledge of the Bible in letters, after he got saved, Paul served in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In Romans 2:29 Paul says, "He is a Jew who is one inwardly; and circumcision is of the heart, in spirit, not in letter."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that we must serve not in letter but in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Concerning this, 2 Corinthians 3:6 says that the ministers of the new covenant are ministers "not of the letter but of the Spirit; for the letter kills, but the Spirit gives life."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Serving with Christ</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What is the opposite of serving with self-righteousness?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The opposite of serving with self-righteousness is serving with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When we do not have the heavenly vision, we have self-righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we have the heavenly vision, we no longer have self-righteousness we have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then we serve with Christ, not with self-righteousness.</S>
