   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF FIRST JOHN MESSAGE TWENTY-ONE EXPERIENCING THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING CONCERNING THE TRIUNE GOD Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:18-23 A WORD TO THE YOUNG CHILDREN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 2:13 the apostle John writes a very simple word to the young children, those believers who are very young in the divine life: I write to you, young children, because you have known the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verses 18 through 27 John writes a much longer word to the young children in order to confirm what he has already written to them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the positive side, this further word is concerned with the anointing; on the negative side, it is concerned with the antichrists.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In verse 18 John says, Young children, it is the last hour, and even as you heard that antichrist is coming, even now many antichrists have come; whereby we know that it is the last hour.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The words young children here refer to the young children in verse 13 as the third class of the recipients of this Epistle.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verses 18 through 27 emphasize the knowledge in life vv.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>20-21 and strengthen the word, because you have known the Father, spoken to the young children in verse 13.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In verse 20 John speaks to the young children concerning the anointing: And you have an anointing from the Holy One, and you all know.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The anointing is the moving and working of the indwelling compound Spirit, which is fully typified by the anointing oil, the compound ointment, in Exodus 30:23-25 see Life-study of Exodus, Messages 157-163 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This all-inclusive life-giving Spirit from the Holy One entered into us at the time of our regeneration and abides in us forever v. 27 . It is by this Spirit that the young children have known the Father v. 13 and know the truth v. 21 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>John s word to the young children concerning the anointing has much to do with their growth in life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>John s word here also indicates that all the saints in the church life need to receive the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE ANOINTING TEACHING US</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>CONCERNING THE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If you read verses 18 through 27 carefully, you will see that the teaching of the anointing is mainly a matter of teaching us the mystery of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For years, I have been giving messages on the teaching of the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In those messages I emphasized the fact that the anointing teaches us concerning all things, that is, concerning everything in our daily Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In this message I would like to consider the teaching of the anointing in the more restricted sense of the anointing teaching us all things concerning the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, in this message I am concerned not with the broader application of the principle, but with the proper interpretation of the teaching of the anointing according to the context of these verses.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more I consider these verses in context, the more assurance I have that it is absolutely accurate to say that the teaching of the anointing concerns the things of the Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>THE ELEMENTS OF THE COMPOUND OINTMENT</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We have seen that the anointing is the moving of the all-inclusive, compound, life-giving Spirit, who is the processed Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This Spirit is the fulfillment of the type of the compound ointment revealed in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this compound ointment there are a number of different elements which are the ingredients of the ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Just as paint may have a number of different elements, so the anointing Spirit also has different elements.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These elements include the processed Triune God and His activities.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Triune God has passed through incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These are the steps in His activity.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All these steps have become elements of the compound, life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, the anointing Spirit is actually a compound of the Triune God and His activities.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The anointing Spirit includes divinity and humanity, the divine nature and the human nature.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Such a compound Spirit includes incarnation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>All these are elements of the compound Spirit typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The anointing is actually the moving of the ointment, and the ointment is a compound.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Oil, however, is not a compound, for it contains a single element.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The compound ointment, on the contrary, contains a number of different elements.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the compound Spirit we have the Father, the Son, the Spirit, divinity, humanity, incarnation, human living, the effectiveness of Christ s death, the power of His resurrection, and His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The anointing is the moving of this compound Spirit with all His elements.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only this anointing, only the moving of this compound Spirit, can teach us the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paint is the best illustration of the compound ointment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>What is the best way to know the elements of a particular paint?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The best way is to buy a can of that paint and apply some paint to a piece of furniture.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>By applying the paint, you will be taught concerning the elements of the paint.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This means that only the paint itself can teach you what the paint is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Apart from the paint there is no way for you to learn about the elements of the paint.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In a similar way, it is by applying Himself to us as the paint that the compound Spirit teaches us concerning the Triune God and His activities.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We also may say that the elements of the compound Spirit teach us the various matters concerning the Triune God and His activities.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The anointing Spirit is the composition of the Triune God with all His activities, and now this compound Spirit teaches us concerning the things of the Trinity.</S>
