   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE TESTIMONY OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 5:9 John goes on to say, If we receive the testimony of men, the testimony of God is greater; because this is the testimony of God that He has testified concerning His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The testimony of God here is the testimony by water, blood, and the Spirit that Jesus is the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This testimony is greater than that of men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Verse 10 says, He who believes in the Son of God has the testimony in himself.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He who does not believe God has made Him a liar, because he has not believed in the testimony which God has testified concerning His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God testified concerning His Son that we may believe in His Son and have His divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we believe in His Son, we receive and have His testimony in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Otherwise, we do not believe what He has testified and make Him a liar.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>ETERNAL LIFE IN THE SON</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In 5:11 and 12 John continues, And this is the testimony, that God gave to us eternal life, and this life is in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The testimony of God is not only that Jesus is His Son, but also that He gives to us eternal life, which is in His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>His Son is the means to give us His eternal life, which is His goal with us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Because the life is in the Son John 1:4 and the Son is the life John 11:25; 14:6; Col 3:4 , the Son and the life are one, inseparable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we have the Son of God, we have eternal life, because eternal life is in the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may say that the Son is a container of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we receive the Son by believing in Him, we have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may say that eternal life, the divine life, is the capital of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Actually, this eternal life is the Son, and the Son is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>By this we see that eternal life is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Now the Triune God is moving and working within us as the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This anointing is also the moving of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Eternal life is not a thing; it is a Person who is the embodiment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now this Person is moving within us to anoint us with Himself, that is, with eternal life and with the essence of this life, which is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Triune God is the content, the essence, of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, when eternal life anoints us, it anoints us with the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This gives us the basis and the means to live a life that practices the divine righteousness, practices the divine love, and overcomes the world, death, sin, the Devil, and idols.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Confucius taught that the highest learning was to cultivate and develop what he called the bright virtue.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But God s New Testament economy teaches that eternal life is the embodiment of the Triune God and that this life is anointing us with the essence of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eventually, through continuous anointing, we shall become the same in life and nature as the Triune God, in that His essence will become ours, making us the same as He.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then we shall live a life full of righteousness and love, a life that spontaneously overcomes the world, death, sin, the Devil, and idols.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is no need for us to try to live such a life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>As long as we dwell in the fellowship of eternal life according to the anointing, we shall spontaneously practice righteousness and love and simultaneously overcome all negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>KNOWING THAT WE HAVE ETERNAL LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 5:13 John says, I write these things to you that you may know that you have eternal life, to you who believe in the name of the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The written words of the Scriptures are the assurance to the believers, who believe in the name of the Son of God, that they have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our believing to receive eternal life is the fact; the words of the Holy Writings are the assurance concerning this fact.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are the title deed of our eternal salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are assured and have the pledge by them that because we believe in the name of the Son of God we have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The word of the Bible is the pledge of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Bible is also the title deed of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why the Bible is called a covenant or testament.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We not only have the fact of eternal life; we also have the pledge, the guarantee, the title deed, to prove that we have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Praise the Lord that we have salvation and eternal life and also the title deed to prove it!</S>
