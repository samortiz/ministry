   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER ONE WHAT IS LIFE?</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Scripture Reading: Gen 2:9-12; John 14:6a; 1 John 5:12; Col 3:4a; Gal 2:20a; Rev 21:2, 18-19a, 21; 22:1-2a</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>By reading the above verses, we can see life and building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many of us have been Christians for years and may have heard about life, but may have never heard anything about building.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Life is for building.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Life is the content, and building is the corporate expression of this content.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>So if we have life, normally speaking, we should have building; and if we would have building we must have life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God purposes to express Himself through a corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, God must be life to a group of people who must be built up to express God in a corporate way.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE BASIC REVELATION OF THE BIBLE</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Life is just God Himself, and building is simply the expression of God as life in a corporate Body.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Life and building are the basic and central revelation of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Genesis 2 shows that after God completed His creation, especially the creation of man, He put man into a garden in which the central item was the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Here we must underline the word "life."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>As it is very difficult to define life, so it is also difficult to define the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You know what a peach tree is and what an apple tree is, but you may not know what the tree of life is.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>From other books in the Bible, we can realize that this tree of life is nothing less than God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The Triune God is the tree of life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Then we see some precious things which come out of the flow of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Near the tree of life is a flowing river, and at the flow of the river there is gold, bdellium a kind of pearl , and onyx stone Gen 2:9-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Life produces the flow of life, and out of the flow of life come these three kinds of precious materials: gold, pearl, and precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>To know what these are for, we must read the Bible through to the end where we see a city that is built with gold, pearl, and precious stones Rev 21:2, 18-19a, 21; 22:1-2a .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, these three precious materials indicate building.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>So, we see that the Bible opens with life for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Life is the source, and the building is the issue of life.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many Christians know that the Bible is a book of life, but not many Christians realize life in a proper and adequate way.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We need to see some of the wrong views that Christians have concerning life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, from these verses in Genesis and Revelation, we can see clearly that life is for building and that building comes out of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>LIFE IS DIFFERENT FROM KNOWLEDGE</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Life has nothing to do with knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Instead knowledge is versus life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In Genesis 2:9 there are two trees: the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>By this picture we can understand that knowledge is contrary to life and even versus life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Why must I mention this?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Simply because in any kind of religion, and especially in Christianity, people always pay attention to knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After we were saved in Christianity, we were told to give attention to knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Yet the Bible shows us that knowledge is contrary to life and versus life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are going to know what life is and realize the experience of life, we must first of all be very clear concerning the difference between life and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>For example, if you drink a glass of milk you get life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If you do not drink it, regardless of how much you know about it, you have mere knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>To know about milk is just knowledge, but to take it into you is nourishment, and that is life.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Life is not knowledge, and knowledge can never replace life.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Instead, knowledge contradicts life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we would care for life, we must, in a sense, repudiate knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We should not care for knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We should only care for taking something into us to nourish us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Knowledge will bring us death instead of life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Furthermore, knowledge causes not only death, but also division.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If knowledge is the main emphasis among us, I fear that after a short time we will be divided into several sects.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>So we must take off the crown of knowledge and put it under our feet then we will have oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Knowledge divides, but life unites.</S>
