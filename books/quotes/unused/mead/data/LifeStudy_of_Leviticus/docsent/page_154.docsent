   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF LEVITICUS MESSAGE FORTY-SIX THE PROPITIATION 1 Scripture Reading: Lev 16:1-16; Heb 10:1-4</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In this message we come to the matter of propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Propitiation is a very difficult term in theology.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The definition given in most dictionaries is not according to the meaning of the Hebrew word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Hebrew word translated "propitiation" in Leviticus 16 means to cover; it has the same root as the word for the cover of the ark.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the ark, the place where God was to meet with His people and where the people were to meet with God, were the two tablets of the Ten Commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This means that the tablets of the Ten Commandments were in front of God and in front of the one coming to meet with God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Ten Commandments pointed out all the sins committed by the one who was approaching God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Between God and the one approaching Him there is a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The problem is not with God, for He loves His people and wants to meet with them.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The problem is that His people have committed sins, doing many things contrary to His commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Ten Commandments are a portrait of what God is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God is love and light, and He is holy and righteous.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>These four words love, light, holy, and righteous describe what kind of God God is.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God is full of love and light, and He is righteous and holy.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Ten Commandments were given by Him to show us that He is such a God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The tablets of the Ten Commandments stood before the one who approached God and exposed him as being a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, between God and the one approaching Him there was the problem of sin and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How could a sinful person approach and converse with the One who is love and light and who is righteous and holy?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This problem had to be solved.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Otherwise, there would be an obstacle, a hindrance, between God and the one approaching Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have seen that we were born unclean and are surrounded by people who are unclean.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Thus there is a problem not only with our birth but also with our contact with others.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Through this contact it is very easy for us to be contaminated.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Furthermore, in our condition we are altogether leprous; we are a totality of leprosy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In addition, whatever comes out of us as a discharge is unclean, contagious, and contaminating.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>How can such a person approach God, who is clean, holy, and righteous, and converse with Him?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>God loves man, but man is in a pitiful situation.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This situation reveals what we need.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need propitiation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I have pointed out that the Hebrew word for propitiation means to cover and that the word for the cover of the ark comes from the same root.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There was the need for the tablets of the Ten Commandments in the ark to be covered.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Only if the Ten Commandments were covered could the situation between us and God be appeased.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Propitiation appeases our situation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In propitiation it is not mainly God but our situation with God that is appeased.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The problem is with us, not with God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God is not angry with us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>God loves us, but there is nevertheless a problem between us and God.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For this reason, our situation needs to be appeased by the cover that is placed over the condemning, judging commandments.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We do not need to beg God to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He is ready to forgive us, once He has the standing to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Because God is righteous, His forgiveness requires that He have the standing to forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Suppose we were to say, "God, I know that You love me.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I beg You to forgive me."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If we said this, God would reply, "Yes, I do love you.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>There is no need for you to beg Me to forgive you.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But what about the Ten Commandments?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>I shall put a cover over them for you.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then your situation will be appeased."</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How wonderful that through propitiation our situation with God has been appeased!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In preaching the gospel, some have said that God is angry with us, but that Jesus, our Friend, asks God to do Him a favor and forgive us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>According to this kind of gospel preaching, God grants the Lord's request and forgives us.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This way of preaching the gospel is absolutely wrong because it describes God altogether in a wrong way.</S>
