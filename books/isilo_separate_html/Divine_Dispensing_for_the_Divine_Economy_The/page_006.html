The sealing of the Spirit can be likened to a seal with ink being pressed upon a sheet of paper. The more the ink is applied, the more the paper is saturated and permeated with the ink. Eventually, the entire paper will be sealed, saturated, and permeated with the substance of the ink in the image of the seal. In the same way, the Spirit is saturating and permeating us. The last stanza of hymn #501 in Hymns says:</P><P CLASS=INDENT1>Thy Spirit will me saturate,<br>Every part will God permeate...</P><P>This sealing, permeating, and saturating is going on constantly in the believers. As you are reading this chapter, the Spirit is permeating you. The Spirit as the sealing ink remains wet forever. It never dries. The Spirit's sealing saturates the sealed ones through the dispensing of the sealing ink unto, or for, the day of the redemption of their body (Eph. 4:30). The redemption of our body is the transfiguration of our body (Phil. 3:21). Until the transfiguration of our body, the sealing of the Spirit will go on continually to saturate and permeate our entire being.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Issuing in the Church</H2><P>The issue of the divine dispensing of the Divine Trinity through the Father's choosing and predestinating, the Son's redeeming, and the Spirit's sealing is the church (Eph. 1:22b).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>Through the Transmission, the Dispensing,<br>of the Resurrected and Ascended Christ</H2><P>The church as the issue of the divine dispensing is through the transmission, the dispensing, of the resurrected and ascended Christ (Eph. 1:19-22a). God's power was wrought in Christ in raising Him from among the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies. Christ was raised from among the dead in Hades to the throne of God in the third heaven. Everything was subjected under His feet, and He was made Head over all things to the church. The word to in verse 22 implies a transmission. Whatever God has wrought in Christ is transmitted and is being transmitted to the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>That the Church May Be<br>the Body of Christ for the Corporate<br>Expression of the Processed Triune God</H2><P>This transmission is so that the church may be the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all, for the corporate expression of the processed Triune God (Eph. 1:23).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> </body></html>
