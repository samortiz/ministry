   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MINISTERING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we have indicated, verse 19 points out that Paul s burden was not to carry on a Christian work, but was to have Christ formed in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Through Paul s preaching, Christ had entered into the Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But because they had been deceived, Christ had not yet grown in them and had not been formed in them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, Paul labored again, like a mother laboring in giving birth, that Christ would be formed in the believers.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Paul wrote out of the burden to minister Christ into the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He was burdened that Christ would be established, built up, in them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Galatians tells us that Christ is revealed in us and that He lives in us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Now we see that Christ must also be formed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Ministering Christ to others is not accomplished easily.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It often requires suffering and struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Ministering Christ is much more difficult than carrying on an ordinary Christian work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If you would bear the burden, with a sincere heart, to minister Christ to others, you will discover what labor and suffering it requires.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You will need to labor like a mother giving birth to a child.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The goal of our service in the church or in the ministry must be to minister Christ into others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It is not adequate simply to say that we preach the gospel, for it is possible to preach the gospel without ministering Christ to others.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Our burden must be the ministering of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once again I say that this requires labor and suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It demands prayer, patience, and love.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>According to our experience, such a ministry is a battle, a wrestling.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The subtle one, the enemy of God, is active to bring in frustration or distraction.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We do not know from what direction he will attack next.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, we must learn from Paul to be burdened to minister Christ and also to appeal to the saints affection that their hearts may be touched.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>PAUL S PERPLEXITY</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 20 Paul says, And I wished to be present with you now and to change my tone, because I am perplexed about you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The apostle wanted to change his tone from severity to affection, as a mother speaking lovingly to her children.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul was puzzled in dealing with the Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He was searching for the best way to recover them from their deviation from Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Verse 20 indicates that Paul felt that what he had written to the Galatian believers was not adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He wanted to visit them and stay with them because he knew that his presence would accomplish more than his writing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul was perplexed about the Galatians; he did not know how to deal with them, how to handle their case.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>On the one hand, he addressed them as foolish Galatians ; on the other hand, he appealed to them as beloved brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that Paul was perplexed.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>THE NEED TO BE PURE IN MOTIVE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In writing chapter four Paul was very affectionate and appealed to the affection of the Galatian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is very difficult to appeal to others personal affection in a proper way.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>To do this requires that our motive be pure.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>If we are not pure in our motive, we should be careful of our affection for the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There is a great need of affectionate contact with the saints; there is also the need to appeal to the affection of others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, we must recognize that such an appeal is difficult, for it is easy for the natural love, the honey, to be present.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not easy to be pure as Paul was in Galatians 4.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul was a person who had been salted.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This was the reason that he could appeal to the Galatians personal affection in such a pure way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He could even rebuke them and condemn the Judaizers with a pure intent.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we try to practice this, we shall discover how difficult it is.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In rebuking others we need a pure motive.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In appealing to others personal affection, we need to be even more pure in our motive.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In many situations we shall not be able to minister Christ to others, to travail to have Christ formed in them, if we are not able to appeal to their affection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>As we consider all these points, we see that chapter four is as important as chapter three.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>I thank the Lord that Paul wrote this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Otherwise, we might have the impression that in writing to the Galatians he was legal, but not personal or affectionate.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In chapter four Paul could be affectionate and appeal to the love of the saints for the purpose of ministering Christ to them.</S>
