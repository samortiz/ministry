First, there is the Body life. Then we have the church in Antioch. For this reason we must have some make-up lessons, before we discuss the question of Antioch. If the reality of the Holy Spirit is present in the church, the question of central control no longer exists. However, if there is only approval by vote, planning, and resolutions in our work, instead of the reality of the Holy Spirit, we have nothing more than central organization; it will be Roman Catholicism.</p><p>Catholics say that there is only one church, that their priests are the only kind of people who can understand the Bible, and that their church is the only true church. It is true that there is only one church. But the way Roman Catholics interpret this oneness is not the right way. How can something right be wrong in the hands of the Catholics? We have to realize that it is right for the church to be one, but in the Catholic Church, there are human ideas, methods, and organizations. As a result, that which is right becomes wrong. Luther gave us two things: justification by faith and an open Bible. It is true that the Lord's recovery has made it possible for everyone to read the Bible, but this does not mean that everyone is able to interpret the Bible. Some do not have the gift of interpretation, yet they insist on interpreting the Bible. The result is errors. Some think that by putting together a few verses they can come up with a new doctrine. This not only produces wrong teachings; it also takes men out of the sphere of God's grace. Some cannot be subdued even when others point out the error in their teachings; they still insist on speaking. These people can never be taught.</p><p>God has set up teachers in the church (1 Cor. 12:28). The teachers interpret the Bible. In the church some have been set up to interpret the Bible. The meeting spoken of in 1 Corinthians 14 has the prophets as its center. Not everyone can interpret the Scriptures. In the meeting, when those who can interpret the Scriptures stand up to speak, the others should discern. However, this does not mean that the interpretation of one or two, or of a few, will ascertain a truth. The speaking is done by one or two, but the others have to discern. Even when the congregation is not able to discern, the words of the prophets must still be judged by the Spirit of the Lord.</p><p>Antioch was not a center, because it was not the product of an organization but the product of the Holy Spirit. Once the church is separate from the Holy Spirit and once it has lost its spiritual reality, it becomes the Roman Catholic Church. It is possible for Catholicism to be found among us. The basic question today is not the method of Antioch, but the kind of person we are. Are we a person living in the spiritual reality? This is the basic issue. Whether or not a local church can become a central church depends basically on whether or not that church is spiritual. This is the foremost issue.</p><h2 class="head1">NO LOCAL CHURCH BECOMING A HEAD CHURCH</h2><p>Factually speaking, the church in Antioch could not have become a head church either. In fact, Antioch never exercised supervision over other churches. One local church cannot exercise supervision over another church. However, the work has the right to exercise supervision over a local church. The church in Antioch never exercised supervision over another church, but the apostles who went out from Antioch did exercise supervision over other churches. When a problem arises in a local church, the matter has to be brought to the attention of the workers. First Timothy 5:19 indicates that an accusation against an elder must be accompanied by the word of two or three witnesses. An accusation could not be based on rumors or hearsay; there had to be witnesses, and the accusations had to be presented to Timothy. Timothy was a worker. Therefore, he could deal with the problem of the elders in a locality. Antioch was only one local church. Jerusalem was also another local church. As far as being a church is concerned, the question of a head church does not exist. But as far as the work is concerned, it is something different.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_034.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_036.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 57: The Resumption of Watchman Nee's Ministry &nbsp; pg 35</div><br></body></html>
