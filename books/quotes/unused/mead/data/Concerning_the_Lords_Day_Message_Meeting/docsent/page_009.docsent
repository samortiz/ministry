   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Needing Highly Gifted Persons</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If we work in this way, I believe that the situation in every locality will be very balanced, and we do not know how many times the increase in numbers will be multiplied.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It is a great thing, a most wonderful thing, for the church to preach the gospel!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For the church to preach the gospel in the Lord s Day meeting is the most glorious work!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we can have a breakthrough in the way of the Lord s recovery at this time, if the church can rise up to preach the gospel, there will be the dawning of a new day everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This does not mean that there must be a few highly gifted persons in the church, such as Philip or Charles Stanley, Whitefield, or Wesley.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The power of the church s gospel preaching is much greater than their power!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we want a five-talented member to be manifested, it may take twenty or even fifty years to produce one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>How difficult that would be!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But if we take the five worst brothers here in Kuling and put them together, there will be five talents.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we put the five least spiritual ones together, there will also be five talents.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we expect to see a five-talented member rise up, we will realize that there are not very many in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But if the church preaches the gospel, then the effect will not be that of only five five-talented members, but that of ten, one hundred, one thousand, or ten thousand five-talented members.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Moreover, we will continue to see this effect everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Whether or not the gospel can get through is not a matter of preaching by the workers, it is a matter of preaching by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The church will overturn the world.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Work Being Placed upon the Church</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Therefore, today before God you must see this vision accurately.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Your view must be accurate, and you must thoroughly see the Lord s spiritual revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>O Lord, You place the work on the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Head directs the Body, not individual members.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is necessary that the entire Body develop all of its strength.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, I desire that there would be the local representations of the Body in China.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do not think that the Body of Christ is something in the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Looking for a local church in the heavens would be idealistic.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You must see that the Body of Christ is manifested on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Body of Christ is spiritual to the point that it can be manifested on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Supply of the Word Being Very Important</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Since this is the case, you can see that the supply of the word is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We need to preach the gospel, edify the new believers, and have mutual and special edifying.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, many, including the sisters, need to go out, group by group, in twos or threes, so that every locality may be able to stand on its own.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without this, today s problem will remain.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There will still be a need to maintain a Lord s Day message meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>You have to overturn this habit of listening to messages.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You must overturn it completely.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord s Day is the time for all of us to go out and save people.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If this habit is overturned, it will be impossible to ask the brothers and sisters to just listen to a message on the Lord s Day.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Perhaps there will be times when we pause for a while and have a conference for a whole week.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If co-workers come, we will have a feast for one whole week, and then we will go out to work again.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In these few years I have especially seen what God has done in the hearts of brothers everywhere.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Gradually, the church must preach the gospel and do the work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This way is already quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>New Believers Needing to Migrate</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>You will probably ask what the new believers should do in the second year after listening for a year to the fifty-two topics, which neither advance nor change.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The answer is that you need to send them out in migrations.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If not, we will definitely have to build a Solomon s Temple, because there will not be a place that is large enough to meet in.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Therefore, after a group of believers has been raised up at the end of a year, you have to deal with them concerning their going on.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They then will care for new believers.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>At the same time, you have to cause them to see that living on the earth is for preaching the gospel and for the Lord s interest; they cannot choose their own professions or their own places to live.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Thus, we will see that we can send out five hundred or a thousand people after one or two years.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a place does not have the church, there will be a church there after one or two hundred people have been sent out.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>After a few years we can send many out to places where the gospel has not yet come.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We must send them out group by group.</S>
