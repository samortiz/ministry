   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWELVE EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 8 Date:June 28, 1948 TESTIMONY BY SISTER F. R.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I am willing to expose myself fully to the judgment of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In my family I was the only daughter, and I have been loved by everyone since my youth.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is the reason I am so proud of myself and not afraid of others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When I was in a gospel meeting, I heard a line of a song: "While others have received it, do not pass me by."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I was touched by that word and prayed to God to save me.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I prayed not to be passed by, and I was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Later God revealed Himself to me and told me to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I came to the local church and began to fellowship with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Later I joined Brother Nee's training in Yu-Hwa Village, Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>At that time I was like a wild horse.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I received much help from the training.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I saw that everything apart from Christ was vain.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even my prayers were filthy, and my reading of the Bible was unacceptable to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>For years in the sisters' meeting, I did not open my mouth, and I did not open myself to others.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Some have said that I am too arrogant.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Later the Lord arranged a spiritual sister to stay with me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Outwardly, I rebelled and would not submit, but inwardly, I said "amen."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Had it not been for the grace of God, I would have run away a long time ago.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I have heard many messages and I thought that I had the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when trials came I found myself being defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>From the messages on authority and on the breaking of man, I saw that I have weaknesses which I myself was not aware of.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>I have been slow in running this race.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It seems that I move one step only to fall down the next step.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>May God be merciful to me and speak to me in a strong way through our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I admit that it is not an easy thing to deal with your natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You need God to smite you in many different ways before you can fall.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Presently, the negative dealings should increase in you.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>You do not need to seek for too much or to expect too much.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These experiences will come to you spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He will give you the light and the dealings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God Himself will continue to deal with you.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God Granting Grace apart from Our Reason</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Someone said one time, "God can grant me grace apart from my condition."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is a very positive word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>All those who know God will testify sooner or later to the reality of this.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God does things beyond what we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The work of breaking is absolutely necessary.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Many brothers and sisters will not be softened unless they have passed through the breaking.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But this is in the hands of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to look to God to do this work without our interference.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God does not deal with us according to our expectations.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God grants grace to us apart from any expectation on our side.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we say "apart from us," we are not saying that this work is carried on outside of us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, we are saying that it is carried on apart from our expectations.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we want God to go along with our reasons, we will not receive any blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In order to make us a blessing to others, God has to deal with us in a realm beyond our expectation so that we can receive grace that is beyond our expectation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In this race, the positive things are God's blessings, mercy, grace, and power.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In Romans 9:15-16 Paul spoke of how God said to Moses, " I will have mercy on whomever I will have mercy, and I will have compassion on whomever I will have compassion.'</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>So then it is not of him who wills, nor of him who runs, but of God who shows mercy."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If God is gracious to us and grants us much grace, we have to remember that it has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>God works on us according to His pleasure, not according to our pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is a good thing that we are dealt with by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But we have to know that our being dealt with and being broken are not the basis and condition for us to receive His blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>It is a great misconception to think that God's breaking is His basis for blessing us today and in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If God wants to use us, it has nothing to do with us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If He finds us useful in any way, we can only say that this is the result of His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>God dispenses gifts according to His will, not according to our will.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It is God's grace that He breaks us, tears us down, and deals with us through the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But we cannot bargain for God's grace according to the dealings we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Sister, if you can be free from the self, it will be a great deliverance to you.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Those who know God know that we do not receive grace for any reason of our own.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Esau's life did not have any mark of God's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>But Jacob experienced God's hand throughout his life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>He had times of loss and times of gain.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He cheated others and, in turn, was cheated by others.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God's hand was heavy upon Jacob.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>God will have mercy on whom He will have mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>We have to see that it is a mercy that a man can be broken and destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We can call this a destruction, and we can also call this a blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The only thing we are afraid of is God taking away His breaking hand.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Today the Lord may want me to speak to others and to minister to them.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>I obey Him, but this is not my business, it is His business.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We boast of His pleasure, not of our accomplishment.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The most positive things are those that are according to the Lord's pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>If we can take the dealings well, we should thank the Lord for it.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If we cannot take the dealings well, we still should thank the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Nothing can replace the Lord's pleasure.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Putting Paul's word more explicitly, we can say, "If God wants to do something a certain way, what can you do?"</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Jacob could say that he was stubborn, but if God wanted to use him, what could he say?</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All positive items such as mercy, blessing, and usefulness are based on God's pleasure and desire.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Our eyes should never be upon ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, eight out of ten people set their eyes upon themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>My heart rejoices when I realize that God's work is accomplished apart from me.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The Lord did not consider how we would react or how the world would react when He came to the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>His coming was according to His own pleasure; He blesses according to His salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We do not have to pay attention to the Lord's breaking; that is the Lord's business.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>The trimming of the vine tree is God's business.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>God will do as He sees fit.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Once we see that God accomplishes His work apart from us, we will experience great liberation.</S>
