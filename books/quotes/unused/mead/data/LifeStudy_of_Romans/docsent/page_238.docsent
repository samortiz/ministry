   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORK OF THE INDWELLING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Now let us go on to consider from Romans 8 the various aspects of the blessed work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, the Spirit is the indwelling Spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>9, 11 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is a great matter to have the Spirit indwelling us.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Suppose the President of the United States came to your city and stayed for a while in your home.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That would be considered a great honor and privilege.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But we have someone much higher than the President dwelling in us we have the Spirit of God dwelling in our spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The second function of the Spirit is to give life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As the Spirit indwells us, He is not idle.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Rather, He is active to impart life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The indwelling Spirit is the life-giving Spirit, the Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The third function of the Spirit is found in verse 13: For if you live according to flesh, you are about to die; but if by the Spirit you put to death the practices of the body, you will live.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to this verse, the Spirit not only gives life, but also kills, puts to death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Positively, the Spirit gives life; negatively, He kills and clears away all the negative things within us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Fourth, in verse 14 we have the function of the Spirit s leading: For as many as are led by the Spirit of God, these are sons of God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The indwelling Spirit leads us, and His leading is so sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many of us can testify that it is the Spirit who leads us to the church meetings when we may be inclined to do something else.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Praise Him that He is the One leading us!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 8:15 gives us the fifth function of the Spirit: For you have not received a spirit of slavery to fear again, but you have received a spirit of sonship in which we cry, Abba, Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Spirit cries, Abba, Father, in a very sweet way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Whenever we cry, Abba, Father, we sense sweetness and comfort.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Truly the Spirit is the crying Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>As we have already pointed out, according to verse 16, the Spirit witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, He is the witnessing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because of the witness of the Spirit, we have the confirmation and testimony within us that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There is a living One, the indwelling Spirit, witnessing in us that we are children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Seventh, verse 26 says, And in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness; for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here we see that the Spirit functions by joining in to help us in our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>If we were not weak, the Spirit would not join in to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But simply because we are weak, He becomes our partner helping us in our weakness and sharing our weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is a wonderful blessing which human words cannot explain adequately.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Eighth, in verse 27 we have the interceding of the Spirit: But He Who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because He intercedes for the saints according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The interceding of the Spirit is also mentioned in verse 26, where we are told that the Spirit intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to these verses, the Spirit s interceding takes place not in the heavens, but within us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Notice that verse 27 says that God searching our hearts knows the mind of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This indicates that He has mingled Himself not only with our spirit, but even that He has mingled His mind with our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God searches our heart to know the mind of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This means that the mind of the Spirit is one with our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>At this point let me ask a question: Is it the Spirit who groans, or are we the ones groaning?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Verse 26 says that the Spirit intercedes with groanings which cannot be uttered.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Surely we are the ones groaning.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But our groaning is the Spirit s interceding.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This indicates once again that we and the Spirit, the Spirit and we, are one.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Our groanings become the Spirit s interceding.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Furthermore, the Spirit s mind is involved with our heart.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>How wonderful that the Spirit is not only mingled with our spirit, but His mind is mingled with our heart and His interceding is in our groaning!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>How marvelous that He is one with us in this way!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Eventually, according to verse 23, we have the firstfruit of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>What we are enjoying today is just the firstfruit, not yet the full harvest.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The firstfruit is an example, a foretaste, a guarantee, of the full taste which is coming.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As verse 23 indicates, this full taste is related to the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Today we are enjoying the Triune God in our spirit and, at most, also in our soul.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Our body has not yet been brought into the full enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, we need the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>While we are enjoying the firstfruit of the Spirit, we are expecting in the future to enjoy the full taste, the redemption of our body.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It is not an insignificant matter to remain in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When we stay in the spirit, we enjoy the Spirit s indwelling, life-giving, killing, leading, crying, witnessing, joining in to help in our weakness, and interceding.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Eventually, we enjoy Him as the firstfruit of the Triune God, who will become our full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is not a mere teaching; it is an unveiling and also a proclamation of the facts for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When you read of all these aspects of the work of the Spirit, there is no need to fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Instead, just say amen to each function of the Spirit: In the spirit, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Indwelling, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Life-giving, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Putting to death, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Leading, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Crying, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Witnessing, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Joining in, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Interceding, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Firstfruit, amen.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Amen, I am in the spirit, enjoying the work of the Spirit in me.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>I encourage you to amen every verse in Romans 8, especially the phrase in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If you proclaim the fact that you are in the spirit and say amen to each aspect of the work of the Spirit, you will experience a change in your Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This will transform you, build you up, and give you the growth in life.</S>
