   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. NOT CONSIDERING VISIONS AND DREAMS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AS GOD'S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Many believers in the church today depend solely on supernatural visions as a guide for their conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This happens more frequently among women than men.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They speak a great deal about their supernatural experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>They tell others about their encounters with Jesus and what the Lord has said to them.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They dream about heaven on certain days, and they tell others what the Lord has revealed to them concerning their future and what they should do.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They claim that they have some visions or interpretations and that they should therefore do this and do that.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There are many things of this nature.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I cannot say that all of them are false.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But these things can only be an aid in our seeking after God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We cannot fully depend on them to show us God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Satan can counterfeit many dreams and visions to deceive believers and distract them from God's ordained way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Many supernatural experiences of the believers are only Satan disguised as an angel of light.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>They catch many of God's children unaware and cause them to do many things that bring dishonor to God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"And a vision appeared to Paul during the night: A certain man, a Macedonian, was standing and entreating him and saying, Come over into Macedonia and help us.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And when he had seen the vision, we immediately endeavored to go forth into Macedonia, concluding that God had called us to announce the gospel to them" Acts 16:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Did they not become clear about God's will through a vision?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>No, they did not.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we read carefully, we will find that only Paul saw the vision, but "we" decided to go to Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It says, "And when he had seen the vision, we immediately endeavored to go forth."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>They went to Macedonia not because Paul saw a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It was incidental that Paul saw the vision first.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After he saw it, they were led of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is why there was the one accord to go to Macedonia.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They did not consider it God's will to go just because of a vision or dream.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Moreover, the word concluding in verse 10 has the sense of making a deliberation after investigation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>They did not move rashly upon a dream.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Rather, they made the decision based on some conclusion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, in seeking after God's will, we should not depend merely on supernatural experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Rather, we should investigate thoroughly to see if something is according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>NOT PREJUDICED:</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>PREJUDICE HINDERING ONE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>FROM UNDERSTANDING GOD'S WILL</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The worst thing for a believer to be in seeking God's will is prejudiced.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once there is prejudice, he cannot hear God's voice.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Paul said, "I thought to myself that I ought to do many things contrary to the name of Jesus the Nazarene" Acts 26:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This was Paul's thought when he was persecuting the church.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He did not know the relationship between Moses and Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He thought that Jesus was the chief culprit against Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He made up his mind to eradicate this new religion even at the expense of killing others, shedding their blood, and chasing down believers.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He was willing to stir up these clashes and act according to his conscience.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He thought that these acts were proper.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He thought he was doing everything according to God's will, but he was actually doing the opposite.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>His mistake lay in his prejudice and self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He considered that his actions were proper.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>So he did not see God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>It is very easy for us to be prejudiced and biased because of our self-will.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our heart cannot forgive people who hate us and tolerate the things that we do not like.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We are not willing to calm down and seek a solution according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We boast in our own prejudice and self-will, and consider them as God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We may find out that we were wrong, but it may be too late when we do find out!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Every time we come before God, we have to drop all our prejudice and ask the Father to guide us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although many times His leading is contrary to our concepts and ideas, we should still willingly yield to it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We must not plan and make decisions, and then pray.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we do this, our prayer is a kind of wasteful ritual.</S>
