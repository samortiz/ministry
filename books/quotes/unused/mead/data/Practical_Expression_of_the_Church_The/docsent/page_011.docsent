   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE PRACTICALITY OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last chapter two points were covered: 1 the real need of the local churches to be the expression of the church; 2 two or three meeting together in the name of the Lord cannot be the church if there is already a church in that place.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I believe these two points have been made clear to us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, in this chapter we want to go on to see the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I do not mean the reality of the church, but the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The reality of the church is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And when we say the practicality of the church, we do not mean the spirituality of the church, for this also is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The practicality of the church is something else which we need to see.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>THE PRACTICALITY OF THE LOCAL CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Brother Watchman Nee once stayed in a certain place for some time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When he was about to leave, the people asked him to give a parting word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He spoke to them in this way: "There is much talk today about the church, the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is just like a group of carpenters talking about making chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I have heard so many good speeches about making chairs, but I would ask, where are the chairs?"</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This word is so simple, but so impressive and practical.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"Where are the chairs?"</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There have been many teachings and writings concerning the church, the Body of Christ, over a period of many years.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But where are the churches that have come out of these teachings and writings?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There has been a long period of speaking about making "chairs," but it is difficult to find one "chair."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is why we need to see the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>What is the practicality of the church?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Without the local church, the church is not practical; it is like something in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We may have much talk about the church, but nothing practical.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The practicality of the church is in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The local church is not only the expression of the church, but the practicality of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we would practice the church life, we must have the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>A CHURCH TO WHICH WE CAN GO</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In Matthew 16:18 the Lord says, "upon this rock I will build my church."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is the universal church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But if we go on to chapter 18:17, we see the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I know some Christian teachers who take a stand by using only Matthew 16:18.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They ask, "Is the church mentioned in this verse the local church?"</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They seem to present a strong argument.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We agree that in Matthew 16:18 it is not the local church, but we cannot drop Matthew 18:17.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must go on from Matthew 16 to Matthew 18.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Is the church in Matthew 18 the local church or the universal church?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If it is the universal church, the church in the heavens, how could we go to it today when we have a problem?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Matthew 18 says that if we have a problem to be solved by the church, we must go to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If this church is not the local church but something in the heavens, how can we go to it today?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If in any locality there is not a local church, regardless of how much we talk about the church, we do not have the practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In the past years I have noticed how many Christian teachers have spoken and written so much about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But eventually they did not have its practicality.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Where is the practical church on this earth?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Where is it?</S>
