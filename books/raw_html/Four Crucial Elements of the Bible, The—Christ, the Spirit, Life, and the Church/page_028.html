<h2 class=head3>In Resurrection the Son Entering into the Disciples as the Comforter That They Might Experience the Son in the Father</h2><p>How could the Lord enter into the disciples, and how could He be with them forever? In 14:19-20 the Lord said, “Yet a little while and the world beholds Me no longer, but you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live. In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.” That day was the day when the Lord lived and His disciples also would live; this refers to the day of the Lord’s resurrection (20:19). After His resurrection the Lord lived in His disciples, and they also lived by Him, as referred to in Galatians 2:20. Moreover, in that day the disciples were able to know that the Lord is in the Father. This is not a mere mental knowledge, because our mind cannot understand such a thing. What the Lord referred to here was an experiential knowledge. In John 14:10 the Lord said, “Do you not believe that I am in the Father and the Father is in Me?” The Lord was asking the disciples whether they believed, not whether they had the experience. Then in verse 20 the Lord went further and said, “In that day you will know.” Therefore, know here refers to experience—not only believing but also experiencing that the Lord is in the Father. In the initial stage of my experience of Christ, I considered that Christ and the Father were separate. Whenever I prayed, I was bothered, because in my mind I had always understood that Christ was in me and the Father was on the throne in heaven. Colossians 1:27 says that Christ in us is the hope of glory, but I could not understand how this Christ was related to the Father. At that time I did not have any feeling or experience telling me that Christ is in the Father. It was not until after I had been a Christian for thirty years that I began to realize that it is altogether impossible to experience Christ apart from the Father.<p>As far as the truth of salvation is concerned, John 3:16 is the top verse. However, as far as the enjoyment of Christ is concerned, John 14:20 is the top verse. This verse says, “In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.” The order here cannot be reversed. What the Lord’s word here means is that in resurrection He would enter into His disciples, but instead of entering into them alone, He would enter into them in the Father. Therefore, on the day of the Lord’s resurrection, the disciples would know that Christ not only was related to the Father and was the expression of the Father, but that He was also in the Father. Moreover, the disciples would know that they were in the Son and the Son was in them.<p>Why is it that in this section concerning the other Comforter, instead of speaking concerning the Comforter, the Lord spoke of Himself being in the Father, us being in Him, and Him being in us? In actuality, it is because this refers to our experience of the other Comforter. It was on that day, the day of the Lord’s resurrection when this other Comforter came to the disciples and breathed into them; He was inhaled by them and received into them. In 20:22 in His resurrection the Lord came to the disciples and breathed into them and said to them, “Receive the Holy Spirit.” This Holy Spirit is the “another Comforter.” When the disciples received Him, they knew that Christ was in the Father. Then He could live in them and they could also live because of Him and with Him. The disciples could even live in Him, and He could also live in them. Hence, in John 14:10 there is merely a revelation, but in verse 20 the revelation becomes an experience. This experience began on the day of the Lord’s resurrection, in which the Son came as another Comforter and breathed the Holy Spirit, who is His transfiguration, into His disciples. When this Comforter, the other Comforter, had entered into the disciples, they realized that the Son was in the Father, they were in the Son, and the Son was in them. The disciples could have such a realization because the other Comforter had entered into them and was experienced by them practically.
