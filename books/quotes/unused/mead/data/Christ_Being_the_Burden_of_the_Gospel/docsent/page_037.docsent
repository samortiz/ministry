   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Man s Inward Nature Being Evil</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The second aspect of our problem is related to our inward nature.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first aspect is our improper behavior; the second aspect is our evil nature.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We lie because our inward nature is deceitful, and we hate because our inward nature is envious of others.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We should not think for a moment that we only occasionally make mistakes or that our inward nature is not corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Rather, we are improper outwardly because our nature inwardly is corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Luke 6:43 says, There is no good tree that produces corrupt fruit, nor again a corrupt tree that produces good fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In other words, a good tree produces good fruit, and a corrupt tree produces corrupt fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>A corrupt tree produces corrupt fruit because the inward nature of the tree is corrupt.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our conduct is improper because our nature is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, more than the aspect of our outward behavior must be addressed; we must also solve the aspect of our inward evil nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Our outward behavior proves that our inward nature is evil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We do not attend classes that teach us how to sin, yet we all commit sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Although there are schools for art and universities for education, we do not need schools or universities to teach us how to lie and sin.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Instead, we are taught to be moral, benevolent, and righteous, and we are admonished to do good and be honest, because lies and sins spontaneously come out of our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There is a sweet date tree with fruit that is full of thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We like the dates but dislike the thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Similarly, we may have a certain measure of benevolence, righteousness, elegance, and love, but we are full of thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may have many virtues that are admirable, but these virtues are entangled with thorns that cause hurt to others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All these thorns grow out from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our nature produces many different kinds of thorns.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The thorns in our outward conduct merely confirm the evil in our inward nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the second aspect of our problem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Man s Life Being Corrupt</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Our evil nature is related to our life, which is the third aspect of our problem.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The aspect of our life is directly connected to the aspect of our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We have a certain kind of nature because we have a certain kind of life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This can be seen in our common use of the expression life and nature.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>According to our nature by birth, we lose our temper, but this nature is contained in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since nature comes out of life, the only way to avoid losing our temper is for our life to end. Our temper is no longer a problem when we die.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Our nature of losing our temper is in our life, just like the circulation of life is in the blood in our body.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As long as there is a circulation of our corrupt life, our nature of losing our temper will be active.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Our nature is in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our behavior issues from our nature, and our nature is hidden in our life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Our threefold problem consists of behavior, nature, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Although our behavior is outward and our nature is inward, our life is the ultimate source of our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Considering our problem from inside to outside, there is life, nature, and behavior; considering our problem from outside to inside, there is behavior, nature, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We need to ask ourselves whether our behavior is good or bad and whether we are persons of moral integrity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If we admit that we are not good, we have some degree of moral integrity, but if we think that our conduct is good and that we have moral integrity, we are deceiving ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We lie to people, we hate people, and we even steal from people.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>At the minimum we have stolen candy or cookies from our parents.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>How can we think that our behavior is good!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If someone dares to say in public that he has good behavior, he is the greatest sinner in the world because he has deceived everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our poor behavior is derived from our nature.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Both our behavior and our nature are problematic.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Moreover, our nature comes from our life, which is also problematic.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Outwardly, our behavior is improper, and inwardly our life and nature are improper.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Since our life is corrupt and our nature is evil, our behavior is improper.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Since our inward life is corrupt and our inward nature is evil, our outward conduct cannot be proper.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE LORD JESUS SOLVING</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>MAN S THREEFOLD PROBLEM</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Our life, nature, and behavior are a threefold problem.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order to be our Savior, the Lord Jesus must be able to solve this threefold problem.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If He could solve only one aspect of our problem, His salvation would not be complete.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If He could solve only two aspects, His salvation would not be sufficient.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Thankfully, the Bible shows that His salvation is complete and full.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He is a wonderful Savior, and His saving way is also wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He fully solves man s threefold problem related to behavior, nature, and life.</S>
