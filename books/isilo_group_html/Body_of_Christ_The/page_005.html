We, the members of Christ, have been transfused with the great power of God, which raised Christ from among the dead, seated Him in the heavenlies, subjected all things under Him, and gave Him to be the Head over all things (vv. 20-22). This great resurrection power has accomplished so much with Christ and in Christ. God's great power that operated in Christ gave Him to be Head over all things to the church, making it the Body of Christ, the fullness of the One who fills all in all (vv. 22b-23). Whatever this great power has accomplished with Christ and in Christ is to the church. "To the church" implies a kind of transfusion or transmission. Christ as the great power of resurrection is transmitted into our being, making us the Body of Christ.</P><P>Many Christians have heard something about the church, but not many know the real significance of the church as the Body of Christ. The word for church in Greek is ekklesia, which means the called-out assembly. The church is a congregation of God's called ones. But this is not the ultimate revelation concerning the church. Ultimately, the church is the Body of Christ. The church is the Body of a wonderful Person. Because this Person is wonderful, His Body is wonderful. The Body matches the Head. Christ as a wonderful, all-inclusive, Triune Person needs a wonderful Body, the church. The church is the Body. It is not an organization, but an organism. This Body of Christ is the fullness, the expression, of the One who fills all in all. Christ needs an expression, and this expression is His Body. If a person does not have a body, he does not have an expression; he is not complete, or full. His body is his fullness, the very expression of his being. God desires to have a church as the very Body of Christ to match Him as the universal Head for His full expression.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Being under the Continuous Sealing of the Spirit<br>and with the Pledge of the Spirit</H2><P>The church as the Body of Christ is under the continuous sealing of the consummated, compound, all-inclusive, and life-giving Spirit of the processed Triune God (v. 13). An unceasing sealing is going on in us. It is like the circulation of our blood because it is continuous. Such a Spirit as the seal is sealing us all the time with all the ingredients, elements, and essence of the processed Triune God. The all-inclusive Triune God has a consummation, and this consummation is the compound, all-inclusive, and life-giving Spirit.</P><P>On the one hand, we are under the sealing of such a Spirit. On the other hand, we are with this Spirit as the pledge of the all-inclusive, processed Triune God for our foretaste during the church age and our full taste in the coming age for eternity (v. 14). We have not only a sealing but also a pledging going on within us. The Spirit has been given to us as a pledge, as a guarantee that God is ours. He is our inheritance for us to enjoy both in the church age and in the coming age for eternity. The processed, all-inclusive Triune God has given Himself to us as such an inheritance for our enjoyment.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_004.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_006.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Body of Christ &nbsp; pg 5</div><br></body></html>
