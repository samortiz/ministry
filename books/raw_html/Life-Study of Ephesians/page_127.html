<h2 class="head1">II. ARRIVING AT A FULL-GROWN MAN</h2><p>Verse 13 also says that we need to arrive at a full-grown man. A full-grown man is a mature man. Through regeneration the saints have become babes in Christ (1 Cor. 3:1). Now the saints need to grow into maturity (1 Cor. 3:6, Gk.; Heb. 6:1). Such maturity in life is needed for the practical oneness.</p><p>If we are still divided by doctrinal differences, it is an indication that we are childish. Such divisive doctrines are &ldquo;toys.&rdquo; During the early stages of our Christian life, we may be fond of playing with such &ldquo;toys.&rdquo; The more childish the saints are, the more &ldquo;toys&rdquo; they have. But as children grow up, they gradually lay aside their toys. When people become fully matured, they have no toys at all. In the first few years of my Christian life I dearly loved my doctrinal &ldquo;toys.&rdquo; Because these &ldquo;toys&rdquo; meant so much to me, it took me a rather long time to drop them. But today I have no &ldquo;toys.&rdquo; I have only Christ and the church.</p><p>In 1 Corinthians 13:11 Paul said, &ldquo;When I was a child, I spake as a child, I understood as a child, I thought as a child: but when I became a man, I put away childish things.&rdquo; Here Paul indicates that certain things may be &ldquo;toys.&rdquo; As the believers grow, they will drop these &ldquo;toys.&rdquo; Eventually, by being perfected, they will all arrive at a full-grown man.</p><h2 class="head1">III. ARRIVING AT THE MEASURE OF THE STATURE<br />OF THE FULLNESS OF CHRIST</h2><p>According to verse 13, we also are to arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. The fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ (1:23), which has a stature with a measure. To arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is also a necessity for the practical oneness. Hence, to go from the oneness of reality to the oneness of practicality we need to press onward until we arrive at the three things mentioned in this verse.</p><p>The fullness of Christ is simply the expression of Christ. As Christ&rsquo;s fullness, the Body is Christ&rsquo;s expression. Christ&rsquo;s fullness, the Body, has a stature, and with this stature there is a certain measure. Hence, verse 13 speaks of the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</p><p>To arrive at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ is to arrive at the full building up of the Body of Christ. It is to arrive at the full completion of the building up of the Body.</p><p>We have seen that we need to arrive at the practical oneness, at the full growth, and at the complete building up of the Body. If we would arrive at these three things, we need to do the work of ministry. As verse 12 indicates, the work of ministry is equal to building up the Body of Christ. Among us there is just one ministry. Although thousands of us may participate in the work of ministry, the ministry itself is unique. This ministry is strictly for the building up of the Body of Christ. No matter who we may be, leaders or followers, we all are working to carry out the ministry in the New Testament economy to build up the Body of Christ. We are not here to go on alone, but to go on with others, even to bring others on. As we ourselves go on, we need to bring others on. We take others on by speaking for Christ, by teaching, and by shepherding.</p><p>Once again I wish to point out the need in all the churches for some kind of practical training. We need to be trained in the matters of teaching, shepherding, and preaching the gospel. Through this training the saints will learn how to function as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. As we function in all these ways, we have one goal: the building up of the Body of Christ. As we participate in the work of ministry for the building up of the Body, we arrive at the practical oneness, at full growth, and at the completion of the building up of the Body of Christ.</p><p>If our only goal is the building up of the Body, we shall spontaneously be regulated. As we carry on a particular work, it will be with the consciousness that this work is for the building up of the Body. Formerly, we may have preached the gospel without realizing that gospel preaching must be for the building up of the Body. Now we see that whatever we may do as apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers must be for the unique goal of building up Christ&rsquo;s Body. If we have seen the goal, then we shall be burdened to help others arrive with us at the practical oneness, at the full growth, and at the full building up of the Body. If we are clear about this, then the Lord will have a way to come back, for He will have a way to obtain the Bride He desires.</p><p>The Lord&rsquo;s way to do this is found in three crucial verses &mdash;in Ephesians 4:11-13. These verses reveal that all those who have been captured by the Lord have been presented to the Body as gifts for the perfecting of the saints, so that the work of ministry may be carried out and that the building up of the Body of Christ may be accomplished. Then we shall all arrive together at our destination&mdash;at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, and at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ. This is our goal, and we must diligently press toward it until we all reach it together.</p>
