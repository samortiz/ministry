<p>A message needs to be prepared for all the different kinds of meetings. This is your cooking. This does not mean that you pick up the thought, the idea, with the terminology from the Life-study Messages and our other publications and recompose them. If you do this, you will spoil them. You need to get into the Life-studies and the other publications. This could never be done only by one person. There are too many groceries. You need a group of elders, helpers, or co-workers, including some knowledgeable sisters, to help you. Some sisters have a very good knowledge of our publications. Select the portions which you consider are suitable to your church&rsquo;s present situation, and put them together exactly as they are into one message. Train the saints not to simply read it but to use it as a message given by themselves and to themselves. They must take it as a message firstly to themselves and then to others. Furthermore, they should do this in a mutual way by mutual speaking with a little defining. Such a speaking for about thirty to forty minutes will become a rich, living, and uplifting message. Everyone will get the benefit. Also take care of all the points I have fellowshipped with you in this book. Train the saints to exercise their spirit and train them how to speak. This requires time for the elders to labor in the Word to select portions for the messages.</p>
<p>You also must train some promising ones as full-timers. Train them to go into the home meetings to be the basic elements of that meeting. There are no leaders, but you need one or two to be the basic elements, not simply the common members. The eight or ten are common members, but you need one or two basic elements, not leaders. Within a growing tree there are some basic elements by which the tree grows. Likewise, the entire weight of the meeting hall in Anaheim rests on some large steel columns concealed within the stone. Within the red stone is the cement, and under the cement are the steel columns. Neither the stone on the outside or the cement is the basic element. The basic element is the steel. The entire building is very solid and strong because within it is the solid element.</p>
<p>Within every home meeting the elders should put in the basic element. Then every gathering will be strong, but the source of the strength will be a secret. The ones not so knowledgeable may attribute the strength of the column to the red stone. Actually the strength is the steel within. You must train some to be the steel in the home meeting. This requires much labor. It is not sufficient to merely set up some homes and make a schedule and an announcement concerning the home gatherings. This will never work. You need much labor. The new way needs the elders, the co-workers, and the full-timers to labor to the uttermost. Without this you have no way to carry it out.</p>
<p>For the truth lesson classes you do not need to prepare any messages. Still you must learn how to charge the teacher to teach the truth lessons as I have pointed out earlier. For the rest of the meetings, including the general meeting, you should not trust in one person to speak. For the general meeting you must cook a message and charge one among you who is able to present this message in an adequate way. Actually it will not be his own message, but a message prepared by a group of you. This way is altogether new. Then you must prepare some kind of message for the gospel preaching in case you will need it. If there are no new ones present, then forget about it. If there are some new ones, then right away there will be something on hand to use in every home meeting. This is according to the principle of 1 Corinthians 14:26. You do have something. If the need arises, you may use it.</p>
<p>You also need to prepare the messages for all the home meetings. This is a hard job. Every week there must be one good message. Then you need to prepare a message for the Lord&rsquo;s table and another one for the prayer meeting. In principle, for the Lord&rsquo;s table you need a message on life for the nourishment, and for the prayer meeting you need a message on the service, but it is hard for us to separate these two matters. In Matthew 24 and 25 there is the parable of the ten virgins, denoting life, and the parable of the talents, denoting service. These are two aspects. However, in order to encourage people to serve properly you sometimes need life messages. Likewise, to encourage people to grow in life you sometimes need some messages on service. It all depends upon your learning and your discernment.</p>
<p>You should learn, you should labor, and you should practice not only to speak but to prepare some good messages. We have the storage of so many riches. It is doubtful that anyone could give a new message richer or more living than what we have stored up. The wisest way is to use the existing riches and skillfully present them as a prevailing message with which to serve the saints in the meeting. This is the top way. These will be not only my messages, but they will be yours because you will have digested them and put them together as one message to nourish the saints. These are the riches of the Lord&rsquo;s house. We all need to use them. In the parable of Matthew 24:45-51 the servant knew how to serve food to the household at the appointed time. We do have much food. Now we need the diligence, the faithfulness, and the skill to use all these materials as proper meals to serve the Lord&rsquo;s people, including the sinners, at the appointed time.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH MEETINGS AND THE NEW WAY</h2>
<p>The church meetings are not only the big meetings in the halls. The church meetings are mainly the home gatherings. Only in a little sense are the big meetings the church meetings. The tradition still remains in our unconscious concept. When you speak of the big meetings, you refer to them as the church meeting, indicating that subconsciously you do not consider the home gatherings to be the church meeting. This is our problem. We need to have a purifying change, a purification of our thought and idea which has been with us for so many years.</p>
<p>The new way is constituted with these five things: the home gatherings, the functioning of all the members, the knowledge and spread of the truth, the growth in life, and the preaching of the gospel in every way. Brother Nee in his ministry stressed these five points very strongly. Chapter nine of <em>The Normal Christian Church Life</em> has a long section concerning the home meetings, the small group meetings. He was very much disappointed by the failure to carry this out. He stressed this very much. He even suggested annulling the Lord&rsquo;s Day morning meeting, and asked all the saints to preach the gospel on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. However, that did not work out.</p>
<p>He stressed very much that everyone needs to function. In his writings concerning the parable of the talents he said that the most dangerous one is the one-talented member. He warned us. Of course, he also stressed very much the knowledge of the truth. For this he invented the way of training. He initiated the way of training which I have been carrying out. His way was by training, not by a seminary or a school. He also stressed life very much and planned to evangelize all of China within twenty years by five routes. The new way we are now considering to take is altogether constituted with the same basic points which he stressed. We should not merely say that if Brother Nee were here he would be willing to be one with this new way. Actually, he was stressing this new way years ago. But due to our foolishness and dullness, we did not go along with him. He was very much disappointed. He did not carry it out. He could not have the way.</p>
<p>I knew this quite well. To me this is not something new. We knew of this way years ago, but we were always held back and frustrated. I beg you young ones to take the new way absolutely. I beg the old generation to also take the new way. If you do not feel capable to take the new way, then please keep silent. Do not say anything in a dissenting way. Rather, try your best to encourage the young ones to take the new way and you pray for it. The majority of the old generation there in Taiwan all encouraged the young ones to take this new way. They are all happy to see the young ones take this new way. This is what I expect and what I would beg you all to do. The young ones must take this way and the old generation also must take this way. If not, please do not be dissenting, but encourage the young ones to go on. The new generation are all our children. We are the parents. We would like to see our children take the new way and have a great success.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 08: The Life-Pulse of the Lord's Present Move &nbsp; pg 27</div><br></body></html>
