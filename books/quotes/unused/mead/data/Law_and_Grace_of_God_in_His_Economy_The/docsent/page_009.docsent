   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>I. THE NEW TESTAMENT BELIEVERS BEING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>NOT UNDER THE LAW IN GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BUT UNDER THE GRACE IN GOD S ECONOMY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The New Testament believers are not under the law in God s economy but under the grace in God s economy Rom 6:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today we are not the saints in the Old Testament who were under the law; rather, as the New Testament believers, we are all under the grace of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A. The Law Being for the Old Covenant</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>in God s Economy, Which Is Also Called</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>the First Covenant, a Covenant Which Is</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Becoming Old and Growing Decrepit</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>and Which Is Near to Disappearing</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>To carry out God s economy and achieve the purpose of obtaining an organism for God involves two covenants.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One covenant is a covenant that existed originally, and the other covenant is a covenant added along the way, a covenant that should have been unnecessary.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Bible uses two women to signify these two covenants: The first woman is Sarah, the wife of Abraham as the rightful woman, and the other woman is Hagar, who was a concubine.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the Bible, the position of the law is like that of a concubine and not like that of a rightful woman, so the children brought forth by the law were unto slavery and could not be reckoned as the free children of God cf.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Gal 4:22-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In between the covenant that God made with Abraham and the new covenant that the Lord enacted with His precious blood, there was the covenant of Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Moses, who, on the one hand, represented God, and on the other hand, represented Israel, enacted a covenant for the two parties, which covenant was the old covenant.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The old covenant, referred to as the first in Hebrews 8, was a covenant which was becoming old and growing decrepit and which was near to disappearing vv.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>13b, 7a .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This first covenant was a covenant that should not have existed; it was not in God s plan but was added along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We may illustrate this in the following way: A person drives from Anaheim to the airport, and because he has no plan to see a doctor on the way, he expects to arrive at the airport in fifty minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, along the way he has an accident and is injured.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The car is pulled aside, while a policeman calls a doctor.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the story of the law of the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to Romans 5, the law was something added; it was not something in the original plan but was inserted afterwards.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The law is God s portrait, God s photograph; it is not God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The photograph came first, and then the person Himself followed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The law is God s photograph, and grace is God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before God came, He first sent a picture to testify of Himself and also to expose man s real condition.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God knew that man had fallen to such an extent that he was filled with the devil, having the devil s life and nature and even the devil himself, so that man could not walk according to God s law.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>B. Grace Being for the New Covenant</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>in God s Economy, Which Is Also Called</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>the Second Covenant, the Better Covenant</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When the Lord Jesus came by God s incarnation , grace came.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Grace is for the new covenant in God s economy, which is also called the second covenant, the better covenant Heb 8:13a, 7c, 6b .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The law requires us to do something by ourselves; grace is God doing something for us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Actually, we do not have to do anything, and we cannot do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God does not require us to do anything; He does everything for us from the beginning to the end. It was God who carried out His incarnation, it was He who lived out His human living for thirty-three and a half years, it was He who accomplished the all-inclusive death on the cross, it was He who attained His entrance into resurrection, and it was He who accomplished His entrance into ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Everything was accomplished by Him.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We just need to enter into His accomplishments and enjoy Him as our rest.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is grace.</S>
