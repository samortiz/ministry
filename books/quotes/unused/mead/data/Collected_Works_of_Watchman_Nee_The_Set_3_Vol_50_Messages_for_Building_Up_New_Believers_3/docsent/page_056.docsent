   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>V. DISCIPLINE BEING FOR OUR BENEFIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Verse 10 says, "For they disciplined for a few days as it seemed good to them."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Often parents discipline their children in a poor way, because they act and discipline according to their own whims.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Not much benefit will come out of this discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>"But He, for what is profitable that we might partake of His holiness."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is not a discipline driven by temper nor a discipline that is merely a punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No discipline or reproach of God is merely a punishment; it is educational in nature, and it is there for our profit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The purpose of discipline is not just to hurt us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The hurt produces something; it is there for a purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He does not punish us simply because we have done something wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Whoever thinks this way is altogether in the realm of the law and the courtroom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A. Partakers of His Holiness</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What is the benefit of such discipline?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is to make us partakers of His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is glorious!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Holiness is God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may say that holiness is also God's character.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is for this that God uses many ways to discipline His children.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From the time we believed in the Lord, God has been disciplining us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He disciplines us with the view that we may partake of His holiness, His nature, and His character.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Bible speaks of a few kinds of holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The holiness in Hebrews specifically refers to God's character.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>For Christ to become our holiness is one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For us to be sanctified in Christ is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The holiness spoken of here is something wrought into us; it is not a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It has to do with our constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is something we have been emphasizing for years.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This means that God works something into us in a gradual way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The holiness here is a holiness that is constituted through His discipline, something constituted through His scourging and daily, inner working.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>His discipline and operation are for the purpose of making us partakers of His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After we suffer a little chastisement, we partake of His holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After we suffer more chastisement, we learn more holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If we remain under God's discipline, we will gradually realize what holiness is.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we continue under God's discipline, there will be a gradual constitution of holiness into our character.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we stay under God's discipline all the way to the end, we will become holy in our character.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Nothing is more crucial than this!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must realize that the result of discipline is the constitution of God's character into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>All discipline has results, and we should reap the fruit from all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>May the Lord be merciful to us so that His discipline, whenever it is upon us, may produce a little more holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May it result in more holiness, in more lessons learned, and in more constitution of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Holiness must continually increase in us!</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>B. The Constitution of a Holy Character</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After we accept the Lord and become God's children, He daily arranges many things in our environment to discipline and chastise us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All these things are lessons to us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Time after time these lessons come to us for the purpose of adding His holiness to us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need much discipline before God can work out a holy character in us!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the eyes of God we have only a limited number of years to live our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If we neglect God's discipline, and if it does not produce the needed effect in us, our loss will be an eternal loss indeed!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>C. Holiness as a Gift</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>and Holiness as a Constitution</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>God not only gives us His holiness as a gift, but He also wants us to partake of His holiness through His discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He wants us to be constituted with His holiness; He wants to wrought holiness into our being little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Carnal persons like us require years of discipline from God before His holy character and nature can become ours.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need all kinds of blows, situations, guidance, frustrations, urgings, and chastisement before we can partake of God's holy character.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is a great matter!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God does not merely give us holiness as a gift.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This holiness must be wrought into us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>God has to constitute us with His holiness!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is one distinctive feature of salvation in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God first gives us something, and then He works the same thing into us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>He constitutes us with the same thing little by little.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When we have both aspects, we have full salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>One is a gift from Christ, and the other is a constitution of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is a distinctive feature of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>One is a gift, and the other is a constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Among all the crucial things in the New Testament, there is this clear statement: God is making us partakers of His holiness through His discipline.</S>
