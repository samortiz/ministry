He is our temple (Rev. 21:22), our Passover (1 Cor. 5:7), and our feast (v. 8). He is even our real soil. We have been planted into Christ (1 Cor. 3:6), and we have been rooted and are being built up in Him (Col. 2:7). The good land which flowed with milk and honey (Deut. 6:3; 11:9; 26:9) typifies Christ as our good land (Col. 2:6). How wonderful Christ is!</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>As the All-extensive One<br>Who Fills All in All</H2><P>Christ as the divine Person is all-extensive. He fills all in all (Eph. 1:23). Our solar system is in a galaxy which is one among millions of galaxies. How vast the universe is! Yet Christ fills all in all.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>As the One Who<br>Is Unlimited in His Dimensions</H2><P>Christ is also unlimited in His dimensions (Eph. 3:17-18). The breadth, length, height, and depth are the dimensions of the universe. In the universe these dimensions are unlimited. Christ is the breadth, length, height, and depth. He is unlimited.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>As Our God-allotted Portion</H2><P>Christ as the divine embodiment, who is divine and human, all-inclusive, all-extensive, and unlimited, is our God-allotted portion (Col. 1:12). According to 1 Corinthians 1:2 Christ is the portion of all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, "theirs and ours." He is their portion, and He is our portion.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>As the Reality of All the Positive Things</H2><P>Christ is the reality of all the positive things (Col. 2:16-17). Colossians 2:16 mentions matters of eating, drinking, the feasts or holidays, and the Sabbaths. All of these matters are shadows; the reality of these shadows, the body, is Christ (v. 17). Christ is the reality of eating, drinking, feasts, and Sabbaths. Christ is our food and drink. Our eating of food and drinking of water is just a shadow. The substance, the reality, of our eating and drinking is Christ. Christ is our real feast and our real Sabbath. He is our real rest (Matt. 11:28).</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_042.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_044.html">Next</a> </body></html>
