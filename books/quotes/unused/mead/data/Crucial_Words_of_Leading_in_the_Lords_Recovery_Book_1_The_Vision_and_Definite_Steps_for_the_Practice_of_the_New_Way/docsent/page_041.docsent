   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>MAIN POINTS THAT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>REQUIRE OUR ATTENTION IN PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Those who promote any kind of movement or activity in society know that if they want to promote an activity, they must do so at the grass-roots; they cannot merely gain the husband of a household and not have any regard for his wife and children.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If they have no regard for the entire household, the movement or activity will not succeed.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But if they gain the wife and children as well, the promotion will be easy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Likewise, the goal of carrying out the home meeting is to gain the wife and children of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The result will be that the entire family will become the Lord s good soldiers who work for the Lord to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Furthermore, Acts 1:8 tells us that we need to spread from our Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Those whom we bring to salvation will follow us in what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we bring our relatives and friends to the Lord, our relatives and friends will also bring their relatives and friends to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In this way, the cycle will continue endlessly.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We would no longer need to rely on big gospel meetings or any great work.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our number will increase speedily and spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I hope the elders will have this foresight.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A SCRIPTURAL PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>What we have fellowshipped is a scriptural practice.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is the way shown in Acts and in the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He also took this way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Rather than holding gospel campaigns, He preached everywhere He went by the shore, on the mountain, or in people s homes.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>He deliberately went to Samaria to bring the meeting to a Samaritan woman, and in so doing He brought salvation to her John 4 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>After the Samaritan woman was saved, she went back to her city and testified for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This resulted in the entire city being shaken and receiving great benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Today we are influenced by the tradition of Christianity to the extent that we are tied down by its rules and formalities.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We like to hold gospel meetings at the meeting halls with a set time and topic.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the end, even though we spend much time and energy, we hardly gain anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even if we have gained some, only a handful remain and the rest are lost.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, we should not continue in this wasteful way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the previous chapter I said that in a period of thirty-eight years, from 1948 to 1986, a world-renowned evangelist held big gospel meetings wherever he went.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At every gospel meeting several thousand were in the audience, many of whom left their names.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was a talented, learned, and influential person.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If he had spent his effort on the home meetings for those thirty-eight years, I believe that he could have stirred up at least several million homes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If there were three million active homes in the fifty states of America, the whole of America would have been turned upside down.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am fellowshipping these matters to help us change our view so that we would no longer focus on big meetings and good messages.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we emphasize the big meetings and good messages, our work will be killed immediately.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Today we are not only few in number; those who function among us are even fewer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, when we have a slight increase, we feel overwhelmed and do not know how to nourish the new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The big meetings have become a bondage to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>For this reason, I hope that all the churches will accept this fellowship to no longer rely on the big meetings and good messages but to rely on the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Co-workers and elders, the only thing that we need to work on is the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>As long as we succeed in carrying out the home meetings, the church in our locality will be living, and the number will increase.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>THE CONTENT OF THE HOME MEETINGS</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The content of the home meetings is the truth in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This truth is concerning God s New Testament economy, the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He preached this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the apostles went out to labor, they preached this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We also should preach this truth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We thank the Lord that among Christians today, the Lord s recovery has the greatest, deepest, and clearest utterance on the gospel of the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As long as we have the heart, we will be able to find the appropriate materials from our publications for our pursuit and edification in the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In the suburb of Taipei, there is a Christian group that has experienced an increase of one thousand people in ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They have a practice similar to our home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>They put out messages for edification using the materials in the Lord s recovery and make them available to the believers free of charge.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The first message they put out is Joining the Church, and the second is Reading the Bible ; both are taken word for word from Brother Nee s Messages for Building Up New Believers.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This group has had the highest rate of increase over the past ten years, and they use material from our publications.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we look closely, we will find that we do not use our own materials as enthusiastically as others.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>It seems as if we do not treasure the blessing that we have because we have been continually eating this good food for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, our problem is not a lack of riches; rather, our problem is that we would not avail ourselves of what we have.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The truth that the Lord has given to His recovery is the most comprehensive.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We do not need to think of what to say or how to say it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Even if we were to strain our mind and exhaust our effort to think of something to say, we may not say anything better than what is in our published materials.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The materials in the Lord s recovery are rich and plentiful.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have not only hundreds but thousands of messages.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We should learn how to use them properly and choose a message or half a message to supply the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Thirty years ago I taught the co-workers to first digest the messages and then release them from the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Now I take this back and say that it is not necessary to do this anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>All we need to do is to repeat what the book says, reading with repetition, emphasis, and prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Allow the saints time to digest the materials in the meeting and speak them to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>If the co-workers in Taiwan had done this over the past twenty years, I believe that there would be four times as many saints in the Lord s recovery today.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Many other Christian groups, knowing that they do not have much content and realizing their own lack, borrow the riches from the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the end, they bring in a manifold increase and cause many to be saved and edified.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Today in the church in Taipei there are almost five thousand saints, and not many of them participate in the church service.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In the past thirty years the church in Taipei has not increased even by a thousand people.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The other Christian group, which I mentioned earlier, was started by a couple, a husband and wife.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>They moved to a certain place and practiced meeting in their home using the materials of the Lord s recovery, and now they have increased to one thousand people in ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This proves that we are so rich in our family assets, yet our co-workers have been laboring day after day without much result.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have no excuse.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have brothers and sisters in the churches who love the Lord, not only in the big cities but in smaller towns and villages as well.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Hence, compared to other Christian groups, we have an easier job.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But over the years we have accomplished very little.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is worthy of our consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Of course, we cannot put the blame entirely on the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>The underlying reason is that our system was wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>I regret that I did not come back to Taipei to change the system five or ten years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Now we must realize that our former practice is not working and is outdated.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Today we must be realistic; we need to receive a practice that is according to the revelation in the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>By observing the situation in all of Christianity, we see that the Lord s riches are truly in our midst, in His recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>However, because we have not done things in a proper way over the past twenty years, we have come to a standstill.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>At the same time, others have overtaken us because their practice is more advanced and because they use our truth.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>In the end, they multiply and increase.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>However, we should still be joyful that the truth in the Lord s recovery is spreading.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Our eyes need to be enlightened.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We need to discard the old ways and forget about trying to give better messages.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>I hope that all of us will aggressively use the truths in the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If the elders can prepare messages for the saints to pursue after the Lord s table meetings, prayer meetings, and in the home meetings, the saints will be greatly nourished and edified.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>According to the statistics, the number of saints attending the truth classes is higher than that of the big meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>This shows that the saints genuinely like to study the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>For this reason, we need to learn how to make use of the rich material in the Lord s recovery in a living way, not in a formal, rigid way.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We have a large amount of assets in the abundance of the truth, which is accessible and inexhaustible.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>I hope that we all can change our concept to shift all of our attention and effort from the big meetings to the home meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We should highly regard the home meetings, setting them as our goal and stress because the practice of the home meetings is the life pulse and the life line for the increase in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Through the home meetings we can gain people, keep them, and at the same time carry out the functions of begetting, nourishing, and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>This is truly the practice for changing the system.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I hope that the elders will consider this matter and pay much attention to it.</S>
