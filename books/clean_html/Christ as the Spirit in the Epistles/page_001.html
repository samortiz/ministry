<h2 class="head1">PREFACE</h2>
<p>This book is composed of messages given by Brother Witness Lee in Los Angeles, California in the Summer Training of 1965. These messages were not reviewed by the speaker. The subject of the Summer Training was the inner life and the church life. The messages in this book were given concurrently with other messages on life and the church, including <em>The Enjoyment of Christ</em> and <em>Enjoying Christ as the Word and the Spirit through Prayer.</em></p>
