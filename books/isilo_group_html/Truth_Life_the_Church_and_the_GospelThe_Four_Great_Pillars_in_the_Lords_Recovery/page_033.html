<p>Concerning the full-timers, we need to have a kind of understanding that they are not preachers but full-time serving ones. They must spend every morning to study the Recovery Version of the New Testament, including the footnotes and cross references, and also the life-studies. They should be able to read two life-study messages in four hours each day. There are approximately 1,200 messages in the <em>Life-study of the New Testament</em>. If we read two messages each day, we will be able to read fifty messages a month and six hundred messages in twelve months. Then we will be able to read through all of them in two years.</p>
<p>Because most of the saints do not have sufficient knowledge of the truth, there is the need for the full-time serving ones to pick up the burden to speak the truth to people. Since the full-timers have to speak the truth, they must first equip themselves. This is different from simply giving a message on the Lord&rsquo;s Day. They must speak to people every day. Also, the full-timers have to help people to establish and lead the groups, and they should also speak the truth to those in the groups. Not only should the full-timers speak to them in small group meetings, but they should also speak to them individually and lead them in how to read the Recovery Version of the New Testament and the life-studies.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH NEEDING<br />
TO BE FILLED WITH THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>We should pursue the truth to such an extent that we put the life-study messages everywhere in our homes&mdash;not only in our living rooms and on the nightstands but also in the bathrooms. In this way the brothers and sisters in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery will develop an atmosphere of pursuing the truth. At the same time we should encourage one another not to engage in any idle talk when we visit people. Instead, we should share the truth with them. Also, when we meet each other, instead of exchanging pleasantries, we should fellowship about the truth through mutual asking and answering. Then the saints will make progress in the truth.</p>
<p>Today the majority of Christians, including us, may not have an adequate knowledge of the truth in general. Even some elders of the local churches cannot speak clearly concerning the difference between the titles <em>Jesus Christ</em> and <em>Christ Jesus</em>. This shows us that the degree of our understanding of the truth is too poor. Thus, we all have to learn from the very beginning. Everyone who has a heart to serve the Lord full-time must spend at least two years to study the Bible. When you go to visit people, do not speak idle words. Speak the truth. Then, gradually, you will be able to build them up and form them into a group. Then gradually everyone in the church will enjoy coming to the meetings, and everyone who comes to the meetings will study the truth and know how to speak the truth. Unconsciously, this will bring in a revival.</p>
<p>I really have a burden to promote the life-studies over the five continents until every saint has the life-studies at home. I believe that if every household in the churches all over the globe had the life-studies, it would take only three to five years to bring in a new revival. The Lord&rsquo;s word is life, power, spirit, the living water, and even the consuming fire. Today the reason why we are so cold and weak is that we do not have much of the Lord&rsquo;s word in us. When we enter into the life-studies and are filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, we will be empowered by the Lord&rsquo;s word as the power and set on fire by the Lord&rsquo;s word as the consuming fire.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PROPAGATION OF<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S RECOVERY IN THE PAST</h2>
<p>Thirty years ago most of the churches in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery outside of mainland China were in Southeast Asia, including Indonesia, Singapore, Malaysia, Thailand, and the Philippines. Together they added up to less than one hundred churches. Today there are at least five hundred and fifty churches in the world. There are over three hundred churches in the Far East; the Philippines alone has about one hundred and thirty churches. Over a hundred of them are in the southern part of the Philippines, having been raised up through getting into the sixty topics of <em>The Fundamental Truths in the Scriptures.</em> Moreover, there are more than eighty churches in Taiwan, twenty in Japan, twenty-seven in South Korea, at least twenty in Indonesia, fifteen in Singapore and Malaysia, and around ten in Thailand. When we add up the numbers of all these churches in the Far East, it is over three hundred.</p>
<p>As for the churches in other continents, there are over ninety churches in the United States and more than ten churches in Canada, so there are over one hundred churches altogether. There are around sixty churches in Brazil, South America, and at least twenty to thirty churches in Mexico, adding up to around one hundred churches. So the Americas have around two hundred churches total. In addition, there are at least twenty churches in Europe, including churches in England, Germany, Belgium, Switzerland, France, Italy, Denmark, Sweden, Finland, and Spain. In Africa there are at least five countries&mdash;Ghana, Nigeria, Libya, South Africa, and Zimbabwe&mdash;that have churches, with at least fifteen churches total. Also, there are churches in New Zealand and Australia. In total, apart from the churches in the Far East, there are at least two hundred and fifty local churches in those other continents. Thus, there are five hundred and fifty churches spread over the five continents.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_032.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_034.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth, Life, the Church, and the Gospel-The Four Great Pillars in the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 33</div><br></body></html>
