<h1 class="title">WITHOUT THE SHEDDING OF BLOOD,<br />
THERE IS NO FORGIVENESS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Heb. 9:22</h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>The requirement of God&rsquo;s righteousness: death</li>
<li>The significance of shedding of blood: death</li>
<li>The meaning of shedding of blood: God&rsquo;s righteous requirement is satisfied</li>
<li>The result of shedding of blood: men&rsquo;s sins are forgiven</li>
<li>The shedding of Jesus&rsquo; blood
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In the Old Testament all the sacrifices were killed and their blood was shed. This was a symbol of the blood-shedding of Jesus.</li>
	<li>The shedding of Jesus&rsquo; blood signifies His death for us. The meaning of His shed blood is that God&rsquo;s righteous requirement is satisfied. Thus, the effect of His blood being shed is that our sins are forgiven.</li>
	<li>Without the shed blood of Jesus, God&rsquo;s righteous requirement could never have been satisfied, and man&rsquo;s sins could never have been forgiven. But the shed blood of Jesus has satisfied God&rsquo;s righteous requirement so that man&rsquo;s sins can be forgiven.</li>
