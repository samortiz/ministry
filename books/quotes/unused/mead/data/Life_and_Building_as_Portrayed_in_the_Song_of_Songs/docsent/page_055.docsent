   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>NOSE AS THE TOWER OF LEBANON</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Following the eyes, the Lord appraises her nose: "Thy nose is as the tower of Lebanon which looketh toward Damascus" 7:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Lord has never mentioned anything about her nose until now.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Her nose is like the tower of Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We know that a tower is something elevated, and Lebanon means ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, her nose is elevated by the Lord's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The function of a nose is to smell.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There are many things which we cannot see, touch, or hear, but we can smell them.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The one who works with the Lord cannot be cheated.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>He does not care for what you say; he cares for how you smell.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He does not care for things according to the outward appearance; he cares for the inward scent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You may tell him that everything is fine, but immediately he senses something wrong, something not genuine, and something not in harmony with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Perhaps he could not say exactly what is wrong, but he knows that something is indeed wrong, because he has a nose as a tower.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is the safeguard of the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is really difficult to cheat one who has reached such an attainment.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>You may tell the truth or you may tell him a lie.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It makes no difference; it is still the same.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It is not a matter of outward appearance, but a matter of smell.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For the safeguard of the Lord's work, we need such a nose as the tower of Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>FLOWING LOCKS LIKE PURPLE</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then the Lord comes again to her hair: "Thine head upon thee is like Carmel, and the flowing locks of thine head like purple; the king is held captive in their tresses" 7:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This time the Lord does not use the word "hair."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The King James Version has a wrong translation here.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is not the natural hair, but the locks.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>A lock is a bundle of hair which has been dealt with, plaited, and bound together.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>As we have already seen, this signifies her submission.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Her will is fully dealt with, fully bound, and fully submitted to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>With the locks are the beautiful tresses.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is the beauty of the tresses which captures the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The king is held captive in her tresses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Lord has become a captive to her submission.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Her submission is so high, with the color of purple, that it brings in the Lord's kingship and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In today's Christianity, you simply cannot see the Lord's headship, kingship, and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But, if we mean business with the Lord, we will have the color of purple in our submission to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Lord's kingship is revealed in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is the beauty of her submission that captures the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Darby's translation uses the word "fetter."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The beauty of her submission "fetters" the king.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The king was put in fetters by her submission.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is the real qualification for working with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If our natural life has not been subdued, if our hair has never been dealt with to be plaited and bound, then we are not qualified to touch the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Spontaneously there will be some amount of rebellion to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But with this one there is the submission to the uttermost, and the beauty of her submission holds the Lord as a captive.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Marvelous!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>HER BREASTS AS CLUSTERS OF GRAPES</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The Lord goes on to mention something about her breasts: "This thy stature is like to a palm tree, and thy breasts to clusters of grapes" 7:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In chapter four, her breasts were likened to roes which were feeding.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This meant that her faith and love were working to take something in for her own nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But now her breasts have become clusters of grapes, not for her nourishment, but for others.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>She is so full of life she does not care much for her own needs.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>She mainly cares for others' needs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Eventually she has a stature which is likened to a palm tree.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This is the same as that which is mentioned in Ephesians 4:13.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>She has the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>She not only has all the other aspects, but she has also a full stature.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Now she is fully qualified to take care of the work of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In chapter four, it was the Lord who said to her, "Come with me."</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But now it is she who initiates the move with the Lord: "Come, my beloved, let us go forth into the field; let us lodge in the villages.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Let us get up early to the vineyards; let us see if the vine flourish, whether the tender grape appear, and the pomegranates bud forth: there will I give thee my loves" 7:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>She initiates the work and the Lord follows.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The field is the world in a general way, the villages are the local churches, and all the gardens are the different saints.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The problem is that we are all for our own places.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We may all be for Jerusalem, but Judah is for Judah, and Benjamin is still for Benjamin.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But let us go to the field and lodge in the villages and look at all the gardens.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We should not be short-sighted, but have a broadened vision.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should be for all the churches in all the world.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hallelujah for Frankfurt, Germany!</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Hallelujah for Auckland, New Zealand!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Hallelujah for Tokyo, Japan!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Hallelujah for Sao Paulo, Brazil!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Let us go to the field and lodge in all the villages and visit all the gardens.</S>
