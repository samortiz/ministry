   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BREAKING AND TIMING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Lord breaks our outer man in two ways.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, He breaks it in a cumulative way, and second, He breaks it in a sudden way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord gives some people a sudden breaking first, followed by more gradual breakings; the sudden work comes first and the cumulative work follows.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Other people face situations and problems every day.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then one day, they suddenly receive one great blow from the Lord; the cumulative work comes first and the sudden work follows.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These are different patterns of breaking that we ordinarily experience.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Either the sudden breaking comes, followed by the cumulative breaking, or it is the other way around.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Generally speaking, even with those who have not deviated and detoured, the Lord has to spend a few years before He can complete this breaking work.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We cannot reduce the time this breaking takes, but we can extend this time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord completes the work in some in a few years.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>However, with others, the work is not completed after ten or twenty years.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is a very solemn matter!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Nothing is more pitiful than wasting God's time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Too often the church is deprived of blessing because of us!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We can preach with our mind and incite people with our emotion, but we cannot exercise our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God cannot use His Spirit to touch others through us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When we delay the work, we incur great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we have never consecrated ourselves to the Lord in a thorough way in the past, we have to do it now.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We have to say, "Lord, for the sake of the church, for the going on of the gospel, for You to have a way, and for the sake of my going on in my own life, I commit myself unreservedly and unconditionally to Your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Lord, I gladly put myself in Your hand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I am willing to let You find a way to release Yourself through me."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>THE MEANING OF THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have heard about the cross for a long time.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We may be very familiar with it already, but what is the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The meaning of the cross is the breaking of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The cross puts the outer man to death and breaks open the shell.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The cross destroys everything of the outer man.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It destroys our opinions, methods, wisdom, self-love, and everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Once the outer man is broken, the inner man is released, and the spirit is able to function.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The way before us is very clear indeed.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Once our outer man is broken, it becomes easy to release our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>One brother has a good mind; those who know him all acknowledge this.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>His will is strong and his emotions are reserved and deep.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yet when others meet him, they realize that they are touching his spirit, not his strong will, good mind, or reserved and deep emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Every time others fellowship with him, they touch a spirit, a pure spirit because this man is broken.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Another sister is quick.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Everyone who knows her realizes this.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>She is quick in thoughts, quick in words, quick to confess, quick to write, and quick to throw away what she has written.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But when others meet her, they do not touch her quickness but her spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Her very person has been broken.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The breaking of the outer man is a very fundamental issue.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We cannot hold on to our weaknesses all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We cannot have the same flavor after the Lord has dealt with us for five or ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must allow the Lord to have a way through us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the Lord's basic requirement of us.</S>
