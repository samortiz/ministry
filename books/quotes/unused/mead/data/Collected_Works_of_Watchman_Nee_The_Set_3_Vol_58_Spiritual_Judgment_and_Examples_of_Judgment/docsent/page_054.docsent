   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-EIGHT EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 34 Date:August 10, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER U. C.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a non-Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I tried to commit suicide by hanging myself a few times because I could not stand the constant pressure.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I became very pessimistic and thought of becoming a monk.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, I became a vegetarian, and then I joined a monastery.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Later I heard the gospel in my sister-in-law's house and was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>My parents opposed my faith and always tried to bother me when I prayed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>These persecutions forced me to build up a sweeter fellowship with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I went into the salt business, but I did not have the peace to stay in that business because there was tax evasion related to that business.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I left for other jobs.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When my second daughter became sick and was about to die, I had the Lord's word.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It was the story of Elisha with the son of the Shunammite woman.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I kept this word in my heart and did not consult the doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I prayed unceasingly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>My father prepared a coffin for her, but the Lord told me that I did not need to pray anymore but that I should praise Him instead.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I began to sing and to praise the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After two or three days, my daughter gradually recovered.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Once we had to move to another house, but my wife and I were not in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We knelt down to pray, and the Lord touched my wife and told her to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We were able to move in peace.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In hearing all the messages on the mountain and in comparing them with my experiences, I have found that I am short in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I thought about quitting and giving up serving the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But I realized that I have handed myself over and that I have no right to do anything according to my will.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Lord has to make the decision.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I have been saved for over ten years, but I still make mistakes in many things.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I can only look to the Lord today and ask for His mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I want to be like a newly regenerated person, starting all over again.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our brother clearly has handed himself over to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, his future should be decided by the church.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have some brothers who have returned from southeast Asia, and they tell us that a rubber tree must be cut before it will yield its sap.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Similarly, a pine tree must be cut before it will yield resin.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A man must be cut by God and dealt with by Him before life will flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In talking to others or in working with them, we have to give them the impression that we are very close to them.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We should not give them the feeling that we are unapproachable.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord arranges circumstances around us in order to cut us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Once we suffer a cut, we become very approachable.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Some people release their spirit as soon as they open their mouths or as soon as they pray.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Once we have a wound, the sap flows, and we become very approachable.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When some people preach, their spirit is released.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>When others preach, their spirit is not released.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Older ones can release their spirit more easily.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If the young ones will humble themselves under the mighty hand of God, they also will release their spirit quickly.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Our brother has been running a straight course.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, he still needs to receive some cutting from God's knife so that he will have a wound and his shell will be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When this happens, he will be released and life will flow.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He will become approachable and will be able to touch others.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I hope you will lift up your head and say, "Lord, I am willing to let You work on me, whether this work is gradual or sudden.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>May You inflict a wound on me, and may I afford You a way to go on."</S>
