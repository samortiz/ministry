   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWENTY-SIX THE TREE OF LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the opening chapters of the Bible the tree of life is presented to us.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When we come to its closing chapters, again there is this tree.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Why does it still prevail after so many pages, so much history, and so many centuries?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>MAN IN THE GARDEN OF EDEN</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God had an eternal plan.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>For this purpose He created the heavens and the earth and countless other things.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then He formed a creature that differed from the animals, the plants, and the hosts of heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If you looked at him, there would be something about him that reminded you of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This man was placed in a garden planted especially for him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Of all the trees growing there, only two are mentioned by name.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For many, many years this picture of man and two trees in a garden puzzled me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why did the Lord God's first recorded word to His creature concern the matter of eating from these trees?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"Of every tree of the garden, thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die" Gen 2:16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If I had been God, I would surely have talked to Adam about my purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>I would have told him that since I was his creator, he should worship me morning, noon, and evening.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>I would have taught him some melodies with which to praise me.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Then I would have told him about the wife I would make for him, his counterpart.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>He would need to love her, and she would need to submit to him, in order that they might be a good example to all the future human couples.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>I would have told him about the generations to be born and the communities that would be raised up.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For all these relationships he would need to develop a good character and show kindness, humility, and patience.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But these opening chapters of Genesis are void of any such explanations and exhortations.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>MAN A DEPENDENT CREATURE</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Very gradually over these past fifty years I have come to understand the meaning of this simple picture of man and two trees in a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The first crucial point is that man was not created independent.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Because he had to eat, he was dependent upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If God had created Adam with a self-sustaining, unending life, he would not have needed to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But man could not live by himself in an isolated way, because he was designed to need food.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He was destined to be dependent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>TWO SOURCES OF SUPPLY</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The two trees represent two ways for man to turn to have his need met.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The tree of life represents God.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The other tree signifies Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God's supply is simple life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Satan's supply is complicated the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Notice that good does not belong to the category of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Good pertains to knowledge, just as evil does.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Both belong to Satan and issue in death.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If you do not depend upon God, you are depending upon that second source.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Do not think that you can depend upon knowledge or upon what is good.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you are not depending upon God, your trust is in something that has Satan as its source.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However much you struggle to be independent, you are waging a losing battle against your destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If you depend upon God, the issue is life; if Satan, it is death.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The second crucial point, then, is that we have only God and Satan to choose between for the source of our supply.</S>
