   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Discerning Man s Motives</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>If our judgment concerning people is inaccurate, our administration of the church will result in tearing down.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A lack of knowledge concerning people will only cause the church to suffer loss even though we have no intention to tear down the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If we want to know people, we must learn to discern whether their motives and intentions are pure before God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If someone does not have a pure motive, we should not give him any responsibility in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Our knowledge of people s motives is based on the Lord s dealing with our own motives.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If our motives have never been dealt with by the Lord, we should not think that we can know the motives of others.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If our motives have been dealt with and are pure, our ministry of the word will not produce side-effects or result in mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, we will be single and pure toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to deal with our motives in all things, not only in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When we learn this lesson, we will be able to easily discern the motives of those who come to us.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After our motives have been dealt with, we will be able to easily discern the motives of those we meet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We may not be able to sense the purity in their heart, but we will immediately recognize the filthiness within them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We will be able to discern whether someone is single and pure or whether he is filthy in his motive.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We can easily know a person.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Discerning Man s Flesh</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A person whose flesh has never been dealt with or who has never learned any lessons concerning the flesh can never coordinate in service.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We may allow him to serve, but we should not assign him to any service.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This would be a mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Since it is difficult to find a person whose flesh has been absolutely dealt with, we should not assign people to any service unconditionally.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In other words, a person s assignment in a service should match the degree to which his flesh has been dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more his flesh has been dealt with, the more we can assign to him in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If he has had little dealing, we should not assign him much responsibility in the service; this can lead to problems.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Suppose a brother loves the Lord, is zealous, and wants to serve.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not rejoice when he expresses a desire to serve and allow him to participate in the service.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This will not issue in the building.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>No one builds a house in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A carpenter must first look at his material in order to know the nature, condition, and size of the material to use in the building.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Only then can he build.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He must first assess the condition of the materials and then assign the materials according to their nature and condition; only in this way will his work be proper for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>However, the elders in some local churches are not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>They rejoice when they see a brother who loves the Lord and immediately make him responsible for a group meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But since his motive is impure and his self has not been dealt with, his tricks all become apparent within a few weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Even though the saints may be fond of him, just as the children of Israel were fond of Absalom, the church will suffer a considerable degree of damage.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Sometimes the damage cannot be recovered for several years, and the church suffers a great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This affects the ability of a church to preach the gospel with power, the ability for brothers to be raised up, and the lack of vitality in the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The entire church seems to suffer from poisoning, giving people the feeling of helplessness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the issue of the elders not knowing how to administrate the church and not knowing people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>They are like a carpenter who does not know his material.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Thus, it is difficult to have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not difficult to preach the gospel and bring people to salvation, and it is easy to minister the word to edify people, but it is not so simple to build others up.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For this reason the apostle Paul says, As a wise master builder I have laid a foundation...Let each man take heed how he builds upon it 1 Cor 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is truly not easy to build the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We cannot simply let the brothers and sisters grow on their own.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We must see that the church needs administration and that a large part of the administration depends on our ability to know people and to discern their motives and their flesh.</S>
