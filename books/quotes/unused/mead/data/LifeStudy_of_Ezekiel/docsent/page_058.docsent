   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EZEKIEL MESSAGE FOURTEEN GOD S JUDGMENT UPON HIS PEOPLE Scripture Reading: Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>8:2-4; 9:3a; 11:22-24; 10:2; 22:20-22; 14:21; 12:15; 7:21; 33:21; 3:17; 9:4; 6:8; 11:16-17; 20:40; 17:22-23; 21:10, 27; 29:21</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we will consider the judgment of God s people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>THE BASIS OF GOD S JUDGMENT</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>First, we need to see the basis of God s judgment upon His people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s judgment upon His people was based on three things: the righteousness of God, the holiness of God, and the glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the first section of Ezekiel ch.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>1 , in the vision of the appearance of the glory of the Lord, we saw three main things: the throne, which looked like a sapphire, signifying God s righteousness; the fire, signifying God s holiness; and the glowing electrum, signifying God s glory.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As we have pointed out, these three things give us three basic colors.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The throne in the appearance of sapphire was blue; the fire was red; and the glowing electrum was yellow.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When these three basic colors shine, reflect, and refract together, they give the appearance of the rainbow.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The crucial matter here is that God s righteousness, holiness, and glory are the basis upon which God exercises His judgment over His people.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God s Glory versus Idols</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In chapters two through twenty-four there are some negative things which are versus the righteousness, holiness, and glory of God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God s glory is versus idols, and in 8:2-4, 10 and in 9:3 God s glory is contrasted with idols.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In a vision Ezekiel was brought to Jerusalem and entered the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Before Him the glory of God and the idols were contrasted.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>On the walls were the images of the idols, and over the temple was the glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The glory of the Lord could not tolerate the images of the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those images were called provoking images because they provoked God s jealousy 8:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our God is a jealous God; He will not tolerate idols.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Because of the idols in the temple, the glory of God withdrew step by step, leaving the temple, the city, and the people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In the last step the glory of the Lord left the temple and the city, stopping on the Mount of Olives on the east side of the city 11:23 , the same place where the Lord Jesus ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The glory of the Lord stopped there and waited for a while, but eventually it left that mountain and went back to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>That was the departure of the glory of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s judgment upon His people is based first upon His glory.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Anything that is versus God s glory will surely provoke His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today s Christianity is under God s judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The situation of today s Christianity is provoking God s jealousy because of the many idols.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Roman Catholic Church has all kinds of idols, and other so-called churches also have idols.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In some of these places there may not be physical idols, but there are other kinds of idols.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>With some their work for God is an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>With others Bible teaching or evangelism becomes an idol.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If we love our work, activity, or practice more than the Lord, even such things, which are for the Lord, may be idols.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Based upon this principle, we can realize that the situation of Christianity is filled with idols.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is why I say that the situation of today s Christianity is provoking to God and under His judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God s Holiness versus Dross</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>God s holiness is God s separation and sanctification, and this is versus dross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As God s elect, God s chosen people, the church should be pure gold, pure silver, and a pure treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, like the people of Israel at Ezekiel s time, the church has become dross.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, like Israel the church needs to be burned by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord said that He would put the city of Jerusalem and the people of Israel into a furnace to burn them 22:17-22 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This indicates that God s holiness is versus dross.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>God s holiness cannot tolerate any kind of dross.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Consider the situation of today s Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Where can you find a pure treasure to God?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Nearly everywhere you look there is only dross.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Surely there is the need of God s burning fire to burn out the dross.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The love expressed by many Christians today is not pure but is dross because it is according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These ones may love others, but their love is according to the natural human emotion and contains a great deal of mixture or impurity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This kind of love is a love that has not passed through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The same is true of the kindness and humility expressed by many Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In this kind of love, kindness, and humility there is no pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Instead of something pure and holy, there is mixture, dross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Those who express such love, kindness, and humility are in the flesh, doing good things or expressing something in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Although the expression may be good, it is still the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>There is no dealing of the cross and no dealing of God s holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Therefore, this kind of love, kindness, and humility needs to be burned and judged; it needs to be put under God s judgment by fire.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>From this we see that not only does our hatred need to be burned, but even our love needs to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Likewise, both our pride and our humility need to be burned by God.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>God s Righteousness</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>versus Injustice and Oppression</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God s righteousness was versus Israel s injustice and oppression.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>During Ezekiel s time the people used oppression and exercised robbery 22:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>On the basis of His righteous throne, God had to exercise His judgment upon all unrighteous and unjust things.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now we can see that God s judgment of His people was based on His glory, holiness, and righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Anything that did not match His glory, holiness, and righteousness had to be judged.</S>
