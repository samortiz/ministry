While the location and date of the conference are unknown, it was most likely conducted in Shanghai in 1939. The main subject of the conference was God's eternal plan. The messages explain the two eternities and the meaning of God's eternal plan. They expound the Lord's prayer and its relationship to God's eternal plan. They point out Christ the Son of God and His place in God's eternal plan. They cover the origin of Satan, the purpose of the creation of man and his fall, and the work of Christ in fulfilling God's eternal plan. They expose Satan's organization and methods in frustrating God's eternal plan, and they conclude by revealing the position and responsibility of the church in God's eternal plan.</p><p>Section Twelve, comprised of chapters ninety-six through one hundred six, contains a series of messages given by Watchman Nee on the mystery of Christ. These messages were given in Shanghai in 1939.</p><p>Section Thirteen, comprised of chapters one hundred seven through one hundred thirteen, contains messages released by Watchman Nee in the mid-week meetings in Shanghai in 1939. The subjects vary in nature. Some cover the experience of life, and some cover spiritual principles. However, all the messages were given for the benefit of believers and for their growth in the spiritual life.</p><p>Section Fourteen, comprised of chapters one hundred fourteen through one hundred fifty-three, contains the record of mid-week meetings, Lord's Day morning meetings, fellowship with new believers, and other fellowship given by Watchman Nee in Shanghai in 1940. Chapters one hundred fourteen through one hundred twenty-three are included in this volume, while chapters one hundred twenty-four through one hundred fifty-three are included in Volume 45 of The Collected Works.</p><p>The contents of Volume 44 have been taken from notes by K. H. Weigh, which included the following list:</p><h2 class="head1">I.

This plan is made according to His will. In order to know God's eternal plan, we first must know what eternity is. The Bible shows us that eternity has two parts. We can call them the first eternity and the second eternity (see diagram):</p><div style="text-align:center"><img src="http://www.ministrybooks.org/diagrams/CWvol44ch86.gif" width="400" height="75" border="0"></div><h2 class="head2">The First Eternity</h2><p>The beginning in John 1:1 is the beginning of the Word. We do not know the time of the beginning of the Word. The beginning of the Word is the eternity without a beginning. This is the first eternity. (The beginning of the Word is different from the beginning mentioned in Genesis 1:1. The beginning in Genesis 1:1 is the beginning of the universe, which happened in time and which can be reckoned by time.) Other verses that speak of the first eternity are John 17:24, Ephesians 1:4, and 1 Peter 1:20, which say, "Before the foundation of the world"; Ephesians 3:11, which speaks of "the eternal purpose" or "the purpose of the ages"; 2 Timothy 1:9 and Titus 1:2, which say, "Before the times of the ages"; and Romans 16:25, which says, "In the times of the ages." All of these verses cover the first eternity, the eternity that is without a beginning.</p><h2 class="head2">The Second Eternity</h2><p>Isaiah 66:22 says, "The new heavens/And new earth.../Remain." Revelation 21:1 also speaks of the new heaven and new earth, and Revelation 22:5 speaks of "forever and ever." These verses tell us about the second eternity, which is the eternity without an ending and which is also beyond time.</p><p>The first eternity and the second eternity are joined in heaven; they are connected and span from eternity past to eternity future with no time element involved. We cannot say when eternity begins and when it ends. But at a certain point God created the universe. Time began from the foundation of the world, and thereafter, events can be reckoned in terms of time. From earth's point of view, eternity can be divided into two parts, with the portion of time that began from the foundation of the world linking the two parts of eternity. The eternity which existed before the foundation of the world was the first eternity, the eternity without a beginning, and the eternity which exists after the end of time is the second eternity, the eternity without an ending.</p><h2 class="head1">WHAT GOD'S ETERNAL WILL IS</h2><p>With this understanding of eternity, we can consider God's eternal will. According to Ephesians 3:11, God has an eternal purpose, that is, an eternal will. In Greek the word purpose has the same root as the word purposed in Romans 1:13. God has an eternal will. This means that God made a decision in the first eternity. According to Ephesians 1:9, God's decision is according to His good pleasure; it is purposed in Himself; and it is for the purpose of making known to us the mystery of His will. In Greek the words good pleasure mean "joy" or "delight." Since God has a delight, He purposed a will. Since God has a will, He made a plan. Based on His plan, God has a mystery to fulfill this plan.</p><p>God's will is something that is hidden in God's heart, but His plan is something that is manifested to others. God's plan is God's center, which is also God's goal. God's eternal plan spans from eternity to eternity; it begins with His purpose and will in the first eternity and ends with its full consummation in the second eternity.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S PERFECT WILL AND PERMISSIVE WILL</h2><p>God has two kinds of will. One is His perfect will, and the other is His permissive will. God's perfect will is His ordained will; it exists from eternity to eternity and is executed in heaven without any hindrance. God's permissive will originates from God's foreknowledge and is based on God's perfect will; it passes through the world and eventually ends up in eternity.</p><h2 class="head1">BEFORE THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD<br />AND FROM THE FOUNDATION OF THE WORLD</h2><h2 class="head2">God's Plan Being<br />before the Foundation of the World</h2><p>God's plan was made before the foundation of the world. What kind of plan did God make before the foundation of the world? The first thing God purposed before the foundation of the world was to love the Son. John 17:24 tells us that the Father loved the Son "before the foundation of the world." The second thing that God purposed before the foundation of the world was to foreordain His Son to be the Christ. First Peter 1:20 says that "before the foundation of the world" God foreordained the Son to be the Christ. However, Ephesians 1:4-5 also tells us that God "chose us" in Christ and pre- destinated us "unto sonship" before the foundation of the world. (He chose men, but He predestinated them unto sonship.) Not only did God foreordain the Son to be the Christ, He also chose us in Christ and predestinated us unto sonship. Second Timothy 1:9 says that God gave us grace "before the times of the ages." Titus 1:2 says that God promised us eternal life "before the times of the ages." He promised that we would participate in His life. These two verses tell us that in order to receive the sonship, God predestinated us unto grace and life. All of these things were purposed by God before the foundation of the world.</p><h2 class="head2">The Fulfillment of God's Plan Being<br />from the Foundation of the World</h2><p>God's plan was purposed before the foundation of the world, but the fulfillment of His plan is realized from the foundation of the world. God accomplishes His plan through time. How does God accomplish His plan? Revelation 13:8 tells us that the Lord was slain "from the foundation of the world." Moreover, our names are written in the book of life from the foundation of the world. Hebrews 4:3 says that "the works of creation were completed from the foundation of the world." Matthew 25:34 speaks of "the kingdom prepared...from the foundation of the world." It is within the span of time that God created all things and accomplished redemption through Christ, writing the names of the redeemed ones into the book of life, giving them eternal life, and through this, preparing His kingdom.</p><p>God's eternal will was purposed in the first eternity, that is, before the foundation of the world. This is God's perfect will. Although the eternal plan of God was purposed before the foundation of the world, it is accomplished from the foundation of the world by passing through the world. This is God's permissive will. God's eternal plan will be fulfilled in the second eternity.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE PRAYER THAT EXPRESSES GOD'S WILL</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 6:9-13</h1><h2 class="head1">WHAT IS PRAYER?</h2><p>The Bible shows us what prayer is. First, God has a need; He has a purpose. Second, He puts this purpose within man through the Holy Spirit so that man feels this need as well. Third, man responds by uttering this purpose back to God through prayer. Fourth, God does His work and accomplishes this purpose. This is the meaning of prayer.</p><p>Let us read a few passages. Matthew 9:36 through 10:1 says, "And seeing the crowds, He was moved with compassion for them, because they were harassed and cast away like sheep not having a shepherd. Then He said to His disciples, The harvest is great, but the workers few; therefore beseech the Lord of the harvest that He would thrust out workers into His harvest. And He called His twelve disciples to Him and gave them authority over unclean spirits, so that they would cast them out and heal every disease and every sickness." According to this passage, (1) God is moved with compassion to save, (2) He wants man to pray, (3) man prays, and (4) God sends men to work and to save.</p><p>Ezekiel 36:37 says, "Thus saith the Lord God; I will yet for this be inquired of by the house of Israel, to do it for them; I will increase them with men like a flock." According to this verse, (1) God will increase Israel with men, (2) God wants men to pray for this matter, (3) men pray for this matter, and (4) God accomplishes it.</p><p>Isaiah 62:6-7 says, "Upon your walls, O Jerusalem,/I have appointed watchmen;/All day and all night/They will never keep silent./You who remind Jehovah,/Do not be dumb;/And do not give Him quiet/Until He establishes/And until He makes Jerusalem/A praise in the earth." According to this verse, (1) God wants Jerusalem to become a praise in the earth, (2) He has appointed watchmen, (3) the watchmen pray, and (4) God fulfills their desire.</p><p>From these passages we see that all proper prayers issue from God's heart and express God's desire. Prayer implies that God has a desire. He wants to fulfill such a desire, yet He does not want to do it directly; He wants man to cooperate with Him on earth. For this reason He unveils His desire to man and charges man to pray. Only after man prays will He fulfill His desire. This is the meaning of prayer.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF MATTHEW 6:9-13</h2><p>The prayer the Lord taught the disciples in Matthew 6 touches God's will. God's eternal will is expressed through it. From this prayer, we can see God's heart's desire. We can also see what He wants to accomplish and how it is being accomplished.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SECTIONS OF MATTHEW 6:9-13</h2><p>We can divide Matthew 6:9-13 into three sections. Verses 9 through 10 form the first section. Verse 11 to the end of the first sentence of verse 13 forms the second section. The second sentence of verse 13 to the end of the verse forms the third section. The first section is related to God, the second section is related to man, and the third section again relates to God and points out the underlying basis.</p><h2 class="head1">EXPOSITION OF MATTHEW 6:9-13</h2><h2 class="head2">Section One</h2><p>Verse 9 says, "Our Father who is in the heavens." "Our" denotes something corporate. In this prayer the words our, us, and we are used nine times. Although one prays this prayer alone in a "private room" (v. 6), its tone is not indi- vidual but corporate. "Who is in the heavens" denotes that our prayers have to reach the Holy of Holies (Heb. 10:19). In order for our prayers to reach the Holy of Holies, we cannot trust in our feelings; we must trust in the precious blood of the Lord Jesus. Furthermore, we must come to the Father in faith (v. 22). "Father" denotes that we have a life relationship with God. We pray in this way because we stand as sons. Only when we stand in such a position can we fulfill God's heart's desire.</p><h2 class="head3">"Your Name Be Sanctified"</h2><p>Following this there are three things that we have to ask for: "Your name be sanctified," "Your kingdom come," "Your will be done, as in heaven, so also on earth." First we ask, "Your name be sanctified." In the Bible, the words sanctification, holiness, and separation are the same word in Greek. It means to set apart a person or a thing unto God. Whether we set ourselves apart or are set apart by someone, being set apart means to be sanctified.</p><p>There are two aspects to our sanctification. The first is positional and objective. For example, men can be sanctified:</p><p>(1) Aaron and his sons. Exodus 28:41 says, "And shalt anoint them, and consecrate them, and sanctify them, that they may minister unto me in the priest's office." Here we have the sanctification of Aaron and his sons.</p><p>(2) The firstborn. Exodus 13:2 says, "Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast: it is mine." Here we have the sanctification of the firstborn of Israel.</p><p>(3) The saints. Acts 9:13 says, "Lord, I have heard from many concerning this man, how many evil things he has done to Your saints in Jerusalem." The term "saints" shows that the disciples are sanctified.</p><p>(4) The wife, the husband, and the children. First Corinthians 7:14 says, "For the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the wife, and the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the brother; otherwise your children are unclean, but now they are holy." Here the husband and the wife are sanctified.</p><p>The Bible also mentions things being sanctified.</p><p>(1) Food. Leviticus 21:8 says, "You shall sanctify him, for he offers the food of your God."</p><p>(2) Every creature of God. First Timothy 4:5 says, "For it [every creature of God] is sanctified through the word of God and intercession." The above verses show us that both food and every creature of God can be sanctified.</p><p>Furthermore, the Bible also mentions places being sanctified.</p><p>(1) Jerusalem. Matthew 4:5 uses the phrase holy city, showing that Jerusalem is sanctified.</p><p>(2) The temple. Matthew 23:17 refers to the temple being sanctified.</p><p>(3) The altar. Matthew 23:17 and 19 say, "The temple which sanctifies the gold...the altar which sanctifies the gift." This speaks first of the temple and altar being sanctified, and then of the gold and gift being sanctified through the sanctification of the temple and the altar.</p><p>The second aspect of sanctification is experiential and subjective. It is sanctifying God's name through one's life.</p><p>(1) The Lord Jesus. Matthew 4:10 says, "Then Jesus said to him, Go away, Satan! For it is written, You shall worship the Lord your God, and Him only shall you serve." God's name is sanctified before Satan through the Lord Jesus.</p><p>(2) Enosh. Genesis 4:26 says, "And to Seth, to him also there was born a son; and he called his name Enos: then began men to call upon the name of the Lord." God's name was sanctified before men through Enosh.</p><p>(3) Abraham. Genesis 14:22 says, "And Abram said to the king of Sodom, I have lifted up mine hand unto the Lord, the most high God, the possessor of heaven and earth." God's name was sanctified before the king of Sodom through Abraham. He called God the most high God.</p><p>Genesis 21:32-33, "Thus they made a covenant at Beersheba: then Abimelech rose up, and Phichol the chief captain of his host, and they returned into the land of the Philistines. And Abraham planted a grove in Beer-sheba, and called there on the name of the Lord, the everlasting God." In verse 33 God's name was again sanctified through Abraham. He called God the everlasting God.</p><p>(4) Isaac. Genesis 26:28 says, "And they [Abimelech, his friend Ahuzzath, and Phichol the chief captain of his army] said, We saw certainly that the Lord was with thee: and we said, Let there be now an oath betwixt us, even betwixt us and thee, and let us make a covenant with thee." God's name was sanctified before Abimelech through Isaac.</p><p>(5) Jacob. Genesis 30:27 says, "And Laban said unto him, I pray thee, if I have found favor in thine eyes, tarry: for I have learned by experience that the Lord hath blessed me for thy sake." God's name was sanctified before Laban through Jacob.</p><p>(6) Joseph. Genesis 39:9 says, "There is none greater in this house than I; neither hath he [Potiphar] kept back any thing from me but thee, because thou art his wife: how then can I do this great wickedness, and sin against God?" God's name was sanctified before Potiphar through Joseph.</p><p>(7) David. First Samuel 17:46 says, "This day will the Lord deliver thee into mine hand; and I will smite thee, and take thine head from thee; and I will give the carcasses of the host of the Philistines this day unto the fowls of the air, and to the wild beasts of the earth; that all the earth may know that there is a God in Israel." God's name was sanctified before Goliath through David.</p><p>(8) Samson. Judges 16:28 says, "And Samson called on Jehovah and said, O Lord Jehovah, remember me, I pray; and strengthen me, I pray, this one time only, O God, that I may be avenged of the Philistines at once for my two eyes." God's name was sanctified before the Philistines through Samson.</p><p>(9) Elijah. In 1 Kings 18:37 Elijah said, "Hear me, O Lord, hear me, that this people may know that thou art the Lord God, and that thou hast turned their heart back again." God's name was sanctified before the priests of Baal through Elijah.</p><p>(10) Paul. In Acts 27:22-23 Paul stood and said, "And now I advise you to cheer up, for there will be no loss of life among you, but only of the ship. For this very night an angel of the God whose I am and whom I serve stood by me." The Lord's name was sanctified before Paul's companions through Paul.</p><p>Hence, sanctifying God's name is making God's name distinct in the ear of the hearer from all other names who are not God, such as the devil (John 8:44), the stomach (Phil. 3:19), and idols (Isa. 36:19). Sanctifying God's name is to make His name distinct whenever it is mentioned.</p><h2 class="head3">"Your Kingdom Come"</h2><p>God's goal is to rule over the universe. His desire is to have a kingdom. "Your kingdom come" shows God's goal and desire. God wants to see His kingdom come soon. Once His kingdom comes, Satan will be overturned (Matt. 12:28). In the age of the kingdom, the overcomers will share Christ's glory, and Satan will be cast into the abyss and suffer shame. This is God's goal and desire. God wants man to pray according to this goal and desire. The Lord wants men to pray for God's kingdom to come to earth, which means for God's rule to come to earth and for God to gain His kingdom on earth.</p><h2 class="head3">"Your Will Be Done, as in Heaven,<br />so Also on Earth"</h2><p>God's will is never hindered in heaven. His will is frustrated from being executed on earth because the earth has been corrupted by Satan. It has been usurped by God's enemy. However, when the kingdom comes, the earth will be completely recovered, and God's will and desire will be executed on the earth as it is in heaven. Satan will be bound in the abyss (Rev. 20:3; cf. Luke 8:31, Dan. 10:13) and will no longer be able to frustrate God's will. Today the Lord wants men to pray for this and to hasten the manifestation of His will.</p><h2 class="head2">Section Two</h2><p>When a man stands on God's side to contend for His name, His kingdom, and His will, the enemy will attack him constantly. Everyone who makes a stand for God will come under the enemy's attack. This is why there is the need for protection. If there is no protection from God, we would fail. God protects us in four areas.</p><h2 class="head3">Food</h2><p>"Give us today our daily bread." Without food, man cannot survive, and he cannot live for God's will. Man cannot give up ground to the enemy through the matter of food. It says, "Our daily bread." An individual may not be lacking in anything, but God wants the corporate "us" to be without want.</p><h2 class="head3">Forgiving Debt</h2><p>"Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors." "Debts" here does not refer directly to the offenses we have committed against others. Our sins are forgiven through the Lord's blood, yet our debts are forgiven through our forgiving our debtors.</p><h2 class="head3">Not Brought into Temptation</h2><p>"Do not bring us into temptation." We should not anticipate temptation; rather, we should ask God to not bring us into temptation.</p><h2 class="head3">Deliverance from the Evil One</h2><p>"Deliver us from the evil one." This is an opposing prayer that deals with Satan.</p><h2 class="head2">Section Three</h2><p>"For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen." This section mentions three things that are God's: the kingdom, the power, and the glory. All three things belong to God forever. Satan will eventually be removed. The word "forever" signifies that Satan can never prevail. "Amen" means "yes." It is like signing a signature; everything is sealed.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD NEEDS MAN'S PRAYER</h2><p>God's Word repeatedly shows us that He wants man to pray. Isaiah 45:11 says, "Thus says Jehovah,/The Holy One of Israel and the One who formed him,/Ask Me about the things to come concerning My sons,/And concerning the work of My hands, command Me." Jeremiah 29:12 says, "Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you."</p><p>Many people do not want to pray. God even wonders why men do not intercede. Isaiah 59:16 says, "And He saw that there was no man,/And He was appalled that there was no intercessor./Therefore His arm brought salvation to Him,/And His righteousness sustained Him."</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">WHAT IS GOD'S ETERNAL WILL?</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:11; 1:9-10</h1><p>The verses above show us that God has an eternal plan (Eph. 3:11). This plan is the mystery of His will (1:9). It is something unknown to man. God's eternal will is that all things in the heavens and on earth be headed up in Christ (v. 10). In other words, Christ is to be the Head over all things. When this happens, everything in the universe will express the Lord. This is God's eternal will.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY OF GOD</h2><p>God's mystery was kept in silence in the times of the ages (Rom. 16:25). This mystery was hidden in God's heart and was not revealed to anyone. In the past generations, God did not tell anyone the reason He created all things (Eph. 3:5a, 9).</p><h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION OF THE MYSTERY</h2><p>However, this mystery has been manifested (Rom. 16:26). God revealed this mystery to Paul. He also revealed it to the holy apostles and prophets (Eph. 3:3-5), and He enlightens all concerning it (v. 9).</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S MYSTERY BEING CHRIST</h2><p>What is God's mystery? Colossians 2:2 says that God's mystery is Christ. Hence, the mystery of God is Christ. God's will is for Christ to be the centrality of all things and for all things to be subject to Christ so that He may be Head over all things. Colossians 3:11 says, "Christ is all and in all." Colossians 1:18 says, "That He Himself might have the first place in all things." Concerning this mystery Ephesians 3:6 says, "That in Christ Jesus the Gentiles are fellow heirs and fellow members of the Body and fellow partakers of the promise through the gospel." God is always working towards this goal. In the fullness of the times (1:10), He will head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth. (The word "times" in the original Greek means "ages.") This means that all things will be gathered together in one place and will be crowned with the name of Christ.</p><p>The book of Ephesians tells us what the Lord has obtained and will obtain from the time of His resurrection until the time of the new heaven and new earth. This is why it speaks of the Lord being the Head over all things in the heavens and on the earth; it does not speak of Him being the Head of all things under the earth, because by then there will no longer be anything under the earth. The book of Philippians tells us what He has obtained from the time of His resurrection until His second coming. This is why it says that in the name of Jesus every knee should bow, of those who are "in heaven and on earth and under the earth" (2:10). Today there are many things under the earth that are still unsettled.</p><h2 class="head1">CONCLUSION</h2><p>God's goal is twofold: First, it is for all things to manifest Christ. In other words, it is for Christ to be Head over all things. Second, it is for man to be like Christ, to have His life and His glory. Today many believers on earth are lacking in Christ, and many things are manifesting Satan. But God will eventually reach His goal. One day, all things will manifest Christ. We have to pray that we will gain more Christ and manifest Him more so that God's will can be fulfilled soon.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHTY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">THE SON OF GOD AND<br />THE CHRIST</h1><p>The Bible reveals that the Lord is both the Son of God and the Christ. Since the Bible uses both titles when it addresses Him, there must be a distinction between these two titles. Today we want to see the meanings of these two titles.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD<br />BEING THE SON OF GOD</h2><p>Concerning the Lord as the Son of God, we have the angel in Luke 1:35 who spoke this title to Mary. Peter received revelation from the Father and knew the Lord as the Son of God in Matthew 16:16. According to Romans 1:4, the Lord was designated the Son of God out of resurrection. According to John 20:31, a man is saved and receives God's life when he believes in the Son of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD<br />BEING THE CHRIST</h2><p>Concerning the Lord as the Christ, we have the angels in Luke 2:11 who declared that He is the Christ to the shepherds. Peter received revelation from the Father and knew Him as the Christ in Matthew 16:16. According to Acts 2:36, the Lord was made Christ after His resurrection. According to John 20:31, a man is saved through believing that Jesus is the Christ.</p><p>We can clarify this by the following chart:</p><div style="text-align:center"><table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="550"><tr><td><div style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold">The Lord Being the Son of God</div></td><td><div style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold">The Lord Being the Christ</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><ol class="decimal"><li>Spoken by the angel to Mary<br />(Luke 1:35)<br /><br /></li><li>Received by Peter as revelation<br />from the Father (Matt. 16:16)<br />&nbsp;&nbsp;<br /><br /></li><li>Designated out of resurrection<br />(Rom. 1:4)<br /><br /></li><li>Man's being saved by believing it<br />(John 20:31)</li></ol></td><td valign="top"><ol class="none"><li>Spoken by the angels to<br />the shepherds (Luke 2:11)<br /><br /></li><li>Received by Peter as<br />revelation from the Father<br />(Matt. 16:16)<br /><br /></li><li>Appointed by God after<br />resurrection (Acts 2:36)<br /><br /></li><li>Man's being saved by<br />believing it (John 20:31)</li></ol></td></tr></table></div><h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF THE SON<br />AND THE MEANING OF THE CHRIST</h2><p>The Lord is the Son of God as well as the Christ of God. The Son and Christ each signify different things. The Lord being the Son of God speaks of His divinity; it indicates that He is God. His title as the Son also denotes that He is equal with God and shares the same glory as God. Furthermore, the Son of God is God from eternity to eternity. The Lord being the Christ speaks of Him being the Executor of God's plan. When the Son took up God's plan, He became the Anointed One&mdash;Christ. He did not become Christ until He was anointed. When He took up God's plan, He became the Christ. We can clarify the meaning of the Son and Christ by another chart:</p><div style="text-align:center"><table border="0" cellpadding="3" cellspacing="0" width="550"><tr><td><div style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold">The Son</div></td><td><div style="text-align:center; font-weight:bold">Christ</div></td></tr><tr><td valign="top"><ol class="decimal"><li>The Son having divinity,<br />being God<br /><br /></li><li>The Son being equal with<br />the Father and sharing the<br />same glory as the Father<br /><br /></li><li>The Son being God<br />from eternity to eternity</li></ol></td><td valign="top"><ol class="none"><li>Christ being the<br />Executor of God's plan<br /><br /></li><li>After taking up God's<br />plan, the Son becoming<br />the Anointed One&mdash;Christ<br /><br /></li><li>The Son becoming Christ<br />after the time of His<br />anointing</li></ol></td></tr></table></div>		<h2 class="head1">MAN SHARING A PART IN GOD'S PLAN</h2><p>Ephesians 1:11 says, "In whom also we were designated as an inheritance, having been predestinated according to the purpose of the One who works all things according to the counsel of His will." The word "counsel" can also be translated as "plan." In God's plan we have become portions of "Christ." Hence, all of us together become the Christ. We become the Christ by being in Christ. First Corinthians 12:12 says, "For even as the body is one and has many members, yet all the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ." This Christ is the corporate Christ, who is composed of the Head and the Body. Hence, we are the Christ in the big corporate Christ, and we have all become a part of Christ. Since God's plan is in Christ, we have become a part of God's plan as well.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ACCOMPLISHMENT OF GOD'S PLAN</h2><p>God accomplishes His plan in two steps. First, we become subject to Christ and are headed up by Him (Eph. 4:15). Then all things become subject to Him and are headed up under Him (1:10). God's plan has to do with the whole universe. He heads up all things under the headship of Christ. But God does not carry out this work directly; He does it first in the church. He brings the church, which is Christ's Body, under the authority of Christ's headship. Then He brings the whole universe under the headship of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETY</h1><h1 class="title">THE REBELLION OF THE ANGELS</h1><p>God created the angels with a free will, and God also created man with a free will. If the angels and man had been created without a free will, the Son would not be able to gain any glory, because anything which is dead has no meaning. If the angels and man, who were endowed with a free will, had allowed the Son to be the Head, the Son would have gained the glory. Yet the angels rebelled, man fell, and God's eternal plan was frustrated. God's original intention was to express the glory of Christ through all things and particularly through man. Because of the angels' rebellion and man's fall, God's plan was frustrated.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD'S RELATIONSHIP<br />WITH THE ANGELS<br />AND WITH MAN</h2><p>According to God's ordination, the Lord took on the form of an angel before His incarnation, and He took on the form of a man after incarnation. In the Old Testament He was the Messenger of God (Gen. 22:11-12). In the New Testament He was made in the likeness of men (Phil. 2:7). The Lord took on the form of an angel temporarily. He took on the form of an angel for the purpose of revealing Himself to man. However, the Lord has also taken on the form of a man eternally. In the New Testament the Lord not only took on the form of a man but also became a man. Hence, the Lord's relationship with man is much more intimate than His relationship with the angels. Hebrews 2:16 says that God did not give help to the angels but to man. In God's plan the Son is joined with man, not with angels. Perhaps the angels are quite aware of this fact.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ORIGIN OF SATAN</h2><h2 class="head2">Ezekiel 28:11-19</h2><p>Revelation 12:4 tells us that when Satan rebelled against God, one third of the angels went with him and joined his rebellion. The word Satan in Greek means "the opposer." How did Satan become Satan? How did he rebel against God? What is the history of his rebellion? We can find the facts about Satan in Ezekiel 28:11-19 and in Isaiah 14:12-20. These passages show us how he was created, his original position before God, his beauty, his latter rebellion, and his ultimate fate.</p><p>Ezekiel 25 uses seventeen verses to describe the destruction of four kingdoms&mdash;Ammon, Moab, Edom, and Philistia. Between verses 26:1 and 28:19, there are seventy-six verses that describe one kingdom&mdash;Tyre. This is because the king of Tyre in 28:12 is a type of Satan. Therefore, the Bible places special emphasis on this kingdom and its king. All the adjectives used in verse 28:12 are superlative in nature. "Thou sealest up the sum, full of wisdom, and perfect in beauty." He was "full of wisdom." This wisdom was probably used originally to understand God's will. Therefore, Satan had the function of a prophet before his fall.</p><p>Verse 13 says, "Thou hast been in Eden the garden of God; every precious stone was thy covering, the sardius, topaz, and the diamond, the beryl, the onyx, and the jasper, the sapphire, the emerald, and the carbuncle, and gold." The Eden referred to here is different from the Eden spoken of in Genesis 2:8. This Eden denotes God's dwelling place in heaven. The precious stones denote God's light, and gold signifies God's glory; Satan had both. In comparing the precious stones that covered him and the stones that covered Aaron, we see that God had probably appointed him to be a priest (cf. Exo. 25:7; 28:9-14).</p><p>Ezekiel 28:13 continues, "The workmanship of thy tabrets and of thy pipes was prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created." Pipes require breath to produce sound. Hence, they signify life. Tabrets move the heart and express love. The tabrets and pipes signify God's delight. Musical instruments are always linked to the kings (1 Sam. 16:23; Isa. 14:11). This shows that he was a king. These three things reveal that Satan functioned as a prophet, priest, and king at the same time.</p><p>"Prepared in thee in the day that thou wast created" means that he belonged to the previous world, distinguishing him from the prince of Tyre in verse 2.</p><p>Verse 14 says, "Thou art the anointed cherub that covereth." The word "anointed" means that he was separated for God's commission. "Covereth" refers to the covering of the ark, the place where God's righteousness (signified by the blood) and God's glory (signified by God's appearance) are found. The cherub's duty is to lead men to worship the Lord (Rev. 4:9-10; 5:11-14). He was the one commissioned by God to lead the created hosts to worship God's righteousness and glory. This again shows his priesthood.</p><p>Verse 14 continues, "I have set thee so: thou wast upon the holy mountain of God." In the Bible mountains signify an administrative center. The great mountain in Daniel 2:35 typifies God's kingdom. The mountains in Revelation refer to God's administration centers. In this verse we are told that Satan was in the seat of God's administration and ruled over all things of that world.</p><p>"Thou hast walked up and down in the midst of the stones of fire." The stones of fire refer to God's light. This shows that he had intimate fellowship with God. According to Ezekiel 1:26, the cherubim are positioned under God's throne. This is confirmed by the picture in Exodus 24:10 and 17. This means that he was very close to God.</p><p>Ezekiel 28:15 says, "Thou wast perfect in thy ways from the day that thou wast created." Everything that God creates is perfect. Verse 15 continues, "Till iniquity was found in thee." The word "till" indicates a long period of time. God did not create a Satan; He created a cherub. After God's created cherub fell, he became Satan. The iniquity he committed brought sin into the universe.</p><p>Verse 16 says, "By the multitude of thy merchandise they have filled the midst of thee with violence, and thou hast sinned." Mr. Pember said that the word "merchandise" can be translated as "slander." The word devil in the original language means "the accuser" (Rev. 12:10). Satan's way of merchandising is to bribe men's hearts with little gifts and favors, as Absalom did.</p><p>"Therefore I will cast thee as profane out of the mountain of God." The word "profane" can also be translated "overstepping." It means going beyond one's rightful place. As a result God cast him out and stripped him of his rule.</p><p>The phrase "O covering cherub" reminded him of his name. "And I will destroy thee, O covering Cherub, from the midst of the stones of fire." This means that the fellowship was broken. But this does not mean that Satan could no longer go to God; it merely means that spiritual fellowship was terminated. Being cast out from the holy mountain denotes being stripped of his administrative post and the fact that he could no longer rule the universe. Being destroyed from the midst of the stones of fire refers to being stripped of the spiritual fellowship and the fact that he could no longer come near to God.</p><p>Verse 17 says, "Thine heart was lifted up because of thy beauty, thou hast corrupted thy wisdom by reason of thy brightness: I will cast thee to the ground." He became proud because of his beauty, and he overstepped his boundary. He also corrupted his wisdom by reason of his brightness. As a result he was cast to the ground. Originally his sphere was the universe. Now it is limited to the earth.</p><p>Verse 17 continues, "I will lay thee before kings, that they may behold thee." These kings were the angels who ruled the world together with Satan. But only one-third followed him. Those angels who did not follow him still rule the universe, and they are the kings referred to in this verse. (Psalm 82 shows us that there are many rulers in the universe.)</p><p>Ezekiel 28:18 says, "Thou hast defiled thy sanctuaries by the multitude of thine iniquities, by the iniquity of thy traffic; therefore will I bring forth a fire from the midst of thee, it shall devour thee, and I will bring thee to ashes upon the earth in the sight of all them that behold thee." This is the punishment of fire. The first world was destroyed by fire.</p><p>Verse 19 says, "All they that know thee among the people shall be astonished at thee: thou shalt be a terror, and never shalt thou be any more." After this verse the description switches back to the prince of Tyre spoken of in verse 2.</p><h2 class="head2">Isaiah 14:12-20</h2><p>Isaiah 14:12-20 also gives us some facts about Satan. Verses 12 through 14 describe his past, while verses 15 through 20 tell us his present condition.</p><p>Verse 12 says, "How you have fallen from heaven,/O Daystar, son of the dawn!/How you have been hewn down to earth,/You who made nations fall prostrate!" "Daystar" refers to the morning stars mentioned in Job 38:7. The phrase "son of the dawn" refers to the fact that he was the first one created in the whole universe.</p><p>Verses 13 and 14 say, "But you, you said in your heart:/I will ascend to heaven;/Above the stars of God/I will exalt my throne./And I will sit upon the mount of assembly/On the sides of the north./I will ascend above the heights of the clouds;/I will be like the Most High." He said "I will" five times. This was the cause of his fall. This was not just a matter of the heart but a matter of the will. The "heaven" in verse 13 is different from the "heaven" in verse 12. The "heaven" in verse 12 is in contrast to earth, whereas the "heaven" in verse 13 is above "the heights of the clouds." This is God's administrative center, the place where God conducts His business. Satan's goal is to be God. He was higher than all the archangels already (Jude 9), yet he was not satisfied with this. He wanted to be equal with God.</p><p>Genesis 1:1-2 speaks of God's judgment on the world at that time. When one-third of the angels rebelled with Satan, there was a change in the universe, and God executed great judgment upon it. Genesis 1:1 says, "In the beginning God created the heaven and the earth." Heaven includes not only heaven but also the angels. After God judged the rebellious Satan, the earth became without form and void, and darkness was upon the face of the deep.</p><p>The first world that God created was good (Job 38:7; Isa. 45:18), because God is not a God of confusion (1 Cor. 14:33). Yet the earth became without form and void through God's judgment (Jer. 4:23-26). The Bible shows us that the earth is the center of the universe. In the future, everything will happen on the earth. We can say that the earth is the center stage of the universe.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S PERMISSIVE WILL</h2><p>Due to Satan's rebellion, the earth has become marred with sin, and heaven is also tainted with sin. According to Leviticus 16:14-15, when the priests offered the sin offering for the propitiation of sin, they had to bring the blood into the Holy of Holies and sprinkle it before the propitiation cover. Hebrews 9:24-26 tells us that Christ has entered the tabernacle not made with hands, the heavenly tabernacle, and has offered up Himself as the sacrifice. According to Colossians 1:20, the extent of propitiation or redemption is not limited to the earth; it includes heaven as well. Even heaven itself needs to be redeemed. According to Isaiah 30:26, the sun is tainted with sin and will be healed and restored to its original state. Of course, the earth has suffered the greatest judgment from God. God's explicit will is seen in Ephesians 1:10, which is to head up all things in Christ, the things in the heavens and the things on the earth. His dealing with Satan through man is according to His permissive will.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S PURPOSE IN CREATING MAN</h1><p>Genesis 1:28 tells us that after God created man, He blessed him and told him to be "fruitful, and multiply, and replenish the earth, and subdue it: and have dominion" over all things. On the one hand, God wants to deal with death by life through man's multiplication, and on the other hand, God gave Adam the authority to have dominion. This position and authority once belonged to Satan, but now God has replaced him with man.</p><p>Genesis 2:15 says, "And the Lord God took the man, and put him into the garden of Eden to dress it and to keep it." This shows that there was decay and corruption. Hence, there is the need for man to recover the situation. From these two passages we see that God has a fourfold intention in creating man: (1) multiplying&mdash;dealing with death; (2) having dominion&mdash;dealing with insubordination; (3) keeping&mdash;dealing with attacks; and (4) dressing&mdash;dealing with corruption.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN GOD, MAN, AND SATAN</h2><p>Moreover, Genesis 2 shows us two trees, the tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil (vv. 9, 16-17). The principle of the tree of life is dependence on God, and the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is independence and alienation from God. These are the acts of Satan. God's will is done in heaven, while Satan's will is carried out in the air. Man's independent right is exercised on earth. Now the question is which side man will stand on. Eating of the tree of life means to join oneself to God, whereas eating of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil means to join oneself to Satan.</p><h2 class="head1">PSALM 8</h2><p>When we come to Psalm 8, we can once again see that God's desire is related to man; He wants man to reign for Him on earth. Hebrews 2:5-10 tells us the way the Lord fulfills Psalm 8, whereas 1 Corinthians 15:24-28 tells us the time the Lord fulfills it. Psalm 8 places special emphasis on the earth (vv. 1, 9). It also emphasizes the name and the kingdom. Three things in Psalm 8 match Matthew 6:9-10: (1) God's name being sanctified, (2) God's kingdom coming, and (3) God's will being done on earth. Psalm 8 does not concern the new heaven and new earth, because there will be no sea in the new heaven and new earth. Psalm 8 concerns the kingdom.</p><p>Verse 1 says, "O Jehovah our Lord,/How excellent is Your name/In all the earth,/You who have set Your splendor above the heavens!" This tells us that God's glory is set above the heavens.</p><p>Verse 2 says, "Out of the mouths of babes and sucklings / You have established strength/Because of Your adversaries, / To stop the enemy and the avenger." Babes are the youngest ones. As far as the duration of the universe is concerned, man is a babe and a suckling. God's intention is to deal with His enemy Satan through man. In Matthew 21:16, the Lord quotes this verse, saying, "You have perfected praise." This shows that there is a question of warfare. Here is spiritual warfare.</p><p>Psalm 8:3 says, "When I see Your heavens, the works of Your fingers,/The moon and the stars, which You have ordained." This psalm was written in the night and therefore does not mention the sun.</p><p>Verse 4 says, "What is man, that You remember him,/And the son of man, that You visit him?" We have to marvel at God's selection of man.</p><p>Verse 5 says, "You have made him somewhat lower than angels/And have crowned him with glory and honor." In His creation, God has made man a little lower than the angels. However, man's position before God is higher than that of the angels. God has made man a little lower than angels temporarily (Heb. 2:5-10) in order to crown him with glory and honor. This is God's goal. A crown is a sign of reigning. Crowning man with glory and honor means that man is placed in the highest position and is made to be like God.</p><p>Psalm 8:6-8 says, "For You have caused him to rule over the works of Your hands;/You have put all things under his feet:/All sheep and oxen,/As well as the beasts of the field, /The birds of heaven and the fish of the sea,/Whatever passes through the paths of the seas." God gave man the authority to have dominion over all things because He wants man to deal with the enemy. This is ordained by God at the foundation of the world and will be manifested in the age of the kingdom (Heb. 2:5-10).</p><h2 class="head1">HEBREWS 2:5-10</h2><p>Hebrews 2:5-10 quotes Psalm 8; it is also an exposition of Psalm 8. Verse 5 says, "For it was not to angels that He subjected the coming inhabited earth." God has not given the coming inhabited earth, which is the millennium, to the angels but to man.</p><p>Verses 6 through 8 say, "For one has solemnly testified somewhere, saying, `What is man, that You bring him to mind? Or the son of man, that You care for him? You have made Him a little inferior to the angels; You have crowned Him with glory and honor and have set Him over the works of Your hands; You have subjected all things under His feet.' For in subjecting all things to Him, He left nothing unsubject to Him. But now we do not yet see all things subjected to Him." This tells us that God has entrusted the millennium to man.</p><p>Verse 9 says, "But we see Jesus, who was made a little inferior to the angels because of the suffering of death, crowned with glory and honor, so that by the grace of God He might taste death on behalf of everything." This indicates that the man spoken of in Psalm 8:4-5 is the Lord Jesus. The first man Adam failed, but the second man Jesus suc- ceeded! This verse says that He was a little lower than the angels. This refers to His humanity. He was a little lower than the angels so that He could die for man.</p><p>Hebrews 2:10 says, "For it was fitting for Him, for whom are all things and through whom are all things, in leading many sons into glory, to make the Author of their salvation perfect through sufferings." "Through whom are all things" refers to the source, whereas "for whom are all things" refers to the consummation. Man cannot be the one through whom are all things, but he can be the one for whom are all things. Man is unable to have dominion over the universe because of Adam's failure, but the Lord has fulfilled God's will. He is leading many sons of God into glory. This is what God is after.</p><h2 class="head1">FIRST CORINTHIANS 15:24-28</h2><p>First Corinthians 15:24-28 speaks of the same thing. Verse 24 says, "Then the end, when He delivers up the kingdom to His God and Father, once He has abolished all rule and all authority and power." This verse is divided into two parts: (1) destroying the enemy, and (2) delivering up the kingdom to God the Father. Verses 25 and 26 expand the first part, while verses 27 and 28 expand the second part. "The end" refers to the millennium. "Abolish" means to destroy forever. "The kingdom" also refers to the millennium.</p><p>Verse 25 says, "For He must reign until God puts all His enemies under His feet." The Lord will reign, and God will destroy all His enemies.</p><p>Verse 26 says, "Death, the last enemy, is being abolished." Death is the last thing to be destroyed. Death will be eliminated from the church before the millennium, but will be eliminated from the universe after the millennium. (Dur- ing the millennium there will still be death according to Isaiah 65:20.) The Lord has judged death on the cross, and He will execute this judgment in the millennium.</p><p>Verse 27 says, "For He has subjected all things under His feet. But when He says that all things are subjected, it is evident that all things are except Him who has subjected all things to Him." God is not included.</p><p>Verse 28 says, "And when all things have been subjected to Him, then the Son Himself also will be subjected to Him who has subjected all things to Him, that God may be all in all." This verse is similar to Ephesians 1:10. God the Father has purposed the eternal will. God the Son has accomplished the Father's purpose, and God the Spirit has joined man to the Son.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE FALL OF MAN</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 3</h1><p>As far as God's eternal will is concerned, His goal is centered on Christ, but as far as His permissive will is concerned, His goal is centered on man. According to God's eternal will, all of His plans are centered upon Christ. Because of Satan's rebellion, however, God has to use man to deal with His enemy. God has His eyes on man and He gains man so that He can deal with His enemy through man. This is God's permissive will.</p><p>After finishing His work on each of the six days of creation, with exception of the second day, God saw that "it was good." After He created the firmament on the second day, He did not say that it was good. This is because Satan is in the air (Eph. 6:12). Genesis 3 is filled with Satan's work; however, it does not mention him by name. It only mentions the serpent. (The word serpent in the original language means "the shining one," which indicates that it was beautiful and attractive.) The Bible uses the cursed serpent to symbolize Satan. This shows that Satan is always working behind the scene.</p><p>Let us read chapter 3 of Genesis. Verse 1 says, "Now the serpent was more subtle than any beast of the field which the Lord God had made. And he said unto the woman, Yea, hath God said, Ye shall not eat of every tree of the garden?" The serpent looked first for the woman, the weaker one, and tempted her when she was separated from the man. Eve did not stand on the position that she should have stood on and became susceptible to temptation. The serpent pretended to be dumb and asked questions in order to stir her up to reason.</p><p>Verses 2 and 3 say, "And the woman said unto the serpent, We may eat of the fruit of the trees of the garden: but of the fruit of the tree which is in the midst of the garden, God hath said, Ye shall not eat of it, neither shall ye touch it, lest ye die." Eve opened the door first; she brought up the tree of knowledge first.</p><p>Verses 4 and 5 say, "And the serpent said unto the woman, Ye shall not surely die: for God doth know that in the day ye eat thereof, then your eyes shall be opened, and ye shall be as gods, knowing good and evil." The serpent did two things. First, he lied about God, saying that God did not love them. Second, he told Eve that they would be like God if they ate of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. In the beginning God forbade them to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil because He wanted man to remain a man. Although they could become like God, they were not allowed to do it. But Satan told them that they could do it. This seemed to give Eve a new light and new revelation. Satan's goal is to induce man to leave his proper position.</p><p>Verse 6 says, "And when the woman saw that the tree was good for food, and that it was pleasant to the eyes, and a tree to be desired to make one wise, she took of the fruit thereof, and did eat, and gave also unto her husband with her; and he did eat." Both Adam and Eve ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</p><p>Verse 7 says, "And the eyes of them both were opened, and they knew that they were naked; and they sewed fig leaves together, and made themselves aprons." Two things happened at this point: (1) They acquired God's knowledge, and (2) they knew that they were sinners. Man acquired knowledge, yet at the same time he became a sinner. From this point on, there was no other destiny for man except death.</p><p>In verses 8 through 13, God only questioned man; He did not ask the serpent anything. On the surface man was beguiled by the serpent. In fact, however, God won the victory, and Satan was defeated, because Satan's fate became tied to man through this act. In Genesis 2:15 man could only guard the garden from attack, but he could not destroy Satan. After Satan gained man, Satan was bound and could no longer move freely. We can illustrate this by an example from a legal court. A culprit and his accomplice cannot be separated. Satan is the culprit, while man is the accomplice. Legally speaking the culprit and the accomplice must be together. Whatever punishment the culprit receives the accomplice will receive as well, and vice versa. Hence, Satan's fate was tied to man.</p><p>Genesis 3:14 says, "And the Lord God said unto the serpent, Because thou hast done this, thou art cursed above all cattle, and above every beast of the field; upon thy belly shalt thou go, and dust shalt thou eat all the days of thy life." This was a punishment for the serpent. The serpent became closer to the earth, and man became his food (because Adam was made of dust). He could only eat man and be joined to man. Hence, if God can deal with man, He will deal with the serpent as well, because the two have become one. Consequently, when Christ judged Adam on the cross, He judged Satan as well. Satan's victory has indeed become his loss. There is a difference between walking upon feet and walking upon the belly. The serpent walks upon his belly; he touches the earth and is bound by the earth. But man walks upon his feet, which is only a very small part of his body. Satan was bound to the earth and could only have man as his food. If God redeems man and the earth, Satan will be left with nothing.</p><p>Here we must remember three important things: (1) God's eternal will is for Christ to be the Head. (2) Satan rebelled against God, and God appointed man to stand against Satan. (3) Man fell. God wants to accomplish His eternal will, but He needs to solve two problems&mdash;Satan's rebellion and man's fall. First, He has to deal with the rebellious Satan. Second, He has to take care of man's fall. In the next chapter we will see how God dealt with these two problems.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">THE WORK OF CHRIST</h1><p>We have mentioned before that God's eternal plan is for Christ to be glorified and to be made the Head over all things. When Satan rebelled and man fell, God had to come in to deal with these two problems before He could accomplish His eternal plan. Originally God created man with the purpose of having man deal with the rebellious Satan and to displace his rule. But man was deceived and fell. Now God had to take care of two problems. What did He do? He dealt with these two problems through the Lord Jesus. Today we will consider the work of the Lord in God's plan: how He solved the problems that stood in the way of God's plan and how He accomplished God's plan. The Lord's work was carried out mainly on the cross. On the cross He dealt with sin and the sinner. He redeemed us from sin and removed us, the sinners. This is the negative side of the Lord's work. In addition, the Lord stood in the place of Adam, that is, in the place of man and opposed, withstood, and defeated Satan by exercising His will as a man and seized the power of authority back from Satan.</p><h2 class="head1">HIS BIRTH IN BETHLEHEM</h2><p>Every incident in the Lord's life was connected to God's plan and related to the destruction of Satan. First, He was born in Bethlehem, taking on a body of blood and flesh (Heb. 2:14). This was not only for the purpose of having blood and shedding blood to forgive our sins, but also for the purpose of dealing with Satan. God wants the created man to deal with Satan. Satan could never touch the will of the man Jesus. In the second man Jesus, God gained what He could not gain in the first man Adam.</p><h2 class="head1">HIS TEMPTATION IN THE WILDERNESS</h2><p>After the Lord was baptized by John in the Jordan, He rose up from the water and a voice from heaven said, "This is My Son, the Beloved" (Matt. 3:16-17). Then the Lord was led by the Holy Spirit into the wilderness and tempted by the devil (4:1-11). In the first temptation the devil said to Him, "If You are the Son of God..." (v. 3). Satan wanted Him to be the Son of God rather than a man. He wanted the Lord to leave His position as a man and take the position of the Son of God, that is, to be God. This was Satan's deception. Satan knew that once the Lord took the position of God, He would lose His position to deal with him. But the Lord saw through Satan's deception, and He answered saying, "Man shall not live..." (v. 4). It seems as if the Lord was saying, "I am here as a man, not as the Son of God. Although I am the Son of God, I am taking the position of a man." The first Adam, who was a man, wanted to be God and failed. The second Adam, who is God, was willing to stand in the position of a man and prevailed. Only man can accomplish God's eternal plan and only man can deal with Satan.</p><p>In the second temptation Satan seemed to be saying, "If You are a man after God's heart, You should be able to jump down from the wing of the temple. God will surely protect You." (There is no love in Satan's temptation. Wherever there is love, there is not temptation.) Temptation comes when a person does not understand God's will. When a person is ignorant, he will try anything. Satan tried to completely separate the Lord from God once He firmly stood in the position of a man. Yet the Lord would not tempt God. He knew that He was joined to God, and He did not doubt God. Hence, He did not take Satan's suggestion to tempt God by jumping down from the temple. In the temptations that the Lord encountered in the wilderness, He was tempted to give up his position as a man and He was tempted to doubt whether He was one with God.</p><p>In the third temptation the devil said, "If You will fall down and worship me" (v. 9). Satan's goal is worship. Since the Lord represented all men, all men would have failed if He had worshipped Satan. But the Lord stood on God's side. He only worshipped God and served Him. He overcame Satan's temptations. In the garden of Eden man's will sided with Satan and brought in his utter failure. In the wilderness man's will sided with God and was one with God. As a result man completely overcame.</p><h2 class="head1">HIS CRUCIFIXION ON GOLGOTHA</h2><p>The center of God is Christ, whereas the center of Christ is the cross. When the Lord became a man, He became a representative of all men and included all men. Because He included all men, all men suffered God's punishment when He was crucified on the cross and shed His blood (2 Cor. 5:14). He included all men. Hence, when He died on the cross, everyone in Adam died as well.</p><h2 class="head1">HIS VICTORY IN RESURRECTION</h2><p>The Lord is the resurrection (John 11:25). Resurrection is that which overcomes death and that which cannot be defeated by death. Through death, the Lord destroyed the devil who has the might of death and released men from the slavery of death (Heb. 2:14-15). The Lord is the resurrection. Hence, death could not lay hold of Him, and Hades could not keep Him. The one who had the power of death lost his authority over Him. Colossians 2:15 says, "Stripping off the rulers and the authorities, He made a display of them openly, triumphing over them in it." The words "stripping off" mean that Satan could not lay hold of anything or keep anything. Originally, Satan's food was dust (which was man). But now that the Lord has died and resurrected, His life is the resurrection life, and the resurrection life has nothing to do with dust. Therefore, through the death of Christ, dust (that is, man) is buried, and the rulers and authorities are also buried. This is the reason that Satan hates baptism. Baptism signifies burial, and everything in Adam has been stripped off through the water of burial and is buried in the grave. Satan has no more food to eat. Those who have risen from the water of baptism are men in resurrection. They are no longer dust, and Satan no longer has any authority over them.</p><p>Through death the Lord Jesus destroyed the one who held the power of death. He stood in the position of a man and overcame Satan on behalf of man. He is the victorious One, and we whom He represents are also victorious. He has gained the victory, and we are enjoying His victory. In the Bible there are victories, and there are those who boast in victories. There is a difference between victory and boasting in victory. Victory is overcoming in the battlefield, while boasting in victory is singing the victory celebration after the battle has been won. Christ has won the victory, and we who are on His side only need to boast in His victory. This is like a school whose sports team has won the victory. All the students in the school rejoice and boast in the victory. The minute we boast in victory, we rejoice. This is what Psalm 23:5 means when it says, "You spread a table before me/In the presence of my adversaries." Christ has won the victory, and in Him we boast in His victory.</p><p>Both John 16:11 and Revelation 12:11 speak of the cross dealing with Satan. The Lord on the cross was a representation. In its representation, the world was also on the cross (Gal. 6:14), and the prince of the world was also on the cross. In God's eyes the whole world is one entity. Satan is the head of the world. When the Lord was lifted up on the cross, Satan was cast out (John 12:31-33). John 3:14 says, "And as Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up." The bronze serpent which Moses lifted up (bronze being a type of judgment) shows God's judgment. Not only did He judge men, He also judged Satan. After man sinned and fell, he became God's enemy. In John 8:44, the Lord says, "You are of your father the devil." When man followed the devil, he became the descendant of the serpent. Hence, when the Lord was crucified, the descendants of the serpent were included in His crucifixion. As the bronze serpent the Lord does not have the poison of the serpent. He suffered God's judgment as a representative of us, the descendants of the serpent. He bore man's sin, yet He Himself did not know sin (2 Cor. 5:21). The blood of the Lamb enables us to overcome Satan (Rev. 12:11), because the Lord as the bronze serpent has become a representative of the descendants of the serpent. When He was crucified on the cross, Satan was dealt with as well. Hence, the Lord has won the victory.</p><h2 class="head1">HIS EXALTATION IN ASCENSION</h2><p>Ephesians 1:20-22 says, "Which He caused to operate in Christ in raising Him from the dead and seating Him at His right hand in the heavenlies, far above all rule and authority and power and lordship and every name that is named not only in this age but also in that which is to come; and He subjected all things under His feet and gave Him to be Head over all things to the church." These three verses mention the Lord's resurrection and ascension. Resurrection and ascension are equally important. God's will is in heaven, man's will is on earth, and Satan the enemy is in the air. When the Lord ascended, He transcended over all His enemies. Today the Lord occupies such an exalted position that the enemy cannot even touch Him. Ascension signifies a victorious stand, and ascension brings in a new position. Heaven is not part of the enemy's territory, and Satan cannot touch this realm at all. We who are now in Christ and in heaven are also beyond Satan's touch. Ephesians 1:20-22 tells us that the Lord is in heaven, while Ephesians 2:6 tells us that we are seated in the heavenlies with the Lord. The Lord ascended to heaven as a man. This means that now a man has ascended to God. He is a glorified man. He is the first Overcomer. He is the first Man before God. As a man He has transcended over everything.</p><p>Christ defeated the enemy through His birth, temptation, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. He dealt with the enemy as a man and in the position of a man. Because of His victory, God's will in man is fulfilled. By becoming a man, Christ overcame the enemy and accomplished God's eternal purpose.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE ORGANIZATION, GOAL, AND METHODS<br />OF SATAN'S KINGDOM</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 1:13; Acts 26:18; 2 Cor. 2:11; Matt. 12:25-26</h1><p>These few verses show us that Satan has a kingdom. They also show us that Satan has his authority and deceptions. Many believers fail because they are ignorant of the enemy's deceptions. Colossians 1:13 and Acts 26:18 clearly show that Satan has a kingdom and authority. When the Lord talks about a kingdom divided against itself in Matthew 12, He is talking about the kingdom of Satan. The Lord knows that Satan has a kingdom. Today we want to see the organization of Satan's kingdom, the goal of his kingdom, and the methods he employs to reach his goal.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ORGANIZATION OF SATAN'S KINGDOM</h2><p>There are two sides to the organization of Satan's kingdom&mdash;the spiritual side and the physical side. He uses spiritual materials as well as physical materials to build up his kingdom. On the spiritual side, there are corrupted angels and unclean demons, that is, evil spirits. On the physical side, there is man.</p><h2 class="head2">Spiritual Materials</h2><h2 class="head3">Satan Himself&mdash;Revelation 12:9</h2><p>The Hebrew word for Satan is used thirty-five times in the Old Testament. Its Greek equivalent is used thirty-eight times in the New Testament. In the Bible, several names are associated with Satan:</p><p>(1) The dragon (Rev. 12:3-4, 9). The dragon is the one who deceives the whole world. He is referred to in 1 Thessalonians 3:5 as "the tempter." He has seven heads and ten horns and is very powerful.</p><p>(2) The serpent (Gen. 3:1-15). The serpent is most beguiling in seducing men to sin and become fallen.</p><p>(3) The devil (Rev. 12:9). The meaning of the word devil is "the accuser" or "the slanderer." He accuses us before God and slanders us before men.</p><p>(4) Satan (Rev. 12:9). The meaning of the word Satan is "the adversary." He is God's adversary, opposing and rebelling against God.</p><p>(5) Apollyon (Rev. 9:11). The meaning of the word Apollyon is "the destroyer." He is a cruel and treacherous enemy.</p><p>(6) Beelzebul (Matt. 12:24). The meaning of Beelzebul is "the lord of the dunghill." This means he nags and annoys.</p><h2 class="head3">The Corrupted Angels&mdash;Matthew 25:41</h2><p>Revelation 12:4 tells us that one-third of the angels fell and followed Satan when he rebelled against God. With them Satan organized a kingdom of darkness. The "world-rulers of this darkness" in Ephesians 6:12 and the "rulers and authorities" in Colossians 2:15 refer to them.</p><p>Psalm 82 also speaks concerning them. In verse 1 "the congregation of God" and "the gods" refer to these angels. They have been sent by Satan to rule over this world and to deal cruelly with men. In verses 1 through 4 God rebuked their unrighteousness and exhorted them. In verse 5 we are told that they did not take heed to His rebuke and exhortation. Verses 6 and 7 speak of God's judgment and punishment concerning them, and verse 8 is a prayer of the psalmist.</p><p>Daniel 10:13-21 mentions two princes, who are evil, ruling angels, that is, the rulers and authorities under Satan's hand. This passage of the Scriptures shows that behind every nation there is an evil angel sent from Satan, who manipulates its politics behind the scenes.</p><h2 class="head3">The Little Demons</h2><p>There are countless numbers of demons. They are not in the air but on earth. They primarily attach themselves to men, pigs, or idols (Matt. 12:43-45; Luke 8:33; 1 Cor. 10:20). They like to lodge themselves in the human body. These demons were probably citizens of the former world. As proof: (1) They are different from the angels (Acts 23:9), (2) they are different from the spirits of the dead people (Job 7:9), and (3) they are spirits that have been separated from their bodies (Matt. 8:16; Luke 10:17, 20; Matt. 17:18; Mark 9:25). They are divided according to the nations of this world, and each one has his own territory, sphere, and boundaries. They are limited by regional boundaries (Luke 8:31).</p><p>Satan's kingdom is tightly organized, and its numerous messengers keep close surveillance on every move of man. This is why we have to cast out demons and withstand their activities when we pray. These demons are the creatures of the former world who became disembodied spirits (their bodies having been destroyed). When they possess man's body:</p><p>(1) Man becomes bent double and cannot stand erect at all (Luke 13:11).</p><p>(2) Man becomes dumb (Matt. 9:33).</p><p>(3) Man is driven to insanity (Matt. 8:28).</p><p>(4) Man worships idols (1 Cor. 10:20-21; Rev. 9:20; 2 Chron. 11:15; Lev. 17:7; Deut. 32:17).</p><p>More than one demon can possess a human body (Mark 16:9). But a demon can possess only one body. The evil angels are the rulers of this world, while the little demons are out to frustrate men, to torment men, to drive men to insanity, and to motivate men to worship idols. When demons attach themselves to idols, they seduce men to worship them and rob men of their worship of the true God.</p><h2 class="head2">Physical Materials</h2><p>First John 5:19 says, "The whole world lies in the evil one." Satan is the prince of this world, and the whole world, including man, is under his domination. In order to deal with ordinary men, he only needs to release the little demons. But in order to deal with godly men who stand absolutely one with God, like Daniel, he has to call in the princes. (Of course, God also sends angels to protect these godly ones.)</p><h2 class="head1">THE GOAL OF SATAN'S KINGDOM</h2><p>Satan's tightly organized kingdom and numerous messengers exist for the sole purpose of achieving his evil goal. Satan desires four things:</p><p>(1) In eternity he wanted to be the Most High (Isa. 14:14).</p><p>(2) In the garden of Eden he wanted to be like God (Gen. 3:5).</p><p>(3) In the wilderness he wanted to be worshipped (Luke 4:7).</p><p>(4) In the temple he will want to be God (2 Thes. 2:4).</p><p>Satan's consistent goal is to be God and to be worshipped as God. In order to achieve this, he has formed a tightly organized kingdom. He controls all the materials in it on the one hand, and he tries to build up his kingdom on earth on the other hand. He knows that God eventually will establish His kingdom on earth, and he has gone a step ahead of God to establish his own. Genesis 6 reveals how Satan corrupted the men God had created. In Genesis 11, Satan instigated men to corporately rebel against God by building the tower of Babel to make a name for themselves. In Egypt Satan used Pharaoh to persecute the Israelites (Exo. 1:8-22). The great image in Daniel 2:31-43 signifies the earthly kingdoms which are established by Satan himself. These kingdoms up- lift men, rebel against God, and withstand God's kingdom (which at that time was Israel).</p><h2 class="head1">THE METHODS OF SATAN'S KINGDOM</h2><h2 class="head2">His Work in the World</h2><p>(1) Blinding men's thoughts (2 Cor. 4:4).</p><p>(2) Stealing men's worship (Rev. 13:12).</p><p>(3) Snatching away God's word which men have heard, so that men forget what they have heard (Matt. 13:19).</p><p>(4) Bringing in counterfeits&mdash;religion and morality (1 Tim. 4:1-3).</p><p>Satan knows that God hates the flesh. Therefore, he pretends to hate it by instigating men to be vegetarians and to abstain from marriage. He also wins men's hearts by promoting culture and science, creating confusion to convince men of their impotence, and creating false peace to cover up his darkness.</p><h2 class="head2">His Work in the Church</h2><p>(1) Persecutions, threats (Rev. 2:10; Acts 5:28).</p><p>(2) Attacks on the body (2 Cor. 12:7).</p><p>(3) Counterfeits, slanders, and lies (2 Cor. 11:13-15; Rev. 2:9; 3:9).</p><p>(4) Filling men's hearts and causing men to become covetous (Acts 5:3). This shows us that it is difficult to separate Satan from money.</p><p>We have to pay attention to Satan's works. Concerning everything that happens to us, we should not ask what it is but where it is coming from. It is not a matter of good or bad but a matter of the source. Everything that Satan does is with a view to increase his power, kingdom, and authority. He is doing everything he can to oppose God. He exhausts all of his tactics and employs all of his messengers to do just one thing&mdash;win men over. The kind of people he is most afraid of are those who do God's will. Today God's goal is to gain men who will destroy all the works of Satan. Satan's goal is to win men over to oppose God's will. This is a warfare between two thrones. God wants men to destroy Satan's will, while Satan wants men to destroy God's will. May the Lord clearly show us Satan's kingdom, organization, and evil plots. May God cause us to be those who only love His will so that we can deal with Satan, His adversary.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETY-FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE POSITION AND RESPONSIBILITY<br />OF THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:20-23</h1><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE CONTINUATION<br />OF CHRIST'S POSITION AND WORK</h2><p>We have seen the work of the Lord as well as the kingdom and the evil intention of Satan. Now we come to the position and responsibility of the church. In the eyes of God the church occupies a very important place. Its position is that of being joined to Christ, and its responsibility is to continue the warfare that Christ fought on earth. Christ the Head has ascended, but His Body is still on earth. The church, as the Body of Christ, is His propagation, continuing His stand and work to fight against God's enemy.</p><p>Ephesians 1:20-23 shows us that the power which operated in Christ not only raised Him from the dead, but caused Him to ascend to the heavens. This resurrection power is the power of ascension. Through His resurrection the church received its life, and through His ascension the church assumed its position of authority and inherited the kingdom. In this way, He brought heaven to earth, and His will can be done on earth, as in the heavens. Christ ascended to the heavens and received the heavenly authority; now He is able to bring heaven to earth. Resurrection alone is not enough; there must also be ascension. When we stand in the heavenly position, we transcend all things. When the Lord ascended to the heavens, He transcended all the powers of the enemy, and God subjected all things under His feet. (Of course, this is not fully manifested at the present time.)</p><p>Christ ascended and became "Head over all things to the church" (Eph. 1:22). Verse 23 clearly shows that the church and Christ are inseparable. The church is filled with Christ; it is the fullness of Christ, the overflow of Christ. God's desire is to gain a corporate man. The church, which is formed of individual saints who are put into Christ, is the corporate Christ; it is the combination of all the small portions of Christ in the saints. As the Body of Christ, the church is the continuation of Christ. Everything that belongs to Christ belongs to the church. The position that Christ attained is the position that the church has attained. The works that Christ accomplished are sustained and perpetuated through the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH STANDING BETWEEN<br />THE CROSS AND THE KINGDOM</h2><p>The cross of Christ produced the church, and the church brings in the kingdom. Hence, the church stands between the cross and the kingdom. The present age is the time for the church to practically realize the victory of Christ. The Head has overcome; now the Body must also overcome. The Lord destroyed the devil on the cross and produced the church with resurrection life. Today God is establishing His kingdom on earth through His church. The church must continue the victorious work that Christ has carried out against Satan. It is responsible for bringing heaven's will down to earth and for carrying it out on earth.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH CONTINUING CHRIST'S BATTLE ON EARTH</h2><p>In John 12&mdash;16 Satan is spoken of as the ruler of this world three times (12:31; 14:30; 16:11). Presently, he is the ruler of this world, and the nations of this world are his domain. In the millennium, he will be bound and cast into the abyss. Before that time, the church is on the earth to curb the activities of Satan. The prayer of the church is the most effective means of curbing Satan. The church is a miniature of the kingdom. Any place that manifests God's authority is a place where the kingdom is realized (Matt. 12:28). It is our responsibility to put a halt to Satan's will. Wherever the church is, Satan's authority will retreat. The church is on the earth to perpetuate and manifest Christ's victorious stand over Satan.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH CARRYING OUT GOD'S WILL ON EARTH</h2><h2 class="head2">Subduing the Rulers and Authorities</h2><p>The church has a great responsibility on the earth today. On the negative side, the church has to subdue the power of darkness and continue the warfare that Christ waged against Satan. On the positive side, the church brings God's will to earth. Wherever we are, we should stand firm. When we read the daily news, we can find where the enemy is working, and we should render proper, opposing prayers. Second Corinthians 10:4 says, "For the weapons of our warfare are not fleshly but powerful before God for the overthrowing of strongholds." Ephesians 6:12 says, "For our wrestling is not against blood and flesh but against the rulers, against the authorities, against the world-rulers of this darkness, against the spiritual forces of evil in the heavenlies." Our prayer must be powerful before God in order to oppose the power of darkness. Before we can reign in the future, we have to learn to rule over everything today. We rule over the thrones on earth by the throne in heaven. Believers fail because they have not exercised their authority; they have not prayed to reign over the political events. As soon as we see the devil's power or work, we should exercise our authority to pray. If there were no Christians on earth today, the world would be like hell. We have to learn to exercise the overcoming authority of Christ to rule over the power of darkness.</p><h2 class="head2">Preaching the Gospel</h2><p>Everyone in this world is a captive of Satan. But God wants the Christians to recapture the captives through the gospel and win them back to God's side. When God wins one more person, Satan has one less person. First Timothy 2:4 says, "Who desires all men to be saved and to come to the full knowledge of the truth." This shows that the gospel is part of God's will. God delivers men with the purpose of saving them to the extent that God's authority can be fully manifested through them. God wants us to preach the gospel and through it to carry out His will. Those who do not open their mouths and do not testify for God have failed to uphold God's will.</p><h2 class="head2">Casting out Demons</h2><p>Every believer should be able to cast out demons; this act also carries out God's will. When we cast out the demons by the Spirit of God, the kingdom of God has come upon us (Matt. 12:28).</p><h2 class="head2">Overturning Anything Not Found in Heaven</h2><p>We have to overturn anything on earth that is not found in heaven. In heaven there is no lawlessness, sickness, weakness, or hunger because God's will is done in the heavens. If these things come to us through God's permission, they will go away after awhile (Matt. 10:29; Job 38:8-11; Jer. 5:22). But if they are from Satan, they will not go away, even after months and years. We have to differentiate between the things that God has allowed to come upon us and the things that Satan has set to ensnare us. We have to reject anything that comes to us without God's permission. The earth should have only that which is found in heaven. Whatever heaven does not have should not be found on the earth. This is the church's responsibility on the earth.</p><h2 class="head2">Absolutely Obeying God's Will</h2><p>The church must obey God's will absolutely. His will must be done in man before it can be done on earth. Nothing can replace God's will, not even sacrifice, zeal, or work. It is not a matter of good or evil but a matter of God's will. If a work cannot be linked to God's will and cannot inflict loss to the gates of Hades, it is useless. God brings us through many trials because He wants His will to be done, not because He is cruel. God tests us again and again to see what and who we are living for.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Having Private Associations</h2><p>In the casting out of the demon in Acts 19:13-16, we see that the enemy fears only those who do not associate with him in private. He recognizes those who refuse to associate with him. In the kingdom of the demons, a well-recognized name carries much weight. The devil knows and fears men such as Paul, whose names are well-recognized and who are absolutely for God. Some Christians secretly want to associate themselves with the devil. The devil only laughs at such ones because they are not absolute for God's will. They can never shake the gates of Hades. Only those who are absolute and who do not associate themselves with the devil privately will bring God's will to earth.</p><h2 class="head2">Praying</h2><p>Genuine prayer is a joint labor with God to bring His kingdom to the earth and to carry out His will on earth. Hence, prayer is nothing less than a spiritual battle (2 Cor. 10:2, 4; Matt. 6:10; Eph. 6:12). Prayer overturns the power of darkness and opens the way for God's will to be executed on earth.</p><h2 class="head2">Not Belonging to the World</h2><p>We are above the world; we do not belong to this world (John 17:16). Through the cross God delivered us out of this world unto Himself and His will (Gal. 6:14). We should not belong to this world, and we should not return to the reign of Satan. Once we are not of this world, Satan will not have any ground in us. When we are not of this world, we will be free from Satan's authority, and we will be delivered from His reign and kingdom. In this way, God's will can be carried out on earth.</p><p>May God execute His will and accomplish His purpose through the church. The church's responsibility on the earth today is to perpetuate Christ's victory on the earth and to bring in God's kingdom. When the church is faithful to its position and responsibility, God's eternal purpose will be accomplished.</p><h1 class="series">SECTION TWELVE<br />CONFERENCE ON<br />THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETY-SIX</h1><h1 class="title">THE MYSTERY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:4-6; John 12:32; Luke 12:50-52</h1><h2 class="head1">THE MYSTERY HIDDEN IN THE AGES</h2><p>In Ephesians 3:4-6 Paul speaks of his understanding of the mystery of Christ. This mystery was not made known to the sons of men in other generations. The men of old did not know of the mystery that God spoke through Paul, which involves the Jews and Gentiles becoming one new man in Christ Jesus. This is the corporate Christ, which is the church. Verse 6 of chapter three is a precious verse. The words "fellow members" refer to the new man in Ephesians 2:15. The new man stands in contrast to the old man. There are many individual men in this world, but there is only one old man. In the same way, there are many Christians, but there is only one new man&mdash;the church.</p><h2 class="head1">ONE NEW MAN</h2><p>In order to understand what the new man is, we must first understand what the old man is. The old man is the God-created man who fell through sin. Every person in Adam is not only a sinner before God, but also an old man. When such a sinner, the old man, hears the gospel and believes in Christ and is saved, he becomes a new man. Not only has he become a new man individually; he is joined to all other Christians to become one corporate new man as well. Ephesians 1 speaks of the church as the Body of Christ; chapter two speaks of the church as the new man; chapter three speaks of the mystery of Christ; chapter four speaks of the way to build up the Body of Christ; chapter five speaks of the responsibility of the church; and chapter six speaks of the warfare of the church. The peak of God's work is the church, which is the new man. God saves us so that we will become a new man in Christ.</p><p>A great lack among Christians today is that everyone wants to be an individual Christian. Everyone wants to be good and zealous; everyone wants to sit and listen to good sermons. In short, everyone wants to be a Christian in an individual way. But God does not just want us to be good on an individual basis. He is after a corporate vessel that will destroy Satan and accomplish His plan. God does not want to see Christians scattered like a pan of sand. He wants Christians to be joined together to become a corporate new man.</p><h2 class="head1">WHAT IS THE NEW MAN?</h2><p>Ephesians 2 speaks of Christ creating one new man out of two groups of people, but it does not tell us what the new man is like. According to Colossians 3:10-12, the new man is renewed unto full knowledge according to the image of Him who created him. In the new man there is no Greek or Jew, circumcision or uncircumcision, barbarian or Scythian, slave or free man, but Christ is all and in all. The new man is not a matter of having or not having distinctions; it is a matter of either being the new man or being nothing. The new man is not in the realm of being a Greek or a Jew. The new man is simply Christ. The nature of the new man is Christ. In the new man Christ is all and in all. We can even venture to say that Christ is the church and the church is Christ, because everything in the new man&mdash;the church&mdash;is simply Christ. The constitution of the new man is nothing less than Christ Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING CHRIST</h2><p>Since the nature of the new man&mdash;the church&mdash;is Christ, we can say that the church is Christ. Let us read two passages. In Luke 12:50-52 the Lord said, "I have a baptism to be baptized with,...Do you think that I have come to give peace on the earth? No, I tell you, but rather division." Why did the Lord say this? He said this because He had said that He would cast fire on the earth. This fire is the fire of God's life. This means He would release His life on the earth to all those who would believe in Him so that they would be regenerated and receive God's life. This matter, however, could only be accomplished after His baptism, which refers to His crucifixion. John 12 reveals that the church is produced out of Christ's death and resurrection. He is the grain of wheat that fell into the earth, died, and brought forth many grains&mdash;the church&mdash;in resurrection. From these two passages we can see that the church is produced by the life of Christ. Through His death and resurrection, Christ released His life and dispensed it into the believers. These believers are then joined together to become the church.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE CORPORATE CHRIST</h2><p>In the New Testament there are two ways to look at Christ. On the one hand, He is Jesus Christ the Nazarene&mdash;this is the individual Christ. On the other hand, He is Christ plus the church&mdash;the corporate Christ. First Corinthians 12:12 refers to the second aspect when it says, "All the members of the body, being many, are one body, so also is the Christ." Anything apart from Christ is not the church. There is only one thing in a Christian that forms a part of the church&mdash;Christ. The church is the corporate Christ. In the church there is only Christ. During the bread-breaking meeting, the portion that we break off from the whole still signifies the Body of Christ, the church. The church is not what is added to Christ but what issues out from Christ.</p><p>Today there are divisions among God's children because there are differences in organizations, personal views, concepts, choices, preferences, and doctrines. But in God's eyes the church is inseparable. All these differences are merely outward differences; they are not differences in the intrinsic reality of the church. The church is the composition of all the believers with Christ. The church is the corporate Christ. When all the saints are joined together in Christ, we have the church. Since there is only one Christ, there can be only one church. Hence, it is indivisible and inseparable.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETY-SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE BODY OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:4-6; Col. 3:4-11; Rom. 12:3-5</h1><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>In this message we will speak on the Body of Christ. In the New Testament, Paul was the only apostle who used the expression the Body of Christ to denote the church. In other places in the New Testament, the church is called the temple of God, the household of God, etc. But Paul specifically said that the church is the Body of Christ. The subject here is not us becoming the sons of God or becoming Christians. We are talking about how the church becomes the Body of Christ. We can say that the church is Christ in a different form. Christ was the only begotten Son of God. Now He has become the Firstborn. Christ plus all the sons&mdash;the church&mdash;is the one Body. There are no individual persons in the church; there is only Christ in the church. Anything that issues from Christ is the church. The church comes fully out of Christ and is one with Christ. There is no need for a Christian to do anything or change anything in order to be in Christ. As long as a man is regenerated, he is in Christ and becomes a part of the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING A MATTER OF LIFE</h2><p>The church as the Body of Christ is absolutely a matter of life. The church as the Body of Christ is not a doctrine; it is of life. A man cannot become a part of the Body of Christ just by understanding it. He becomes a part of the Body of Christ through regeneration. This is absolutely a matter of life; it has nothing to do with knowledge or doctrine. As Christians we need very much to see the Body of Christ. But the only way we can see the Body of Christ is by God's revelation. We cannot understand the Body of Christ with our mind. Even if we have all the knowledge there is about the Body of Christ, we still may not have seen the Body of Christ or touched the reality of the Body. Only those who have received revelation from God will see the Body of Christ, and only they will enter the reality of the Body.</p><p>Romans 12 tells us that the church is the Body of Christ, but it does not explain how the church becomes the Body of Christ. In order to understand how the church becomes the Body of Christ, we have to understand Romans 5 through 8. Chapter five tells us that all men are joined to Adam and that man derives his life from Adam. Through Adam's fall, all men have become sinners and have been joined to the old man. Chapter six tells us that the old man has to be dealt with; it has to be crucified with Christ. Through Christ's redemption, we have died and resurrected. Chapter seven says that a man should no longer live according to the flesh but according to the Spirit. Chapter eight goes on to explain how we live according to the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING<br />THE CONSUMMATION OF THE WORK OF THE CROSS</h2><p>The consummation of the work of the cross is the church. The work of the cross goes as far as the Body of Christ and consummates with the Body of Christ. Hence, the knowledge of the cross brings us to the knowledge of the Body of Christ. The cross brings a man to a state of weakness and inability, one in which he totally loses hope in the old creation. When he is brought to this point, he is delivered in a real way from the old creation and brought into the new creation. Everything in the old creation has been condemned and terminated by the cross. The Body of Christ is the new creation; it has nothing to do with the old creation. If we resort to human methods, tactics, and skills (which we have used in the past) to deal with the affairs of the church, the result will only be disastrous. God does not approve of anything that is from the old creation, and He will not allow anything from the old creation to remain in the new creation. Everything of the old creation must pass through the cross and remain on the cross. The church has no use for anything that comes from the old man. The church only takes that which issues from Christ.</p><p>When man fell, he fell because of his own concepts, choices, and judgments. Therefore, God will not allow anything that issues from the old creation to gain the upper hand. The "backbone" of the natural man must be broken; the hollow of his thigh must be touched. Before he will submit to God, he must be crippled and fall flat on his face. This is what God is doing in the new creation. He is smashing everything of the old creation, and He is constituting us with everything that issues from Christ so that we can become the Body of Christ in practicality. I saw the evil of man's flesh twelve years ago in Philippians 3, Romans 5, and John 5. For seven months I was hesitant to make any move at all, because I knew that everything that issued from the flesh would be rejected by God. God wants to remove everything in man that is from the flesh. God's children must first deal with the natural life. If they deal with their natural life, they will be in the Body spontaneously, because the Body of Christ is composed of everything that issues from Christ. Nothing of the old man can remain in the Body. As soon as a man passes through the experience in Romans 5 through 8, he can enter into the experience of Romans 12.</p><p>Today the church is divided because Christians are living in the wrong realm and the wrong sphere. Christians are not living in the new creation or in the reality of the Body of Christ. They are living only in the superficiality of doctrines, which belongs to man's natural life and is part of man's oldness. If every Christian was willing to be dealt with and to leave the natural things and the old creation behind, and if every one of them was willing to live in the reality of the Body of Christ, there would be no more divisions. May the Lord be merciful to us to see what the Body of Christ is. May the work of the cross usher us into the Body of Christ.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETY-EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />BEING A BELIEVER AND BEING A MEMBER</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:3-6; 4:15-16; Col. 3:10-11; Rom. 12:4-5; 1 Cor. 12:4-16, 20, 26</h1><p>In the last two messages we saw that the church is the corporate Christ, and we saw also that in order to know the Body of Christ, we have to deal with our natural life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING THE EXPRESSION OF CHRIST</h2><p>What is the Body of Christ? The Body of Christ is the continuation of Christ's life on earth. When He came to the earth and lived on earth, He expressed Himself through a body. Today He still requires a body to express Himself. Just as a man needs a body to express all that he is, Christ needs a body to express Himself. The function of the Body is to be the full expression of Christ. We cannot manifest our personality through any one member of our body&mdash;the ears, mouth, eyes, hands, or feet&mdash;alone. Similarly, Christ cannot manifest His personality through any one member of His Body. It takes His whole Body to manifest Him. We must see that everything of Christ is expressed through His Body. This is not all. The Body of Christ is the extension and continuation of Christ on earth. He spent more than thirty years on earth to reveal Himself. He did this as the individual Christ. Today He is revealing Himself through the church. This is the corporate Christ. Formerly, Christ was expressed individually; now He is expressed corporately.</p><h2 class="head1">THE BODY OF CHRIST BEING<br />THE CORPORATE VESSEL TO FULFILL GOD'S PLAN</h2><p>God is after a corporate vessel, not individual vessels. He is not choosing a few zealous, consecrated ones to work for Him individually. Individual vessels cannot fulfill God's goal and plan. God has chosen the church, and He is after the church. Only the church as the corporate Christ can fulfill God's goal and plan.</p><p>Consider our human body. No member of our body can act independently. It is impossible for a body to depend on one hand or one leg. However, if the body loses a member, it will not be complete. The Body of Christ is composed of all the believers. Every believer is a member in the Body of Christ, and every believer is indispensable.</p><p>The Body of Christ is a reality. The church life is also a reality. The Word of God does not say the church is like the Body of Christ; it says the church is the Body of Christ. Nothing external can become part of our physical bodies. We may clothe our bodies, but the clothes do not become part of our bodies. Nothing that is of us can ever become part of the Body of Christ, because "Christ is all and in all" in the Body (Col. 3:11). Anything in us that is not a part of Christ frustrates our inward knowledge of the Body of Christ. Sin hinders us from seeing Christ, and the natural life hinders us from seeing the Body. We all must see our position in the Body of Christ. If we truly see our position in the Body, it will be as though we were saved a second time.</p><p>The Adamic life is individualistic and independent. Even though everyone in Adam shares the same life, there is no fellowship among them. We all commit sin, yet we each take our own way. Everyone in Adam lives as separate individuals. In Christ everything that is individualistic is ruled out. If we want to know the Body life, we need deliverance not only from our sinful life and our natural life, but also from our individualistic life. All individual elements must go because nothing that is individualistic can reach God's goal.</p><h2 class="head1">THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN<br />BEING A MEMBER AND BEING A CHRISTIAN</h2><p>The New Testament shows us that there is a difference between being a member and being a Christian. Being a Christian is something individualistic, whereas being a member is something corporate. Being a Christian is something one does for himself, whereas being a member is something for the Body. In the Bible there are many terms with opposite meanings, such as purity and uncleanness, holiness and commonness, victory and defeat, the Spirit and the flesh, Christ and Satan, the kingdom and the world, and glory and shame. All these are opposites. In the same way, the Body is in opposition to the individual. Just as the Father is versus the world, the Spirit is versus the flesh, and the Lord is versus the devil, so also is the Body versus the individual. Once a man sees the Body of Christ, he is free from individualism. He will no longer live for himself but for the Body. Once I am delivered from individualism, I am spontaneously in the Body.</p><p>The Body of Christ is not a doctrine; it is a realm. It is not a teaching, but a life. Many Christians seek to teach the truth of the Body, but few know the life of the Body. The Body of Christ is an experience in a totally different realm. A man can know the book of Romans without being justified. Similarly, a man can know the book of Ephesians without seeing the Body of Christ. We do not need knowledge; rather, we need revelation to know the reality of the Body of Christ and to enter the realm of the Body. Only a revelation from God will usher us into the realm of the Body, and only then will the Body of Christ become our experience.</p><p>In Acts 2 it seems as if Peter was preaching the gospel alone and that three thousand people were saved through him. But we must remember that the other eleven apostles were standing beside him. The Body of Christ was preaching the gospel; it was not the preaching of an individual. If we have the view of the Body, we will see that individualism will not bring us anywhere.</p><p>If we realize that a Christian is nothing more than a member, we will no longer be proud. Everything depends on our seeing. Those who see that they are members will surely treasure the Body and honor the other members. They will not see just their own virtues; they will readily see others as being better than themselves.</p><p>Every member has a function, and all the functions are for the Body. The function of one member is the function of the whole Body. When one member does something, the whole Body does it. When the mouth speaks, the whole body is speaking. When the hands work, the whole body is working. When the legs walk, the whole body is walking. We cannot divide the members from the body. Therefore, the movement of the members of the Body must be focused around the Body. Everything that the members do should be for the Body. Ephesians 4 says that the Body is growing into a full-grown man. It does not say that individuals are growing into full-grown men. In chapter three the ability to know the love of Christ and to apprehend the Lord's breadth, length, height, and depth is with all the saints. No one can know or apprehend by himself. An individual does not have the time or the capacity to experience the love of Christ in that kind of way.</p><p>First Corinthians 12:14 through 36 speaks of two erroneous concepts that members may have: (1) "Because I am not...I am not of the body" (v. 15). This is to despise oneself and covet the work of others. (2) "I have no need of you" (v. 21). This is to be proud of oneself, thinking that one man can be all-inclusive, and despising others. Both concepts are harmful to the Body. We should not imitate other members or be covetous of other members. In this way we will not become discouraged and give up when we find that we cannot be like others. At the same time, we should not despise other members, thinking that we are better and more useful.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONSCIOUSNESS OF THE BODY</h2><p>In the church life, we should learn to have the consciousness of the Body. When we are at odds with the brothers and sisters, it means that we are surely at odds with God. Some Christians are like butterflies; they act independently. Others are like bees; they live and move together. The butterfly flies from flower to flower, going its own sweet way; but the bee works for the hive. The butterfly lives and works individually, but the bee has a body-consciousness. We should all be like bees, having the consciousness of the Body so that we can live together with other members in the Body of Christ. Wherever there is Body-revelation, there is Body-consciousness, and wherever there is Body-consciousness, individual thought and action are automatically ruled out. Seeing Christ results in deliverance from sin; seeing the Body results in deliverance from individualism. Seeing the Body and deliverance from individualism are not two things but one. As soon as we see the Body, our life and work as individuals cease. It is not a matter of changing our attitude or conduct; revelation does the work. We cannot enter the realm of the Body by anything other than seeing. A real inward seeing settles the whole problem.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINETY-NINE</h1><h1 class="title">THE SUPPLY OF THE BODY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:3-6; 2:15; Col. 3:10-11; 1 Cor. 12:20-21; Rom. 12:3-6</h1><h2 class="head1">THE NEED FOR THE SUPPLY OF THE BODY</h2><p>Every Christian should know that he is only a member. If he does not have the other members, he will not survive. In the Body all the members must be joined together before they can become the Body. All the members in the Body are related to one another, and they cannot be separated from one another. Between the members there must be a mutual supply and a mutual relatedness. Only then can the members survive. If a Christian lives an independent life, sooner or later he will weaken and dry up. If I am an ear, I cannot see and neither should I expect to see by myself. The whole body is dependent upon the eyes for sight, and no amount of prayer will give sight to the other members. If I am an ear, what should I do if I want to see something? I should go to the eyes&mdash;a brother or sister who sees&mdash;and ask for help. In order to go on with the Lord, we must recognize His supply for us in the Body and avail ourselves of it. The whole Body is built up through the interdependence among the members.</p><p>When I was in Southeast Asia, I had a talk with some brothers and sisters. Someone asked, "Why am I not living as before? I have not committed any particular sins that I know of, and I have not disobeyed the Lord in any way. I have not taken back my consecration or changed my mind about the money I have offered to the Lord. Outwardly, there does not seem to be any change in my spiritual condition. But why I am not the same as before? I seem to have lost the joy and the vitality that I once had." I answered, "The reason is that you have lived in your self for too long. You have to get into the Body life." In order for a member to live a normal life, he must receive the supply from the other members. If a man is not living in the Body of Christ, he will not receive the Body's supply. No member can say that he does not need the other members. No member may detach himself from other members to live alone.</p><p>Romans 12:3 says, "Not to think more highly of himself than he ought to think." We should not think too highly of ourselves, and we should not think that others are inferior. We should not despise and reject other members of the Body. Peter thought that the other members would fall and fail but that he would not. But when the test came, he failed just the same as everyone else. Those who think highly of themselves and despise other members will end up in trouble sooner or later. In the Body of Christ everyone is a member  and nothing more than a member. Hence, no member can live without the other members, much less despise them.</p><h2 class="head1">THE INTERCESSION OF THE MEMBERS</h2><p>Many of us have the experience that when we are dry and have no way to go on, we need other brothers and sisters to intercede for us before we can get through. Once I was sick for one hundred seventy-six days. I prayed for my own sickness every day, but it did not work. When I became exhausted, I asked a brother whom I did not think too highly of to pray for me. Amazingly, I received help from his intercession, and my condition became better within a short period of time. Brother Holz is known for his prayer life. When he was a missionary in China, he often asked a young brother to pray with him. Even if the young brother had nothing to say, it was still a help to him when the young brother sat in the room. Brothers and sisters, please remember that this is the supply of the Body. The supply of the Body of Christ is a reality. You cannot get through in many things no matter how much you struggle. But once you give the matter to the Body, the problem is solved. This is the supply of the Body of Christ.</p><p>In the years after 1930, many places in China experienced the outpouring of the Holy Spirit, especially around Shantung province. At that time I had been saved for about ten years. I desired to have the outpouring, but I could not experience it. Later I went to Chefoo and asked the brothers and sisters there to pray for me. Not long afterwards, I received the outpouring. There was a brother in England who had the knowledge of victory in Christ, but he was unable to overcome a certain sin. A few brothers and I prayed for him, and he overcame. I can mention dozens of examples which show the effect of the Body's intercession. The prayer of the Body renders the life supply to members in need. God dispenses the life supply to His members through many other members. If the finger wants the supply of the blood, it has to receive it through the shoulder and the arm. Similarly, as members in the Body, we receive our supply through the other members. Therefore, it is foolish to try to separate ourselves from the other members.</p><h2 class="head1">LIVING IN THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2><p>What are the eyes, ears, hands, and feet? They are Christ Himself. The Head is Christ, and the Body is also Christ. Each member is a part of the life of Christ. If I refuse the help of my fellow-members, I am refusing the help of Christ. If I am not willing to acknowledge my need of them, I am not willing to acknowledge my need of Christ. Just as I cannot be independent from the Head, I cannot be independent from the Body. Individualism is hateful in the sight of God. What I do not know, another member of the Body will know; what I cannot see, another member of the Body will see; what I cannot do, another member of the Body will do. Therefore, I must allow the other members of the Body to minister to my needs. We must avail ourselves constantly of the fellowship of the Body, for it is our very life.</p><p>In the Old Testament, being out of the fellowship was the most severe punishment that could be visited upon the children of Israel. They "shall be cut off from his people." This is very serious. If it were God's intention for us to live as individuals, we could progress perfectly well apart from one another. However, He has made us members of His Body; therefore, we cannot possibly grow apart from one another.</p><p>We have to see the reality of the supply in the Body of Christ, and we have to learn to live in the Body and to receive the supply in the Body. In the Old Testament the lampstand was placed in the sanctuary. In order for a man to see light, he had to enter the sanctuary. In the New Testament the sanctuary is the church. If a man wants to see light, he has to come to the church. In the church meetings and among the brothers and sisters, God's light is much stronger than in individuals. Today God's sanctuary is the church; God Himself dwells in the church. Hence, His light is in the church. A man can only see light if he comes to the church. Everything that Christ has is in His Body. He is a foolish man who claims that he can be a Christian alone. Sooner or later, all individual Christians will dry up. As long as we live in the Body, we will receive the supply of the Body, no matter what our condition is. Every member should learn to treasure the supply of the Body and to treasure every member. We must all learn to live in the Body, that is, we must all learn to live in the supply of the Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED</h1><h1 class="title">THE PROTECTION, LIMITATION, AND MINISTRY OF THE BODY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 3:3-6; 2:15</h1><h2 class="head1">THE PROTECTION OF THE BODY</h2><p>We have seen that the church is the Body of Christ. This Body renders supply to every member of the Body. Furthermore, this Body also renders protection to every member. This is especially important when it comes to the matter of spiritual warfare. Ephesians is a book that deals specifically with the Body of Christ. In chapter six we see that spiritual warfare is something that is related to the church, not to individuals. It is the plural you that must put on the whole armor of God, not the singular you. Satan is not afraid of individuals. He is afraid of the church. "Upon this rock I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it" (Matt. 16:18). We must meet the devil on the ground of the Body. Even in our private prayers we should stand by faith on the ground of the Body. Many Christians fall before the foe because they stand alone. In fact, if we stand alone, we invite Satan's attack.</p><p>We must remember that the spiritual armor is for the church, not for individuals. The Body of Christ puts on the whole armor of God. In the Body every member has its specialty, and all these specialties combined together form the whole armor of God. If a brother has faith, he has the shield of faith. If another brother has the word of God, he has the sword of the Spirit. The whole armor of God is the totality of all the specialties of the members. Hence, the whole armor is for the whole church, not for individuals. Spiritual warfare is an integrated warfare of all the members; it is not the isolated warfare of individuals. A single tree can be blown down easily, but a whole forest cannot be blown down easily. Satan likes to pick out those who are without any covering as the objects of his attacks. He looks for men who are alone and isolated. Whoever is under the protection of the Body is sheltered. One function of the Body of Christ is to protect all the members. We need the covering of the Body; otherwise, we will be constantly exposed to the enemy. An isolated individual is also prone to be deceived, so we need the covering of the Body for this as well. We should consult constantly with our fellow- believers. We must not only acknowledge the need for the Body in a general way, but we should also go to our brothers and sisters in a specific way and ask for help.</p><p>The Body of Christ is a reality; it is not a doctrine or a theory. The protection of the Body is also a reality and not a doctrine. Immediately after I was saved, I read in the Bible about bearing the cross. I thought that if I memorized the verses on this subject, I would be bearing the cross and that if I forgot the verses, I would not be bearing the cross. Later, I found out that bearing the cross has nothing to do with our memory. Our memory merely retains the doctrine. If the Lord's word is life to us, nothing will affect our bearing of the cross. It does not matter whether or not we remember the word, because if the word is life to us, it has already become a law of life in us and is no longer just an outward legal ordinance to us. The same is true with the Body of Christ&mdash;it is a law of life. Once we experience this life, we are under the operation of this law of life, and we discover that the protection of the Body is a reality and not an outward law.</p><p>Soldiers hide in the trenches for their protection in physical warfare. They cannot expose their heads; to do so is dangerous. This is also true in spiritual warfare. No member should be alone, and no member should expose his head. We are merely members in the Body, and we need the protection of the brothers and sisters. When Moses lifted up his hands to pray for the Israelites, he needed the help of Aaron and Hur. With their help the Israelites prevailed over the Amalekites. If a man as strong as Moses needed the help of his brothers, how much more do we need the help of our brothers? Many people do things without consulting and praying with the brothers and sisters. They are ignorant of the protection of the Body, and the result is nothing but failure. We all must see the reality of the Body's protection, hide under its protection, and accept its safeguard.</p><p>This is the difference between one who has revelation of the Body and one who does not: The one who knows the Body merely as a truth may seek the counsel and covering of the Body, but he will do it as a matter of policy, not as a matter of life. When he thinks of it he will do it, but he can also forget about it. The one who has seen the Body as a reality and has entered experientially into the realm of the Body has no possibility of forgetting. His acting by the Body-principle is something spontaneous because it is his life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LIMITATION OF THE BODY</h2><p>If you are simply a believer, you can act as you please, but if you are a member of the Body, then you must allow yourself to be limited by the other members. Here we find the necessity of the cross. The cross leads to the Body, and the cross operates in the sphere of the Body. If I am quick and another is slow, I must not insist on keeping my own pace; I must allow myself to be limited by the slow member. If I am a prophet, then I must give way to the evangelist when it comes to the matter of preaching to the unsaved. I should not feel the need to preach just because I have the gift of prophecy. "To each one of us grace was given according to the measure of the gift of Christ" (Eph. 4:7). It is essential for the development of the Body that we each recognize our measure and not go beyond it. This is a basic requirement for the growth of the Body.</p><p>The Body of Christ is not only a protection to the members but a limitation to all the members. Every Christian is but one member in the Body of Christ and must accept the limitation of the Body. We should not allow ourselves to go our own way; rather, we should learn to be blended with other brothers and sisters. Individual dispositions and peculiarities have no place in the church. Every member should honor the talents of others and be faithful to his own. Moreover, every member should know his own capacity and not consider himself more highly than he should. If everyone does this, there will be no jealousy, ambition, or craving to do what others can do. In 2 Corinthians 10:14 Paul said, "For we are not extending ourselves beyond our bounds, as if we did not reach you." Yet many people have not seen their own capacity. As a result they overstep their boundaries. Those who over- step their boundaries are trampling others under their feet; they are kicking others, pressing upon others, and usurping the portion of other members. If members behave this way in the church, some will begin to monopolize while others will withdraw, and the result will be a loss to the church. We should not behave in this way. We should turn back and take our place in the Body and be limited by the Body. If we do this, the Body will be spared from damage.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF THE BODY</h2><p>The fellowship in the Body involves not only receiving help from other members but also giving help to other members. The functioning of the Body is mutual. Mutuality is the characteristic of the Body. Even when there is ministry from the pulpit, the ministry should never be one-sided. The pulpit needs the help of the congregation just as the congregation needs the help of the pulpit. Merely being a listener or an onlooker is contrary to the life of the Body. Every Christian should have a part in the meeting and render supply to other members. This kind of supply is the ministry of the members and the function of the members. It is also the fellowship of life. No member should cut himself off from this fellowship. If you stop this fellowship, life will stop flowing, and you will become a burden to the Body. If a person thinks that he does not need to say anything, and that he will be approved of and not cause any trouble as long as he simply, quietly, and politely receives from others, he does not know what the Body of Christ is. Every member has to render supply to the Body and fellowship and function in the Body. This is a law of the Body. In the physical body no member can cease functioning without there being a loss to the whole body. This is also true in the Body of Christ.</p><p>In the church meeting every member should function according to the leading of the Holy Spirit. First Corinthians 14:26 says, "What then, brothers? Whenever you come together, each one has a psalm, has a teaching, has a revelation....Let all things be done for building up." In spite of this, many people come to the meetings as spectators. They are a heavy burden to the Body. The Lord told the Pharisees that if His disciples did not rejoice and praise God with great shouting, the rocks would cry out. It is abnormal to not function in the meeting, and this is not pleasing to the Lord. Every time you come to a meeting, you should enter into the fellowship. With every believer, there should be the flow of life. If you do not fellowship, you hinder God's life and kill the meeting. I have often asked those who come to the bread-breaking meeting whether they are coming as spectators or whether they are coming for fellowship. Anyone who hinders God's life is not only bringing death to the meeting but also bringing death upon himself. What do you contribute to your fellow members when the church gathers together?</p><p>If a member fails to function, not only do the other members suffer loss, but the member himself is impoverished. I am enriched by giving to others. When I quench others' thirst, my own thirst is quenched. This is like the Lord's experience with the woman in John 4. The Lord was thirsty, but His own thirst was satisfied when He took care of the spiritual thirst of the woman. When His disciples brought Him food, He said, "I have food to eat that you do not know about" (v. 32). He was ministered to by ministering to another. Whenever we try to satisfy ourselves, we end up being hungry. But whenever we satisfy others, we are fed. When we bear the burdens of others, our own burden becomes light.</p><p>Many people complain that this or that meeting is not good. They do not realize the kind of attitude that they have brought to the meeting. Whenever we stop functioning, we frustrate God's life. When we come to the meeting, we have to open our mouth, release life, and participate in the Body ministry. Once I was preaching in a place, and the meeting was very dead. But one of the sisters rendered a great help by responding to my words. She kept saying "amen" to my speaking and responded with much expression on her face, indicating that she was taking in my words. Because of her response, I was released and God's word was also released.</p><p>May the Lord show us that we all have a share in the meeting. It is not enough for us to speak about the Body; we have to express the Body in our living. The Body of Christ is not a doctrine; it is a reality in life. God wants us to enter into the Body life, not to have the doctrine of the Body. We have received the life of the Body, not a doctrine about the Body. Martin Luther did not receive the doctrine of justification by faith but the life of justification by faith. As a consequence his ministry was powerful. The justification that he spoke of was not a doctrine but a reality in life. Today we all must receive the revelation of the reality of the Body and enter into the life of the Body. Then we will see that we are members of the Body of Christ, that we need the protection and limitation of the Body, and that we need to function in the Body and supply other members so that the life of the Body will flow in an unhindered way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED ONE</h1><h1 class="title">AUTHORITY IN THE BODY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 1:22; 2:15; 3:3-6; 4:15-16; Col. 2:19; 3:10-11</h1><h2 class="head1">THE AUTHORITY OF THE BODY RESTING IN THE HEAD</h2><p>The Bible emphatically tells us that Christ is the Head. One day God will head up everything in the universe under Christ. Today the universe has not come under the headship of Christ yet, and everything is in a state of confusion. But one day God will head up everything under the headship of Christ. God ordained that Christ should exercise headship over all things, but today that headship must first be exercised in the church, and then through the church the headship will be exercised over all things. Today Christ is the Head of the church. Eventually, He will be the Head over all things. The church is God's means of enlarging Christ, and this enlargement will go on until He fills the entire universe. The church is "the fullness of the One who fills all in all" (Eph. 1:23). If the headship of Christ is not established in the church, it cannot be established in the universe.</p><p>What do Christ being the Head of the church and the church being the Body of Christ mean? They mean that all authority is in Him. All authority is in Him because all life is in Him. The whole Body is consummated in Him; He is the fountainhead of the life of the Body. The Body has no life of its own. "God gave to us eternal life and this life is in His Son" (1 John 5:11). Even after eternal life is given to us, it still rests in His Son. The Son does not part with it; He retains it in Himself. "He who has the Son has the life" (v. 12). This verse does not say, "He who has the life has the life." We do not possess life as life; only by possessing the Son do we have life. A Christian receives his life from the Lord. Yet this life can never be separated from the Lord. A believer is related not just to life. By being related to this life, a believer is related to the Son of God. This life makes us members of the Body of Christ. This life relationship rules out the possibility of being separated from the Head, because our life is derived from the Head. The flow of life in us continually depends upon our relationship to the Son. As soon as there is any obstruction in our fellowship with Him, the life in us is immediately blocked. He is the Head of the Body, and life can flow freely to us only when He is in full control.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MEMBERS' PLACE BEING<br />TO SUBMIT TO THE AUTHORITY OF THE HEAD</h2><p>The power of our existence is derived from Christ. This is why we cannot do anything independently. Only the Lord is our Head, and only He has the authority to direct the moves of the members of His Body. In this age of lawlessness, any suggestion of the need of authority is unwelcome; but if we are to understand and enter into the life of the Body, we must know the authority of the Head. My hand can do nothing without direction from the head. The head must command if the members are to move. Christ is the life of the Body, and Christ is also the authority in the Body. All the moves of the members of His Body must be under the direction of the Head. For Christ to be the Head means that He has the authority in the Body. We are not the head, and we do not have the authority. The only thing we should do is submit to the authority of the Lord. If we seek to know the life of the Body, a question will immediately arise: Do we bow to the absolute authority of the Lord? We will be challenged at the outset by the headship of Christ. We cannot say, "But..." We cannot say, "I think..." We can only bow to His sovereignty. We need to realize that if we are going to be members of the Body, we cannot be the Head. We cannot dictate, choose, or even desire. The Bible says that we should follow the Lord. What does it mean to follow the Lord? Following means coming after. The Lord is the One who decides our pathway. We do not have any ground for our own choice. The Body's only duty toward the Head is obedience and submission without any opinion, idea, or proposal. In the Body of Christ, no individual's idea or proposal counts; all these have to be cast down. We should only submit to the authority of the Head. We should just listen to His command and do as He says.</p><p>An acceptance of Christ as Head involves a repudiation of all other heads. Christ alone is the Head of the Body; no one else can be the head. You cannot be the head, nor can anyone in the church be the head, because there can only be one Head in the Body; there cannot be two heads. Only Christ is the Head. Therefore, all of us have to obey Christ. Today we see many human methods and ordinances abounding in the church. How wrong this is! Human plans and human decisions are against the headship of Christ. If Christ is my Head, then I will not dare to please myself or others; I must seek to please Him alone. "God has made Him both Lord and Christ" (Acts 2:36). Note that God has not set up Christ as Savior but as Lord. Paul first saw Christ as Lord and then as Savior. When he was apprehended on the road to Damascus, his first question was, "Who are You, Lord?" (9:5). Only Christ is the Head in the church; there is no other head. If we desire to live in the Body of Christ, we have to learn to submit to the authority of our Lord Jesus. Anyone who cannot submit, who always expresses his opinions and proposals, and who insists on being the head has never seen the Body. Once a man realizes that he is a member in the Body, there will surely be a feeling of submission in him because submission is a law of the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">HOLDING THE HEAD</h2><p>Paul spoke of "holding the Head, out from whom all the Body, being richly supplied and knit together by means of the joints and sinews, grows with the growth of God" (Col. 2:19). Since Christ is the Head of the Body, we have to hold the Head. Holding the Head is acknowledging that only Christ is the Head; it is coming absolutely under His authority. We can be joined to the brothers and sisters only when we hold the Head. The members of the Body are fitted together and able to live the Body life through holding the Head. Our relationship to the Head determines our relationship to the other members. All the questions regarding our relationship with the brothers and sisters can only be solved when we come under the absolute authority of the Lord. Unless we recognize the headship of Christ in the Body, we will never have a perfect fellowship with the other members, because it is our common relationship to Him that causes us to be related to one another. We may look different outwardly, but the Christ within us is the same. This is why we can fellowship with one another and be one with each other. Apart from Christ, we have no means of fellowship. When we do not hold the Head, our fellowship becomes invalid. The basis of our fellowship is our mutual holding of the Head. When we all hold the Head, we will hold to one another, and our relationship with the Body will be proper.</p><p>If we hold the Head, we cannot have a special relationship, feeling, or fellowship with any individual or group of individuals. There is no room for our own preferences in the Body. We have no direct communion one with another; it is all through the Head. For instance, when my left hand hurts, my right hand comes to its aid immediately. The right hand does this because both the left hand and the right hand are under the direction of the head. The mutual relationship of the members passes through the Head first. What does it mean to form parties? Forming parties means that a few Christians have a direct relationship with one another and are detached from the authority of the Head. They communicate with each other directly, but their communication has not passed through the Head. They have a special relationship with one another, but their relationship has not passed through the Head.</p><p>We must not move in relation to another member except under the direction of the Lord. If He asks us to do something for a fellow member and the fellow member does not appreciate it, we do not need to worry since all of our dealings are with the Head. If we hold the Head, getting all our direction from Him and doing all as unto Him, we do not need to worry about the consequences.</p><p>If we hold the Head, we cannot have different interpretations of Scripture. Differences arise when someone is not holding the Head, because He cannot possibly say one thing to one member and something else to another. If differences arise, we must not try to straighten them out by discussion; rather, we should just recognize Christ as the Head. In the church we all must hold the Head, whether it involves the understanding of the truth, the handling of business, or any other matter. Christ is the unique authority in the Body. The place of all the members is to hold the Head and to acknowledge Him as the unique and supreme authority in all things. If we let the cross deal with our natural life, we will find no difficulty in our relationship with the fellow members of the Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWO</h1><h1 class="title">THE ANOINTING OF THE BODY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 John 2:27; Luke 3:22; 4:18; Eph. 4:1-10, 30-32; Psa. 133</h1><p>The Bible shows us that God's anointing is only for the One who has totally satisfied God's heart&mdash;His Son, Christ. If this is so, why does the Body receive the anointing? Psalm 133 shows us that the fine oil was poured on Aaron's head and ran down upon his beard to the hem of his garments. When a man is anointed, the oil is poured on the head of the anointed, not on the whole body. Yet after the oil is poured, it runs downward and eventually flows to the whole body. Because the Head is Christ, the Anointed One, the Body is also Christ. Christ is God's Anointed. The church is His Body. When Christ was anointed, the whole Body was anointed with Him. Christ is the great Anointed One, while the members are the little anointed ones. Yet we are not anointed separately; we were anointed in His Body, that is, in Christ, when He was anointed. It is impossible for us to be anointed in ourselves, because the Bible says, "Upon man's flesh shall it not be poured" (Exo. 30:32). We are anointed in Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CONDITION FOR THE ANOINTING BEING<br />THE BURIAL OF THE NATURAL MAN</h2><p>Luke 3:22 tells us what happened after the Lord was baptized in the river Jordan. "The Holy Spirit descended in bodily form as a dove upon Him. And a voice came out of heaven: You are My Son, the Beloved; in You I have found My delight." Luke 4:18 says, "The Spirit of the Lord is upon Me, because He has anointed Me to announce the gospel to the poor." From these verses we see that the Lord was anointed with the Holy Spirit when He came out of the water of baptism at the Jordan River. Genesis 8 records that after the flood, Noah opened the window of the ark and sent out a dove. However, the dove could not find any place to rest because the whole earth was filled with water, and it returned back to the ark. (The passage of Noah's ark through the deluge is a type of baptism.) At the time of Christ's baptism, the Spirit of God descended upon Him like a dove. This signifies that at the time of Christ's baptism, He received the anointing of the Holy Spirit. In the same way, when we were baptized, we also received the anointing of the Spirit.</p><p>Baptism signifies that everything of the old, natural man is buried. For the anointing to come after baptism means that in order for us to receive the anointing of the Holy Spirit, our flesh must first be buried. Only that which is of the Lord can rise up after baptism because anything that belongs to the believers themselves is only qualified for burial. Anything that can rise up after burial has to be something in resurrection. It can rise up because Christ is in it. When we are baptized in Christ, we pass through death, burial, and resurrection with Him. Hence, when He was anointed, we were anointed also. We are crucified, buried, resurrected, and anointed together with Him.</p><h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTION OF THE ANOINTING</h2><p>The anointing is so precious because grace flows from the Head to the Body by means of the anointing. The function of the anointing is to maintain the link between the Head and the Body, as well as the link between all the members. The anointing is the operation of the Holy Spirit within man. The relationship between the Holy Spirit, Christ, and the church can be compared to the nerves in the human body. The nerves direct and coordinate all the members of the body. The head communicates and directs all the members through the nerves, and through the nerves all the members are related one to another as well. All the members in the body move according to the direction of the nerves. Submitting to the nerves is submitting to the head. Likewise, in the spiritual Body the Holy Spirit carries the thoughts of the Head to all the members. As members of the Body of Christ, we have to yield to the authority of the Holy Spirit. When we yield to the authority of the Holy Spirit, we are yielding to the Head. When we grieve the Spirit, we frustrate our relationship with the Head. We hold the Head by simply yielding to the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TEACHING OF THE ANOINTING</h2><p>In the Bible the Holy Spirit is symbolized by many things, such as the wind, the living water, and the fire. At the same time, the Holy Spirit is also life, power, etc. However, 1 John 2:27 is particularly sweet in its description of the Holy Spirit as the anointing. This is the teaching of the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit teaches by the anointing. We do not know the will of God by studying and weighing the pros and cons of a particular matter. We know the will of God by the teaching of the anointing. The Holy Spirit communicates the mind of Christ to us. It is not necessary to continually ask, "Is this the will of God?" "We have the mind of Christ" (1 Cor. 2:16). When the Head wishes a member of the Body to move, He intimates it through the anointing, and as we yield to the anointing, life flows freely from the Head. If we resist the anointing, the relationship with the Head is interfered with and the flow of life stops. Many believers miss the leading of the Lord because they are not under the Head. The anointing does not come directly upon the Body but upon the Head. Believers can receive the anointing which flows from the Head to the Body only when they are directly under the Head.</p><p>The anointing is something very fine and soothing. The teaching of the Holy Spirit is not something rough or wild. It does not blow on us like the wind or burn us like fire. Rather, it anoints us like oil. This is how the Holy Spirit teaches us. Wherever there is the oil, there is the work of God. His work does not depend on words, biblical interpretations, reasons, judgments concerning right and wrong, etc. God's work and leading within us come by way of a kind of inner sense of life. This sense of life is the anointing of the Spirit. The Head does not use external means to control the Body. "The life was the light of men" (John 1:4). In seeking to know the will of God, we cannot arrive at it by asking, "Is this right or wrong?" Rather, we should ask, "Do I have life regarding this?" If we feel dead inside, then there is no anointing, and if we act without the anointing, we are acting without the authority of the Head. For example, sometimes we may want to visit someone, but we feel cold and indifferent within. As far as doctrines, human affections, or biblical principles are concerned, we should visit him. But the more we resolve to go, the colder we become. This means that the Spirit is telling us not to go. At another time, we may visit someone and feel as if we are under some kind of sweet anointing; everything is soothing and comfortable. This is the teaching that comes from the Spirit's anointing. The more we go along with this anointing, the stronger we will be, and the more there will be an "amen" within.</p><p>The teaching of the anointing of the Spirit has nothing to do with right or wrong, what should or should not be done, or what is true or false. It is an inner feeling of life. Many people still work according to the principle of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the tree from which Adam ate. This is to walk according to the principle of right and wrong; however, God's work in Christ is a matter of life. It is a matter of the anointing of the Spirit. Where the anointing is, there is life. As long as one has the anointing and the life, everything is right and according to God's desire. Those who are clever and acquainted with Bible doctrines are not necessarily more familiar with God's work. Sometimes a brother or sister from the rural countryside may know more about God's work. They do not have knowledge, but they have life. If this were not God's way, He would be very unfair. Illiterate country folk would be doomed because they would not have the mental knowledge and would be unable to know God's will. But our God is not a respecter of persons. Whether or not we have the mental knowledge and whether we are clever or slow, the teaching of the anointing still abides in us. As long as we walk according to the inner anointing of the Spirit, we will know God's will and be acquainted with God's work.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ANOINTING AND THE LAW</h2><p>In the Old Testament men had God's word&mdash;the law. In the New Testament, men also have God's word. But if this word does not have the Spirit's anointing behind it, it is also a law. The Lord Jesus presented God's word, but that word was spirit and life. The apostles also presented God's word, and that word was also spirit and life. But when the Pharisees presented God's word, there was no anointing of the Spirit, and that word became dead laws. Many people practice baptism, the laying on of hands, and head covering merely according to the instructions of the Bible. These things are the law to them. If a man acts merely according to the letter of the Bible, he is a disciple of Moses and not a Christian. A Christian has the Lord's anointing on him. In the Body of Christ, there is no law; there is only the Lord's anointing. Hence, in order for us to live in the Body of Christ, we have to walk according to the Spirit's anointing, not according to the letter of the law. We must do everything according to the anointing of the Spirit. This is walking according to the teaching of the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WAY TO BE ANOINTED</h2><p>How do we receive the anointing? Psalm 133 is the key passage in the Old Testament concerning the anointing. We should realize that Psalms 120 through 134 are songs of ascent. These are the songs the Israelites sang three times a year when they ascended from different places to meet the Lord in Zion in Jerusalem, the dwelling place of God. Although all the songs are different, they have one thing in common&mdash;they are all ascending songs. The people did not talk about economics, education, warfare, or politics. Their hearts were toward Zion, toward God, and they were going upward. Psalm 133:1 says, "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is/For brothers to dwell in unity!" This dwelling in unity is corporate; there is no barrier or separation. They have cast aside their disunity, jealousy, and hatred. This is like the fine oil that was poured on Aaron's head that ran down upon the beard to the hem of his garments. In this condition, they receive God's anointing. When the oil flows down, those who are under the head will spontaneously receive the oil. Psalm 133 is equivalent to Ephesians 4. When we are in the Body and are diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit, we have the anointing of the Spirit. We have to come under the Head, and we have to live in the Body before we can receive the anointing. Many people do not receive any leading because they are not standing in the right place. They are not under the Head and have not submitted themselves to the authority of the Head. Neither are they in the Body. In order for us to receive the anointing, we must submit to the Head and live in the Body.</p><p>The believers' fellowship is based on Christ. We can fellowship with one another because Christ is the life of the Body and the Head of the Body. At the same time, the enjoyment of this fellowship is the Holy Spirit. The more we live in the fellowship of the Body, the more we enjoy the anointing of the Spirit. But there is a condition to this: We have to allow the cross to deal with our flesh and our natural life in a thorough way. Whether or not a believer can enjoy this fellowship depends on whether he has dealt with his natural life. Our natural flesh only deserves to die; it only deserves to be in ashes, to be on the cross. We cannot think by ourselves; we are not qualified to propose anything by ourselves. We must allow Christ to have the absolute sovereignty over everything. We must allow Him to be the Lord in an absolute way. If our natural life is dealt with by the cross and if we submit to the headship of Christ and live the Body life, we will have the Spirit's anointing and enjoy the fellowship of the Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THREE</h1><h1 class="title">THE ORDER OF THE BODY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:3-8; Eph. 4:9-16; Col. 2:19; 1 Cor. 11:29</h1><h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF THE MEMBERS</h2><p>First Corinthians 12:18 says, "But now God has placed the members, each one of them, in the body, even as He willed." This shows that every member has a definite place, definite assignment, and definite position. Every member has a particular portion with which he serves the Body of Christ. The eyes see, the ears hear, and the nose smells. Each organ has its function, and each has its portion. The eyes serve the body by seeing. The ears serve the body by hearing. The nose serves the body by smelling. Each has its own responsibility, and none can replace another. Member A cannot be member B, and member B cannot be member C. Each member has his own characteristics, and each has his own capability. These characteristics and capabilities constitute the place, position, or ministry of each member.</p><p>The characteristics of a member are the ministry of that member, which is the supply it renders to the Body. The ministry of a member dictates his place and position in the Body. The portion of each member in the Body is not for himself, but for the whole Body. Our service in the Body of Christ is based on what we have received particularly from the Lord. The particular knowledge and experience we have acquired from the Lord become our supply to the Body. Yet many Christians have acquired only reeds&mdash;amounting to nothing but knowledge that they have heard and doctrines that they have studied. These are reed weapons; they are not the sword of the Spirit, and they will prove to be useless in time of need. One theologian despised his wife for not knowing the Bible, but when his son became ill, he could not remain calm. His wife, who had a much deeper knowledge of God, was more trusting, peaceful, and firm in her faith. Doctrines that are gained from study do not avail much. Only the life that comes from the Lord counts, and only that supplies the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">FUNCTIONING IN ORDER</h2><p>We supply the Body with the life that we have received from Christ the Head. Yet when we function, we have to be proper and in order. Order in the Body is essential to growth and ministry. In the physical body, any dislocation or disproportionate growth of the members hinders its functioning. This is also true in the Body of Christ. In the meeting no one will stop you from speaking. But you have to speak according to your measure of faith and according to the leading of the Spirit. You have to know whether there is any overstepping in your speaking, and you have to know whether your speaking is too long. Many believers crave to be outstanding Christians and outstanding workers, but if some become overdeveloped, others will be underdeveloped. The result would not be the Body but a monstrosity; God's order in the church would be destroyed. When we truly come under the authority of the Head, He sets us in our special place in the Body and appoints us to our special function.</p><p>In the denominational organizations, leaders are selected according to background, social status, education, knowledge, intelligence, eloquence, or talent. But they may not have any revelation, faith, or experience in the Lord. They can only bring natural things to the church. They will not supply the Body; on the contrary, they will bring death to the Body. The ministry of the Body is not determined by natural things. A member functions in the Body according to what he has received from the Lord. It is according to the "measure of faith" (Rom. 12:3, 6). At the same time, it is according to God's assigned order. Therefore, we have to seek revelation and experience from Christ so that we can have something to supply the Body, and we have to know the order of the Body, which is God's assigned pattern in the Body. We must be willing to be limited to our measure. As soon as we go beyond it, we go beyond the authority of the Head and move out from under the anointing. When we go beyond our measure, we interfere with the order of the Body. The Body of Christ is an organic life; it operates without any human arrangement. All the members must receive life from the Head and function in proper order. If our relationship with the Head is proper, we will keep our place in the Body spontaneously.</p><h2 class="head1">APOSTLES, PROPHETS, EVANGELISTS,<br />SHEPHERDS AND TEACHERS</h2><p>Ephesians 4:11 speaks of a group of people who are for the Body; they are God's gifts to the church, supplying Christ for the building up of the Body. We have to pay special attention to this group of members.</p><p>The apostles are the first gift that God has appointed in the Body of Christ. They are sent by God to represent the authority of the Head and to execute God's will on earth. Hence, in a church that is a proper testimony of the Body, all the believers should submit to the representative authority. In the Old Testament, Moses did not argue when Korah and his company repudiated Moses' authority as God's prophet. Instead, he referred the matter to God, who made it clear that touching the anointed of the Lord was the same as touching the Lord Himself, and that repudiating the authority of His prophet was the same as repudiating His authority. The result of such a touching and repudiation is death upon the offenders. God requires us to come directly under not only the authority of the Lord but also the authority of those who represent His authority in the Body. When the head orders the arm to move, the little finger must move with the arm. The arm illustrates representative authority. We must keep our position in the Body under the headship of Christ and under the authority of those in the Body to whom He has sovereignly given His authority. It is much easier to bow to the direct authority of God than to the authority of His representatives in the Body. Bowing to the authority of His representative takes meekness and humility. We cannot disregard God's order with impunity, as we see in Paul's letter to Corinth (1 Cor. 11:29-30). There is no room for individual thought or action in the Body of Christ. The Body moves under the control of the Head. Disobeying the law of the Body means weakness and death.</p><p>The prophets not only predict future events but also speak forth God's mind. They are those who are sent by God to His people to convey His mind. The greatest prophet in the Old Testament was Elijah, not Isaiah, because most of Isaiah's words were prophecies, whereas Elijah primarily conveyed God's mind. When a prophet receives a revelation from the Lord, he conveys God's mind to His people. A prophet is one who knows and declares God's mind, whereas a person who predicts merely foretells future events. In the Body there is a special group of ministers who know God's mind and who make it known to the Body. These ones are also the representative authority of the Head.</p><p>Evangelists make known the compassions of God in Christ, while shepherds and teachers make known God's riches in Christ and render others the supply through these riches. Each of these ministers is a "joint of the rich supply" (Eph. 4:16). They receive life from God and communicate it to the whole Body. Many Christians say, "I am in direct communication with the Source of supply; I can get everything for myself from the Head." Such an attitude is a repudiation of the authority of the Lord, who in His sovereignty has ordained that the members would be dependent not only on Him but also on one another.</p><p>How do these "joints of the rich supply" serve the Body? They must be those who have gone through special training under the Lord's hand and have been specially molded through the environment ordered by the Spirit; they have a history of knowing Christ. They are tried and tested and instructed by Christ, and they are qualified to transmit spiritual values. They have a secret history in tribulation, and the cross has wrought the things that they minister to the Body into them.</p><h2 class="head1">ELDERS</h2><p>In addition, in the local assembly there are members who have the right to exercise authority. They are not merely given authority; they have authority. These are those who hold the office of elders. They occupy this position, not because they have been made elders, but because they are elders. Elders are manifested in a spontaneous way by the Holy Spirit; the only thing that man can do is  identify and confirm. In a spiritual church the most spiritual members hold the office of elders; in a carnal church the office is held by those who have the best natural qualifications. When a man marries and has a son, he becomes a father. No one can be appointed to hold the office of a father. A man either is a father or is not a father; he cannot be made a father. Likewise, no one can be made an elder. He either is an elder or is not an elder. Elders are not elected through campaigns and elections; they are manifested in a spontaneous way through maturity in life. They should be those who are purer in heart and who are seeking for and growing in spiritual things. Their duty is to help others obey the Head. If a person is an elder, all that the church has to do is recognize what he is and allow him to function accordingly.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MAN BEING THE HEAD OF THE WOMAN</h2><p>In God's arrangement, the man is the head of the woman. Therefore, sisters have no administrative power in the church. This does not mean, however, that any man can be the head of a woman; only those who are under Christ can be the head of the sisters. The covering of the sisters' heads indicates that they maintain the order in the Body, that they submit to Christ as well as to the authority of the Body.</p><p>Strictly speaking, there is no authority in the Body; all authority lies in the Head. The weakness of the so-called church today is that authority has become a matter of position, not of life. In the Body of Christ authority is a matter of life, not of position. If a member has authority, it is because that authority has been wrought into him already. He has passed through God's dealing, and authority has become life in him. God does not set up certain individuals to act as eyes, ears, mouth, hands, etc. He makes them these things by the operation of the cross. When they are these organs, they naturally function in that capacity. The whole issue rests on life. As long as we obey the life of the Body, which flows as the Body maintains its position under the absolute authority of the Head, there will be continuous and perfectly proportioned growth. Unless we are truly in the life of the Body, there cannot be increase in the measure of Christ.</p><p>Apostles and elders have no authority in themselves; they only have authority as they stand under the authority of the Lord. They exercise authority in the Body by representing the authority of the Head. If the apostles and elders have the mind of God, then they have the authority of God, for He only upholds that for which He Himself stands. Whatever He authorizes, He supports by His authority.</p><p>The life of the Body necessitates drastic dealings with the natural life. We must be broken before we will submit to the representative authority in the Body and be willing to minister and be ministered unto in our sovereignly ordained place. God cannot allow lawlessness to come into His church, because this makes the development of the Body impossible. He cannot allow any human head to raise itself, because this also hinders the development of the Body and denies the headship of Christ. Any desire on the part of a believer to exercise authority is contrary to the life of the Body. Christ alone is the Head, and we are all members one of another. If anyone claims to have a revelation of the Body yet is not in subjection to the authority of the Body or properly related to the other members, the claim is false. As soon as we truly see the Body, we will also see the need of obedience and mutual relatedness. Submission is one outstanding characteristic of those who are familiar with the life of the Body.</p><p>God has made definite arrangements and instituted order in the Body of Christ. We must be careful to discern the Body, as 1 Corinthians 11:29 charges us to do. We cannot be careless in the Body and make proposals lightly or overstep presumptuously. Every member must be in proper order and walk in an orderly way. Authority is ordained by the Lord; no one can be an authority in himself, and no one can elect others to be an authority. Authority comes from the Lord's arrangement and is for the Body life. We should be clear about our position in the Body and maintain our position. In the Body life, we all must walk according to the order in the Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE PRINCIPLE OF THE BODY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Acts 6:6; 8:4-5, 12, 14-17; 9:3-6, 10-12, 17; 19:6; James 5:14-16; Matt. 18:15-16, 19-20; 1 Tim. 4:14; 5:22; 2 Tim. 1:6</h1><h2 class="head1">THE APOSTLES' LAYING ON OF HANDS</h2><p>There is an example in Acts 8 that shows us the principle of the Body. At that time the church in Jerusalem suffered great persecution, and except for the apostles, all the disciples were dispersed. Philip was not an apostle; he only took care of the distribution of food. But because he had life, he went down to Samaria and preached the gospel. Many believed and were baptized, and there was "much joy in that city" (v. 8). But there was a difference between these saved ones and the believers in Jerusalem. These saved ones did not have the Spirit upon them yet. Therefore, the apostles sent Peter and John as representatives to fill up the lack. They laid hands on the new converts, and the new converts received the Holy Spirit.</p><p>What is the significance of the laying on of hands? According to Leviticus, when a man offered a sacrifice, the offerer had to lay his hands on the offering. This means that the laying on of hands is a sign of identification. Many places in the New Testament speak of the laying on of hands. First Timothy 5:22 says, "Lay hands quickly on no man," lest, as Paul explained, we should "participate in others' sins." This shows once again that the laying on of hands signifies an identification. We have to be careful lest we "participate in others' sins." In the Old Testament, when kings or priests were appointed, there was the laying on of hands as well as the anointing upon the head. Hence, there are two main meanings of the laying on of hands: It puts the believers under the anointing of the Head, and it brings the believers into the fellowship of the Body.</p><p>The apostles are the representatives of God. They are also representative members in the Body of Christ. When Peter and John laid their hands on the believers in Samaria, their act brought those upon whom they laid hands under the authority of the Head and into the fellowship of the Body. This means that they were acknowledged as part of the Body. Once they were brought into the one Body and came under the one anointing, the Holy Spirit immediately fell upon them. If the saved ones in Samaria had received the Holy Spirit before the apostles arrived, Philip would have been able to boast that Peter and John had their work in Jerusalem while he had his work in Samaria. If this had been the case, the saved ones in Samaria would have become separate from the saved ones in Jerusalem. If some had claimed Peter for Jerusalem and others had claimed Philip for Samaria, the principle of the Body would have been broken. The events in Samaria show us that unless one submits to the Body, he cannot receive the anointing. We cannot have the anointing if we do not recognize the Body. The Holy Spirit is not given to individuals but to members of the Body. The apostles' laying on of hands brought the believers into the fellowship of the Body. Hence, the laying on of hands acknowledges that there is union, fellowship, and one Body. The Body is one; therefore, the members need to recognize their dependence not only on the Head but also on one another.</p><p>Hebrews 6:1-2 speaks of six items as "the word of the beginning." The laying on of hands is one of the six foundational matters of the Christian life. These six items can be divided into three groups. The first group includes repentance from dead works and faith in God. This is an inward attitude or action taken by one toward himself or toward God. The third group includes the resurrection of the dead and eternal judgment. These are teachings that have to do with things in the future. The second group includes baptism and the laying on of hands. These two items are outward testimonies. Baptism and the laying on of hands are two testimonies of the church that are essential for those who are to "be brought on to maturity." We have not neglected five of these items, but we have neglected one of them&mdash;the laying on of hands. Although the Bible does not clearly say that we must practice the laying on of hands, it does show us that at the time of the apostles, a man received the laying on of hands as soon as he was saved and baptized. By baptism we enter into Christ. By the laying on of hands we enter into the Body. Believers are put not only into Christ, but also into the Body of Christ. This is our proper position. We know that every believer should break bread on the Lord's Day. The breaking of bread refreshes our memory of the significance of baptism and the laying on of hands. By baptism we bear witness to the fact that we have put off ourselves and the world and entered into Christ. By the laying on of hands we bear witness to the fact that we have left the ground of being an individual and taken a stand on the ground of the Body. Henceforth, even if circumstances take us to a place of geographical isolation, we will not be alone, because the whole Body will be with us. If we suffer, all of the members will suffer with us, and we can count on them coming to our aid continually.</p><p>At the time of the laying on of hands, if the Holy Spirit gives prophetic prayer for the one who is being brought under the anointing, then the specific features set forth in prophecy will characterize the future life and ministry of that one. We have an illustration of this in the case of Timothy. When Paul and the elders laid hands on him, prophetic utterance was given, and Paul later exhorted Timothy to not neglect the gift imparted to him, but to fan it into flame (1 Tim. 1:18; 4:14; 2 Tim. 1:6). If we truly have a revelation of the Body, we must have the laying on of hands. It is our testimony to the reality of the Body and our commitment to the life of the Body. By this we declare that everything is for the Body and nothing is for the individual. If the Lord cares to use us, praise Him; if He chooses to use another, praise Him still. There is no room for jealousy in the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ANOINTING AND PRAYER OF THE ELDERS</h2><p>In James 5:14-16 we see the laying on of hands in relation to sickness. In the case of sickness we are instructed by James to call for the elders of the church. The elders, rather than the members of the church who have the gift of healing, need to be called because the sick persons in this case need to be brought under the anointing; their case must be dealt with by the representatives of the church. The sins referred to in verse 15 are particular sins; they are sins against the Body. How do we know that the sickness here is a special kind of sickness and not ordinary sickness? If we know the remedy that a doctor prescribes, then we can deduce the type of illness that a patient has. Since the patient is brought under the anointing, we can safely infer that the patient's sickness was due to a departure from the anointing. The Word of God plainly declares that many are weak and sick, and many have even died, because of the failure to discern the Lord's Body (1 Cor. 11:29-30). James 5 presents such a case. If we are living in the realm of the Body, then we are always under the anointing of the Head. However, as soon as we take an individual line, we depart from the anointing and expose ourselves to sickness and death. The sin of the man in James 5 must have been the sin of detaching himself from the Body. If his sin was only a personal sin, he could have been forgiven by trusting in the blood and by confessing to others. There would have been no need to ask the elders to anoint him with oil. The elders' oil cannot remove sin; only the blood can remove sin. Verse 15 says that he will be forgiven if he has sinned; however, the forgiveness is due to the elders' prayer. Therefore, this sin is not an ordinary sin; it is the sin of acting contrary to the Body. As a consequence, there is the need to ask the elders of the church to pray for him and to anoint him with oil in the name of the Lord so that he can be brought back under the Head and into the Body.</p><p>Verse 16 says, "Therefore confess your sins to one another and pray for one another that you may be healed." This verse tells us to confess our sins to one another. We have to confess to one another because something is wrong in the Body of Christ. The sphere of confession corresponds with the sphere of transgression. If I have only sinned against God, I must make my confession to Him alone. The sin in these verses is a sin against the Body. Since something has gone wrong in the Body of Christ, both the sick one and the elders have to take responsibility for it. The sick one has offended the Body, and the elders represent the Body. Therefore, the sick one has to confess, and the elders also have to confess. Note that confession is mutual. The sick one confesses, but the elders also confess. The sick one acknowledges that the sickness is a result of taking an individual position, and the elders acknowledge that they have failed in the matter of love and watchfulness; otherwise, the sick one would not have departed from the ground of the Body.</p><p>After the mutual confession, there is prayer. "Pray for one another." This means that the elders pray for the sick, and the sick pray for the elders. The result is that the sin is forgiven, and the sickness is healed. Mutuality is the characteristic of the Body. Do you see how the Body is highlighted in anointing, confession, and prayer? In the Body every member should have love and humility. Being outside the Body brings in not only physical sickness but also spiritual sickness. Those who are outside of the Body should see the importance of turning back to the anointing and turning back to the Body. It is through these turns that they will receive the help of the other members.</p><h2 class="head1">THE REVELATION PAUL RECEIVED<br />AT THE TIME OF HIS CONVERSION</h2><p>In the case of Paul's conversion we have a further illustration of the laying on of hands. Acts 9 shows us two characteristics of the revelation that Paul received at the time of his conversion. When the Lord appeared to Paul on the way to Damascus, He showed him that persecuting the believers was the same as persecuting Him (vv. 3-5). The Lord asked, "Why are you persecuting Me?" He did not ask, "Why are you persecuting those who believe in Me?" Paul asked, "Who are You, Lord?" The Lord said, "I am Jesus, whom you persecute." The Lord showed Paul that he was persecuting the Head when he was persecuting the members of the Body. When you damage any member of the Body, you damage the Head. Every sin that offends the Body offends the Head. Every believer of the Lord is one with the Lord. This is the oneness of the Head with the Body. Paul was the first one who saw the Body of Christ. The day that the Lord revealed Himself was the day that Paul saw the Body.</p><p>After this high revelation, the Lord charged him to go into the city, and there it would be told to him what he must do (v. 6). This was also a revelation of the Body. After such a high revelation, the Lord did not speak to him directly; rather, He committed him to the Body. On the day Paul was saved, the Lord showed him the principle of the Body. Three days later the Lord sent a small disciple by the name of Ananias to lay hands on him, and Ananias said to him, "Saul, brother, the Lord has sent me&mdash;Jesus, who appeared to you on the road on which you were coming&mdash;so that you may receive your sight and be filled with the Holy Spirit" (v. 17). Ananias was just an ordinary brother. We know nothing about his history before or after this event. When he was sent by the Lord to Saul, he said, "Saul, brother." This ushered Saul into the Body of Christ, filled him with the Holy Spirit, and brought him under the anointing.</p><h2 class="head1">THE JUDGMENT OF TWO OR THREE BROTHERS</h2><p>Matthew 18:15-16 is not about whether a person is right or wrong. It is not even about whether a person feels that he is right or wrong. It is about the testimony of two or three brothers. If they say that you are wrong, you are wrong. Therefore, when other brothers say that you are wrong, and you do not feel that you are wrong, you should take their judgment and believe in them more than in yourself. If two or three brothers stand in the name of the Lord and say something to you, you should listen to them.</p><p>In the church there are four groups of people representing the Body. They are: (1) the apostles, (2) the elders, (3) those whom the Lord has specially chosen, and (4) two or three believers who deny themselves and who have come under the Lord's name. These four groups of people represent the church. If we are wrong, the Lord will send a believer to us to speak to us about it. If we do not listen to the word of one believer, he will tell two or three other believers. If we still do not listen to their word, we should receive help from the elders. We cannot have any independent actions. For problems that cannot be solved, we should consult the apostles. They are designated by the Lord to represent the Body. We cannot overlook the Body, and we cannot overlook the representatives of the Body. May the Lord grant us the revelation of the Body so that we can submit to Christ the Head as well as to the representatives of the Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIVE</h1><h1 class="title">THE RICHES IN THE BODY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Deut. 32:30; Psa. 133; Eph. 1:23; 2:20-22; 3:10, 18-19; 4:13; 6:11; 1 Cor. 12:27; Matt. 18:15-18</h1><h2 class="head1">THE MEASURE OF CHRIST</h2><p>The riches of Christ are too profound. He is the Lord who fills all in all (Eph. 1:23). With Him are the unsearchable riches (3:8). God's intention is not for these riches to remain just in Christ but for these profound and infinite riches to become the riches of the church. His intention is that the church would become the fullness of the One who fills all in all (1:23). The church is a vessel to contain the life of Christ. All the riches of the Son of God are deposited in the church. The riches of Christ are the riches of the Body of Christ. No individual could ever contain those riches, nor could a multitude of individuals. It takes a corporate company to hold the riches of Christ. The individual pieces of a shattered tumbler may hold a few drops of water, but it takes the whole tumbler to hold a full glass of water.</p><p>The church is not a heap of stones, nor a mass of unrelated individuals, but a "building" in which the stones are "fitted together" so that they become "a dwelling place of God in spirit" (2:21-22). This temple is "built upon the foundation of the apostles and prophets" (v. 20). In a lesser sense each individual believer is a temple of God, but only the corporate temple can contain all the riches of God.</p><p>Ephesians 3:10 tells us that the showing forth of the multifarious wisdom of God to the rulers and the authorities is given to the church, not to any individual. Verses 18 and 19 say that God will cause us to be "full of strength to apprehend with all the saints what the breadth and length and height and depth are and to know the knowledge-surpassing love of Christ." The love of Christ is so rich that it takes the church to measure it. Christ is not only in each member, but He is also in the Body. No one member of the Body of Christ can contain all the riches of Christ. The riches of Christ that we receive individually are two-dimensional at the most, but the riches of Christ that the church receives are three-dimensional. Only the Body of Christ has the capacity to express the riches of Christ. We need to be in the Body so that we can apprehend the riches which Christ has in His Body. It is not one believer, but "all" the believers together who "arrive at the oneness of the faith and of the full knowledge of the Son of God, at a full-grown man, at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ" (4:13). In chapter six we are told to put on "the whole armor of God" that we may wage warfare against the hosts of darkness. However, the equipment for the fight is not given to one believer; it is given to the church. "The whole armor" can only be put on by the Body, not just by one member. Spiritual warfare is in this principle&mdash;one will chase a thousand and two will put ten thousand to flight (Deut. 32:30). The so-called church has not defeated the enemy's host, because Christians are living scattered lives instead of functioning in the Body.</p><p>Mathematically speaking, if one can chase a thousand, two should only be able to chase two thousand. But in spiritual mathematics, one chases a thousand while two chase ten thousand. The strength of two persons put together is five times that of two who are considered separately. Two is the minimum corporate number. If two persons chase the enemy separately, they will not defeat ten thousand. This is a principle: The strength of the corporate Body is very great. God cares for the corporate Body. He does not care how much strength you have or how powerful you are as an individual. As long as you are an individual and not joined to others, you can only chase a thousand. But if you are joined to others, your strength will be increased fivefold. You have to see that you are only a member. You are limited and short. You need the other members.</p><p>"For there Jehovah commanded the blessing:/Life forever" (Psa. 133:3). Where did God command the blessing? He commanded the blessing where brothers dwell in unity (v. 1). When the Body is under the anointing, life flows freely from the Head to all the members. Christ is not the Head of any mission or organization, He is only the Head of His church. The Head is only Head over the Body. Unless we are standing on the ground of the Body, we cannot claim the headship of Christ, and if we cannot claim the full authority of the Head, we cannot know the fullness of life that streams from the Head. The blessing that is commanded whenever brothers are united under the anointing is "life forever," a full, free, unceasing stream of life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LOCAL CHURCH BEING THE MANIFESTATION<br />OF THE BODY OF CHRIST ON EARTH</h2><p>When Paul wrote to a group of believers in Corinth, he said, "Now you are the body of Christ" (1 Cor. 12:27). The Body of Christ is not only universal; it is also local. Every local church is the manifestation of the Body of Christ in that locality. All of the riches of Christ are vested in the local church. The authority of the Head is vested in the local expression of the Body. Apostles and elders in the local church are representative members of the Body, but they are not the Body. The entire company of believers in a locality, not just a section of the believers, constitutes the church in that locality. The church is not one member; it represents the whole Body in a locality. Hence, when we touch the local church, we touch the Body. Participating in the fellowship of the local church is participating in the fellowship of the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is not something abstract or unfathomable; the Body of Christ is manifested in the local churches. Anyone who wants to live in the Body in a practical way has to be in the local churches. He should fellowship with the local saints, be edified in the local church, and be built up together in mutuality.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S WILL BEING EXPRESSED<br />IN THE LOCAL CHURCH</h2><p>When Christ was on earth He referred to the church two times&mdash;in Matthew 16 and Matthew 18. In the first instance, He referred to the universal church, and in the second instance, He referred to the local church. In speaking of the authority of the local church, He said, "If he refuses to hear the church also, let him be to you just like the Gentile and the tax collector" (18:17). This verse shows us that the authority of the church is derived from its representation of Christ. Christ has given His authority to the church and authorized the church to execute His will on earth. The Bible shows us that there are three ways in which a person can receive guidance from God: (1) God's Word&mdash;the Bible, (2) the indwelling Holy Spirit, and (3) the church in a locality. The third line is the most important line. The leading of the Bible and the Spirit are individual in nature, but the leading of the local church is corporate in nature. The local church, being the local expression of the Body of Christ, has the headship of Christ and, therefore, can know the mind of Christ, which is always communicated to His Body. The local church declares the headship of Christ. "Truly I say to you, Whatever you bind on the earth shall have been bound in heaven, and whatever you loose on the earth shall have been loosed in heaven" (v. 18). A person who sees the Body seeks fellowship and accepts the leading of the church. Often the decision of a church in a rural area is proven to be better than the decision of a church in the city. Such a decision does not originate from man's ability or wisdom but from the corporate seeking in one accord. In order to know God's will and His way, it is not enough for us to read the Bible or pray by ourselves. We have to be in the fellowship of the local church, live the Body life, and follow God's leading in the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LOCAL CHURCH<br />EXECUTING THE AUTHORITY OF THE BODY</h2><p>In a local church, God has established the elders as representatives of His authority. But this does not mean that they are everything. The elders should not monopolize anything; they are merely the overseers in the church. They stand on the side to guide the saints on, to stop improper activities, and to encourage proper activities so that the whole Body can be activated. Acts 12:5 says, "So then Peter was kept in the prison; but prayer was being made fervently by the church to God concerning him." Today the church should pray fervently for world events and the state of our nation. This kind of prayer involves the exercise of the authority that God has given the Body.</p><p>Much revelation has been lost to the church because believers have sought light individually instead of seeking light in the sanctuary. When a man does not see the Body, he loses many blessings. This is a great loss to the church. May the Lord show us what the Body is so that we can live in the Body and receive the riches of the Body. When we are in the Body, we know God's will, have the authority of the Body, and experience the power of the Body.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIX</h1><h1 class="title">THE MINISTRY IN THE BODY</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 12:4-31</h1><h2 class="head1">SEEING THE REVELATION<br />OF THE BODY</h2><p>A Christian must see not only that he is a believer but also that he is a member of the Body. Since he is a member, he needs other members. It is impossible for one member to live without other members. In order for a member to survive, he needs to have other members. Many people leave the denominations because they realize that denominationalism is wrong. But this is not enough; they must go on to see the Body and get into the Body. The church is not a denominational organization; the church is the living Body of Christ. A Christian is not a member of a denomination but a member of the Body of Christ. We have to see that we are members in the Body and that we cannot be separated from other members. We cannot be independent, and we cannot go on without the other members.</p><h2 class="head1">THE MINISTRY OF THE MEMBERS</h2><p>The Body of Christ is built up by the mutual supply of the members. In addition to seeing that we are members, we have to see that every member has a ministry. Every member in the Body has a special function, and that function is its ministry. The verb form of the word ministry means "to serve." The ministry of a member is the special portion that a member receives from Christ. With this special portion he supplies the Body, and this is the service of the members. The Body is Christ, so our ministry is simply Christ. Everyone who belongs to the Lord has a special portion which he has received from Christ, and each portion has its characteristic feature. This feature becomes the special characteristic of his service. Ministerial service to others is based on the Christ one has within him. One does not serve others with the doctrine that he understands; he can only supply the Body with what he has received of Christ. The measure of our ministry is determined by the measure of Christ in us. Our ministry is based on these two factors: the Christ we have gained and the aspects of Christ that we have gained which are different from what other members have gained. If we only knew Christ in the same general way, what would there be for us to minister to one another? What would we have that would enable us to build up the Body? That is the most basic consideration in all ministries.</p><p>A Christian needs a ministry that is particularly his, not just a general ministry. We must gain something of Christ that others have not gained. It is this particular gain that enables us to make up that which is lacking in other members. Ministry involves a special knowledge of Christ; it is not a general knowledge of Him. Every organ in the body has its special function. The eyes see, the ears hear, and the nose smells. Every organ has its special function. In other words, every organ has its special portion. Other organs may temporarily do what another member does, but they are not dedicated to that particular function. For example, you can sometimes use your mouth to pick up things, but you cannot dedicate the mouth to this use. If the ears do not function according to their particular capacity, the body will not hear anything, and the growth of the body will be frustrated. If you have acquired something special and have some special knowledge of the Lord, you can supply the Body with it. If you have a special knowledge of the Lord, this special knowledge will constitute your specific ministry. Only specific ministries can serve the Body and cause the Body to grow. This is why every member has to continually seek and gain from the Lord what the Body does not have and convey it to the Body. When every member fulfills its ministry, there will be growth in the Body of Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">SEEKING TO KNOW AND EXPERIENCE THE LORD</h2><p>First Corinthians 12 tells us that all the members should seek the gifts and ministries. God's intention is to have special members fulfill special ministries, using them as channels for the Lord's life to flow into the Body and to increase the measure of the Body through them. When the life we receive from the Lord flows into the Body, the measure of the stature of the Body increases. God increases the measure of the stature of the Body through the members. Madame Guyon, Mrs. Penn-Lewis, Brother T. Austin-Sparks, and others are members who have a special knowledge of Christ. Through these ones God has dispensed many riches of life into the Body. Every member should learn and know something specific before the Lord so that each one can have a specific ministry. Without a ministry, it is useless to talk about gifts. Many people stress gifts, as though gifts constitute our ministry. But our ministry is Christ; our gifts are only the means by which we minister. Two persons may use the same kind of spoon to feed a child, but whether or not the child is well-nourished will be determined by the substance in the spoon, not by the kind of spoon. We do not impart our gifts to the church; we impart Christ. Our gifts are merely the means by which we impart Him. What we minister to the Body is Christ, and what the Body receives is Christ, because Christ is all and in all in the Body.</p><p>Specific ministry comes when we receive special experiences, particular dealings, and particular discipline from the Holy Spirit. Such experiences, dealings, and discipline result in specific knowledge of Christ. With this knowledge we serve the church through the exercise of the gifts. We need to receive power from the Holy Spirit and serve the Christ we know to the church through the operation of this power. The whole matter of our ministry is a matter of life. We do not despise gifts, but it is ministry that directs the gifts, not gifts that direct the ministry. If we have a gift without first having a ministry, we will be led away by the gift and not be able to render help to the Body. What the Body lacks today is ministry, not gift. We must first discover the specific ministry that the Lord has appointed to us. Only then should we seek for the gifts to equip us to fulfill that ministry.</p><h2 class="head1">FIRST LIFE, THEN DOCTRINES</h2><p>Our service in the Body of Christ is based on our knowledge of Christ. This knowledge comes from our experience of life, not from doctrines. God first gives us life and then doctrines. Life comes first, and doctrines follow. The Bible shows us that Abraham had a special contribution for the Body along the line of faith. This did not come by a teaching he received concerning faith, and it was not brought about by him communicating a doctrine to others. Instead, it came about by Abraham being brought into a set of circumstances in which he learned to trust God. What was wrought into him through the fires of affliction was eventually ministered by him to the whole Body for its enrichment. First there was the life and lesson of faith and then the doctrine of faith. How did Martin Luther become competent to teach the church concerning the truth that "the righteous one shall live by his faith" (Hab. 2:4)? He did not become competent by diligently studying the Bible as a textbook and then communicating the knowledge he had acquired; rather, he became competent through much suffering and affliction. When his knees were worn from kneeling and his hope for justification was gone, the Lord revealed to him in a living way that a man is justified by faith. After he had this experience, he gained the doctrine of justification by faith. Doctrine is necessary, but doctrine should follow experience, not precede it. First there should be life, and then doctrine should follow. First there should be the experience, and then there should be the teaching. The order of the New Testament is first the Gospels (facts) and then the Epistles (doctrines). First, we have the life of Christ, and then we have the teachings of Christ. We should not spend all of our time studying, analyzing, and investigating a doctrine; these are works of reeds and will fail when the test comes. The only thing that is useful is what God has wrought in us, and only this can render supply to others. The only way we can communicate to others in a living way is to communicate that which we have learned through experience. Discipline, suffering, and trials are the means for God to constitute the word into us so that we may have something to give to the Body. If we want to be ministers for the building up of the Body of Christ, we must not shrink from any trial, discipline, or dealing.</p><h2 class="head1">FIRST CORINTHIANS 12</h2><p>First Corinthians 12:4-30 is divided into four sections:</p><p>(1) Subject&mdash;vv. 4-6: Gift, ministry, and function.</p><p>(2) The gifts of the Holy Spirit&mdash;vv. 7-11: The main emphasis being on the Holy Spirit.</p><p>(3) The ministry of the Lord&mdash;vv. 12-27: The main emphasis being on Christ.</p><p>(4) The work of God&mdash;vv. 28-30: The main emphasis being on God.</p><p>The beginning of every section points out the main divisions, while the theme can be seen in the subject of that section. Gift is related to the Holy Spirit, whereas ministry is related to Christ. The bringing forth of the ministry is through the gift of the Holy Spirit. The gifts are the vessels to perfect the ministries for the building up of the Body of Christ. The goal of the gifts is to bring in the ministries, and through the ministries, the Christ that the church has learned, known, and gained is dispensed to others. Most of the revival movements today have gifts but no ministry. It is useless to exercise gifts all day long. We have to realize that gifts are secondary; the main thing is the ministry. Once we have a ministry, we can serve the Body and cause the growth of the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">MUTUAL INFLUENCE OF THE MEMBERS</h2><p>All the members of the Body of Christ mutually affect one another. If one member suffers, all the other members spontaneously suffer. Sometimes we feel strong because strength from other members has been transmitted to us. Every member can affect the other members. This is why we should not live by ourselves but hold the Head and seek fellowship. God conveys life to the Body through every member. If life stops in you, you will not be able to supply others with life, and the church will suffer. Every individual failure causes damage to the church. As a consequence, when one member suffers in the Body of Christ, all the members suffer with him. Every member affects other members one way or another. Hence, we have to be in the fellowship of the Body in everything we do. If we have some good experiences, it is for rendering a supply to the Body. If we are in some adverse condition, we must realize that this also affects other members of the Body.</p><h2 class="head1">IN THE BODY, THROUGH THE BODY,<br />AND FOR THE BODY</h2><p>Everything we have is in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body. In 1925 Brother T. Austin-Sparks was invited to America. He met a sister there who had learned many lessons through her illnesses and who had subsequently rendered much help to many people. She had a ministry of life and was a person who supplied others with life. The lessons she learned were learned in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body. This is the kind of person God is looking for today. Our living should be in the Body, through the Body, and for the Body; this should be our standard. May the Lord deliver us from individualism into the Body. May the Lord show us the Body, and may we serve His Body with a ministry which is based on our knowledge of Christ.</p><h1 class="series">SECTION THIRTEEN<br />SHANGHAI MESSAGES<br />OF 1939</h1><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">A MINISTRY THAT SUPPLIES LIFE</h1><p>The Gospel of John is a book that is particularly devoted to life. Chapter three speaks of regeneration through water. This water is for burying the old man. In chapter four the Lord says, "But the water that I will give him will become in him a spring of water gushing up into eternal life" (v. 14). This water is the gushing forth of God's life within man. When we received the Lord, His life entered into us. This is like putting a fountain within us. When we received the Lord's life, we were joined to the fountain of life. In chapter seven the living water is not only in us, but it also has become rivers of living water. It flows out of us into others and supplies others with life and satisfies their thirst. God is not satisfied with us only having His life; He wants His life to flow out of us.</p><p>Miss Barber was such a person. As soon as others touched her, they touched life. If you sat down and fellowshipped with her for a minute or two, you would feel life flowing out of her. If a person with life sits beside you, his very presence will bring life to you. Today God is seeking people into whom He can dispense Christ's life more and more so that they can supply others with His life. Life needs channels, and God wants men to be the channels through which His life can flow to others. May the Lord gain us so that we can have a life-supplying ministry and supply others with life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHT</h1><h1 class="title">THE POWER OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h1><h2 class="head1">NOT WILL POWER BUT LIFE POWER</h2><p>A Christian does not live by the power of his will but by the power of life. Many Christians have never seen this, nor have they learned this lesson. They often say, "I will make up my mind. I have to make resolutions. I will promise and make vows. I will do this today and I will do that tomorrow." The power of their living is derived from their will. Even many co-workers work through the exercise of their will. Their work is controlled by their human will. However, Romans 7:19 says, "For I do not do the good which I will; but the evil which I do not will, this I practice." The man in this verse could only say that he willed; he could not do what he willed. Matthew 26:41 says, "The spirit is willing, but the flesh is weak." This verse proves that the spirit is willing but that the will is weak. A man may say that he wants God's will, that he will do God's will, and that he will perform all kinds of goodness. No matter how much he wills, he will not accomplish what he wants to do. The greatest mistake is to think that man does good because he wills to do good and that he does evil because he wills to do evil. However, doing good and committing evil are all a matter of law; they have nothing to do with the will. In order to do good, man needs a life that is good. However, man has become fallen and can no longer do good. A man who tries to do good by his will is like a man trying to drive a car that is out of gasoline. All he can do is push the car. If he pushes, the car moves, and if he does not push, the car does not move. This is the way many believers live today.</p><p>We have to realize that within a believer there is some- thing deeper than the will. This is the life of God. This life has nothing to do with our will. It is something spontaneous. This life is a law. It lives out all kinds of goodness in a spontaneous way. In the physical life, a man eats when he is hungry. He puts on clothing when he is cold. He gets out of bed when he wakes up in the morning. These are spontaneous acts. The same is true with the spiritual life. We read the Bible because it is beneficial to our spiritual life; we eat the word spontaneously. We do not read just because we resolve to read. For a healthy person, eating is something spontaneous. Only a sick person needs others to force him to eat. The same is true with our spiritual life. God's life is good; therefore, doing good is a spontaneous thing. It is abnormal for us not to do good. We do not testify just because we resolve to testify; our testimony should be an outflow of life. Whatever is in us spontaneously comes out of us. If we are inwardly filled with God's life, we will outwardly express this life in a spontaneous way.</p><h2 class="head1">THE RESURRECTION LIFE</h2><p>A sister once became sick on a journey. She suffered much, but the Lord brought her through. Later she testified that the Lord of glory literally carried her on His back and brought her through. She had experienced God's life, and she knew this life. Hence, her testimony was spontaneous. Many believers are physically weak because they love their own life. They are not able to bear even the slightest burden. They have not experienced the Lord's resurrection life, and they cannot testify of the riches of this life. Blessed are those who live by the power of the Lord's life. They are able to experience the resurrection power of the Lord and to testify of this power under any circumstance. In 2 Corinthians 1:9 Paul said, "We should not base our confidence on ourselves but on God, who raises the dead." This is the life that God wants us to live. It is a life that lives by the resurrection life of the Lord, not by ourselves.</p><p>What is the resurrection life? In John 11:25 the Lord said, "I am the resurrection and the life; he who believes into Me, even if he should die, shall live." The resurrection life is just Christ. Philippians 3:10 speaks of the power of Christ's resurrection. Hebrews 7:16 speaks of the power of an indestructible life. Acts 2:24 says that God raised Christ from the dead, because it was not possible for Him to be held by death. The greatest power in this world is death; the totality of the power of the gates of Hades is the power of death. But Christ has resurrected from the dead. He has overcome the power of death and Hades. Resurrection means that life has gone into death and come out of death. Revelation 1:18 is a precious verse. It says that the Lord became dead but is living forever and ever. Resurrection means that something "became dead, and behold...[is] living forever and ever." This life possesses the greatest power. It overcomes death, transcends death, and is not bound by death. The life that we have is such a life. Consequently, we can transcend over all sufferings and trials and overcome the bondage of the power of death in our daily living.</p><p>Once, when I was in Nanking, there was an air raid. I saw one man crawling out of a heap of debris. He was able to do this because he was still living; there was still life in him. Anything that was dead and lifeless would not crawl out. Ephesians 1:19-20 speaks of the great power that God operated in Christ in raising Him from the dead. This life is now manifesting itself through us. It can manifest itself through us because Christ is in us, and He is our resurrection life. Once we see this, we will no longer trust in our will power but in the life power of Christ. When a sick man is dying, he cannot just decide in his mind to live. Doctors tell us that only a very small percentage of people survive through the exercise of their will power. Living is a matter of life; it is not a matter of the will. Paul said in Colossians 1:29 that he labored and struggled according to the Lord's operation which operated in him in power. This is the secret to our Christian living. We live according to the power of the inner life, and not according to the power of our will.</p><p>The amount of burden a Christian can bear in his outward living depends on the working of God within; it does not depend on his will power. This is like filling a tire with air. When all the tires of a car have twenty-five pounds of pressure per square inch, the car can move smoothly. But if any of the tires are flat, the car will not move. A man who acts according to his will is like a man who is pushing a car with a flat tire. A Christian can never be energized by the power of his will. Every outward performance and work of the will will eventually be shattered. The Christian life should be spontaneous. Everyone who lives by the life of God is a spontaneous person; there is nothing unnatural about him. Anything unnatural, awkward, or artificial is a result of the human will. This is not the kind of life that God has ordained for a Christian. We have to see the futility of the will. We have to see that the power for our Christian living is not the power of the will but the power of the life of God. May the Lord show us the power of God's life, and may we always live by the power of this life.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINE</h1><h1 class="title">THE PRINCIPLES OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 1:12; Gen. 12:11-13; Luke 20:1-8; John 6:38</h1><p>Prayer: Lord, shine on us so that we will be honest enough to acknowledge what we have and what we do not have. We do not want to be empty inwardly while pretending to have something outwardly. We want to first be filled with something inwardly and then express it outwardly. We do not want to be empty inwardly while pretending to have something outwardly. Make us those who live in a spontaneous way before You. Amen.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT BY POLITICS, BUT BY GOD'S GRACE</h2><p>Paul testified in 2 Corinthians 1:12 that "our boasting is this, the testimony of our conscience, that in singleness and sincerity of God, not in fleshly wisdom but in the grace of God, we have conducted ourselves in the world, and more abundantly toward you." This verse tells us that the principle of Christian living is not human wisdom but the grace of God. It is not maneuvering or politics but the will of God. The world has its principle of living; it can apply human wisdom, maneuverings, and politics. But a Christian should never resort to his own wisdom, maneuverings, or politics. Being without politics is being void of any motive of self-gain. Those who trust in their own wisdom, maneuverings, or politics are only for themselves. They only care for their own interest in everything, and they only seek their own gain.</p><p>In Genesis 12 Abraham went down to Egypt because of famine in Canaan. There he resorted to politics. He knew that his wife was fair and that when the Egyptians saw her, they would kill him to get her. He asked Sarai to tell others that she was his sister so that he could be spared and have peace. Later, Pharaoh took Sarai to be his wife, and God sent a plague to Pharaoh's household as a result of this. Eventually, Pharaoh went to Abraham and rebuked him. Abraham resorted to politics, but he failed and was rebuked by a Gentile (vv. 11-19). What a shame! Sometimes there is famine in Canaan and food in Egypt. It is all right to go to Egypt to buy food like Jacob, but one should not resort to politics for the sake of preserving his own life and peace like Abraham.</p><p>Miss Barber used to carry a walking stick and take a walk every afternoon for an hour or two. Some criticized her for indulging in sightseeing. When I told her about this, she asked me, "Does a Christian live by what others say or by what he knows?" At that time I did not know what this meant. In her early days Miss Barber returned to England once every three or five years. After she moved to Lo-hsing Pagoda, very few people visited her. She stayed there for eighteen years. She knew that it was God's will that she take a walk for an hour or two every day. She was aware of the criticisms against her. However, she would not resort to human politics; rather, she trusted in the simplicity of God. She did not explain or vindicate herself but only acted according to God's will.</p><p>Once a famous person invited me to dinner. At that time a somewhat renowned worker of the Lord was in Shanghai. He was also invited, and he wanted to go with me. At that time I was taking care of a conference. On my way to the dinner, the Lord told me not to go. I obeyed God's will and turned back. I could not brush aside God's will just because a famous man had invited me, nor could I accept the invitation just because a renowned worker of the Lord was going. God stopped me from exercising human politics and led me to act according to the singleness and sincerity of God.</p><p>The same should be true in how we serve the saints. We should not trust in human wisdom but in God's will. For example, some brothers and sisters are under God's disciplining hand. We have to render them help according to the Lord's timing. If we step in too early, we will disturb God's work. We cannot overstep the Lord to extend help to others according to our own zeal and wisdom. If we do, it will be like trying to pull a butterfly out of a cocoon. The result will be nothing but death.</p><p>Once Miss Barber dealt with a troubled sister in a very severe way. The sister cried bitterly. When I saw this, I asked Miss Barber why she rebuked the sister in such a strong way. She asked, "Is this sister crying for the Lord or is she crying for herself?" Miss Barber was very absolute for God. She did not care for human sentiment and would not do anything to save others' faces. She truly lived by God's singleness and sincerity.</p><p>Once I was preaching at a certain place, and two brothers were translating my speaking into the local dialect. One was a good translator, and the other one was not that good. At the beginning the one who was good was not present, and I had to ask the second one to translate for me. He was in fear and trembling and prayed all the time while he translated. After twelve days, with two days remaining, the first brother came. Everyone wanted him to take over the translation, and he came and told me that everyone expected him to take over the translation. I knew within me that I should not let him, but I was too polite. I made some superficial remarks and said, "There are only two more meetings left. If we change now, the other brother may feel embarrassed." Later, I had to confess to the Lord concerning this matter. I knew God's will, yet I was too sensitive to man's face and had spoken a word of politics. God was not pleased with this. A believer has to learn to suffer misunderstanding and criticism rather than forsake God's will.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT ACCORDING TO NATURAL DISPOSITION,<br />BUT ACCORDING TO GOD'S WILL</h2><p>The principle of Christian living is based not on natural disposition but on God's own nature. Our natural disposition should not be the guideline for our daily living. We should not live according to our looseness or caution. It is not a matter of how we feel. It is a matter of prayer and of acting according to God's will. If we do not put God's will first and do not seek after it, we will do something based on our natural disposition or character, and it will be nothing but acts of self-will.</p><p>The Lord's life on earth was a life of acting according to the will of the One who sent Him (John 6:38), not according to His self-will. He went up to Jerusalem, cleansed the temple, and cast out those who were making merchandise in the temple. Although this offended many and although others interrogated Him, He was not discouraged from carrying out God's will. The Lord did not care for man; He did not save men's faces. He only cared for God's will. It is often the clever and capable saints who get themselves into trouble. While we may face many obstacles in doing God's will, including criticism, mockery, and opposition from others, we should remain single to the Lord, obeying His will and pleasing Him alone.</p><p>A clever man often has to resort to lies, tricks, maneuverings, or politics. Luke 20:1-8 records the story of priests, scribes, and elders finding Jesus teaching the people in the temple. They asked the Lord by what authority He was doing all these things and who had given Him such authority. The Lord asked them, "The baptism of John, was it from heaven or from men?" (v. 4). They reasoned together among themselves and told the Lord that they did not know. They avoided the Lord's question, even though they knew the answer. They knew that the baptism of John came from heaven. All the people believed this, but they themselves did not believe this. They could not say that it was from heaven, because they were afraid the Lord would ask, "Why did you not believe him?" (v. 5). Neither could they say that it was from men, because the people would stone them; therefore, they said that they did not know. They did not answer because their words would have condemned them. The Lord then said, "Neither do I tell you by what authority I do these things" (v. 8). The Lord did not say that He did not know; He said that He would not tell them by what authority He did these things. The word "neither" is very interesting. This word exposed the lies of the priests, scribes, and elders. They lied when they said they did not know; therefore, the Lord said, "Neither do I tell you." The priests, scribes, and elders were men of politics. They resorted to human politics and plots to avoid hurting themselves. A person who resorts to such things is absolutely useless in the hand of the Lord.</p><p>May the Lord be merciful to us. May we learn to live by God's singleness and sincerity and not by human wisdom, maneuverings, or politics, and may we not seek our own advantage or be driven by motives of self-advancement. May the Lord cause us to live according to His singleness and sincerity, and may we carry out His will with singleness of heart.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TEN</h1><h1 class="title">BEING WEAK IN THE LORD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Cor. 13:4; 12:9-10; 1 Cor. 2:2-5</h1><h2 class="head1">HINDRANCES TO SPIRITUAL GROWTH&mdash;<br />SELF-PROCLAIMED STRENGTH</h2><p>Many Christians have problems and are not growing because they are not weak enough in the eyes of God. They consider themselves strong. They say that they know their problems, yet they remain the same and are never delivered from their problems. Many people are very opinionated and talkative. They do not see the evil of sin. Sometimes they even boast in their confessions. The stronghold of these ones is their self-confidence. They have instant assurance and judgment concerning everything. They know whether something is right or wrong and its advantages or disadvantages. Such ones have to learn the proper lessons from the Lord; they have to lose their self-confidence and assurance before they can advance spiritually and before they can become useful in the hand of the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF PETER</h2><p>Before the Lord's death Peter was very confident and self-assured in what he said and did. He did not lie. If you were to say to him that he was too quick, he surely would have argued with you. Yet, after the Lord was betrayed and captured, Peter became so weak that he denied the Lord before the face of the maid of the high priest. He did not deny the Lord just once but three times. The last time he even swore in his denial of the Lord. At that moment the cock crowed, and he remembered the Lord's word. He received revelation and came to know himself, and he went out to weep (Matt. 26:69-75). After the Lord resurrected, He appeared to Peter by the sea and asked him three times, "Simon, son of John, do you love Me?" Peter could only say, "Lord, You know that I love You" (John 21:15-17). Peter was no longer so confident. He dared not say that he could die for the Lord. He could no longer say that he would not stumble even if everyone else stumbled. A man who has passed through the cross and who has been dealt with by God is weak&mdash;all of his self-confidence and assurance have been shattered.</p><h2 class="head1">THE EXPERIENCE OF MOSES</h2><p>In the Old Testament there was Moses. From the time he was a child until he was forty years old, he learned the Egyptian knowledge in Pharaoh's palace. He was powerful in words and deeds, and he became very confident in himself. However, he had to run away to the land of Midian when he was forty years old, and he became a shepherd. All his learning became useless. He was dealt with and lost his self-confidence. When He was called by God forty years later, he told the Lord, "O my Lord, I am not eloquent, neither heretofore, nor since thou hast spoken unto thy servant; but I am slow of speech, and of a slow tongue" (Exo. 4:10). He was so afraid to speak that he wanted his brother Aaron to be his mouth. Although Aaron did become his mouth, eventually Moses still spoke for God. By then Moses was qualified to be used by God. His self-confidence in his own education and capability was completely shattered. He had become a servant of God, and God could use him.</p><p>Those who have received revelation and light from the Lord are persons who first have been totally stripped of their strength before the Lord. We see this in David, Jeremiah, Isaiah, etc. They all felt as if they had nothing and could do nothing. A Christian must be a person who has lost all self-confidence. Only after he has lost his self-confidence will he look to God alone, and only then can God use him.</p><p>Christ was crucified out of weakness, and Paul was weak in Him (2 Cor. 13:4). Christians often want to participate in Christ's resurrection and ascension, but they often forget that they should be weak in Him. On the cross the Lord prayed to the Father that He would forgive those who crucified Him. Yet He also said, "My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?" (Matt. 27:46). It seems that our Lord was quite weak. The apostle Paul told the Corinthians believers, "For I did not determine to know anything among you except Jesus Christ, and this One crucified" (1 Cor. 2:2). He said that when he was with the church in Corinth, he was in weakness and in fear and in much trembling (v. 3). He preached the cross. He was not like today's revivalists, who conduct conference after conference with power and energy. Paul was apparently weak, and he only preached the crucified Christ. Yet this preaching manifested the power of God.</p><p>Whether or not a man can be weak before the Lord has nothing to do with his knowledge. Only those who have received revelation can be weak. Performed weakness does not last, and others can see clearly that it is not the real thing. Weakness that results from revelation is not something that can be forgotten. After Peter was dealt with by the Lord, it was hard for him even to confess his love to the Lord. He could only say, "Lord, You know." He no longer had any self-confidence; he had lost his self-confidence. He was not bold to speak quickly or judge confidently. This is genuine weakness. Those who are good at criticizing others, who can easily pinpoint the faults of others, have never seen this revelation; they do not know themselves. Everyone who is confident in himself and who believes in his own judgment does not know his own weakness.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD'S POWER<br />BEING PERFECTED IN MAN'S WEAKNESS</h2><p>Second Corinthians 12:9 says that the Lord's power is perfected in man's weakness. A strong person can never experience the power of Christ tabernacling over him. Those who put considerable emphasis on the outpouring of power cannot receive the outpouring unless they first know that they are weak. If they do not know that they are weak, they can only remain on the level of the Corinthian believers. Paul knew this secret. Hence, he boasted in his weaknesses so that the power of Christ might tabernacle over him.</p><p>During my stay in Honor Oak, England, I met one visitor who was a famous author and expositor. When we were together, he often would expound this or that passage in the Bible. Yet I knew in my heart that his spiritual stature did not even come close to that of the old sister working in the kitchen. He had not been dealt with by the Lord, and his natural life had not been eliminated. He did not know his weakness, and God's power was not made perfect in him. It is not a question of whether or not we can expound the Bible well. The question is whether or not we are the right person. Once I asked Brother Austin-Sparks whether he was taking a step forward or backward in his knowledge of God's will. He told me that he had taken a big step backward. Formerly, he seemed to know everything and was confident about everything. But now he could only say, "It seems...." Yet at the same time, he became more dependent on the Lord. Those who love to write expositions about the book of Revelation are often just elementary students of the Bible. Those who have genuinely received revelation will not be as quick to criticize, propose, speak, expound, or judge anything. They have become weak through the revelation they have received. A weak person is a person who can tremble. He is one who is always afraid of frustrating God. He looks to God and seeks after Him in a genuine way and never oversteps Him. God can use only such a person. May the cross defeat us, and may we be weak in Him so that His power can tabernacle over us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED ELEVEN</h1><h1 class="title">LOVING NOT OUR OWN LIFE<br />(FOR THOSE WHO HAVE MANY SICKNESSES)</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 6, 1939<br />Scripture Reading: Rev. 12:11; Job 2:3-10; Matt. 10:39; Acts 15:26; 20:24; Rom. 16:3-4; Eph. 6:10; Phil. 2:29-30; 1 Pet. 4:1-2; 1 John 3:16</h1><h2 class="head1">NOT LOVING ONESELF<br />BEING THE BASIS FOR VICTORY OVER SATAN</h2><p>The book of Revelation tells us that the brothers overcome Satan, the accuser, by the blood of Christ, by the word of their testimony, and by not loving their soul-life. Not loving our own soul-life is not the condition for overcoming Satan, it is the basis for overcoming him (12:11). Not loving our soul-life does not mean that we have to die. It means that we are willing to give up our own soul-life and that we do not care for our own soul-life. Some people are not that attached to their children; they are not concerned whether they lose their children. But they care very much for their own "face." It is easier for them to lose ten ounces of gold than to give away "ten ounces" of their flesh. These men love themselves. They cannot overcome Satan. In fact they are certain losers in the hand of Satan. Satan is only afraid of one kind of people&mdash;those who do not love their own soul-life. Only these ones are beyond Satan's touch. The basis for victory over Satan is to not love our own soul-life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD'S PATTERN</h2><p>When the Lord was on earth, He did not care for His own soul-life. This was why many people considered Him to be a mad man. They thought that He did not know how to control Himself, that He did not know how to eat properly. Today we are all familiar with teachings on temperance. Actually, we are practicing worldly temperance. The Lord was able to give up temperance for the sake of others. Of course, I must say that being intemperate for no reason at all is a sin, and it is extreme. It is not wrong to live an unregulated life, but it is wrong to be intemperate in an irresponsible way. Not loving our own soul-life and being intemperate are two different things. The Lord could eat outside normal times; He could touch lepers, get up before the sun rose, or pray all night. But these were done during times of special need and for the benefit of others. Being able to sleep properly and eat properly are not signs of temperance in themselves. Proper temperance is having the ability to control oneself, eating when one should eat, refraining from eating when one should not eat, sleeping when one should sleep, and rising up when one should rise up.</p><h2 class="head1">EXPRESSIONS OF SELF-LOVE</h2><p>If a believer never prays or fasts, this is an expression of self-love. If he comes to the meeting late and does not open his mouth, this is also an expression of self-love. Some dare not share the same cup with others at the bread-breaking meeting. Although they love the Lord, they cannot remember the Lord, because they are fearful of being infected by germs. This is also a form of self-love. I am not saying that we should not take care of hygiene. I am saying that it is not right for us to become paranoid about these things through self-love and self-indulgence. When some go to the hospital to preach the gospel, they cover their nose with their hands when they are preaching to the sick. It would be better for such ones to go home. The Lord could touch the lepers with His hands. Is man's soul more precious, or is your life more precious?</p><p>There was a sister who was sick, and I prayed for her twice. I knew that the Lord would heal her, and I asked her if she wanted to be healed. She answered, "When you are sick, others love you. But after you get well, no one loves you anymore." I realized that this sister just wanted to be loved. Many people are sick because they want to be loved. Their sickness is not an outward affliction; it is self-induced. They impose sickness upon themselves artificially.</p><p>Once I was sick in a hospital. The patient lying in the room next to mine groaned quite often. However, the pattern of his groaning followed the sound of footsteps on the stairs. When there was a noise on the stairs, he began to groan, but when it became quiet, his groaning stopped. He groaned to win sympathy from others. Such ones are self-lovers. It is a shame for believers to seek for sympathy. They love no one but themselves. Many people love themselves; they love their own voice, their own health, and their own money more than the souls of others. The Lord can never use them in His work.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PATTERN OF THE SAINTS OF OLD</h2><p>When the son of the Shunammite woman died, the woman did not stay with the son but put him down and turned to Elisha (2 Kings 4:17-37). The book of Hebrews says that she received her dead by resurrection (11:35). Let us turn to Paul's parting word to the Ephesian elders. He invited the elders in Ephesus to come to Miletus, comforted them with words, and testified to them, saying, "The Holy Spirit solemnly testifies to me in city after city, saying that bonds and afflictions await me. But I consider my life of no account as if precious to myself, in order that I may finish my course and the ministry which I have received from the Lord Jesus to solemnly testify of the gospel of the grace of God" (Acts 20:23-24). Paul risked his life for the Lord's name. He was able to say that he considered his life of no account as if precious to himself. The Lord has no intention that every one of us should be a martyr, but we need to have the heart of a martyr, which is not to love our soul-life. Paul did not love his soul-life, and he considered his soul-life of no account as if precious to himself. This is the proper attitude for every servant of the Lord.</p><p>In Acts 15:26 the church in Jerusalem wrote a letter to recommend Paul and Barnabas to the church in Antioch. The letter said that they were "men who have risked their lives for the name of our Lord Jesus Christ." In his recommendation of Epaphroditus, Paul said that "for the work of Christ he drew near unto death, risking his life" (Phil. 2:30). In his greetings to Prisca and Aquila, he said to the church in Rome, "Prisca and Aquila, my fellow workers in Christ Jesus, who risked their own necks for my life, to whom not only I give thanks, but also all the churches of the Gentiles" (Rom. 16:3-4). All of these did not love their own lives. They are patterns to us, the believers.</p><h2 class="head1">A MIND TO SUFFER</h2><p>First Peter 4:1-2 tells us that a mind to suffer is a weapon. If a man is armed with such a mind, he will not live in the lust of men but in the will of God. This, however, does not mean that we look for sufferings, nor does it mean that we mortify ourselves. We have to see the difference between suffering and having a mind to suffer. A suffering man is not necessarily one who has renounced his self-love, but someone who has a mind to suffer surely has renounced his self-love.</p><p>Some people feel weak when they skip a meal, and they resign from the Lord's work once they have a headache. How much the Lord is restricted in these ones! Of course, this does not mean that we should expose ourselves to unnecessary risks. Our boldness is with respect to the Lord. The Lord loves us; He did not love Himself. Therefore, He laid down His life for us. We should not love ourselves for this same reason; we should lay down our life for others. Those who love themselves cannot love others, because they have exhausted all their energy on self-love.</p><p>Those who love their own soul-life will lose it, but those who lose their soul-life for the Lord's sake and who do not love themselves will find life (Matt. 10:39). Satan once attacked Job; now he is attacking the believers. In order to overcome Satan, believers must realize that the basis of victory is the renunciation of their self-love.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWELVE</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S LIGHT AND SELF-ANALYSIS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 4:12; Psa. 139:23-24; 119:130; Eph. 5:13; John 1:4; Gen. 32:30</h1><h2 class="head1">SELF-ANALYSIS BEING A SPIRITUAL SICKNESS</h2><p>In the course of their pursuit of the Lord, many Christians fall into the sickness of self-analysis. They want to know what God's will is and what God's will is not. They want to know what is spiritual and what is soulish. They want to know what is of God and what is of themselves. In the course of their analysis and to their vexation, they sometimes feel that something is of God and sometimes feel that it is of themselves. They analyze everything and try to determine whether they are acting by the power of God or by the power of their soul. As soon as they have a thought, they try to determine whether it is from God or from themselves. As a result they are often trapped by introspection.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S LIGHT VERSUS HUMAN ANALYSIS</h2><p>Sometimes we feel that we are doing the right thing. But when a spiritual person says something to us, we suddenly realize that what we previously considered to be absolutely right is actually totally wrong. At that time we do not need to ask for any reason or conduct any more analysis; we spontaneously become clear about everything. This is God's light, and it comes when God's living word, like a two-edged sword, comes into us and divides our soul from our spirit. At this time we are very clear about what is of God and what is of ourselves. We know what is God's will and what is our will. There is a world of difference between God's light and man's analysis; they are two distinct things.</p><p>Once I did my best to do the right thing. I felt that I was quite holy and spiritual. Later, I had a talk with a sister who was very deep in the Lord. She only said a few words. But after we prayed, I realized that I was wrong. I felt that I was unclean and far from God's holiness. This was God's light, and it broke upon me. Man's own ideas and feelings are often deceptive, but God's light always unveils His view. The knowledge that one acquires through God's light is true self-knowledge.</p><p>God's word conveys God's will. When God's word comes to us, it comes as a two-edged sword. When His word shines on us, we see ourselves and fall down. I admit that I am a strong-willed person. I do not easily admit my faults even when others point them out to me. But once God's light comes, I see my faults. No human analysis and introspection can be compared to God's light. God's light reaches the soul and spirit, even the bone and marrow. His light can reveal the hidden things in man's heart. Although man's soul can understand the doctrines, these doctrines are of no profit without God's light. At least once in our lives, we must experience a fundamental opening of our eyes. We must encounter God's light in this way before we can go on in God's way. Both John and Paul fulfilled the ministries that God entrusted to them because they saw the light.</p><p>Some believers like to wait around for special experiences. They think that they will be a certain way after a certain date. But when that date comes, whatever they see may not be genuine revelation. Often this is man's self-analysis rather than God's light. Anyone who experiences God's revelation experiences God's work. If a man sees light, the light will bring him spontaneously into a certain kind of practice. Hence, in God's work we should not trust in human analysis; rather, we should look to His light. The works in James 2 refer to the help we render to other brothers and sisters; they do not refer to a Christian's conduct in himself. Therefore, they are altogether different from the work mentioned above.</p><h2 class="head1">CONDITIONS FOR RECEIVING GOD'S LIGHT</h2><p>How can we receive God's light? There is only one condition for us to receive the light&mdash;the presence of an opening. There is no other condition. This is the only condition&mdash;we have to be open within. Nothing can stop light. The only way that light can be shut out is for a man to shut himself up. This is the first thing that we have to guard against. If a man has a predisposition about a certain thing and assumes that he is right, he is a closed person and cannot expect to receive God's light. God's light will only come to those who are empty, that is, to those who are open from within. Psalm 139:23 says, "Search me, O God, and know my heart;/Try me, and know my anxious thoughts." This verse says that it is God who knows, not we who know. Man cannot know his own thoughts and heart through self-analysis. Our self-analysis will only lead to self-deception; it will not lead us to light. However, when God's light shines on us, our inner eyes will be opened, and there will be no need for us to ask anything, because God will have pointed out all the thoughts and the intents of our heart. God gives revelation to His believers through His light and leads them on in a living way. We must follow the psalmist to ask God to search our heart and to try our thoughts. When He speaks, we need to receive His speaking with a sincere and open heart.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED THIRTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE WARFARE OF LIFE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 2:9; Heb. 2:14; Rom. 8:13, 6; 2 Tim. 1:10; 1 Cor. 15:21-22, 25-26, 54-55; Matt. 25:34, 46b; 7:14</h1><p>The heaven and earth that God first created was committed to the archangel. Later, the archangel fell and became Satan, and God came in to re-create the world. In addition, He created man to rule over the earth. Satan had lost all dominion through his fall, but he was not willing to concede defeat. He tried his best to gain and destroy man in order to overthrow God's plan. From that time forward, a warfare has been waging between man and Satan.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WARFARE BETWEEN SATAN AND MAN</h2><p>The main battle between Satan and man has to do with life. The tree of life and the tree of the knowledge of good and evil in Genesis 2 do not seem to be direct opposites, but after verse 17 speaks of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, the next sentence says, "For in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die." We can say that the tree of the knowledge of good and evil is the tree of death, because God said that the day man ate of the tree he would surely die. This tree speaks of the fact that Satan has no other motive in man except to bring him death. His goal is for man to die. Unfortunately, Adam was deceived by the serpent and ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. As a result death came upon all men. First Corinthians 15:21 says that death came through one man. The one man is Adam. When he ate of the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he brought death to humanity, and man became fallen.</p><p>This world is evil not because it is sinful. Sin is just the means; the end result is death. Satan's work is to bring death to the man God created. This is his goal. Today the root of malady in this Satan-corrupted world is death, not sin. When Adam chose the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he introduced not only sin into the world but also death. This refers particularly to spiritual death. Because of this death, sin came upon all men.</p><p>Sin and death are "co-workers" of Satan. A man who spreads death is one who collaborates with Satan. Satan's goal is not only to cause man to sin and fall but also to bring man into the bondage of death. Death is the characteristic of Satan's work. The ultimate goal of his work is to saturate man with death. Today our meeting does not depend on numbers. If we have a bigger number, it does not mean that we have better meetings. The important thing is that we have to overcome death in our meetings. We have to swallow up death and release life. If we see death in the meeting, it means that life is absent. A Christian must realize that there is nothing more evil than death. At the same time, there is nothing better than life. In God's eyes death is the most ugly thing, while life is the most precious thing. What is life? Life is not a doctrine. A person who has life has the experience of life, but it may be very difficult for him to describe what he has experienced. Life is not excitement or good feelings. Life is just Christ Himself.</p><h2 class="head1">THE WORK OF CHRIST'S DEATH</h2><p>How can we overcome death? We can never overcome death in ourselves, because Satan has injected death into us. The only One who has overcome death is the Lord Jesus Christ. The goal of the Lord's work on the cross was to put Satan to death. Satan ruled the world through death, but Christ destroyed Satan through death (Heb. 2:14). The Lord's death is a terminating death, while Satan's death is a non-terminating death. Christ's death is complete and thorough. All other deaths are merely deaths, but Christ's death is a termination. Neither the death of Hades, the death of the body, nor the death of the lake of fire can terminate anything. Only Christ's death terminates. His death has terminated Satan and has terminated even "death" itself.</p><p>Second Timothy 1:10 tells us that Christ nullified death and brought life and incorruption to light. Christ's death is different from Adam's death. In Christ death is halted; it is nullified. This is the gospel. Everything can be burned except for one thing&mdash;ashes. When a house burns, the person who set fire to the house cannot burn it down again. Christ's death is not only a redeeming death but also a Satan-destroying death. When Satan was dealt with, death was dealt with as well. Hence, death reigns no longer; it has been swallowed up.</p><h2 class="head1">THE POWER OF DEATH</h2><p>A man can be free from sin, but he cannot be free from the satanic operation of death. Romans 8 says, "For if you live according to the flesh, you must die" (v. 13), and "the mind set on the flesh is death" (v. 6). The death spoken of in these two verses is not the death of the body nor the death of hell but spiritual death. The power of death is suppressing our spirit and putting it to death. Every believer can be under the effect of the power of death. For example, a Christian may have offended the Spirit and spoken something that should not have been said. Not only is the speaker under the power of death, but the words themselves spread death. When the power of death comes upon a man, it kills his spirit and depletes him of any vitality or energy. As soon as a man sets his mind on the flesh, he falls under the power of death. Any act that is according to the flesh affords death an opportunity to prevail upon man.</p><p>As long as Satan has not been cast into the abyss and the lake of fire, it is still possible for the power of death to operate in the believers. Once this power of death operates, a believer's spirit becomes bound and suffers damage. When a man hits a wall, the first part that is hurt is his nose, because the nose is the part that protrudes from the body. When a man spreads death, the spirit of others is the first part that is hurt, because man's spirit is the "protruding" part as far as life is concerned. Not only must the speaker release life in the meeting, but the ones in the audience must be receptive to life as well. How good a meeting is depends as much on the condition of the consuming elements as it does on the supplying elements. If the number of those who consume life becomes too large, the meeting will be taken over by death. On the other hand, if the number of those who supply life becomes larger, the meeting will be full of life. None of us should be a bystander in the meeting; even more none of us should spread any death. Whether we are speakers or listeners, our spirit should be on the alert and not allow death to take over; rather, we should drive away the power of death through prayer.</p><h2 class="head1">OVERCOMING DEATH</h2><p>First Corinthians 15 says that death comes from Adam, while resurrection comes from Christ. In Adam all have died, while in Christ all will be made alive (v. 22). When the kingdom comes, the sting of death will be gone, and death will be completely annihilated. At that time mortality will put on immortality, and death will be swallowed up unto victory (vv. 54-55). From the time of Adam, death has been man's enemy. But in the end, this enemy will be annihilated. At that time Christ will be king and all things will be put in subjection to Him. The last enemy&mdash;death&mdash;will also be abolished (vv. 25-26). Hence, the kingdom will be a time when eternal life reigns. Not only will sin be terminated in the kingdom, death will be terminated as well. Although eternal life will not reign until the age of the kingdom, we can have a foretaste of the power of the kingdom&mdash;victory over death&mdash;today. As long as we walk by the Spirit and put to death the practices of the body by the Spirit, we will live with the Lord. "For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace" (Rom. 8:6).</p><h1 class="series">SECTION FOURTEEN<br />SHANGHAI MESSAGES<br />OF 1940</h1><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FOURTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE ATTACK ON THE CHURCH</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 16:18; Acts 2:26-27, 31; 1 Cor. 15:55; Rev. 1:18; 20:13-14; Isa. 38:9-11, 18; Eph. 1:23; Col. 2:9; Rom. 8:10; 1 Cor. 2:14</h1><h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH&mdash;<br />A VESSEL OF CHRIST</h2><p>When Christ was living on earth, He was a vessel for the life of God. He was God's expression and image. Colossians 2:9 says that in Him dwells all the fullness of the Godhead bodily. God is invisible, and He dwells in unapproachable light. However, He has deposited all His riches into Christ and has made Christ a visible man. Christ dwelt among men and manifested God's riches. Then one day Christ put all His riches into the church. His intention is for the church to express His riches and be His expression. Today, the church in turn becomes the vessel of Christ. All the riches of God are in Christ, and today all the riches of Christ are in the church. According to Ephesians 1:23, the church is "the fullness of the One who fills all in all." The church is not a refugee camp filled with poor and pitiful people. The church is filled with people who have the riches of Christ and who are the vessels of Christ. Why does the church exist on the earth today? The church exists to be a testimony of the riches of God.</p><p>The riches of God are in Christ, and the riches of Christ are manifested through the church. How does the church express Christ? Since the church is the testimony of the riches of God, its characteristics must be the characteristics of Christ. Then what are the characteristics of Christ? We can put it in a simple way: The characteristics of Christ are encapsulated in the words He said when He raised Lazarus from the dead, "I am the resurrection and the life" (John 11:25). Christ is the resurrection and the life. Since the church is the vessel of Christ on earth, it should express this life and resurrection. God intends for the church to manifest the life of Christ. Hence, the church must be full of life. In the church everything that issues from God is life, and everything that issues from Satan is death.</p><p>The main goal of the Lord coming to earth is for man to have life (John 10:10), that is, for man to receive God's life. The Gospel of John is a book on life; it is not on sin or other things. Almost every chapter concerns life and resurrection. God's Christ is life, and God's Christ is resurrection, and the church is the vessel of this life and resurrection. We know that a vessel is used to contain things. You cannot give water to others with your hands; you have to have a vessel to contain the water before others can receive it. Through the church&mdash;the vessel of Christ&mdash;God dispenses His life and riches to men.</p><h2 class="head1">SATAN'S ATTACK ON THE CHURCH</h2><p>Satan is God's rival. He attacks everything that God wants to do. Since God's goal today is the church, Satan's attacks are directed specifically against the church. Satan does not necessarily stumble Christians or the church with the enticement of sin or the world, because these things are too obvious. While we may be free from sin and not love the world, we can still be under Satan's attacks. A bottle with a five-inch mouth cannot be stopped with a one-inch cork. Dealing with sin and the world alone is not enough to stop the attacks of Satan. The ultimate weapon Satan uses to attack the church is death. Death is not easily identifiable; it can creep secretly into the church. This does not mean that Satan will not use the world and sin to attack the church. It means that Satan can use refined and moral things, not just filthy and treacherous sins to attack Christians. Many refined and moral things are filled with death, and Satan can easily utilize these deadly things to attack the church.</p><p>Matthew 16:18 says that the foundation of the Lord's church is Christ the Rock, and the gates of Hades cannot prevail against this church. Hades is death. If the church has its roots in heaven, it will be impossible to cut it off from heaven, because like a great heavenly banyan tree, its roots are entrenched and death cannot prevail against it. The only reason that death cannot prevail over the church is that the church is built upon Christ the Rock. Isaiah 38 mentions Hezekiah's illness and his recovery. It shows us that Satan is most afraid when a godly man defies death. Many Christians can tell the difference between hot and cold; they know whether or not a sermon is well-delivered. But it is hard for them to distinguish between death and resurrection. But if the church is built on Christ the Rock, it will distinguish between death and life, and the gates of Hades will not prevail against it.</p><p>Romans 8:10 corresponds with John 12:25. Romans 8:10 is on the body and the spirit, while John 12 is on the soul, both the preserving and the losing of the soul. In both cases the end result is related to death and resurrection. Everything that issues from the body or from the soul results in death, which is Hades, whereas everything that issues from the spirit results in life. A man may be very talkative; he may be very wordy and may love to speak vain and improper words. A man also may be clear in logic and excellent in eloquence. All these things are but the products of the flesh, the soul, and the natural life. None of them is of the spirit or of Christ. Hence, there is no life; there is only death. A Christian should not ask whether a thing is good or evil but should ask from where a thing originates. Does it originate from the natural life, the flesh, the soul, or does it originate from the spirit? Of all the things that a Christian possesses, only those that originate from the spirit are of life, and only they can give others life. Nothing else&mdash;no matter how good, profitable, or nice&mdash;gives life.</p><p>Soon after I was saved, I became very interested in Bible exposition. I studied the different ways to outline the Scriptures. I studied the different ways to quote Scriptures and use parables. When I listened to others' messages, I would criticize them and label them good or bad, right or wrong. I tried to collect more material from others so that I could be as good as they were. Even in listening to Miss Barber, I held the same attitude. Many times I did not appreciate the messages of others. At that time I could not tell the difference between life and death. I thought that the most important thing was logic and teaching. After listening to Miss Barber for two years, I was invited once by her to speak. She wanted to see how well I spoke. I did my best to prepare for it; I felt good about my own speaking. The ideas were clear, the logic lucid, the explanations thorough, and the examples appropriate. After I delivered my message, I thought she would surely commend me a little. But she did not say a word and acted as if nothing had happened. I said in my heart, "Even if the message was not good, you should say something about it." But she simply did not mention it at all. One day, as I was walking with her in the courtyard, she turned to me and said, "If you realize someday that ideas alone are not good enough, it will be a wonderful day." I was puzzled by what she said, and I did not appreciate it. I said in my heart, "Didn't you use illustrations and quote Scriptures in your sermons? What is the difference?" At that time I did not understand what she meant, but today I do. There was life in her messages, but there were only ideas without life in my messages. Her words caused others to touch life, while my words only caused others to touch knowledge.</p><p>Once I invited a doctor of theology to Miss Barber's meeting and asked that he be given the opportunity to speak, and I translated for him. After the message I asked Miss Barber, "How was it?" She said, "It was sad!" I asked her why, and she pointed to a door that was chained shut and said, "Something good, but not moving." I was again upset by her remark. I told another brother, "This man has spoken only once. Can she possibly know all about him?" But today I know what she was talking about. Everything depends on life. If there is no life, all we have is death.</p><p>The church does not need good doctrines, good theology, or wonderful expositions. The church needs life, the resurrection life of Christ. No doctrine, idea, theology, or exposition can replace the life of Christ. Only the life of Christ and that which issues from it will prevail against the gates of Hades. Everything else is just disguised forms of death and cannot withstand the attacks of Satan. May the Lord be merciful to us, and may He keep us from touching death or bringing death into the church. May God fill the church with life, and may Satan find no opening to attack the church.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED FIFTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE WILL AND THE LAW OF LIFE</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Matt. 6:27-30; Rom. 7:18-19, 21-25a; 8:1-4; Matthew 6 is on the physical life; Romans 8 is on the spiritual life.</h1><h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p>Every life has its law. For example, a man can only grow to a certain height. He cannot add an inch to his stature. It is impossible for anyone to try to become taller by self-effort or will power. He can only be as tall as his natural life allows. This is also true of the spiritual life. What you are is what you are; you cannot increase your spiritual stature by the power of your will. Life is something spontaneous; it has what it has and is what it is. A short person can make himself look taller by wearing high heels, but he can only do this for a little while. When he takes the shoes off, his height de- creases. The same difficulty arises when a man makes up his mind to humble himself. He can sustain this effort for a little while, but he cannot keep it up forever. Many people try to be the kind of person they are not. This is hard. They find it hard and strenuous to be a Christian. Before Paul became a Christian, he resolved again and again to do good, but the good that he willed, he did not do, and the evil that he did not will, that he did. This is because another law of evil was operating in his members. Many Christians feel that they are too talkative or too proud. They think that if they strive, restrict themselves, and cultivate themselves a little, they will improve. They do not realize that there is a law of sin within them which the power of the will has no control over and which can never be overcome.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF LIFE OVERCOMING THE LAW OF SIN</h2><p>The first three chapters of Romans is about what man as a sinner has done. Then Romans 7 tells us what man is in himself&mdash;a sinner. The first three chapters of Romans talk about what man has done; this involves the need of forgiveness. Romans 7 and 8 deal with what a man is in himself; this involves the need of freedom. The first three chapters tell us that the evils that man has committed are forgiven through the redemption of Christ Jesus. Romans 7 and 8 tell us about the law of sin&mdash;that which is within man's being&mdash;and how man is released from it through the law of the Spirit of life. An unbeliever tries to walk according to the power of his will. But a Christian should not walk according to the power of his will. God delivers us from the first law through the operation of the second law.</p><p>During the Ching Dynasty, there was a toll tax which was a heavy burden to many people. The Ching Dynasty set up many toll stations throughout the country, and the toll officers possessed tremendous authority. In order for a load of goods to pass through several provinces, the owner had to pay a heavy toll tax. When the Nationalist government took over, a new law was decreed that replaced the old toll tax. Those who were suffering under the old law were relieved by the institution of the new law. They did not need to hope or pray for change any longer, because the new law had been instituted and had delivered them from the old law.</p><h2 class="head1">A LAW BEING SPONTANEOUS, AND<br />THERE BEING NO NEED<br />FOR THE WILL TO ASSIST IT</h2><p>Consider man's physical life. Our eyes are cleansed by the blinking of the eyelids. This action is involuntary; one does not need to consciously activate it. Our heart, digestion, and breathing are all regulated and spontaneous. There are many laws that govern our body. Many people have forgotten the fact that God not only gives man life but also equips him with the functions of life. Many people think that God gives man only eyes, a heart, lungs, and limbs, etc. But God has given each of these organs their own movement and function. Some may think that even though God has given us life, we have to stir up the capacity of this life ourselves before we can do anything. The result of this stirring up is never satisfactory; man ends up not doing what he wants to do. This life operates by itself. There is no need for us to do anything. This is a law. A law is something that operates by itself.</p><p>Once I could not sleep well for five or six nights. Sleep is very much related to human metabolism. I was worried that if this went on, I would not have the energy and physical strength to work. Later, I prayed and looked up verses in the Bible about sleep, such as the Lord Jesus sleeping at the bow of the boat in the midst of a storm. But none of these verses helped me. Finally, the Lord told me that I should trust in the natural law of the body. When the body is tired it sleeps, and after it sleeps it works. I trusted in this natural law and did not worry about it any longer, and I was able to lie down and sleep very well.</p><p>As long as a man eats, he will be filled and not be hungry. He does not have to worry whether he will be hungry again or what would happen if he lost his hunger. Man's stomach feels hungry spontaneously. As soon as we feel hungry, we eat. A little later we become hungry again and have to eat again. In the same principle, there are laws in the spiritual realm. We read the Bible because the inner life has a spontaneous urge to read, and the more we read, the more we like to read and the sweeter it becomes to our taste. However, if we force ourselves to read, we will not have any taste for it. The same is true with material offering, testifying, and every other kind of spiritual matter. Walking according to the inner life is something very spontaneous. When trials and temptations come our way, the life within will spontaneously withstand them; there is no need to assist with human methods and human strength. Our duty is to pray to the Lord and to look to Him silently and calmly. A Christian does not need to be anxious for his life, because the life that he has resists Satan and rejects sin spontaneously.</p><h2 class="head1">COOPERATING WITH THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><h2 class="head2">No Striving of the Will</h2><p>All we have to do is calmly trust in this new law, the second law within us. However, the minute we exercise our own strength, we act against this law. Anything strenuous is artificial. A man does not need to exert any effort to be saved. This is also true concerning overcoming. Being a Christian is not a question of striving or struggling. It is the Lord's grace that brings us through all the circumstances and that bears us up in all things. The law of life within spontaneously regulates and carries us on.</p><h2 class="head2">According to the Law of the Spirit</h2><p>What should we do about this new law? Romans 8 tells us that the Holy Spirit works to fulfill the righteousness of the law in a Christian. This righteousness is the very righteousness that the man in Romans 7 sought and tried to attain by resolving to do God's will. The secret of experiencing the law of the Spirit of life is to follow, which means to come behind. We cannot walk in front of the Holy Spirit; we cannot lead the way. We have to follow the Lord and walk behind Him. The Lord walks in front of us, and we should follow behind. We should let the Lord move first and then follow after. The Lord can do everything. We do not have to initiate anything. Instead, we can rest fully in the Lord.</p><p>At this point, a question often arises: "If I cannot make it when I try hard to hold myself back, would it not be worse if I let go?" If an unbeliever does not hold himself back, he will become worse because he will be taken over by the law of sin and of death once he lets go. He will die faster because there is only one law in him. But if a regenerated person lets go, the life within will usher him into the new law, the law of the Spirit of life, and once he goes along with this law, he will experience life and peace.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SIXTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">A FORETASTE OF THE POWERS<br />OF THE AGE TO COME</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 1:13; 2:5, 7-8; 4:9; 6:5; 8:8-12; Matt. 5:3; 11:28; 12:29; 16:18; 26:29; Luke 10:18-19; 11:20; 18:30; John 6:47; Ezek. 36:26-27; Jer. 31:31-34; Rom. 6:5; Zech. 13:1; Joel 2:28-32; Acts 2:16-18; 1 Pet. 1:5; Eph. 2:8a; 2 Tim. 1:10; 1 Cor. 15:55; Rev. 11:15; 12:9; 20:1-2, 4-5, 14a; Col. 1:13</h1><h2 class="head1">THE POWERS OF THE AGE TO COME</h2><h2 class="head2">God's Riches</h2><p>God's riches are available for man to enjoy. However, they are mainly for man to enjoy in the age of the kingdom and not in the age of the church. In the age of the church God's riches are not as abundant. However, the church and the kingdom are closely related. As soon as the church age passes away, the kingdom age will come. All of God's provisions for the church are a preparation for the kingdom age. The salvation described in 1 Peter 1 has to do with the coming age. In God's eyes He has prepared only one set of blessings for those in this age and the next age; there are not two sets of blessings. Therefore, God wants to have a group of people in the church age who will have a foretaste of the riches of the kingdom in the coming age.</p><h2 class="head2">Eternal Life</h2><p>In Luke 18, the Lord mentions one kind of eternal life, which we inherit in the coming age. It is for the kingdom and not for the church. However, in John 6 the Lord says, "He who believes has eternal life" (v. 47). Actually, the eternal life that Christians receive in the church age is no different from the eternal life that God's children receive in the kingdom age. But the eternal life in the kingdom is a general blessing, whereas the eternal life in the church today is a foretaste and a pledge.</p><h2 class="head2">Forgiveness of Sins</h2><p>Zechariah 13:1 says that in that day there will be an opened fountain for the people of Israel for sin and for impurity. In the church believers are already experiencing the forgiveness of sins. This is a foretaste.</p><h2 class="head2">Rest</h2><p>Hebrews 4 mentions another Sabbath rest, which is enjoyed in the kingdom. But in Matthew 11:28 the Lord said, "Come to Me all who toil and are burdened, and I will give you rest." This is something that we can enjoy today.</p><h2 class="head2">Regeneration</h2><p>Ezekiel 36:26-27 refers to the kingdom age, in which God will lead the Israelites back to their own land and give them a new heart and a new spirit. In the church we are regenerated and have a new heart and a new spirit. For God's chosen people, the Israelites, both the indwelling and the outpouring of the Holy Spirit will be experienced in the kingdom (Joel 2). But in the church today we have a foretaste of these gifts (Acts 2).</p><h2 class="head2">The New Covenant</h2><p>Jeremiah 31 shows us that the new covenant is something that God will establish with the house of Israel. But today the church is enjoying all the contents of this new covenant (Heb. 8:8-12).</p><h2 class="head2">Resurrection</h2><p>The resurrection spoken of in Revelation 20 is in the future. But today Christians are resurrected with Christ already.</p><h2 class="head2">The Gifts of the Holy Spirit</h2><p>Joel 2:28-32 tells us that the Holy Spirit will be poured out in the future, but in Acts 2 the church experienced it first.</p><h2 class="head2">The Annulling of Death</h2><p>Revelation 20:14 says that death will be thrown into the lake of fire. This is something that will happen in the future. However, 1 Corinthians 15 says that the power of death has been removed in the church (vv. 55-57), and Christ has nullified death (2 Tim. 1:10).</p><h2 class="head2">Termination of Hades</h2><p>Revelation 20 speaks of both death and Hades being cast into the lake of fire. However, Matthew 16:18 says that the gates of Hades cannot prevail against the church.</p><h2 class="head2">The Casting Down of Satan</h2><p>Revelation 12 says that Satan will be cast to the earth, and his messengers will be cast down together with him. In Luke 10, however, the Lord said that when the disciples preached and cast out demons, He saw Satan falling out of heaven. He also gave authority to the disciples to tread on serpents, scorpions, and over all the power of the enemy. Revelation 12 and Luke 10 are related. Today the church has overcome Satan already. In the eyes of the church Satan has already been cast down.</p><h2 class="head2">Satan Being Put under the Lord's Feet</h2><p>Compare Hebrews 1:13, Luke 10:19, Revelation 20:1-2, and Matthew 12:29. On that day the enemy will be made the Lord's footstool. But today the disciples have received authority from the Lord to tread over serpents and scorpions. At the beginning of the millennium, the angel will bind up Satan for a thousand years. But today the church already has the ability to bind Satan.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THOSE WHO HAVE<br />A FORETASTE OF THE KINGDOM</h2><p>These Scriptures show us that the church can possess many things today; it does not have to wait until the future. Hebrews 6:4-5 shows us that the church can taste the heavenly gift, the good word of God, and the powers of the age to come. May the Lord open our eyes to see the position of the church, the riches of the church, the authority of the church, and everything that the church has obtained as a foretaste in this age. "The age to come" in Hebrews 6 can be realized today as a foretaste. In the coming age, that is, the kingdom age, there will be many kinds of powers. At that time Christ will reign as king, Satan will be bound, and the church will be victorious. Yet today, the church can have a foretaste of the powers of the coming age. The feast is in the dining room, but in the kitchen we can have a foretaste of the food. In the coming age we will be in the dining room; today we are in the kitchen.</p><p>From this we see that a Christian is one who lives in the realm of the kingdom. Today we should stand on kingdom ground and execute our "extra-territorial right." This is what it means to be a real Christian. We should live in the kingdom today. A diver who dives deep into the sea cannot withstand the water pressure around him. This is why he has to put on a diving suit and be supplied with air that comes from above the surface of the water. We can say that he lives in the sea on the one hand and that he lives above the surface of the water on the other hand. Today Christians should be those who live on earth yet who draw their power from heaven.</p><p>Many have read Colossians 1:13 and realize that the Lord has saved us from the authority of darkness. But their understanding of their transfer into the kingdom of His Beloved is only doctrinal; they do not have much real experience of it. However, the kingdom should be an experience for today. We do not have to wait for the kingdom age to come before we can have the kingdom experience. Even before the kingdom age comes, we can have a foretaste of the kingdom. The Chinese have an idiomatic expression: "Commanding the lords through manipulating the king." The words commanding and manipulating are precious. Today, Christians are commanding the world by exercising the kingdom influence.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRAYER OF THE CHURCH<br />AND TASTING THE POWERS OF THE AGE TO COME</h2><p>In Matthew 12:28 the Lord said, "But if I, by the Spirit of God, cast out the demons, then the kingdom of God has come upon you." In this verse we see that the kingdom is both in the future as well as now. The Lord also said in John 14:12, "He who believes into Me, the works which I do he shall do also; and greater than these he shall do because I am going to the Father." The greater work here can only be accomplished through the prayer of the whole church. No one can deal with the warfare of this world. Yet the church can exercise the authority that it has received from the Lord to deal with and rule over the things of the world, because God is well-pleased to give the church the kingdom (Luke 12:32). Hence, Christians should have a foretaste of this authority and should exercise this authority.</p><p>In the prayer meeting the church should not only have the pitch of peace, but also the pitch of war. When I was in London, I asked Brother Sparks, "What is the most difficult thing to do in the prayer meeting?" He said, "The most difficult thing for the church to do at the prayer meeting is to maintain a war-pitch." Christians today must be spiritual warriors to bring in the kingdom. This is the most important aspect in our foretaste of the powers of the age to come.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED SEVENTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">OBSESSION AND LIGHT</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Psa. 36:9; Isa. 5:20; 50:10-11; Matt. 5:37; 2 Thes. 2:10b-12</h1><h2 class="head1">OBSESSION IN THE BELIEVERS</h2><p>It is possible for believers to be obsessed, and it is pitiful when believers are obsessed. An obsessed person falls into abnormal conditions. Let us consider the following examples.</p><h2 class="head2">Obsession with Words</h2><p>Some are obsessed with their words. They say something, yet they become convinced that they have not said it, or they may never have said something, yet they believe they have said it. Others may not have said anything, but the obsessed ones believe that they have. They are not just lying; they are obsessed. In the beginning they may have been lying. But after they have lied repeatedly, their lying becomes a habit and they become obsessed. Being obsessed in this way is the result of deceiving others with lies to the extent that the liar himself becomes convinced that what he says is true.</p><h2 class="head2">Obsession with Facts</h2><p>A man may become obsessed with facts. Being obsessed with facts means a person does something, yet thinks he has not done it. In addition, others may not have done something, yet he thinks they have done it.</p><h2 class="head2">Obsession with Feelings</h2><p>When a man is obsessed with his feelings, he will feel that something is there when it is not. For example, a person may fear something, yet there is really not that much to be afraid of. Yet once he develops a fear of this thing, it becomes dreadful to him. He can be given many reasons why he should not be afraid, yet he is still fearful. People can be obsessed not only with evil things but also with good things.</p><h2 class="head2">Obsession with Discernment<br />between Right and Wrong</h2><p>Some people are so obsessed that they will take evil for good, good for evil, darkness for light, light for darkness, bitterness for sweetness, or sweetness for bitterness (Isa. 5:20). They may be clearly wrong, yet they think they are right. Some Christians have sinned, yet they do not see their sins. On the contrary, they think they are very good. This is obsession. Some may be obsessed with the sense of guilt, thinking they have committed unpardonable sins. They have not committed such sins, yet they are convinced they have committed such sins.</p><h2 class="head1">DELIVERANCE FROM OBSESSION&mdash;<br />SEEING LIGHT IN THE LIGHT</h2><p>It is a sad thing to be obsessed. God's children should do everything to avoid being obsessed. An obsessed person cannot see the true nature of things. We have to consider how one can discern the true nature of things and avoid becoming obsessed. Compare Psalm 36:9 with Isaiah 50:11. We can see the great difference between the words, "In Your light we see light," and, "Behold, all of you who kindle a fire,/Who surround yourselves with firebrands...." God's light enables man to see light, but the light that comes from man's firebrands is useless; it cannot give him light. The light that comes from man's firebrands originates from his own considerations and thoughts and is totally worthless. Isaiah 50:11 says that those who kindle a fire and surround themselves will lie down in torment. Spiritual darkness can never be removed by human firebrands. What we really need is God's light. Only God's light will give us true spiritual sight. Examining ourselves or engaging in introspection are acts that rely on human firebrands; they cannot render us any light.</p><p>Psalm 36:9b says, "In Your light we see light." This tells us that a man can only see real light and realize the true nature of things through God's light. The first occurrence of the word "light" in this verse means the enlightening light, and the second occurrence of "light" means the true nature of things. The first "light" refers to the light that comes from God's enlightening, and the second "light" is the facts that one sees, that is, the facts that are revealed under God's enlightening. A believer must live in God's light before he can have sight. Only those who live in God's light will see light, and only those who live in His light can discern the true nature of things. Those who do not know the power of sunlight will search around with a torchlight. But once a man sees the power and radiance of sunlight, he will drop his torchlight. Once we realize that God is light, we will live in His light, and there will be no more need for human firebrands.</p><p>God can deliver a sinful man from his sins, but He cannot do anything with a man who lives in darkness and who is blind. We have to say to the Lord, "I want to be delivered from self-assurance, pride, and self-confidence. Be merciful to me, and shine Your light on me so that I see light." In order to see God's light, we must be meek and not trust in ourselves. Stubbornness, selfishness, and self-centeredness can accomplish nothing except shutting out God's light. We have to ask the Lord to deliver us daily so that we can live in God's light and discern the true nature of things. May the Lord deliver us from falsehood and obsession.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED EIGHTEEN</h1><h1 class="title">POSSESSION, OBSESSION, AND<br />THE LIGHT OF GOD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 6:9-10; John 3:19-21; Matt. 6:21-23; Psa. 36:9; Prov. 23:23; 2 Thes. 2:10b-12; Acts 7:60b; 9:1-2; Phil. 3:6a; 1 John 1:8</h1><h2 class="head1">POSSESSION, OBSESSION, AND LIES</h2><p>When a person is possessed, he falls directly into Satan's hand and is controlled and bound by Satan. When a person is obsessed, he is deceived by himself. First John 1:8 says that those who say that they have not sinned are deceiving themselves; they are obsessed. Lying is different from being obsessed. Those who lie are condemned in their conscience, but those who are obsessed are very confident in themselves. They are convinced that they are not lying when they really are. They do not know that they are lying. A man who is obsessed takes his perception of reality as reality and considers his reality to be absolutely right. Second Thessalonians 2:10-12 speaks of the perishing ones who do not receive a love of the truth but instead believe lies. This is very sad. When a Christian overestimates himself, he follows the lies of his mind. Unless these lies are removed, he will fall into obsession sooner or later.</p><h2 class="head1">OBSESSION BEING TO DWELL IN DARKNESS</h2><p>In the past some people considered taking our way but eventually decided to take a different way. The reason they changed their mind is that they became convinced of their view concerning certain things. They thought it over and over, and in the end, they concluded that their views were absolutely correct. At that point no one could help them anymore. These ones have fallen into darkness. They do not see the true nature of things. One brother thought that it was right to have a concubine. I exhorted him and tried to help him. Later, I learned that this brother was not trying to deceive me. If he had been trying to deceive me, it would have been easier to help him. He was deceiving himself. He would not give up his own view. It is very difficult to render help to this kind of person. The condition that leads to obsession is dwelling in darkness. The Jews rejected the Lord. They thought that their rejection was very reasonable, but their reasonings were not based on the facts. As a consequence, the Lord repeatedly said that they were living in darkness.</p><p>One can be obsessed not only in words but also in the mind. Lying and obsession are essentially the same in content, but when one lies, the conscience condemns it as sin even as one tries to deceive others. With obsession, the mind tells one that he is not sinning, and the person believes that he has no sin. Philippians 3 tells us that Paul was once obsessed. He was delivered from his obsession by the light. All obsessed persons bear one characteristic&mdash;they are always very confident of themselves. Even though they have sinned, they do not admit it. Malachi 1 speaks of the Israelites sinning against God many times, yet they kept saying, "How have we despised Your name?...How have we defiled You?" (vv. 6-7). This is obsession. It is falling into darkness. The Gospel of John has many examples of obsession. The Jews' rejection of the Lord in 5:38 was not contrived; they were obsessed. Other examples of obsession are in John 6:41-42, 52, 60; 7:28, 47; 8:24, 43-45.</p><h2 class="head1">DELIVERANCE FROM OBSESSION</h2><p>The way to be delivered from obsession is found in Psalm 36:9: "In Your light we see light." "Your light" refers to God's light, and "we see light" refers to our seeing the true nature of things through the shining of God's light. Many people like to judge according to their mind, ideas, imagination, and conjecture. Such views are often contrary to facts. The most pitiful men are those who presume that they are right, who are very confident of themselves, and who are good at arguing with others. Actually, everything they talk about is wrong. Everything they argue for is wrong. We should come before the Lord in fear and trembling and come under His shining. If we do this, we will not become obsessed in the Lord's service and will not act like Paul before his conversion.</p><h2 class="head1">THE PRINCIPLE, HINDRANCES,<br />AND CONDITIONS FOR BEING ENLIGHTENED</h2><p>One principle of enlightenment is that light shines through an opening. The Lord said that the light is in us in Matthew 6:23. This inner light is the enlightening of the Holy Spirit within. Yet there can be hindrances to this inner enlightening. What hinders a person from receiving light? John 3:19-20 indicates that a man will not receive light once he is prejudiced and has preconceived ideas. Hence, the first hindrance to light is prejudice and a refusal to come to the light. The deeper a person is in the truth, the less assurance he should have of himself. A person who is prejudiced and who does not want to come under the light is dangerous. The second hindrance to receiving light from the Lord is one's desire to receive glory from men. There are certain conditions one has to clearly fulfill before he can receive light. The first condition is having a heart that seeks after God's will. If one seeks after God's will, he will know the true nature of things (John 7:17). However, even such a heart cannot always guarantee that we will not be deceived. Therefore, we have to ask the Lord for mercy so that He would put in us a heart that genuinely seeks after His will. Proverbs says that in order to receive the truth, we have to pay a price (23:23). Lies do not involve any price; they are cheap. If we want the truth, we have to pay a price. This is the second condition for receiving light. May the Lord be merciful to us so that we will have a heart that seeks after God's will and will pay the price to gain the truth.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED NINETEEN</h1><h1 class="title">THE SYMPTOMS OF OBSESSION AND CAUSES FOR OBSESSION</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:18a; 2 Cor. 10:3-5; John 3:19-21; 7:17; 5:19, 40-43; 2 Thes. 2:10-11; Obad. 3; 1 John 1:8</h1><p>Darkness is something general, while light is something very definite. We cannot lock out darkness, but we can consciously allow light to come in. Foolishness, uncertainty, doubt, and confusion are the normal state of man's mind. Before we were saved, we did not see salvation, and when others preached the gospel, we tried to argue with them. After we were saved, we became ashamed of the way we opposed others. It is easy to be confused, but it is hard to make people clear about salvation. Worldly people think that they are wise most of the time and rarely foolish. Actually, the truth is the opposite&mdash;those who have no knowledge of salvation are rarely wise and foolish most of the time.</p><h2 class="head1">THE SYMPTOMS OF OBSESSION</h2><p>The main characteristic of obsession is self-deception. It is easy to deal with those who deceive others, but it is not easy to deal with those who deceive themselves. A man is self-deceived when his thoughts are darkened by Satan; he thinks that he is clever and that everything he does is right. Because of his own pride, he turns more and more to his own decisions until he subconsciously becomes fully obsessed. It is possible for any believer to become obsessed. Once a person becomes careless and deviates a little, he is obsessed. Lies and fabricated testimonies are highways to obsession.</p><p>We all should be careful with our words. Some believers are not accurate with their words; they often exaggerate, inflate, overstate, and add things at random. Eventually, they believe their own fabricated words. These ones are obsessed with their words! Others can be obsessed by indulging in self-love. They may not be sick physically, yet they always feel uncomfortable. They pamper their own bodies and indulge in self-pity or self-love. When their heart beats a little faster, they think they are having a heart attack. When they cough a little, they think they have tuberculosis. They are obsessed with sickness.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CAUSES FOR OBSESSION</h2><p>John 3:19 says, "And this is the condemnation, that the light has come into the world, and men loved the darkness rather than the light, for their works were evil." One cause for obsession is a love of darkness rather than light. I know of a brother who does not pray with his natural voice; he prays with an unnatural tone of voice. This is a kind of obsession. An obsessed person is proud and self-deceiving. Obadiah 3 says, "The arrogance of your heart has beguiled you.../Who says in his heart,/Who will bring me down to the ground?" One characteristic of obsession is arrogance, pride, and self-deception. Hence, arrogance, pride, and self-deception can also become causes for obsession. Only a humble person can remove the arrogance that is in him.</p><p>Mr. Hoste once met a theological professor in his travels who refused to accept the truth of baptism. This is a kind of obsession. Another cause for obsession is the rejection of the truth.</p><p>Before we accepted the Lord, we considered ourselves to be wonderful persons. After we believed in the Lord, we no longer considered ourselves in this way because God's light has entered into us. The same should be true with all spiritual matters. We need light, and we must never be presumptuous. When we were saved, we had many questions. Yet when God's light shined in us, all of our questions disappeared. In our spiritual pursuit many questions may arise, and we still need God's light to shine on us. It is not right for a Christian to be in darkness constantly, saying that he does not know or that he is not clear. We have the light of life within us, but we need His light to enlighten us all the time so that we will not fall into self-deception or obsession. May the Lord deliver us from falsehood and all forms of self-deception.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY</h1><h1 class="title">A PROPER PERSON IN GOD'S WORD</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Gen. 49:18; John 12:27-28; Rom. 1:25; 9:5; 11:33-36; Eph. 1:2-3; 3:21; 6:23-24</h1><p>All Scripture is God-breathed, but not all of the words in it are spoken by God. Some are spoken by Satan, some are spoken by men, and some are spoken by men possessed with demons. The Lord said, "Out of the abundance of the heart the mouth speaks" (Matt. 12:34). The Lord did not say that out of the abundance of the heart the hand acts. This shows that the mouth expresses what is in man's heart. Man's words express his true inward condition. The verses listed above show us the kind of people who are qualified to speak for the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">THOSE QUALIFIED TO SPEAK FOR THE LORD</h2><h2 class="head2">Jacob&mdash;a Man Matured in Life</h2><p>Jacob did not have a good start. But by the time he was in Egypt in his old age, he had changed. He was the first man in the Old Testament to utter a complete discourse in prophecy (Gen. 49:1-28). He could do this because God had wrought Himself into him and he was matured in life. In his prophecy in Genesis 49, he spoke about the future of the twelve tribes. In the prophetic discourse, only one sentence was not prophetic: verse 18. In this verse he spoke about himself. While he was speaking about the future darkness and sins of his sons, he interjected the words, "I have waited for thy salvation, O Lord." These words show us the kind of person he was and the kind of heart he had. Previously, Jacob had been a calculating person. He calculated his blessing, his wages, and his flock. He even outdid his uncle, Laban, in calculation. But in his old age Jacob was no longer calculating. He only waited for the Lord's salvation concerning his sons. Jacob had matured. His words proved that he was a matured man. Such a matured man was qualified to speak for the Lord.</p><h2 class="head2">The Lord Jesus&mdash;<br />a Man Who Passed through the Dealing<br />of the Cross and Who Was Pliable</h2><p>The Lord's prayer in John 12 shows the kind of person the Lord Jesus is. In verse 27 He said, "Now is my soul troubled; and what shall I say?" The disciples had heard His messages and witnessed His acts, but it was difficult to sense His inner being. This verse, however, reveals that the Lord was pliable. He was dealt with by the cross. He was not stubborn. He never insisted that God grant Him what He asked for or thought was right. If I had been praying then, I would not have dared to use the same words. The Lord was debating with Himself: "What shall I say? My soul is troubled, and I do not know what to say." He prayed for the Father to save Him from that hour, but He had come for that hour. This was an impossible request. The time had come. What should He do? He said, "Father, glorify Your name." Then a voice came out of heaven and said, "I have both glorified it and will glorify it again" (v. 28). When most men speak, they expose the uglier part of their character. But it was different with the Lord. He was very pliable. He did not insist and was not stubborn. Rather, He fully obeyed the Father's will.</p><h2 class="head2">Paul&mdash;a Man Who Worshipped God</h2><p>In his Epistles, Paul often was not speaking God's word but his own. Yet his words were also inspired by God. This shows the kind of person Paul was. In some passages in Romans and Ephesians, Paul interjected a word of worship in the midst of his speaking for the Lord. The first part of Romans 1 may not strike us as unusual. But at the end of verse 25, Paul suddenly exclaimed a word of worship, "Who is blessed forever. Amen." Verse 26 should have immediately followed the word "Creator" in verse 25. When Paul came to this point, he realized that men were not worshipping the Creator. He wanted to declare that he worshipped Him, and he hastily added his word. Paul paused, worshipped God, and then went on with his speaking. This shows us that there is a human element even in God's Word.</p><p>Romans 9 has another interesting passage. Verses 4 and 5 speak of Christ and His relationship to the nation of Israel. At the end of verse 5, another word of worship is interjected: "Who is over all, God blessed forever. Amen." The main subject of this passage is not Christ but the people of Israel. The first part of verse 5 should have been followed immediately by verse 6, but a word of praise is inserted. From this we see that Paul was a person who worshipped God. His worship was not just in a worship meeting or a meeting of praise. In the middle of his speaking, Paul worshipped God. He was qualified to speak God's Word because he knew how to worship God.</p><p>The same thing occurs at the end of chapter eleven, where Paul spoke of God's mercy for men. Verse 32 should have been followed immediately by chapter twelve, but Paul inserted a word of worship from verses 33 to 36. From these passages we see Paul's character. He feared God and exalted God; he was a man taught by God.</p><p>This also occurs in chapters one, three, and six of Ephesians. After speaking for some time, Paul inserted a word of worship. He was indeed a good worshipper; he worshipped God everywhere and anywhere. I am not saying that we must insert words of worship into our sermons. If you do this as a kind of performance, others will detect it; it will not be spontaneous or spiritual. Instead, it will be artificial and unnatural. We must be people who are full of worship before we can utter words that are full of worship.</p><p>Sooner or later a man's true nature will be exposed. Sometimes we may pretend, but others can always see through our pretense. If a man sits up straight in his chair and does not slant back, you should not assume that he is a diligent and responsible person. Some people are very impatient, yet they act in a patient way. But this acting is easily exposed. Even their pretended patience will expose their impatience. If a man does not have endurance, it does not matter how much he acts; he will still be intolerant. Some people seem to be hasty outwardly, but they are actually not hasty at all but are quite patient inwardly. If you are a man of worship, you will worship at the critical moment, and you will utter words of worship like Paul.</p><p>Paul was also a person who blessed others. He often began his Epistles with a word of blessing. "Without any dispute the lesser is blessed by the greater" (Heb. 7:7). A mark of spiritual maturity is the ability to bless others. A mature person is one who can always bless others. When we are young, we receive blessings from others. When we are mature, we bless others.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT WHAT IS SAID,<br />BUT THE PERSON WHO SAYS IT</h2><p>Today men are concerned only with the right words. They try their best to come up with clever words and to be scriptural. But the words they speak do not convey the persons they are. This is the shallow way to release God's word. It is not a matter of what you preach but a matter of who you are. It is not a matter of the doctrine but a matter of the person. This is today's problem. In the Old Testament we read of an ass opening its mouth to speak to the prophet. The ass might have uttered human words, but it was still an ass. Many people think that they can speak as long as their doctrine is sound. No, the whole issue is not whether a person can speak but what kind of person the speaker is. Once you open your mouth, a spiritual man will detect whether or not you are a "Galilean" because your accent and tone will speak loudly of your person; you cannot hide. The kind of person you are determines the kind of words you speak; it is useless to pretend. One can tell right away whether a Fukienese is speaking Mandarin or a Cantonese is speaking Mandarin. If a man from Hsing-Hua or Amoy speaks the Foochow dialect, any Foochow native can tell right away that the speaker is not from Foochow. The accent will identify to the listener that the speaker is a native from Hsing-Hua. When a man speaks for the Lord, his spirit and heart flow out. When a stubborn  person opens up his mouth, nothing but stubbornness will flow out. When a proud person opens his mouth, only pride will come out.</p><h2 class="head1">DIGESTING AND BEING MINGLED WITH GOD'S WORD</h2><p>We must not only hear the Word and convey the Word but also live the Word. Of all the persons in the Bible, the two who touch me the most are Moses in Deuteronomy (Old Testament) and Paul in 2 Corinthians (New Testament). These two books convey a clear portrait of these two persons. Moses was not a cruel person who coldly passed on the law to men; he was meeker than all the men who were on the face of the earth (Num. 12:3). Only Deuteronomy gives us a picture of such a person. Deuteronomy is the result of a man digesting God's word and then reiterating it to others.</p><p>Prayer: Lord, deliver us from our self-confidence and self- contentment. May we learn to live in fear and trembling and in Your light. May we reach maturity and know how to bow down and worship You all the days of our life, in the name of the Lord, amen.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-ONE</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S TWO FIRM FOUNDATIONS</h1><h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 2 Tim. 2:19-21</h1><p>The verses above show us that the Lord never changes and the things He accomplishes also never change. Everything around us is changing, but there are two things which do not change. First, the Lord knows those who are His. Second, those who name the name of the Lord should depart from unrighteousness. These two things are the firm foundations of God, and these foundations have been firmly established.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD KNOWS THOSE WHO ARE HIS</h2><p>Second Timothy 2:19 says, "However the firm foundation of God stands, having this seal...." A seal signifies that a decision has been reached, that a matter is settled a certain way, and that there will be no further change. Hymenaeus and Philetus could misaim concerning the truth, and Alexander the coppersmith could persecute Paul, and even all who were in Asia could leave the apostle, but the Lord knows those who are His. Some in the church may have departed from the way of truth, and you may be discouraged, thinking that man is always untrustworthy and that you no longer know who to trust. Brothers and sisters, I can be wrong, the church can be wrong, and everything that everyone else does can be wrong, but please remember that the Lord can never be wrong. When we preach the gospel we bring people to the Lord; they are regenerated and are baptized. But these saved ones can depart from the truth. When this happens we may become very discouraged and may want to quit. But at such times we should realize that the Lord cannot be wrong. Even if ten, a hundred, a thousand, or more people leave, God's Word still holds true&mdash;His firm foundation stands. God knows those who are His. We should not blame others for failing or for being wrong. We should only put the blame on ourselves. We should not criticize others for their unfaithfulness or error. We have to believe that the Lord alone knows those who are His.</p><h2 class="head1">EVERYONE WHO NAMES THE NAME OF THE LORD<br />DEPARTING FROM UNRIGHTEOUSNESS</h2><p>Those who are the Lord's are surely apart from unrighteousness. But how do we depart from unrighteousness? Second Timothy 2:20-21 is an explanation of the second half of verse 19. Verses 20-21 say, "But in a great house there are not only gold and silver vessels but also wooden and earthen; and some are unto honor, and some unto dishonor. If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor, sanctified, useful to the master, prepared unto every good work." These verses speak of a great house, not a small house. God cares for the matter of honor and dishonor, not the matter of usefulness. God wants to know which vessels are honorable, not which vessels are more useful. God is for value; He is not for utility. He cares for quality, not for quantity. Man has the misconception that God likes useful vessels. But God cares more for quality than for utility.</p><p>In an ordinary household, vessels of wood and earth are more important than vessels of gold and silver. A family can be without vessels of gold and silver, but it cannot be without vessels of wood and earth. However, we are not talking about the usefulness of the vessels, nor the size of the vessels, but the value of them. Most people think that as long as a vessel is useful, God is pleased with it. But this is a wrong concept. What is important is the value of a vessel and its worth in the hand of the Lord. Five ounces of gold may be worth as much as five hundred tables, but these things are vastly different. God is not concerned for the quantity; He cares for the value of a thing in His hand. How different is God's view from ours!</p><h2 class="head1">VESSELS UNTO HONOR AND VESSELS UNTO DISHONOR</h2><p>First Corinthians mentions wood, grass, stubble. These are cheap and worthless materials. The works of some people are cheap&mdash;their service is cheap, their meeting is cheap, the testimony they bear and the truth they speak are all cheap. With these people everything is worthless and dishonorable. With others everything is honorable. They are willing to pay the price. They have been dealt with by the Lord for three, five, or ten years, and their testimony is something that is from the heart and the result of God's work in them. What they speak and testify are honorable. Those who are naturally wise may speak eloquently and give wonderful stories and excellent speeches, but what they say comes from their mind and not from their heart; therefore, it is cheap.</p><p>The question today is not whether you can preach, but whether your preaching comes from having paid a price. The question today is whether the things you say are honorable. If they are not things of honor, what you speak and what you have will not be honorable in the sight of God or man. If what you have has not yet passed through the blood, the tears, the divine discipline, and the dealings of God, it is impossible for it to be honorable. Words that are copied and imitated from others can never be honorable. Both Balaam and Isaiah spoke about the kingdom and both prophesied. But the worth of the two men's words cannot be compared. Many people are satisfied as long as they can speak the same thing as others do. In reality speaking the same thing does not mean much. The words may be the same, but it makes a great deal of difference whose mouth the words come from. The only words that are noble and honorable are the words that have been paid for with a price.</p><p>After I was saved, I became interested in the subject of the Lord's coming. In the beginning I studied Daniel. Later, I studied Revelation. I studied them day and night, even at bedtime and mealtime. Later, I met Miss Barber, and in the course of our conversation, I found out that her attitude towards the Lord's coming was different from mine. One day while we were fellowshipping, she showed me some verses about the Lord's coming and the end time. After she finished reading those verses to me, she asked whether I understood them. At that time I did not appreciate what she was doing. I felt that I knew more than she did. Within me there were two thoughts. I felt that I was more familiar with the Scriptures concerning the Lord's coming than she was. She took a long time to find the verses, but I could memorize the verses. However, I also felt that the Lord's coming did not produce the same effect on me that it did on Miss Barber. Her whole living was filled with the thought of the Lord's second coming. The difference between these two realizations of the truth concerning the Lord's second coming was that one was honorable and the other was dishonorable.</p><h2 class="head1">THE ISSUE BEING THE PERSON HIMSELF</h2><p>When I was in England, I met many people who opposed Mr. Sparks. One day I invited a brother to hear Mr. Sparks' preaching. Later, I asked the man what he felt about it, and he said, "Nothing special. I can speak what he spoke." He thought that he could speak what Brother Sparks had spoken. He thought that it was merely a matter of the words spoken. But in the spiritual realm, it is not merely a matter of words but a matter of the person who speaks the words. It is not a matter of whether you can say the same words but a matter of whether you are the right person. Subjects such as head covering and baptism often lead to arguments. Actually, they do not deserve any argument at all. The real issue is whether or not we are in the reality of the truth that we are speaking about, whether we are the right person or whether we only retain these truths in knowledge.</p><p>A vessel of gold is golden in nature. This signifies that its nature is heavenly. A vessel of silver is silver in nature. It refers to Christ's redemption on the cross. Wooden and earthen vessels signify those with the human and earthly nature. How can we be a vessel unto honor? What is a vessel unto dishonor? Trusting in human eloquence, wisdom, ability, and knowledge and touching spiritual things with human strength are things of dishonor. Once I read The Spirit of Christ by Andrew Murray, in which he said that some read the Bible and try to understand it with their own wisdom, while others read the Bible by waiting on the teaching of the Holy Spirit; some read the Bible to find out what they want to know, while others read to find out what the Spirit wants to teach them. When I read those words, I felt like a knife was cutting through my heart. I was enlightened and realized that my reading of the Word was according to human energy and human wisdom. I had spent considerable time and energy to read the Bible front to back and back to front many times, hoping that I would understand it through my repeated reading. But this was absolutely an exercise of human energy, wisdom, understanding, and perception. I realized that I was wrong, and I knelt down to pray to the Lord, saying, "Lord, from now on, I will not know anything that You do not want me to know. I will not try to know anything purposely. I am willing to drop my thirst for knowledge, and I will not try to understand the Bible in haste any longer." Before that time, I had a different attitude toward the Word. When I came across something I did not understand, I would feel unhappy and uncomfortable. I could not let go of it, and I insisted on understanding everything thoroughly and completely. I was afraid that if I did not understand something I would be put to shame if others asked me about it. I have since discovered that every spiritual matter is cheap if it originates from ourselves. Only that which originates from God is honorable.</p><p>Because of man's fall, anything that man has in himself that has not passed through the cross is dishonorable. A thing of honor is weighty, and a thing of dishonor is light; this is all a matter of paying a price. This is like price tags for merchandise&mdash;the things which are valuable have high price tags, while the things which are worth little have low price tags. Some people have a good mental capacity; they can remember others' sermons, repeat them, or even say more. But unless their message is acquired through paying a price, it is of little weight in the eyes of God.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S EXHORTATION</h2><p>In verse 21 the Lord says, "If therefore anyone cleanses himself from these, he will be a vessel unto honor." The Lord wants us to reject everything cheap. He wants everything that is in us to go through the cross. What we preach must first touch us before it will touch others. We have to strive to cleanse ourselves from things of dishonor. Wood can never replace gold, and earth can never replace silver. At the same time we have to be those who are willing to pay the price to take God's dealings. If we do, we will be clean and honorable vessels and fit for the Master's use.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-TWO</h1><h1 class="title">WINE MINGLED WITH GALL</h1><h1 class="scripture">Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Matt. 5:39-41, 44; 27:33-35; Luke 23:33-34; Acts 7:54-60; Rom. 12:14, 20; 1 Cor. 4:8-16; 11:16-29</h1><p>Before the Lord was crucified on the cross and the soldiers divided his garments, He was scourged before the Jews and Gentiles and judged by the rulers. Then He took up the cross  and went to Golgotha to suffer punishment, and the executioners nailed Him to the cross. At this point two things occurred. The first was recorded in Matthew 27:34: "They gave Him wine to drink, mingled with gall. And when He tasted it, He would not drink." The second was recorded in Luke 23:34, where the Lord prayed, "Father, forgive them, for they do not know what they are doing."</p><h2 class="head1">THE FUNCTION OF WINE MINGLED WITH GALL</h2><p>What is the purpose of wine mingled with gall? Crucifixion is very painful, and the law allowed soldiers to give wine mingled with gall to the crucified man in order to relieve some of the pain of crucifixion. It functioned like the anesthetics we have today. Others would take it, but our Lord Jesus would not drink it. Human crosses have wine mingled with gall, because with human crosses there is always the sense of pain.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LORD'S CROSS BEING<br />WITHOUT WINE MINGLED WITH GALL</h2><p>The cross of Christ shows us that if there is the cross there is no need of wine mingled with gall and that if there is wine mingled with gall there is no cross. These two things cannot exist together. The Lord's cross did not have any wine mingled with gall, and there was no need for it. It was not used, but not because it was unavailable. It was available and indeed very convenient. If one used it, he would be relieved of some of his pain. It was not used, but not because it was useless; it was not used because He refused it. Why did the Lord reject it? It was rejected because even though the cross could generate much feeling in others, it could not produce any feeling in Christ. (This, of course, does not refer to His physical feelings.) If there is a genuine bearing of the cross, there should not be any feeling or reaction. If there is any feeling or reaction, it means that it is only an act of a martyr, not a genuine bearing of the cross.</p><h2 class="head1">"MARTYRDOM" AND THE BEARING OF THE CROSS</h2><p>Today there are many Christian "martyrs," but there are very few cross-bearing Christians. Many people go through this and that kind of suffering. Although they do not say anything, their faces tell others that they are suffering. It would be better for these Christians not to suffer at all! The kind of cross they are bearing is a cross of wine mingled with gall.</p><p>When the Lord was crucified, He refused the wine mingled with gall. Luke tells us that He prayed for those who crucified Him and asked the Father to forgive them. This is the cross that has no wine mingled with gall. The Lord suffered all kinds of pain on the cross, but He did not feel mistreated. He did not murmur in His heart, saying, "Look at you people! You are too evil! Do you know that one day I will judge you for these things?" The cross the Lord went to was a cross without wine mingled with gall. Wine mingled with gall may not be a complete anesthetic, but those who are conscious of their own suffering have the need to drink of it.</p><p>My burden is not to expound the Bible here. There are many Christians today who are telling others by their words and attitude that they are "martyrs"; they give no impression that they are rejecting the wine mingled with gall. They may have been rebuked by their wives at home. They may have received a cold shoulder in return for hard work at the office. They may have been mistreated in the church and by the brothers and sisters. Their faces tell others that they are martyrs. If a person is truly bearing the cross, there is no feeling of pain. Those who need wine mingled with gall are saying that they are suffering in heart. But a true bearer of the cross has no need of wine mingled with gall.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S TESTIMONY</h2><p>You may find this hard to understand. Let me try to state it another way. Matthew 5 contains many precious teachings, but how many Christians in the church are practicing them? When I was young, I was once a class-leader at school. I was good at my studies, and none of my classmates were my equal. After I became a Christian, six classmates came to test me. They wanted to find out whether I practiced the teaching of Matthew 5. It was relatively easy not to retaliate when I was slapped. But it was difficult to turn my left cheek after the right cheek was slapped. When I was slapped that day, I could not maintain my Christian composure any longer. I wished in my heart that the great white throne would come quickly. After they left, I was happy that I had not hit back. But when I went to the Lord in my prayer, I could only confess my sins. I realized that there was bitterness within me. The outward suffering may be the same, but whether or not there is bitterness within makes a big difference.</p><h2 class="head1">THE STORY OF GOILS</h2><p>There once was a brother in the Middle Ages by the name of Goils. He was a good brother, and he worked as a cook in a monastery. Every time there was a conference in the monastery, men would come from many places, and he would prepare beef, lamb, chicken, duck, and vegetables for them for ten days. The monastery was situated on a mountain, and it was not an easy task to prepare so much food and carry all the foodstuffs to the monastery. He wanted to listen in on the conference, and he was unwilling to lose the opportunity to listen to the sermons and just cook for the others. The more he considered, the more he could not sleep at night. Eventually, the Lord shone His light on him and showed him that the cross is a matter of giving and not receiving and that everything was under God's sovereign arrangement. He realized his own mistake and repented. After he repented, he realized that the abbott's voice had become hoarse. He felt sorry for the abbott and prepared some special porridge for him when he came back from his work at midnight. Here is a man who was bearing the cross. He turned his left cheek to the others. Eventually, he became a blessing to many people through his knowledge of God.</p><h2 class="head1">THERE BEING NO HATRED, MURMURING,<br />AND SELF-PITYING WITH THE CROSS</h2><p>If turning the left cheek to others was merely a matter of performance, even unbelievers could do it. The issue is not about being slapped on the cheek, going the extra mile, or yielding the cloak; rather, it is about the ability to love from within and to be free from hatred.</p><p>What is the cross? The cross is the place where hatred disappears. There can only be love, not hatred. This is why there is no murmuring with the cross. Christ prayed for those who persecuted Him because there was no hatred in Him; there was only love. This is why He refused the wine mingled with gall.</p><p>Do we see many Christians suffering today? Surely we do. I have seen many suffering wives, suffering fathers, suffering sons, etc. But I have also noticed the difference in their expressions. Some do not say anything at the time of suffering (this is the most common case), yet behind one's back they murmur a great deal. If we find ourselves murmuring after something is over, it means that there is a feeling of suffering. The only reason we would need wine mingled with gall would be because we do not know what the cross is. Another group of people do not murmur or make any noise, yet they weep. There may be blood on the cross, but there should be no tears on the cross. A person weeps because he pities himself. There was no self-pitying on the Lord's cross; there was only pity toward others. Francis Havergal was a person plagued with sickness, but he often said, "Everyone pities me because of my sicknesses. Yet I never pity myself, because Christ has borne all my sicknesses."</p><h2 class="head1">ON THE CROSS AND BENEATH THE CROSS</h2><p>Only those who are beneath the cross weep. Those who are on the cross do not weep. If a man feels that he is wounded, he is not on the cross. As soon as some people suffer a little, they feel that they are being martyred. But this is not the cross. What is the cross? The Lord said, "If I be lifted up from the earth..." (John 12:32). Every one who is crucified is one who is lifted up. A crucified person is one who is on top. If you feel that you have been taken advantage of, that you have been slighted, you are a downtrodden one. If you are truly crucified on the cross, you will not feel wounded. The minute you feel wounded, you are not on the cross. The genuine cross only leads to silent prayers in the heart; there is no murmuring and no self-pitying. As long as there is the feeling of suffering, there is the need of wine mingled with gall.</p><p>The first thing we notice about Christ on the cross is that there was no murmuring. If one encounters certain circumstances and feels pain, it proves that he does not have the cross. Wherever there is the feeling of pain, there is wine mingled with gall. Do not think that a smiling face indicates that people are bearing the cross. Of course, neither does this mean that a weeping face indicates that people are not bearing the cross. A person who is genuinely bearing the cross has no feeling of suffering whatsoever.</p><h2 class="head1">THERE BEING PRAYER, BLESSING, AND LOVE<br />ON THE CROSS</h2><p>The Lord's word on the cross was a prayer for His enemies. He loved His enemies. After Paul and Silas were scourged, they were thrown into prison and their feet were secured in the stocks. They were in much tribulation, but they did not take wine mingled with gall. They did not murmur against others, and they did not pity themselves. Their prayer and singing were genuine. When Paul saw the jailer drawing his sword to kill himself, he shouted, "Do no harm to yourself." This proves that he loved the jailer.</p><p>Some people first tell long stories about their suffering and then pray. Such prayer does nothing except pour cold water over our heads. Some wives come to tell me how badly their husbands have treated them, and how they have endured. However, I am afraid that such endurance has arrogance mixed in with it. It is a good thing to be joyful and to love, but if the joy is artificial, we should condemn it.</p><p>There were two Christians who were sisters in the flesh. One day the older one offended the younger one. The younger one kept her mouth shut, but she would sing every time the older one passed by. Her singing was saying, in effect, "See! You are defeated. You have offended me, but I do not take this to heart. I am victorious...." She did this to make the older one feel bad. This is the Pharisee's prayer&mdash;praying in an unnatural way and taking revenge by pretending to be happy.</p><p>What is the cross? Simply put, if I am one who bears the cross, there should not be any feeling of suffering in me. It is not something performed but something spontaneous. The prayer of Paul and Silas and the cry of Stephen all showed that they were men without need of wine mingled with gall.</p><p>The real bearing of the cross is not in any outward act, such as turning the left cheek, yielding the cloak, or walking the extra mile, but in the heart. Today many Christians are performing these three outward things, but the cross is not there. Bearing the cross is inwardly refusing wine mingled with gall. There is no jealousy, vexation, or revenge. Instead, there is genuine prayer, blessing, and love.</p><p>Paul put it well in Romans 12: "But if your enemy is hungry, feed him; if he is thirsty, give him a drink; for in doing this you will heap coals of fire upon his head" (v. 20). The spontaneous love that flows from you will heap a fire upon others. Pretentious love will not burn anyone.</p><p>In order to understand Paul, you have to read his Epistles to the Corinthians. Today there are some Christians who are like the Corinthians. If Paul praised them, they would say that Paul was taking them by guile. If Paul spoke a frank word to them, they would say that Paul was persecuting them. Under such circumstances, it is extremely difficult for anyone to say anything for himself. This is why Paul said, "I speak...as if in foolishness....I speak in foolishness" (2 Cor. 11:17, 21). "Who is weak, and I am not weak? Who is stumbled, and I myself do not burn?" (v. 29). Although many criticized Paul, he was not concerned. His mouth was still open to them, and his heart was enlarged (6:11).</p><h2 class="head1">ONLY THE CROSS THAT CHRIST BEARS FOR US<br />IS THE CROSS</h2><p>Those who need wine mingled with gall are exercising pity on themselves. They can easily be provoked, and they scorn others by pretending to be happy. They are not actually bearing any cross. In reality, if we are bearing the cross, our cross is not a cross. Only the cross that Christ bears for us is the cross. When trouble comes and things bother us, the only way to avoid a total physical and mental collapse is to give the burden to the spirit&mdash;turning it over to the spirit&mdash;because our body and nervous system cannot bear it without feeling its effects. The cross is really very good for our nerves and our health. If it is not the cross, however, it is a studied course of action. The love that is rooted within, that originates from the cross, is a love that is mingled with Christ's love and flows into others. This love surmounts everything. There are many Christians who find it difficult to be Christians because it is all an outward practice, a striving to follow the outward principles of Christianity outwardly. This compulsion of oneself invariably leads to a breakdown.</p><p>It would be cruel of God to only give us Matthew 5 if He did not also give us the cross. When we know that it is no longer we who live but Christ and that we live by the faith of the Son of God in us, we find that there are no repercussions because He receives the blows, not us. We are dead and our life is hid with Christ in God. We escape it all&mdash;His right hand upholds us so that we do not collapse, and in the spirit we are carried through in Him.</p><p>Without a deep knowledge of the cross, trials and sufferings only bring reaction and collapse. But when the cross operates, there is only love. There are many things, in fact most things, that we can experience only in a limited way, but not love. This and only this can be fully experienced now. God has given all His love to us in His Son&mdash;we have seen the proof of this on the cross, and we have all of His love.</p><p>Being crucified and being wounded are two different things. When you are crucified, you have no wound. When you are wounded, you have not been crucified. I hate the feeling of a "martyr"&mdash;many have this feeling because they do not know the cross. They know tears, but they do not know bleeding. They are always seeking sympathy and pity for themselves on the plane of self-pity, not on the high plane of being seated in the heavenlies, reigning, and being able to forgive largely, freely, and regally like a king. You are great spiritually if people can crucify you but not wound you. Suffering and being wounded are one thing, but being crucified is another thing.</p><p>We hear people say, "So-and-so has experienced the cross deeply. For years she has borne the cross." But this is not true if there have been many tears; she only has the feeling of a martyr. Really knowing the cross is dying a kingly death like Stephen, quietly with perfect control, committing his spirit to God and praying for forgiveness for his slayers. We cannot pity him; we can only respect and honor him and worship the Lord. Those who truly bear the cross do not pity themselves; they do not need or want the pity of others. We look to the Lord to lead us into more knowledge of the cross.</p><p>Prayer: Our Lord, we come before Your presence to ask for Your forgiveness. How easy it is for us to be wounded or to boast or murmur in our suffering. May You cause us to love from the bottom of our hearts and to forgive without any pretense so that we may experience spiritual reality in our family life as well as in all of our circumstances.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ONE HUNDRED TWENTY-THREE</h1><h1 class="title">GOD'S INHERITANCE&mdash;<br />THE RICHES OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class="scripture">Place: Unrecorded<br />Scripture Reading: Gal. 2:20; 3:26&mdash;4:1a, 6-7, 28, 31; 5:1; John 15:4a; Rom. 6:5-7, 11; Eph. 2:4-6; Phil. 1:21a; 1 Cor. 1:30</h1><p>Prayer: Lord, under Your light we feel ashamed, because even though we are surrounded by riches, we are living in poverty. Although there is living water all around, we are still thirsty. Show us the riches that are found in Christ, and that we are made to partake of these riches through the grace of God. It is not our faith, but Your selection that counts. It is not of our will, our consecration, or our obedience, but fully Your free provision, grace, and mercy. You are the One who sowed, and You are the One who gathers. Lord, open our eyes to see the riches of Christ. In the name of the Lord, amen.</p><h2 class="head1">ISAAC AND THE CHURCH</h2><p>The book of Galatians shows us that the principle of the believer's living is being an Isaac, one who inherits. Isaac entered into glory, and Christians will also enter into glory. Just as Isaac was begotten through promise, Christians are also children through promise, and just as Isaac became an heir, Christians are also made heirs of God.</p><p>Romans speaks of sinners receiving grace, whereas Galatians speaks of sinners not remaining in the same place but going on in grace after receiving grace. Romans speaks of initial grace, while Galatians speaks of ongoing and sustaining grace. The apostle said that having begun by the Spirit, one should not be perfected by the flesh (3:3). The matter is not what we are going to do or what we are going to give to God. Grace is not our striving to be good or changing for the better. Grace is our looking to the Lord's mercy. It is not a matter of what we should do but a matter of looking to His grace. Isaac was an heir, not an initiator. The same is true with Christians today.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD'S INHERITANCE&mdash;THE WORK OF CHRIST</h2><p>The New Testament shows us two parts in the work of Christ. First, we are in Christ, and second, Christ is in us. One is a union in Christ, and the other is a union in us. Historically, first we are in Christ and then Christ is in us. This is why the Lord said in John, "He who abides in Me and I in him..." (15:5). Our abiding in Christ includes all the facts related to our being in Christ, while Christ's abiding in us is related to the life of Christ. When a Christian abides in Christ, he touches all the facts related to being in Christ. When Christ abides in a Christian, he touches Christ as his life. Being in Christ involves the inheritance of all that Christ has accomplished in the past. Christ's being in us involves our receiving of all that Christ is and has today. When we are in Christ, everything that Christ has accomplished from the past to the present becomes our enjoyment. When Christ is in us, everything that Christ will accomplish between now and the future becomes ours.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRISTIANS IN CHRIST</h2><p>For a Christian to be in Christ means that God has put him in a new position; he now has a new beginning. "The Christian in Christ" is something that spans from the past to the present; whereas, "Christ in the Christian" is something that spans from today to the future. The former was accomplished once for all in Christ, and the latter continues from here until eternity. The Bible says, "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus" (1 Cor. 1:30). This means that God has delivered us out of the old man, the self, the world, and Satan into Christ.</p><p>Romans 1 through 4 tells us that man is wrong in his conduct, while Romans 5 through 8 tells us that man is wrong in himself. A man's conduct is wrong because his person is wrong. This is why man has to die. If we are crucified with Christ, we believe that we will live and ascend with Christ. By the law of the Spirit of life, we will live in the spirit. Only crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension can terminate the old things. But how can we be crucified, raised, and ascended? We do not have to die, resurrect, or ascend by ourselves. This is the work of God. He has joined us to Christ. "But of Him you are in Christ Jesus." This is one of the most precious verses in the Bible. We have to realize how important this is.</p><p>Suppose you put a banknote in the hymnal. If the hymnal is thrown into the fire, the banknote will be burned as well. If you mail the hymnal to England, the banknote will go to England as well, because the banknote has been joined to the hymnal. The same principle applies in our crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension with the Lord. Our natural self, whether good or evil, meek or rash, patient or impatient is crucified in Christ; it is terminated. Now we are resurrected in Him and in the new creation. Therefore, we do not need to look at what we were or are outside of Christ.</p><h2 class="head2">Brother Nee's Testimony&mdash;<br />a Revelation of Crucifixion with Christ</h2><p>In 1927 I was in the upper room in Wen-teh Lane, and the Lord showed me that my crucifixion with Christ was an accomplished fact. Before that time I acknowledged the teaching of our crucifixion with Christ as much as anyone else. I could say as much as anyone else about the reason for our crucifixion with Christ. I could preach as well as anyone else concerning the doctrine of our union with the cross. I cannot deny that I had some experience of crucifixion, but there were problems within me. I saw that there were still many hindrances within. I tried hard to deal with them, but I could not say that I was dead; I was not there yet. I spent four months asking the Lord to show me that I was crucified with Him and to bring me into such a crucifixion. Daily I received some light, but the light was not strong enough. I studied the Bible diligently, and every time I came across the words, "I am crucified with Christ," I repeated them to myself. But I still could not believe them. It was impossible for me to believe them. I prayed every day, and I dropped all my work and tried to deal with this one thing. One day I woke up, and between 8:00 and 10:00 in the morning while I was in prayer, I suddenly saw that my death in Christ was something joined to Christ, in the same way that the banknote is joined to the hymnal. My eyes were opened, and these words came to my mind: "There is only one, not two." It was impossible for Christ to die without my dying as well. Has Christ died? Indeed He has! What about me? Immediately I jumped out of my chair and said, "Hallelujah! I have died also!" Just as Christ has died, I have died. Christ is not any more dead than I am, nor is His death any surer than my death. What God has done in Christ He has done in me. Christ has died; therefore, I have also died. Christ resurrected; therefore, I have also resurrected. Christ has ascended; therefore, I have also ascended. I ran down the stairs and met a brother. Grabbing him, I said, "Don't you know that I am dead?" He was bewildered. I said, "Don't you know that Christ is dead?" He said, "I do." I told him, "Just as He died, I have also died." From that day on, I have never denied what I have seen. This is the inheritance we have in Christ. It is not by struggling or striving that we inherit all these things. We must be those who are in Christ before we can share our inheritance with Christ. Some people have made the cross a teaching. But to others, it is a vision and a revelation. Everything God has done has been done in Christ, not in us. When we are in Christ, all these things become ours.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST IN CHRISTIANS</h2><p>"Christ in the Christian" has to do with what is about to come; it has nothing to do with the past. It has to do with the present and the future. Christ is in us, not for the purpose of dealing with problems, but for the purpose of imparting the power of life to us. When we are in Christ, we enjoy His work and His experience. When Christ is in us, we enjoy His life and Himself.</p><p>Christ is in the believers to live for them and within them. This is the believers' inheritance. Christ does not live in the believers so that they can learn to be like Christ, imitate Him, copy Him, or take Him as their pattern. He is not living in the believers so that they will slowly advance and gradually attain after five or ten years. Paul preached Christ crucified and resurrected, not the believers crucified and resurrected. Believers do not live merely by the power of Christ; rather, Christ lives within the believers by becoming their life.</p><h2 class="head1">THE LAW OF LIFE</h2><p>God has given Christ to the believers to be their life. There is no need for believers to help God by exercising their will, because this fact is a law. Life has its law, and this law is spontaneous; it is not something that one has to work out. The law of the Spirit of life is a natural law. Anything that is unnatural, that comes by struggling, striving, or laboring is not the result of taking Christ as life.</p><p>It is not enough to merely know life. We must know the law of life. A law is something that never changes. Circumstance, experience, and feelings all change, but a law never changes. The law of gravity is the same for everything everywhere; it does not change with time or place. We do not have to worry whether the law of gravity will function; it operates spontaneously. As long as we live according to the law of the Spirit of life, power will come spontaneously. The secret to the Christian life is not to invoke the life of Christ but to allow the life of Christ to invoke us. When we are faced with a problem, all we have to do is say to the Lord, "I cannot do it, but Your life within me can." We do not have to exert extra energy to do anything or believe in anything. This life spontaneously expresses itself. This is God's inheritance for us. God's inheritance is just Christ.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST AS ALL</h2><p>The wisdom, righteousness, sanctification, and redemption spoken of in 1 Corinthians 1:30 are not things but a person. These things all point to a person&mdash;Christ. A Christian is different from a worldly or religious person. A Christian is a person in whom Christ operates; he is a person in whom Christ lives and on whose behalf Christ lives. Those in the world have to struggle using their own energy, but all that a Christian needs is a little faith. The Lord is within us, and He is our sanctification, righteousness, humility, and patience. Christ is everything to the Christian.</p><p>Many people emphasize faith, but their kind of faith is often nothing but a kind of work. Many people pay attention to obedience, but the obedience they talk about is nothing but work. These human endeavors are not the result of Christ's operation within man. On the one hand, we must see that we are in Christ and that all of Christ's past experiences are ours. On the other hand, Christ is in us to be our life and to live for us. All we have to do is believe in a simple way&mdash;this is what Isaac represents. This is enjoyment, and this is inheriting God's inheritance. Thank God that it is of God that we are in Christ and Christ is in us.</p></body></html>
