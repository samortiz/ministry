Before being perfected, they were not able; but they are made able through the perfecting of the gifted persons. All the able members can do the work of the New Testament ministry, which is to build up the Body of Christ. For example, through the summer school for the young people, many have been perfected to do the work of the New Testament ministry. My speaking of these messages also is a perfecting that enables the saints to build up the Body of Christ directly.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1.

This will cause us to be no longer babes tossed by waves and carried about by every wind of teaching in the sleight of men, in craftiness with a view to the satanic system of error (Eph. 4:13-14).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_057.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_059.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Economy and Dispensing of God &nbsp; pg 58</div><br></body></html>
