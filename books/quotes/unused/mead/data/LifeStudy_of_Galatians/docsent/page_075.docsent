   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. Not Letting the Stumbling Block of the Cross</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Be Done Away</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In 5:11 Paul says, But I, brothers, if I still preach circumcision, why am I still being persecuted?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Then has the stumbling block of the cross been done away.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Circumcision foreshadowed the dealing with man s flesh; the cross is the reality of this dealing Col 2:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Judaizers endeavored to bring the Galatians back to the shadow; the Apostle Paul struggled to keep them in the reality.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Circumcision is a type of the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In typology, circumcision typifies the cutting off of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The true cutting off of the flesh is accomplished by the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Therefore, the cross is the fulfillment and the reality of the type of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Nevertheless, the Judaizers insisted on continuing the practice of circumcision, even though Christ had been crucified on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Because the Judaizers insisted on circumcision and opposed the cross, they persecuted those, like Paul, who preached the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Paul taught that circumcision was a type, a shadow, fulfilled in the cross of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Since Christ has been crucified, there is no longer any need for the practice of circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to 5:11, Paul would not preach circumcision and thereby allow the stumbling block of the cross to be done away.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even by the time the book of Galatians was written, between A.D. 55 and 58, the cross of Christ had already become a stumbling block.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Some did not dare to believe in the cross or to talk about it.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was due to the influence of Judaism, where circumcision was of great importance.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Judaizers belittled the cross and exalted circumcision.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To them, the cross of Christ was a stumbling block, and those who preached the word of the cross deserved to be persecuted.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, verse 11 helps us to realize the situation when Paul wrote to the Galatians.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>E. Letting the Troubling and Upsetting Ones</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Bear the Judgment and Cut Themselves Off</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In verses 10 and 12 Paul has some strong words concerning those who were troubling the Galatian believers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In verse 10 he says that he who troubles you shall bear the judgment, whoever he may be.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This word is virtually the equivalent of a curse.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Paul was saying that those who troubled the saints in Galatia would be cursed.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Paul used the word cursed in chapter one, where he says that anyone who preaches a gospel besides that which the Galatians received should be accursed 1:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Here Paul says that the one who troubles the Galatians will be judged, condemned, whoever he may be.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 5:12 Paul utters a very strong word: I would that those who upset you would even cut themselves off.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Apostle Paul wished that the Judaizers who upset the Galatians by insisting on circumcision would cut off not only their foreskin but even themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Their upsetting, disturbing self needed to be amputated.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The fact that Paul wanted those who upset the Galatian believers to cut themselves off indicates that he regarded them as flesh that needed to be cut.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul was saying, Those who are disturbing you should not simply cut off a piece of flesh from their bodies they should cut themselves off.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the eyes of God, the whole being of such ones is under condemnation and worthy to be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Judaizers must have been angered by such a word, angered enough to put Paul to death.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How bold Paul was to utter such a word concerning them, treating them as flesh!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When Paul was bold, he was really bold.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Here we see his boldness in speaking of the Judaizers as flesh needing to be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>NOT TURNING FREEDOM</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>INTO AN OCCASION FOR THE FLESH</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In 5:13 Paul says, For you were called to freedom, brothers; only do not turn the freedom into an occasion for the flesh, but through love serve one another as slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Paul s writing is not like an unturned cake Hosea 7:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Rather, he is balanced and even, first considering one side of a matter, then the other side.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our tendency, however, is to be an unturned cake, with one side raw and the other side overdone.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In giving messages we may easily produce unturned cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But as Paul wrote the book of Galatians, he turned the cake again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He could be strong, then affectionate; rebuking, then mild.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We see Paul s balance in the matter of freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>On the one hand, Paul tells us that we were called to freedom; on the other hand, he warns us not to use this freedom for an occasion for the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>While Paul encouraged the believers to enjoy their freedom in Christ, he was also concerned that they might misuse or abuse this freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>If we over-indulge ourselves in our freedom, then we turn it into an occasion for the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Although we are free, we still need to be limited in the exercise of our freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Freedom without limitation always results in the indulgence of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, we need to be balanced, to be free, yet restricted.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we are limited in the use of our freedom, we shall love others and through love serve them as slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When Paul wrote the book of Galatians, he had a number of thoughts within him.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He realized that the Galatian believers who had been distracted might return to their freedom and then begin to misuse it.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>They might have the attitude that since they are no longer under any kind of yoke, they are free to do what they please.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Such an attitude damages the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Therefore, Paul charged the Galatians not to misuse their freedom.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Yes, they had been called to freedom, but they should not turn it into an indulgence.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>On the one hand, they were free from the yoke of slavery, from the law, but, on the other hand, they should still care for others and serve them in love.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When some saints, especially young believers, hear a message on freedom, they have the tendency to cast off restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>They may have the attitude that, since they are free, no longer do they need to regard the word of the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>This is to turn freedom into an occasion for the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Instead of doing this, we should be limited in the use of freedom and be willing to serve one another as slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As Paul says in 5:14, The whole law is fulfilled in one word, in this, You shall love your neighbor as yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In the verses we have covered in this message, Paul admonishes us to have a proper walk in the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>He indicates that we need to be balanced and not be unturned cakes.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In giving messages, we should cover both sides of a matter.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We need to care for ourselves and also for others.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We may enjoy the freedom we have and yet still be restricted in love for the sake of others that the church life may go on in a good way.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Furthermore, we must learn not to be otherwise minded.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Then we shall have a proper walk in the church life.</S>
