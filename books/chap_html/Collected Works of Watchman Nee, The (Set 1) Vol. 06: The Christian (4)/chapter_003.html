<H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THREE</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE SUFFERING OF THE CROSS</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>Issue No. 5</H2><P>Whenever the Holy Spirit touches me to consider how the Lord Jesus Christ died for me, a sinner, so that I could be free from the punishment of sin and have eternal life, I thank Him with tears for His grace. What suffering my Lord endured on the cross! "O my Lord, how piteous You were to die on lonely Calvary for my sins!"</P><P>The Lord Jesus was the God of glory in heaven. He was the Most Holy One. He did not have to die, and He could not die. But He had compassion for the sinners of the world. He came into this sinful world and took the form of a man. He stood in the position of a sinner and suffered the punishment which sinners deserve. He died so that we may have life. What love is this! Sins were committed by us, the sinners. Evils were done by us, the evil doers. But the punishment of sin, the suffering of hell, fell on the Lord Jesus Christ! What is this? This is substitution, this is love, and this is grace. O sinners, do you know that your sin has crucified the lovely Lord Jesus? I wish that you knew this and that through the love of the Lord Jesus, you would right now be moved to believe in this kind Savior.</P><P>When the Lord Jesus was incarnated into the world, He was born in a manger because there was no room for Him in the inn. How desolate and sad this is! But even today many people have no room for Christ in their hearts. The Bible records that after He was born, they wrapped Him in swaddling clothes and laid Him in a manger. How cold were the swaddling clothes! How hard was the manger! Is this the portion an honorable guest from heaven deserves from the hand of the world? As the Most High Lord, He did not have to come into such a situation. Since He loved you and me, He bore the suffering of this birth. Alas! Our sins afflicted Him.</P><P>He lived on this earth for over thirty years, without coming out from under the shadow of the cross for even a day. He had no settled home or the luxury of a settled meal. Day by day He had no rest, but He was leading the world to believe in His coming death and to have the eternal blessing. While He lived on earth, nothing could refresh His heart. Although His disciples gave Him brief moments of joy, their doubt and ignorance and the world's unbelief and opposition, continually caused Him groaning and heartbreak. He realized that the world was hardened in its heart and could not be turned back. The result was His weeping over Jerusalem. He wept not only for that sinful city, but also for the rebellious hearts of today. O Lord, You became such a One because of my sin! If You did not love me, why did You suffer so many offenses from sinners? While the foxes had holes and the birds of the air had nests, the Son of Man, who loved us, had no place to lay His head! Why did He put Himself into such a situation? He did so only because He loved us. The sins we committed caused Him to suffer all this. In order to save us, He suffered hunger and cold, bearing insults and shame. For our sake He was often hungry and thirsty, traveling everywhere, and eventually dying on the cross. Oh, how great is this grace! Pitiful Savior! How detestable are my sins! You are truly my Savior! I am willing to believe in You.</P><P>Although Christ's sufferings on earth were hard to bear, they were relatively easy compared to His suffering on the cross, where He bore our sins for us. His suffering in His daily life was a foreshadowing of Calvary. He came, not to live, but to die. He came to die for us, that we might live. O sinners, you must realize that if it were not for your sins, the Lord Jesus would not have had to die, and He would not have died. What a pity that we are sinners. He came to die for us. Hard-hearted sinners, will you receive the Lord Jesus as your Savior? He has died for you. Why would you ignore Him?</P><P>Remember the night He was in Gethsemane. The night weather was very cold. Many people sat and warmed themselves at the fire (Mark 14:54). During such a cold night, your Savior was outside in the garden, praying earnestly. Even "His sweat became like great drops of blood falling down upon the ground" (Luke 22:44). What kind of scene is this? Do not laugh, and do not relax! Do not be indifferent, and do not be stubborn! Christ was this way because of your sins and because of my sins. It was as if God had begun putting our sins on Him already in the garden. The shadow of the cross came over Christ completely at that time. He was full of sorrow and pain, and in agony His sweat became like drops of blood. Oh, how I wish that you would know the suffering of sweating drops like blood! It was as if He saw, at that moment, all the sin and evil of the world, the awesomeness of God's wrath, and Himself in the midst of them both. This was a foreshadowing of His bearing man's sin and God's wrath. Because of this He suffered such pain. Yet these were merely shadows of His coming crucifixion. But even while they were shadows, Lord, Your suffering was great.</P><P>Look! His captors came! He could have asked the Father to send twelve legions of angels to rescue Him, yet for the sake of saving us, He was willing to be arrested and have His hands bound. The Old Testament records that the angel of the Lord smote over one hundred thousand Assyrians (Isa. 37:36). One legion totals over six thousand. Surely twelve legions of angels is a large number! The power of twelve legions of angels would be great! On that day they could have easily slaughtered all the people of Jerusalem! But because He wanted to be our Savior, He bore the insults and was willing to be taken in order to die such a death. Was God taken away by man? Yes, because He wanted to save man. The God of heaven wanted to save the world, so He was willing to be taken like a thief by man! All of this was because of your sin and mine!</P><P>Behold, the Son of God taken away by man! First, He was taken to the high priest, Annas. There our Savior was struck by the hand of an ignorant servant! Why did He suffer such an offense from sinners? Because He wanted to save us from perdition and give us eternal life! Our sins afflicted Him!</P>
