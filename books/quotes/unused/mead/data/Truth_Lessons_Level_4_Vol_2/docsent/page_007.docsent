   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Receiving the Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God promised to bless Abraham v. 2 . This blessing consists of the blessings of God s creation and redemption, including all that God wants to give man God Himself and all that He has in this age and in the age to come.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to Galatians 3:14 this blessing is the promise of the Spirit: That the blessing of Abraham might come to the Gentiles in Christ Jesus, that we might receive the promise of the Spirit through faith.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Since the Spirit is God Himself, this means that God promised that He would give Himself to Abraham as the blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>C. Being Made a Blessing</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>to All the Families of the Earth</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God not only promised that He would be a blessing to Abraham but that Abraham would be a blessing to all the families, all the nations, of the earth Gen 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In His calling, God turned from Adam to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This means that He gave up the adamic race.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, in His promise God made another turn from Abraham to all the families of the adamic race through Christ, the seed of Abraham Gal 3:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hence, the adamic race can be gained by God again.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God not only gave Himself to Abraham as a blessing, but He also made Abraham a blessing to all the pitiful people of the adamic race.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this way, all the called ones from among the Gentiles have been brought back to God and have gained God as their blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Galatians 3, God s promise to Abraham in Genesis 12:2-3 was His preaching the gospel to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The three items of God s promise were to make Abraham a great nation, to bless him, and to make him a blessing to all the families of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The contents of God s promise are exactly the same as the contents of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First, the preaching of the gospel opens with the words, Repent, for the kingdom of the heavens has drawn near Matt 3:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The kingdom of the heavens refers to the great nation promised by God to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Second, after a person repents for the kingdom, he needs to believe so that he may have eternal life, which is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The blessing promised to Abraham in Galatians 3:14 is the promise of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The third item of God s promise to Abraham is this blessing.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God said, In you all the families of the earth will be blessed Gen 12:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>God promised to make Abraham a great nation and to bless him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The nation is a matter of dominion to represent God, and the blessing is a matter of image in the Spirit to express God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Hence, in God s promise we see His eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God s promise to Abraham implies His eternal purpose, which is for man to express and represent Him 1:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>D. Bringing Forth Isaac</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Genesis 17:15-21 contains a definite promise concerning Isaac s birth.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is definite because the name Isaac was mentioned by God, and his mother was designated.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Up until this point God had promised that He would give Abraham a seed and that Abraham would bring forth the seed, but God had not mentioned that the seed would be out of Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Neither had He said that the seed would be named Isaac.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In these verses, however, God promised in a definite way that the seed would be Isaac and that Isaac would be born of Sarah.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>E. Gaining the Land That God Promised</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God promised to give Abraham the land 15:18-21; 12:7; 13:14-15, 17; 17:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Abraham needed a place to live in and to live on.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Hence, the land was a place for God s people to live in and to live on.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The land was also a place in which Abraham could defeat all his enemies so that God could have a kingdom on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Moreover, the land was the place where God could have a habitation for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Thus, there are five points concerning the land: it was a place for God s people to live, a place to provide for their living, a place where God s enemies could be defeated, a place where God could have His kingdom, and a place where God could have a habitation for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Eventually, the kingdom of God was established, the temple was built for God s habitation, and the glory of God was manifested in the land.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>F. His Seed Being Multiplied</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>like the Stars of the Heavens and</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>like the Sand on the Seashore</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In Genesis 22:17 God blessed Abraham with the multiplied seed, saying, I will surely bless you and will greatly multiply your seed like the stars of the heavens and like the sand which is on the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God blessed Abraham with two categories of people, one likened to the stars of the heavens 15:5 and the other to the sand on the seashore, which is also likened to the dust of the earth 13:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to this prophecy, Abraham s descendants are of two categories, one heavenly and the other earthly.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We, the Christians, are the stars, the heavenly descendants of Abraham, and the genuine Jews, God s earthly people, are the sand, the dust.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The sea signifies the world corrupted by Satan, and the dust is of the earth created by God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Although the Jews are an earthly people, they are not the dust under the sea, but the dust, the sand, on the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They are separated from the corrupted sea, Satan s corrupted world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, the stars are not only separated from the corrupted world but are also heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God s promise to multiply Abraham s descendants is sown as a seed in Genesis 22.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This seed, having passed through the development of the whole Bible, will eventually be harvested at the end of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The New Jerusalem is composed of the twelve tribes of Israel, representing the Old Testament saints, and of the twelve apostles, representing the New Testament believers.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The people represented by the apostles are the heavenly stars, and those represented by the twelve tribes are the sand on the seashore.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These two peoples will eventually be built together into the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, the New Jerusalem will be the ultimate consummation of Abraham s seed.</S>
