Needing to Submit to His Authority</h2>
<p>The basic principle is that the Lord is the unique source of everything. An apostle is one who is sent by the Lord to do a work. Since he is sent by the Lord to do a work, he surely has received authority from the Lord. This authority is the apostolic authority. Hence, if we are under a person&rsquo;s work, accept his work, and receive benefit from his work, we must submit to the authority that he has been given to carry out the work. To submit to and accept the authority of a work is equivalent to recognizing the one entrusted with the work as an apostle.</p>
<p>If we think that an apostle has to be someone extraordinary, it will be very difficult to recognize anyone as an apostle. We must be delivered from this wrong concept and simply see that an apostle is one who is sent by the Lord to work for Him. Since the Lord has sent him to work, he must have received authority from the Lord. If this is our view, it will be easy for us to understand the matter of apostleship. The one from whom we receive the work of God is the one who has authority. To acknowledge his authority is to acknowledge that he is an apostle.</p>
<p>The problem today is that people will receive a work but not the authority of the one carrying out the work. This is neither according to the teaching of the Bible nor according to the order arranged by God. The Bible is full of order, and God always does things in an orderly way. We cannot receive our parents and reject their authority, nor can we receive our teachers and reject their authority. It is impossible to do so. An apostle may say that to a certain group of people he is not an authority, not an apostle, yet surely he is an apostle to certain ones because they were the result of his work. This corresponds to the example of the apostle Paul. To the church in Jerusalem or even to the church in Antioch, Paul may not have been considered an apostle, yet surely he was an apostle to the church in Corinth. If Paul were not an apostle, how did the Corinthians become believers?</p>
<p>For a church to be three-dimensional and strong, the saints must receive the authority of the apostle in the same way that they receive his work. Receiving an apostle&rsquo;s work yet denying God&rsquo;s authority in him is abnormal. Such a church will have absolutely no way to be strengthened or built up. It will surely be flat, not three-dimensional. For a church to be three-dimensional and strong, all the saints must receive the authority of the apostle in the same way they receive his work. In this way, they will become an apostle&rsquo;s living letter of commendation.</p>
<p>In 2 Corinthians 3:2-3 Paul said, &ldquo;You are our letter, inscribed in our hearts, known and read by all men, since you are being manifested that you are a letter of Christ ministered by us, inscribed not with ink but with the Spirit of the living God; not in tablets of stone but in tablets of hearts of flesh.&rdquo; This means that the Corinthians were Paul&rsquo;s living letter of commendation. In one sense, it was the Holy Spirit who wrote through Paul, yet in another sense, it was Paul who wrote through the Holy Spirit. The content of Paul&rsquo;s letter was Christ. Paul inscribed Christ in the hearts of the Corinthians; hence, they became Paul&rsquo;s living letter of commendation. If a person has written such a living letter of commendation, he must be an apostle.</p>
<p>From this we see that the question concerning apostleship must be resolved not from without but from within. It is much easier to prove this matter inwardly. Although someone is not an apostle who has been commanded by God to do a work or been sent by God, he may claim and pretend to be an apostle. For instance, someone may go to labor in a certain city, but God may not have measured out to him a portion in the work there. God did not send him there or entrust him with the work in that city, yet he may claim to be an apostle to that city. For this reason we need to learn to discern the source of authority in the church. Even though a mother may be young, to the children born of her she is still a mother. This is a big test to those serving the Lord.</p>
<p>If we say that we are apostles, is it because we have a high opinion of ourselves and want to assume a position to rule over others, or is it because the Lord has sent us and given us the authority to do the work that He desires us to do? If we love to be first among the brothers and desire to rule over others, we are false apostles. However, if God has truly sent us and commissioned us, we are apostles. We are apostles and have authority only when we have God&rsquo;s commission.</p>
<p>The saints in the churches need to ask themselves regarding what they have received. A church cannot receive a work but reject the authority of the work. When a church receives a work, it has to receive the authority of the work. Once a church receives the authority of the work, those in the church must acknowledge that the person commissioned to carry out the work is an apostle. Once the saints are clear regarding who is an apostle and what are work and authority, they will be clear regarding the offices. Once the matter of apostles is made clear, the matter of elders and deacons will spontaneously be made clear.</p>
<p>Since the church has the authority of the Head, it is three-dimensional, not flat. In the local churches authority is not centralized. In Acts and the Epistles the churches of the Jews did not have authority over the churches of the Gentiles, nor did the churches of the Gentiles have authority over the churches of the Jews. The church in Antioch did not control the church in Jerusalem, nor did the church in Jerusalem control the church in Antioch. The church in Ephesus was mentioned first among the seven churches in Asia (Rev. 1:11), but it did not have authority to control other churches. In the Bible there is not such a thing as a centralized authority among the churches; rather, all the local churches are directly under the authority of the Head. All the apostles are also directly under the authority of the Head.</p>
<p>If we are sent by the Lord to a certain place to participate in the work, we should not be proud or overly humble. Rather, we should have a deep consciousness that the Head has sent us and that the presence, the authority, of the Head is with us. There is no rank among the apostles. There are no superior apostles in the church. There is only the authority from the Head. Nevertheless, Timothy, Titus, Silas, and Silvanus labored under the apostle Paul because he perfected them. The places where they worked were places where Paul had worked. They were under Paul&rsquo;s leadership and carried out the same work (1 Tim. 1:2-3; Titus 1:4-5; Acts 15:40; 1 Thes. 1:1). However, we cannot say that Paul was under Peter or that Peter was under Paul. They were both directly appointed by the Lord to work in two different regions&mdash;the Jewish region and the Gentile region. Neither had any rank in relation to the other. If they had possessed rank in relation to one another, the result would have been a system of hierarchy as seen in the Roman Catholic Church.</p>
<p>In the way arranged by God, He will not let His authority suffer loss, and He will not allow human hands to act freely in His work. In other words, God desires that His authority be acknowledged in the church, and He prohibits men from acting freely. In God&rsquo;s work, if a person does not have a commission directly from the Head, he will lose the authority that comes directly from the Lord.</p>
<p>Although apostleship is a position, the position is not permanent. When a person is not commissioned by the Lord for a work, he does not have apostolic authority. This requires an apostle to always live in the Lord&rsquo;s commission. On the side of an apostle, the Lord sends him and commissions his work. On the side of the church, a church cannot receive the work of an apostle but not his authority, both of which are from the Lord. If this were the case, the saints would be without restriction. Even though some people are saved, they do not want to submit to God&rsquo;s authority. On the contrary, if we submit to authority, it will be easy for us to discern in our spirit whether or not a worker has the Lord&rsquo;s authority. When we exercise our spirit, we can easily discern whether a person has authority, that is, whether he submits to the Head and has been commissioned by the Head.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_016.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_018.html">Next</a> </body></html>
