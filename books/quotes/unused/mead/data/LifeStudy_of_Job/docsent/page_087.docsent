   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF JOB MESSAGE TWENTY-EIGHT ELIHU'S TURN TO SPEAK</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>CHAPTERS 32 37 3 ELIHU'S FINAL WORD TO JOB Scripture Reading: Job 36 37</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we will consider chapters thirty-six and thirty-seven, which are Elihu's final word to Job Once again, there was no prayer or exercise of the spirit in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I. ELIHU HAVING MORE TO SAY FOR GOD</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In 36:1-4 Elihu claimed that he had more to say for God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He said, "I will bring my knowledge from afar/And will ascribe righteousness to my Maker./For truly my words are not false;/One perfect in knowledge is with you" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I do not believe that Elihu was speaking for God at all; he was speaking absolutely for himself, making a display of his knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Actually, he had less knowledge than Job and the three friends.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although Elihu said that he ascribed righteousness to God, he in fact ascribed everything to himself, going so far as to refer to himself as "one perfect in knowledge."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>SHOWING JOB THAT GOD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>TAKES CARE OF THE RIGHTEOUS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In verses 5 through 16 Elihu showed Job that God takes care of the righteous and that He allured Job from the jaws of distress into a spacious place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Here Elihu skipped from one subject to another, and it is difficult to know what he was talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Elihu said that God "does not preserve the wicked man alive" v. 6a . This is not true, for many wicked people are still living.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Elihu also said that those who hear God and serve Him "will spend their days in prosperity/And their years in pleasantness" v. 11 . Such a concept is altogether according to the principle of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In verse 16 he went on to say, "Indeed He allures you from the jaws of distress/Into a spacious place, where there is no constraint;/And what is upon your table would be full of fatness."</S>
