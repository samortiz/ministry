   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THIRTY-SIX THE NEW JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>ITS WALL, ITS FOUNDATION,</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>AND ITS STREET Scripture Reading: Rev 21:12a, 14, 17-20, 21b; 22:1-2; 4:3a; Matt 22:30</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In order to enter into the full significance of the divine allegory of the New Jerusalem, we must have a revelation of its wall, its foundation, and its street.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>ITS WALL</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Revelation 21:18a tells us that the wall was built with jasper, signifying the appearance of God 4:3a for His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God sitting on His throne looks like jasper and the entire wall, a great and high wall, is built with jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Also, the first foundation of the wall is jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Jasper, according to Revelation 21:11, is a most precious stone...clear as crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Its color must be dark green, which signifies life in its richness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God s appearance being like jasper means that His very appearance is life in its richness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Jasper is the appearance of God, which will also be the appearance of the holy city, New Jerusalem Rev 21:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The entire city, in appearance, looks the same as God is.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all need to see the wonderful picture portrayed in this city.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The center of the city is God on the throne who appears as jasper and the circumference of the city is its wall which is built with jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This means that the entire city from its center to its circumference is an expression of the very God of life in His richness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Revelation 21:12 tells us that the wall is great and high for separation unto God and for protection of God s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The height of the wall is one hundred forty-four cubits.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>A cubit is approximately eighteen inches, so on that basis the wall would be two hundred sixteen feet high.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Also, Revelation tells us that the wall is twelve thousand stadia long.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Since one stadion is approximately 600 feet, the wall is approximately one thousand three hundred and sixty-four miles long.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is approximately the distance from Los Angeles to Dallas.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>China boasts of its Great Wall, but the Great Wall of China is not as high as the wall of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The wall of the New Jerusalem is at least seven times higher than the great wall of China.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to boast concerning our great wall which is in the book of Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Great Wall of China is built with old bricks but our great wall is built with jasper, and this jasper is clear as crystal Rev 21:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Great Wall of China is opaque, but our great wall is transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>No wall on earth can compare with the wall of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Seven Implications</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>With the wall of the New Jerusalem there are seven implications.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The wall implies transformation, building, the image of God, the expression of God, the testimony of Jesus, separation, and protection.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>A wall always separates a particular piece of space from all the other spaces.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A wall also protects what is in it from all sorts of negative and evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In order to fully understand this allegory of the New Jerusalem we need to get into these seven implications.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We can never exhaust all the significances and all the meaningful and crucial points of this allegory since it is the ultimate consummation and conclusion of the sixty-six divine books of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Transformation</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The foundations of the wall bear the names of the twelve apostles.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Each apostle is signified by a precious stone.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Peter should be the first of the twelve apostles and he was named by the Lord Jesus in a renewing way.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The name Peter means a stone.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>A stone is something created by God but not transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>All the precious stones are transformed entities.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Peter was originally a stone but eventually he became jasper, the first foundation of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The wall itself is jasper and the first foundation of the wall is also jasper.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Peter was merely a stone, but in the New Jerusalem he is a jasper stone, the first layer of the wall s foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This implies transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Paul tells us in 1 Corinthians 3 that he had laid a foundation as a wise master builder and that we believers needed to build upon this foundation with gold, silver, and precious stones vv.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>10-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Our building of the church needs to be not merely with stones but with precious stones.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>These are not natural stones but transformed stones which became precious.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Peter could never forget the Lord s changing of his name, so in his first Epistle he indicated that the Lord was a living stone and that we also as living stones are being built up into a spiritual house 2:4-5 .</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Peter s word implies that once he was dead, but the Lord changed him into a living stone.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a living stone, Peter was always under the transforming work of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Transformation is a metabolic change.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>With such a change, there is always the need of some new element to discharge and replace the old elements.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>From the day the Lord Jesus changed Simon s name to Peter, He was doing His best to add Himself into Peter.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As a result of being under the Lord s transforming work, eventually Peter became jasper, a precious stone, the first layer of the foundation of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The wall is not built with natural materials merely created by God, but the wall is built with transformed items.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We all are God s old creation, but God put us into Christ to make us His new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We all were natural beings, but we have been transformed from the old creation into the new creation in Christ 2 Cor 5:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In the New Jerusalem there will be no Chinese, American, Spanish, Mexican, Japanese, Korean, French, Italian, German or any other culture or race.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>All of us will be fully transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>I believe that even our color will be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In that day we will all be green.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We will all be jasper!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We will be one people in one color green !</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>All the different colors and all the different cultures will be swallowed up by the rich divine life of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>All of us must realize that the church life is a transformed life, a life under transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The church life is not a life of a good, natural life, but the church life must be a transformed life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is why Colossians 3:11 tells us that in the new man there cannot be Greek, Jew, circumcision, uncircumcision, Barbarian, or Scythian, because all of us are under transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We are not practicing the church life according to our natural status, but according to the transformed life.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Transformation is implied in the wall.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the wall of the New Jerusalem there is no piece of natural material.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The entire wall is built with jasper, transformed material.</S>
