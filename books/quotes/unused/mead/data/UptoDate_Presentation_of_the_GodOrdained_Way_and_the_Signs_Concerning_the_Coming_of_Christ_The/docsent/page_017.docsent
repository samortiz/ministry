   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>PROPHESYING FOR GOD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In this message we will cover the fourth step of being a priest of the New Testament, that is, prophesying for God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The preaching of the gospel is for begetting, that is, for regenerating people.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The feeding of the lambs is for nourishing, that is, for cherishing the babes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The perfecting of the saints is for teaching, that is, for instructing people in the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Prophesying for God is for building, that is, for the building up of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Speaking may be considered the greatest ability or skill.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may speak the same word, yet you may speak it in one way and I in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Hence, there needs to be much consideration in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the New Testament, there is one chapter, 1 Corinthians 14, that is altogether concerned with the matter of prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Greek word that is rendered prophesy in this chapter may also be rendered predict.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>However, whichever way we may render it, both prophesying and predicting are not to speak for ourselves but to speak for God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must keep this point firmly in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we prophesy in the church, we speak for God and not for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God is our source; He is the word that we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we prophesy for God, we speak for God, speak forth God, and speak God into people to dispense God to them.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In 1 Corinthians 14 Paul spoke altogether about prophesying.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He highly exalted prophesying and greatly belittled speaking in tongues.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He said, "Greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, that the church may receive building up" 1 Cor 14:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He also said, "But in the church I would rather speak five words with my mind that I might instruct others also, than ten thousand words in a tongue" 1 Cor 14:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>For this reason, he encouraged us again and again to prophesy for God.</S>
