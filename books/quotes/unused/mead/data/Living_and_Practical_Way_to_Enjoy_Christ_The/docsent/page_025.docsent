   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER EIGHT JERUSALEM Scripture Reading: Deut 12:5, 8; Psa 122:1-3, 6; 133:1-3; Rev 21:2; 22:1-2a ONENESS IN TODAY'S JERUSALEM</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The principle with Babylon is division and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The principle with Jerusalem is unity and oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Old Testament reveals that God's intention is always to gather His people together.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>His people were of twelve tribes, living in different places.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But whenever they had a time to worship God in a corporate way, all of them were gathered together into the unique place of God's choice Deut 12:5; Psa 122:1-3 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>That place was not chosen according to their taste, preference, or concept.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It was absolutely of God's choice, and to gather together to worship God there was a very serious matter.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To worship God at a place of their choice was condemned by God Deut 12:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God told His people that they had no choice of a place for a corporate worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The place of God's choice was Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the Israelites had to come together three times a year to Jerusalem to worship God Deut 16:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This was the ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the fulfillment of this type, we all have to come to the ground of unity for the public and corporate worship to God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We have no choice.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We do not have the position to do what we prefer.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We have to take God's choice as our destiny.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We have been destined to take His choice, and His choice is the oneness, the ground of unity.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We may wonder what the fulfillment of Jerusalem is today.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The answer is found in John 4.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In this chapter the Samaritan woman talked to the Lord about the place of worship.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Then the Lord Jesus told her the time is different now.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In other words, the age is changed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before this time, it was the age of the old dispensation, and that was the age of the type.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the age of the type, the proper place of worship was in Jerusalem, a unique geographical place.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But in the fulfillment of the type, in the new dispensation, today's Jerusalem is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Lord Jesus told that Samaritan woman that the proper worship is neither on a certain mountain nor at Jerusalem, but today the worship to God must be in our spirit vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>21, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Our spirit is today's Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We may have a lot of different opinions and dissenting concepts in our mind, but when we turn ourselves from our mind to our spirit, right away we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In our mind we are scattered.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In our spirit we are gathered.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In our mind we have the principle of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in our spirit we have the principle of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When we exercise our mind, we are confused.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The exercise of the mind leads to quarreling and debating and eventually to division with confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When you are in the mind, you are in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must turn ourselves from the mind to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When we get into our spirit, we are one.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then there is no more division or confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Today's Jerusalem is our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is here that we have God's habitation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>It is here that we call upon His precious name.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The Lord's name and His habitation today are in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Get out of your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When you stay in your mind, you have all the dissenting factors.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>You have your concept, and someone else has his concept.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Each one has his taste and his choice.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the tastes and choices are different.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christians today are divided over various doctrinal matters.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some insist on baptism by immersion.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Others like to have sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Some insist on the practice of foot-washing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should not focus on such dividing doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead we must turn to our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the early years of my Christian life, I was not so clear.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When people asked me about immersion or sprinkling, I was ready to tell them what I felt, and I was ready to argue.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>But if you come to me today, I would say, "Brother, forget about your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Turn to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Turn to the spirit and say, O Lord Jesus.'"</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we stay in our mind, that means we still remain in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The fallen human mind is the very sphere of Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You can never be clear about the church by exercising your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The more you exercise your mind to reason, to find out what is wrong and what is right, the more unclear you will be.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The questions in your mind are unending.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If you ask me such questions, I will simply say that you need to turn to your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>You can never be clear about the church when you are still reasoning in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When you say, "O Lord Jesus," and turn to the spirit, right away you are as clear as crystal.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In the spirit you are clear about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Jerusalem, the oneness, the ground of unity, is not in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When you have trouble, do not try to analyze.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Just be so simple and turn to your spirit to call, "O Lord Jesus, O Lord Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christians today are too much in the mind, studying, investigating, and discussing.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The more you investigate and discuss, the more divisions and confusion there will be.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Babylon is division and confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We may think that we are right and that others are wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>But our senses are really not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Our feeling is not so accurate.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Our senses and feeling fluctuate all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>In the morning you may say that something is bad, but in the evening you may say that the same thing is good.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Do not trust in your feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Do not trust in your understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Simply turn to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>You may be very unhappy with certain things in the local church, but if you exercise your spirit to say, "O Lord Jesus, O Lord, Amen, Hallelujah," for fifteen minutes, you will feel happy with everything in the local church.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Whatever the local church does will be wonderful to you.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>What is Babylon?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Babylon is to be dissenting in your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When you are dissenting in your mind, you are in Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>What is Jerusalem?</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Jerusalem is unity with oneness in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>When you get into your spirit, you are really one with me.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If you come to argue with me, you come from Babylon, and you are trying your best to bring me back to Babylon.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We have to see the subtle tactics of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should not analyze things in our mind.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Instead we should turn to our spirit and call on the name of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>When we are in our mind, it is so easy to debate about doctrinal things.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>You have your opinion and interpretation, and someone else has his.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We should forget about this and drink of the one Spirit 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
