Some of the children, relatives, and friends of our brothers and sisters are still not saved and in the church.</p><p>The brothers and sisters who serve as the nursing mothers should consider and think carefully before the Lord. They have to pray to find out the way to help the young brothers and sisters around them and to provide them a place where they can speak and fellowship freely. At least once a week they should lead these young ones to have a Bible study during the day or pray with them. If the young ones have some problems or some physical illnesses, these ones should help them solve their problems and pray for them. In other words, all the nursing mothers should exercise much care over the young ones. Every house that is opened should provide the best care, and all the houses should help each other. The thirteen sisters should get together more often to discuss and pray. They have to provide a place for the young people to go to and a place for them to speak up.</p><h2 class="head1">WORK IN THE DISTRICTS</h2><p>The bread-breaking meeting will be conducted in five districts; they will meet in five homes. Every district will be supervised by some responsible brothers. We have not assigned any other tasks to these brothers. If they are encumbered by other tasks, they will be too busy to exercise supervision over others; they will not have the time to visit or to get into the situations. The first work of the responsible ones is visitation. The main work of the church is visitation. If we cannot take care of the visitation in a proper way, we will be like a man whose nervous system has broken down; there will be no communication. There are several kinds of visitations, including gospel visitation, new believers' visitation, and special visitation.</p><h2 class="head1">THE VISITATION WORK</h2><h2 class="head2">Gospel Visitation</h2><p>In gospel visitation we wrestle with Satan over men's souls; we try to snatch people out of Satan's hand. Of course, whoever pulls harder wins. If we have five hundred people who have signed up after a gospel meeting, we are not doing them any good by merely "sending their names to heaven" without visiting them one by one. This is like going to someone's house and presenting a business card at the door without entering into the house at all. What good does this do? Satan is evil in many ways, but he has one virtue&mdash;he is not slothful in zeal. If we preach the gospel on the Lord's Day and a hundred people sign up and express their willingness to receive the Lord, we have to follow up with a second step. We have to arrange for saints to visit them immediately. Within a week, we have to arrange for a hundred to two hundred brothers and sisters to visit them. We must not just invite people to come to the gospel meetings; we must send brothers to make personal calls to these ones. We have to surround them and gain them at any cost. The more gospel meetings we have, the more visitation work we need. If visitation falls behind, our gospel will fail miserably. The failure of the gospel mainly lies in the lack of visitation.</p><p>For the sake of efficiency, we will not centralize the arrangement of the visitation work. Instead, every district will take care of its own visitation. The responsible brothers of each district will make proper arrangements for this work. The period of time when a man is about to escape Satan's grip is the most dangerous time for him. If we visit him in that time and surround him, we will strengthen his faith. I believe that with the proper arrangement and the diligent visitation of the brothers and sisters, the number in the church will double in one to two months time. In one year our number can increase seven or eightfold. Someone once said that the sea is full of fish and the earth is full of people. This is absolutely right. Today two babies are born in China every five seconds. May our gospel match the increase in our population.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_087.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_089.html">Next</a> </body></html>
