   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FORTY EXAMPLES OF JUDGMENT 36 Date:August 13, 1948 TESTIMONY BY BROTHER D. K.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>I was born into a non-Christian family.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Once I heard the gospel and was touched to believe in the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Later I became quite effective in working for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I thought, however, that this was due to my ability.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I did not realize that it was the Lord's grace.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I became proud and failed and then fell into darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This pitiful state continued for seven or eight years.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>During this time my parents passed away, and my brothers, sisters, and cousins were under my care.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Sometimes as I was reading the Bible or praying, Satan would accuse me of being a sinner and tell me that my sins could not be forgiven.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No one came to help me, and I could not prove my salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One night I rose up to pray in the middle of the night.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Hell appeared to open to me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I wanted to commit suicide, yet I was too afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I was very bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One day I read 1 John 1 and began to doubt the matter of forgiveness of sins.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Later I thought that since I did not sin willfully, the Lord would surely forgive my sins.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Concerning the pursuit for holiness, I saw that this is not something that I can accomplish, but that the Christ on the throne accomplishes.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For two years I was very busy in my job, but I was actually living a dry and wilting spiritual life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the middle of one night, only being half-conscious, I heard a voice crying, "Fire, fire."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I rose up hurriedly to put out the fire.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>There were over twenty people sleeping upstairs, and the fire was downstairs.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Lord's voice awoke me to put out the fire, and all of them were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once I was a manager of a company, but in name only.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I received good pay, but I did not have peace within.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I realized that I had never submitted to any authority.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>I am a rebellious person.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I prayed and asked the Lord to deal with me without concern for my pain.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Shortly thereafter, I was hurt in an accident.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I felt that my being was split into two parts.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I was in much pain, but inwardly I was full of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The doctor said that I needed to stay in bed for a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Thank the Lord that He spoke to me.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He healed my wound, and in one or two days I was able to get up from my bed.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>I had many questions in the past, but I no longer have any questions.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>I believe the Lord will enlighten my way through our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not know how much of God's speaking we have missed throughout our lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>If a man misses the discipline of the Holy Spirit, he misses God's speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are willing to humble ourselves and accept everything under the discipline of the Holy Spirit, the result will be the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If the discipline of the Holy Spirit does not consummate in any result, it will be a loss both to ourselves and to the church, because it will be a loss in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If a man obeys God and does not rebel, the result will be a spontaneous uplifting of the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The many experiences we have of God's dealings are for the purpose of producing a word within us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We often are in His hand, yet we foolishly miss the opportunities that He has provided for us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The fruit of the work of the Holy Spirit is the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We need to have the ministry of the word before we can serve others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Under the discipline of the Holy Spirit, a vessel may break; that is, a man may lose his temper and begin to argue with God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Such a man is not able to meet others' needs.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If a man neglects or fails to learn his lessons under the discipline of the Spirit, he has suffered in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The worst thing that can happen to a man is when he has the Spirit's discipline yet does not have the necessary result that comes from the discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is a pity that some pass through the sufferings foolishly and ignorantly without learning any lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>There are two negative things that can possibly result from the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>First, a man can go through such discipline ignorantly.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Second, a man can begin to argue with God, murmuring and complaining against Him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The discipline that affords proper lessons to some can be ignored by others.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>These latter ones go through such experiences blindly and do not understand the Lord's intention behind them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They do not learn any lesson from them.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I met a brother whom I have not seen for over ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He has suffered much, but he did not learn any spiritual lesson from his sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>On the one hand, we can attribute this to the shortage of supply in the ministry of the word in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Yet the discipline of the Spirit is never lacking, and we should never say that there are no lessons to be learned.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>A person who has lost the time of his discipline cannot supply others with the word.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is a loss in the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This loss in discipline is actually a loss to the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>In all the dealings we face, we have to see the Lord's hand.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We have to see that the Lord is constituting, carving, and molding us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The constitution of the Holy Spirit is not just an idea; it is constituted through the experience of all the circumstances around us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>All the experiences we have in our environment are the result of the Spirit's constituting work.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>His discipline is actually His constitution.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The golden lampstand is beaten out of pure gold.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The beating produces the mark, which is the result of the discipline of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Everything that goes on in our environment is for the producing of the beaten lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The way of the ministry of the word is not the way of gift, but the way that is wrought through God's beating.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We are all clear within that the way today is the way of the Spirit's discipline.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Where there is the discipline of the Spirit, there is the ministry of the word through the New Testament ministers.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Everyone who is used by God is beaten and molded by God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>To speak only by gifts, doctrines, truths, and teachings is not our way.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Once we acknowledge the discipline of the Spirit we will have fruit; we will have the speaking, the ministry of the word, and we will be able to supply others with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>But if we pass our days under the Lord's discipline in darkness or rebellion, we have suffered in vain.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The church also will have suffered great loss.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It is too great a loss to suffer without bearing any fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must learn some more so that God can speak to us more.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Lord has been dealing with us for years, yet we often have neglected His dealings and wasted much time.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>May the Lord be merciful to us so that every one of us can function in the ministry of the word and supply others with Christ.</S>
