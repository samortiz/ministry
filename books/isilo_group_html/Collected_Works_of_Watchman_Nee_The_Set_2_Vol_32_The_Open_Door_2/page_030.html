I am from Kweichow and have been saved for many years. Thank the Lord that I moved to Hong Kong from Swatow last year and was brought by one sister to meet at Changshawan for about a year. I have received many blessings from the Lord since then. My husband, Mr. Chiang Chi-dang, was very sick this spring, and no medicine was effective. He almost died. I asked  senior Mrs. Nee to come, preach to him, and pray for him. He repented and received the Lord and was healed. Glory to His name. Some of my family, that is, my brother's family and my sisters, are still in Chungking. Please visit them when you have time and tell them about the truth of salvation. May the Lord give you peace, and give my greetings to the brothers and sisters in Chungking.</p><p>Sister in the Lord,<br />Chiang Du En-hwei, May 20<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head2">Singapore</h2><p>Two weeks ago, I arrived in Penang...I was charged to send X dollars for the use of the co-workers, the brothers in need, and the publication of The Open Door. May the Father remember your work done in secret and supply all your needs so that you can participate in all good works. Brother Tang Shou-ling has arrived safely in Shanghai. Thank the Lord for His grace! The Lord cares for the lives of every one of His children and counts them as precious. May we not care for our own life or count it as precious. Recently the words of Revelation 12:11 have been constantly in my mind: "They loved not their soul-life even unto death." They are faithful to death! I should be leaving for south Thailand this week.</p><p>Faithful Luk<br />June 15</p><h2 class="head2">Sarawak</h2><p>I have received The Open Door from you. Through this publication, I learned of all the news in the Lord. Thank the Lord! I was led by the Lord to come to Southeast Asia last year and have been working in Bintulu and Cebu. I have also testified a little for the Lord. Presently, one brother and I go out on Saturday and the Lord's Day to do some personal evangelistic work. The opportunity is great. Sister Hwang Bi-gwe came and preached for a few days at the Methodist Church. Afterwards she went to Si-Li-Jie, Ku-Lu-Pu, and Ma-Lo-Ge-Po and is now in Cebu. Last Wednesday I received a letter from her saying that she will be preaching in provinces around Jia-Yi-Jia-Na-Yeh. There are over ten brothers and sisters in Sarawak who are on the same way. However, they are scattered, and the distance separating them is great. There is no meeting yet in any place. Finally, please pray for the work and for me.</p><p>Brother Wu Teh-chuen, June 21<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head1">MISCELLANEOUS NEWS</h2><p>(1) Brother Huang Tsai-ching and his mother are safe in Sha-Ti, Si-Shing, Chekiang.
