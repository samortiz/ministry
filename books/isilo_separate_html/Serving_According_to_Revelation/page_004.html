<h1 class="title">THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH&mdash;<br />
THE WHOLE BODY SERVING</h1>
<p>In this chapter we will consider the service of the church. We have been greatly blessed, and we have made progress in our service. However, the responsible saints do not have a fundamental and thorough knowledge concerning the way and the content of the service of the church. Furthermore, they do not have much feeling concerning the service of the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ALL MEMBERS SERVING</h2>
<p>The way for the church to serve is for all members to serve. The Bible speaks of the church as the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23; 1 Cor. 12:27), and regarding the service of the church, the Bible reveals that the church is also a Body, the mystical Body of Christ (Rom. 12:4-8; 1 Cor. 12:4-27; Eph. 4:11-12). The Body denotes not only matters related to life but also matters related to function. The function of the church is the function of the Body. The verses in Romans, 1 Corinthians, and Ephesians concerning the church as the Body of Christ emphasize the function of the church in relation to Christ. Function denotes service. Hence, the service of the church is the service of the Body, and the service of the Body is the service of all the members. Therefore, the way for the church to serve is for all members to serve. Every saint is a member of the Body of Christ with a function; therefore, every saint should fulfill his function.</p>
<p>However, many saints do not serve or do not seem capable of serving. Some saints are not clear concerning their salvation, or they have not had a thorough experience of salvation. Others might be cold or backslidden. Still others may not have the heart to serve the Lord even though they have been saved for many years. Although such saints seem incapable of serving or do not want to serve, all saints have the capability of serving and should serve, because they are members of the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>The responsible brothers need to be clear that the way to serve is for all to serve. In leading the saints to serve in the church, the brothers should apportion the service to all the saints so that all may participate and serve. If the service is not being apportioned to all the saints, the responsible brothers should have a sense that something is wrong. We must see and know the need for all members to serve, and we must even feel compelled to bring all the saints into serving. This will please the Lord. Without a thorough and clear understanding of service, our leading in the service of the church will not be strong.</p>
<h2 class="head1">SERVICE ENCOMPASSING<br />
EVERY ASPECT OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Since the service of the church involves all the members, the service of the church should encompass every aspect of the church. The content of the church is Christ as life, that is, Christ Himself, and the service of the church encompasses all the functions of the Body of Christ. The Body of Christ is more than one member. It has many members, and each member has a function. The service of the church involves the corporate functioning of all the members of the Body.</p>
<p>In our physical body we do not have one member functioning while the other members remain inactive. In a healthy body all the members move when the eyes move; the members do not remain still. It is not possible for only one member to function at a time, nor is it normal for a few members to function while other members remain still, unless some members of our physical body are paralyzed. If only one or a few saints function in service, a church is &ldquo;paralyzed&rdquo; and &ldquo;sick.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Not all the members of our human body look the same, nor do they have the same function. If all the members were the same, it would not be normal, because this is not how a body functions. Likewise, it is not normal if the saints only read the Bible, memorize the Bible, or speak about the Bible to the point that they do not know how to do anything else, because this is not how the Body functions. This does not mean that it is wrong for the saints to read the Bible, memorize the Bible, or speak about the Bible; it means that the service of the church is not normal if the saints only know how to do one thing. All the saints should read the Bible and have a proper understanding of the Bible, but not every saint can expound and teach the Bible. Only a few members are such gifts with this function (Eph. 4:11).</p>
<p>The situation in a church also is not normal if the saints do not care about anything other than praying from morning to evening. This is not how the Body moves. All the saints should pray and inquire of the Lord in all things, but not all the saints can bear the burden of prayer as a service. Such a service can be borne only through the power of the Holy Spirit. The Bible does not speak explicitly of prayer being a gift, but church history and our experience show that some of God&rsquo;s children are needed to serve through prayer. For such ones, prayer is a service. There is a great need in every local church for saints who would rise up and serve through prayer.</p>
<p>In the churches very few saints are given to the service of prayer. Every church should have between ten to twenty saints who are devoted uniquely to the service of prayer, praying not for themselves but for the church, for the brothers and sisters, for sinners, for God&rsquo;s kingdom, for God&rsquo;s work, and for God&rsquo;s gospel. There should be specific prayer even for the literature work. In <em>The Ministry of the Word</em> we mentioned this matter, saying that we hope some would set aside time to pray particularly for this publication (Jan. 1952, no. 7). There is a need for saints to pray for the work in the church, the move of the church, and every detail related to the church. The condition of God&rsquo;s house and of the brothers and sisters is borne upon the shoulders of praying saints. They uphold the Lord&rsquo;s work and His spread, and they bring in His kingdom with prayer. Their prayers should be strong to touch God&rsquo;s throne, shake the authority of darkness, bind what God has bound, and loose what God has loosed (Matt. 16:18-19). There are many aspects of service, but the service of prayer is urgently needed in all the churches.</p>
<p>The Moravian revival that occurred over two hundred years ago is an example. The Moravian Brethren set up a prayer watch around the clock every day. When one group of people finished praying, another group continued. Every day from morning to evening, groups were praying unceasingly. It is no wonder that the Moravian Brethren sent more missionaries abroad in three decades than all the missions combined in the prior two centuries. I believe that this was the issue of long-term, watchful prayer. According to their statistics, one person was sent abroad to preach for every fifty-eight believers who remained at home, and for every person who believed in the Lord at home, two people believed into the Lord abroad. Based on this ratio, the church in Taipei should have more than sixty saints preaching the gospel abroad, and we should gain close to seven thousand believers abroad. However, this is not our situation. If a group of saints would devotedly pray for the preaching and the spread of the gospel, God would manifest His power and glory among us. It would be very good if a group of saints in every district meeting would be involved in the particular service of prayer.</p>
<p>Our service in the church is not normal. The saints pray when we speak of prayer, clean the meeting hall when we speak of cleaning, and preach the gospel when we speak of preaching the gospel. It is not normal for the saints to pay attention only to what is spoken of by the brothers in the meetings to the exclusion of other things. Normal service involves the need to focus on many things at the same time. Some saints need to be led to study the Bible, others need to be led to pray, and still others need to be led to preach the gospel. Some need to be led to clean or to take care of other services. Some saints should go out to preach the gospel, others should gather for prayer, and still others should take care of different services. The saints should not preach the gospel only when we speak of the need to preach the gospel. Nor should the saints focus exclusively on cleaning the meeting hall when this matter is brought to our attention. It is not normal to have a &ldquo;gospel month,&rdquo; during which everyone preaches the gospel, or a &ldquo;visiting month,&rdquo; during which everyone visits the saints. Nevertheless, this seems to be our practice. When we speak of having a love feast for the sake of fellowship, everyone busies himself with the details of a love feast, while at the same time praying less and neglecting the gospel. When we speak of exercising the spirit, all the saints pay attention to this matter, but they drop other practical service. Some saints even begin to view practical service as being in the principle of Martha (Luke 10:38-42). Such a situation is abnormal.</p>
<p>The service of the church involves all the members. The service of all the members is needed for the members to carry out their various functions. Some members should lead the believers to pursue deeper spiritual growth, and others should teach new believers to read the Bible, pray, deal with the Lord, and follow the leading of the Spirit. Some members should lead people to salvation, and others should lead people to serve. Some members should speak the word, and others should offer particular prayers as a supply. If the service of the church is normal, there will be saints praying to support a brother when he is speaking. It is said that several believers were always praying for Spurgeon when he spoke. This is a proper situation.</p>
<p>In the service of the church, every service should have certain ones who bear responsibility to study the service and to lead others in the service. The brothers who rise up in the work of the gospel should study how to contact people, how to speak the gospel, and how to lead the saints to zealously preach the gospel. These brothers should also consider the use of the gospel van, the preparation of gospel tracts, and the posting of gospel banners to advertise the gospel. Some brothers should teach the saints to pray and lead the saints to pray for the various services of the church. Every service of the church needs some saints who are devoted to it and will carry it out with others.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_003.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_005.html">Next</a> </body></html>
