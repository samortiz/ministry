 <h2 class="head1">TRUSTING IN THE LORD&rsquo;S SPEAKING<br />
WITHIN YOUR SPEAKING</h2>
<p>We also need to trust in the Lord&rsquo;s speaking within our speaking. While I am speaking, I trust that within my speaking the Lord speaks. Actually, my speaking in itself means nothing. The real power and impact of my speaking is the Lord&rsquo;s speaking in my speaking. My speaking is a shell; it may be likened to a box that contains a diamond. Little children who do not realize the value of a diamond might treasure the box that contains the diamond more than the diamond itself. If you are childish, you may treasure my speaking. But the experienced saints can sense that there is a treasure within my speaking, and that treasure is the Lord&rsquo;s speaking.</p>
<p>When Brother Watchman Nee was a young man, M. E. Barber, an older sister in the Lord, helped him to the uttermost. Brother Nee went with Sister Barber a number of times to hear certain preachers and Bible teachers. After a message, which Brother Nee thought was wonderful, he asked Sister Barber what she thought. Sister Barber told him that the message was an empty shell full of eloquence without the content of life. In other words, within the person&rsquo;s eloquent speaking there was not the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. This happened quite often with Brother Nee and Sister Barber. One day they went to listen to an ineloquent speaker of whom Brother Nee had a very poor impression. After his message, Sister Barber told Brother Nee that this person had something of Christ and the cross. By this Brother Nee learned to take care of the treasure in a person&rsquo;s speaking. When we speak, we should look to the Lord that in our speaking He would speak.</p>
<p>The Lord Jesus indicated that when He spoke, the Father within Him was working. He said, &ldquo;The words which I speak to you, I do not speak from Myself; but the Father who abides in Me, He does His works&rdquo; (John 14:10). The Lord Jesus also said, &ldquo;The word which you hear is not Mine, but the Father&rsquo;s who sent Me&rdquo; (v. 24). The Lord Jesus had the attitude that His speaking would have been vain and empty if the Father did not speak in His speaking or if He spoke without the Father&rsquo;s working. The Lord never spoke His own word. He always spoke the Father&rsquo;s word. What a pattern to us!</p>
<p>We may not be required to speak for ten or twenty minutes in the meetings, but even if we only speak for two or three minutes, we have to look to the Lord for His speaking within our speaking. We have to learn this lesson whenever we speak in the meetings. We should pray, &ldquo;Lord, if You would not speak in my speaking, I would not speak.&rdquo; If we learn these points concerning the way of speaking and practice them, the church meetings will be very much uplifted and enriched. We cannot take the traditional way of coming to the meetings unprepared without any consideration or sensation. We should not come to the meeting merely to fulfill our duty. This is wrong. All of us have to get ourselves prepared to speak in the meetings and look to the Lord for His speaking in our speaking.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FOLLOWING THE ANOINTING OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>When we speak, we also must follow the anointing of the Lord. The Lord&rsquo;s inner anointing is the moving of the Holy Spirit as the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. If we follow the inner anointing in our speaking, that anointing will become the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. The Lord&rsquo;s speaking is the anointing within us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING EMPOWERED BY<br />
THE SPIRIT OF POWER IN YOUR SPEAKING</h2>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s anointing, the Lord&rsquo;s speaking, and power in our speaking are the same thing. The Lord&rsquo;s speaking is the anointing, and the anointing is the power in which we are empowered. This gives us the impact in our speaking.</p>
