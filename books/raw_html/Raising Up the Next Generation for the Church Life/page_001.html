<h1 class="title">FOREWORD</h1> 
<p>The Lord surely loves and cares for our children and young people, and His good intention for them is that they would become the next generation in His move. Throughout history He has depended on the faithful labor of His saints to raise up the next generation, mainly their own children, for the continuation of His divine economy on the earth. For this reason the Bible offers substantial help to God’s people about raising up the next generation. It is no wonder, therefore, that those who have taken the lead in the ministry among us, Brothers Watchman Nee and Witness Lee, paid careful attention to this matter. The materials that compose this book are drawn from the numerous places in their ministry where they offer fellowship about taking care of our children and young people with a view to their becoming the next generation in His glorious move on the earth.</p>
<p>The published ministry of Brother Nee and Brother Lee is prolific, comprising hundreds of titles and tens of thousands of pages. Thus, while the over four hundred pages of this compilation may seem massive, in relation to the whole of their ministry this line in their fellowship is not actually a major one. As will be seen in the pages to follow, most of their help on this topic comes from excerpts scattered throughout their ministry. If the excerpts are examined in their original contexts, it will easily be seen that most often our brothers offer us help on children and young people as supplemental points to their more central lines of fellowship. Of course, there are a few publications in their ministry where they focused on caring for our children and young people (for example, Brother Lee’s <em>How to Lead the Young People</em>), but it would not be correct to say that this was a focus of their ministry. Rather, viewed in the whole context of their ministry, their fellowship on children and young people falls squarely within that third line of truth from the Bible, what Brother Lee called “the leaves and the branches,” bearing less importance than the former two lines, what he called the central line and the line of supplemental points. While both Brother Nee and Brother Lee often shared on “the leaves and the branches,” they did so to bring us all into the central line of the divine revelation, and the original contexts of these excerpts will fully bear this out. (For Brother Lee’s fellowship on the lines in the divine revelation of the Bible, see <em>International Training for Elders and Responsible Ones, Spring 2011: The Central Line of the Bible,</em> Message 1.)</p>
<p>That being the case, it is with some concern and caution that Living Stream Ministry, as publisher of the ministry of Brother Nee and Brother Lee, offers this compilation to the churches and the saints. In making something of “the leaves and the branches” the focus of so substantial a publication as this, we do not wish to distract any of the dear saints or churches from the central line of the Bible. We sincerely hope that no one among us will make the substance of this book his or her central line or even the focus of his or her ministry among the saints. We hope that all the saints and all the churches everywhere will be just as Brother Nee and Brother Lee were, focused on and laboring for the central line among us, especially when they touched “the leaves and the branches.” Of course, some have been called to serve primarily among our children and young people, and we know that such a service is of the Lord and to the Lord. But we certainly feel that all of us should conduct our service so as to lead all in our care to apprehend and experience the central line in the Bible. We further hope that no one among us will use the precious fellowship of our brothers in this book to insist on ways to conduct the children’s and young people’s work among us. As part of “the leaves and the branches,” this fellowship is not to be insisted on, even though we firmly believe that it presents the best guidance for raising up the next generation for the church life. But while we have these concerns, we also have the firm conviction that all the saints in the local churches everywhere will exercise the very same caution that is expressed here, and we are certain that the mere mention of these concerns serves as a sufficient reminder of the pure intention of us all to remain faithful to the central line of truth in the Bible.</p> 
<p>Finally, it should be noted that because the fellowship in this book comprises many excerpts from numerous publications, there was the need of organizing and summarizing the content. This will be seen in the lesson outlines that precede each group of excerpts. These outlines, which faithfully crystallize the content of their following excerpts, were composed by a group of blended saints who serve among our children and young people. We are sincerely grateful to them for their labor before the Lord and expect that all the readers of this book will be equally so. We thank the Lord for His grace to them in this labor.</p> 
<p>May the Lord use the fellowship in this book to indeed raise up the next generations for the church life.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
