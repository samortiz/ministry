The Spirit in us also fills us essentially to dispense the Divine Trinity into us for our existence and living. When we are persecuted, the Spirit within us also teaches us how to answer our persecutors. The Spirit also guides us into all the reality. This is to declare, to transmit, to us all that the Father is and has, all that the Son is and has, and all that the Spirit receives of the Son and of the Father as our element and essence. The Spirit also explores the depths of God concerning Christ and shows us all the secrets of Christ as our portion for our realization and participation. The Spirit also teaches us spiritual words for the interpretation of spiritual things, the things given to us by God concerning Christ as our portion. The Spirit also speaks with us. He works in us to such an extent that we may be absolutely one with Him that He may speak with us in our speaking.<h2 class=head3>QUESTIONS</h2><ol class="decimal"><li>How do we know that God abides in us and we in Him?</li><li>Give some cases of the Holy Spirit&#8217;s filling of the believers inwardly.
