   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the kitchen the sisters who cook have the foretaste of the things they cook.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But when the food is put on the table, they have the full taste.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today the Holy Spirit who anoints us and seals us is for us to taste.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is more subjective.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Still, what we are enjoying today is the small taste in the kitchen, not the full taste at the dining table.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The dining table will come some day, and we all will be there tasting the Spirit in His fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But praise Him, today we have the foretaste!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We need to taste the Spirit continually.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>He is also the writing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We are the living letters of Christ composed with Christ as the content, and the Spirit is the writing ink 3:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Spirit is writing Christ into us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is not an outward teaching or an objective revealing but an inward, subjective writing of Christ into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second Corinthians also says that the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the Life-giver 3:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God has made us the sufficient ministers of the new covenant, not of the letter but of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>People think that if they are going to be a minister, they have to go to seminary to be taught.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>But Paul said that he was a minister "not of the letter but of the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>What a difference in concept!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The letter here refers to the written code or regulations.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We can be outwardly regulated with no life.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Pharisees, the scribes, and the Jewish leaders at Jesus' time knew all the right doctrines in the Old Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Herod called for the chief priests and scribes and asked them where the Christ was to be born.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Right away they gave him the right doctrine by telling him that the place would be Bethlehem Matt 2:4-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>They had this doctrinal knowledge, but they would not go to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The magi, however, went to contact Christ, not just according to the right teaching but according to the living star v. 9 . The Lord Jesus told the Jewish religionists that they researched the Bible, but they would not come to Him for life John 5:39-40 . The written code kills and deadens, but the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Life is the Triune God flowing Himself out.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It is the living flow of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The picture of this is in Revelation 22, where we see the throne of God and of the Lamb, and out of the throne flows the river of water of life v. 1 . In this river grows the tree of life v. 2 . Life is divine, eternal, flowing, and living.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>People may be bothered at the noise in our meetings, but the Bible tells us to make a joyful noise to the Lord Psa 100:1 .</S>

   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today is the day of life, the day of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In John 5:21 the Lord said, "For just as the Father raises the dead and gives them life, so also the Son gives life to whom He wills."</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Thus, we see that the Father gives life, the Son gives life, and the Spirit gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Even the word spoken by the Lord gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He said that the words that He spoke were spirit and life John 6:63 .</S>
