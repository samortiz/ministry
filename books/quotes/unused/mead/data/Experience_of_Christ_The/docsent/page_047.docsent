   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>WALKING BY THE SAME RULE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In verse 16 Paul says, "Only this: whereto we have attained, let us walk by the same rule" Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>. No matter the degree of our experience, we need to walk by the same rule.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This rule is to think the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Do not say, "Brother Lee, you have been in the Lord for more than fifty years and have a great deal of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>You are matured and on a high level.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But we have been in the church life a short time."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>No matter on what level we are, we need to walk by the same rule and to think of nothing other than the experience of Christ for the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To walk by the same rule is simply to think the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>For this reason, Paul besought Euodias and Syntyche to think the same thing 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>No matter what our age may be, young, middle-aged, or elderly, and no matter how long we have been in the church life, we need to walk by the same rule by thinking the one thing.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we do this, the situation in the church life will be wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>By thinking the one thing we shall be kept in oneness and in life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Instead of divisions or opinions among us, there will be the genuine oneness with life.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Throughout the recovery, we all need to think the one thing to pursue Christ toward the goal for the prize.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we do this, we shall be in oneness, and we shall be full of life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This is my burden in these days.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I hope that you all will be infused with this burden and from now on will not care for anything other than the best enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all want to be filled with Christ so that we may attain to the outstanding resurrection, the out-resurrection from among the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We want to think the one thing so that we may be one not only in spirit, but also in soul.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Furthermore, by thinking the one thing, the reality of the riches of Christ will reach its fullness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the Lord's recovery.</S>
