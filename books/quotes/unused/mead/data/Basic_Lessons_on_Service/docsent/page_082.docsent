   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>III.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OUR HEART BEING DECEITFUL ABOVE ALL THINGS AND BEING INCURABLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>According to Jeremiah 17:9, our heart is deceitful above all things and incurable.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The King James Version says the heart is "desperately wicked," but Darby's translation says it is "incurable."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>In the things of God, our heart is incurable; it is a hopeless case.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>IV.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>OUR MIND BEING FILLED WITH VANITY</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>AND DARKENED IN UNDERSTANDING</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>According to Ephesians 4:17-18a our mind is filled with vanity and darkened in understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 17 speaks of the vanity of the mind and verse 18 of the darkened understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This shows that our natural mind is utterly useless in the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>V. OUR WILL BEING HARD</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ephesians 4:18b speaks of the hardness of man's fallen heart.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that the will, as a part of man's heart, is hard, stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Thus, our heart is incurable, our mind is full of vanity with a darkened understanding, and our will is hard, stubborn.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>VI.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OUR FLESH BEING UNABLE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>TO BE SUBJECT TO GOD AND TO PLEASE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Romans 8:7 and 8 say, "Because the mind set on the flesh is enmity against God; for it is not subject to the law of God, for neither can it be.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>And those who are in the flesh cannot please God."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our flesh cannot do two things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It cannot be subject to God, and it cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to develop these points in our speaking to the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Both the Old Testament and the New Testament tell us that God hates the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>God wants nothing to do with the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In today's religion of Christianity, most of the service is either in the soul or in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is why we have to see the impotence of our natural being for our service.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to impress the saints that our flesh cannot be subject to God and cannot please God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Then the saints may ask, "What is it to be in the flesh?"</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should tell them, "As long as you are not in the spirit, you are in the flesh."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The New Testament mostly gives us a contrast between the spirit and the flesh, not the spirit and the soul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Actually, not many people are soulish; most people are fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even the most so-called moral persons are fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>At God's creation man is called a soul Gen 2:7 , but after the fall of man, man has become flesh 6:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, in Paul's writings concerning salvation and justification, he does not use the word soul but the word flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He says that out of the works of the law no flesh can be justified before God Gal 2:16; Rom 3:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The flesh here refers to man himself.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When the Bible says something about people in a positive sense, it uses the word soul as a term for man Exo 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But when the Bible says something concerning man in a negative sense, it uses the word flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>No flesh, no man, can be justified before God by the works of law.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The flesh is the fallen man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we are not in the spirit, surely we are in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should not think that we are so good that if we are not in the spirit, we are in the soul, not in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, today our soul is one with the flesh, which is the uttermost expression of the fallen tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>So if we are not in the spirit, we are in the flesh, and our flesh is altogether impotent in the things of God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is unable to be subject to God and to please God.</S>
