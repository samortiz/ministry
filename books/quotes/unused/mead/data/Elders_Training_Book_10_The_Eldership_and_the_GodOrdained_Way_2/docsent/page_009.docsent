   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>According to the Scriptures</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The way to take care of the problems in the Lord's recovery should also be according to the Scriptures without twisting and without any interpretation out of context, without any mixing in of human ideas, without any element of tradition, but with an open and seeking spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>If we hold such an open and seeking spirit, the problems can be taken care of properly.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To avoid twisting the Scriptures, we must be very objective in our realization of any portion of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>To avoid having any interpretation of the Scriptures that is out of context, we must not be biased in our subjective knowledge or personal feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To avoid the mixing in of any human ideas, we must reject our natural thoughts, our natural learning, and our natural doings.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>And to avoid having any element of tradition, we need to be under the light of the pure revelation of the holy Word.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All these will keep us in an open and seeking spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Then we can discern and judge things concerning the Lord's recovery according to the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>THE HIDDEN DIVISIVE FACTORS IN THE PAST</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The present trouble among us had its beginning in the past, but the fermentation or leavening process was not significantly manifested until 1985.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This fermenting process has continued over the past few years and has become fully exposed this year 1989 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In August of this year, the brothers who are taking the lead in the present trouble began to publish a paper called The Word and the Testimony in open opposition to the Lord's recovery and ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>From 1984 to 1986 I called three urgent elders' trainings.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first was in February 1984, the second in September 1985, and the last in February 1986 see Elders' Training, Books 1 8, published by Living Stream Ministry .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>My opening word in two of these three elders' trainings was concerning the danger of division.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Intention to Do an Extra Work</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>in the Unique Work of the Lord's Recovery</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The present problem among us came out of something which was hidden in the past.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>One of these hidden things was the intention to do an extra work in the unique work of the Lord's recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the recovery there is a definite work which is for the building up of the local churches unto the building up of the universal Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is the work.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But among us, there was a case of someone who wanted to do an extra work within the work.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This person would not leave the recovery or give up the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Instead, he insisted on having a particular work of his own, by his own effort, within the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was a divisive factor.</S>
