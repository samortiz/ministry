   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>UNDER THE EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Question: What does the phrase under the earth in Philippians 2:10 mean?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Is it the same as your explanation for 1 Peter 3:19 in the first issue of this magazine?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Wong, Chekiang</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Answer: Hades of which Paradise is a part is under the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We have the following verses to prove it: Acts 2:31 compared to Matthew 12:40; Numbers 16:30-33.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Tartarus hell in 2 Pet 2:4 means the deepest pit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Naturally, it is also under the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The bottomless pit is also under the earth Rev 9:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So Philippians 2:10 means that the Lord Jesus is the Lord over everything in heaven, on earth, and under the earth, for there is a spirit world under the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>CAPTIVITY</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Question: How to explain Ephesians 4:8-10?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Wong, Chekiang</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Answer: In the preceding verse Paul was speaking of the gift of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Now he wants to show that the Lord is the Giver of the gift, and the gifts are for men.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>"When He ascended up on high, He led the one who captures men captive" original text .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Who was the Lord Jesus' captive?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The one who captures men is Satan Heb 2:14; Col 2:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the believers died, they would have been imprisoned by the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is the meaning of captivity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, the devil is called "the one who captures men."</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But when the Lord Jesus resurrected and ascended, He captured the men-capturing Satan, thus enabling the saints, though in Hades, to escape from the power of the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is why 1 the gates of Hades shall not prevail against the church, 2 the keys of Hades are in the Lord's hand, and 3 Hades becomes Paradise to the saints Luke 23:43 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Matthew 27:52-53 is a proof of this.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"And gave gifts to men."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Before Christ resurrected and ascended, He did not give gifts to men.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He first warred, then He won the victory.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These gifts are the gifts of the Holy Spirit mentioned in Ephesians 4:11.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He died, He won the victory, and He gave gifts to men.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But from where did He "ascend"?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He first "descended into the lower parts of the earth."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He died, descended into Hades, and overcame Satan and the power of death; then He ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>"He who descended, He is also the One who ascended far above all the heavens."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The One who descended is also the One who ascended.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>What was the purpose for Him to do all these things?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is for the purpose that He would "fill all things."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When He descended, He gained all under the earth; when He ascended, He gained the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The meaning of the whole passage is that since the Lord Jesus died, resurrected, ascended, overcame the enemy, and filled all things, He is able to give gifts to men.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>These words are a quote of Psalm 68:18-19.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He had to ascend on high to take the enemy captive before He could give gifts to men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In Psalm 68:18, "the rebellious" refers to the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because this second part of the verse has nothing to do with the Gentiles, the apostle only quoted the first half of this verse .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In Ephesians 4:9 and 10 the apostle proves that the Lord Jesus is that One who ascended and who took captives.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>JECONIAH</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Question: Jehovah promised David that He would establish his kingdom forever, that his throne would be established forever, and so forth 2 Sam 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>God simply wanted to fulfill this word in Christ Acts 13:23; Matt 2:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Later, David gave the seal of the kingdom to his son, Solomon, who succeeded him on his throne as the bona fide king 1 Kings 1 --2 .</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If this were the case, his throne should have continued until Christ, according to the Lord's promise.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, as we see in Jeremiah 22:30, because Jeconiah committed sins, Jehovah cut off his seed and did not allow him to be king to sit upon the throne of David!</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How then could his descendant, Jesus, sit upon the throne of David?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Answer: This matter shows that the Lord Jesus had to be born through the virgin Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It does not mean that Jeconiah did not have any sons.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Jeremiah 22 merely says that his sons cannot be king.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Matthew 1:12 even says that he begot Salathiel.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Matthew 1:16 says, "...Mary, of whom was born Jesus, who is called Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Christ was not born of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Joseph was the descendant of Jeconiah Matt 1:12-16 , but the Lord Jesus was not the descendant of Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Hence, He was not the descendant of Jeconiah and could therefore sit upon the throne of David.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If, according to the modernists, the Lord Jesus had been born of Joseph, then they would not have the right to call Him Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>ZEDEKIAH</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Question: According to 1 Chronicles 3:15-16, 2 Kings 24:17, and 2 Chronicles 36:10, is Zedekiah Jehoiakim's uncle or brother?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Answer: Zedekiah was Jehoiakim's uncle 2 Kings 24:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Wordsworth said that in the original text of 2 Chronicles 36:10, the words his brother could be translated "his father's brother," that is, his uncle.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Concerning 1 Chronicles 3:15-16, we should know the way in which the writer wrote the genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Zedekiah was Josiah's third son v. 15 . But why was Zedekiah also the son of his nephew Jeconiah? Verse 16 should be translated, "Jehoiakim's son is Jeconiah.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Jeconiah's son is Zedekiah."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is because the sons here are like the Chinese succession of rulers: a person appoints his uncle to succeed him as the ruler, so the uncle becomes his son.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Here is a record of the genealogy of all the legal rulers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Zedekiah succeeded Jeconiah as king, so his name was recorded twice.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If this is not the explanation, how can it be possible that the same person is recorded wrongly from one verse to the next!</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>If we understand the style of the Bible, we will have fewer doubts.</S>
