<h2 class=head2>Spiritual Authority</h2><p>Some who do not meet with us have already greatly misused Brother Nee’s book Spiritual Authority. Brother Nee does not merely use the word authority, but his term is spiritual authority. Spiritual authority does not mean anything official, but something in life. When we say the elders have authority, we must not forget that the authority is not official. When anything becomes official, it is no longer something of life. Brother Nee does not talk of official authority but about spiritual authority. Since the authority is not official, there is no rank or position. Anything that is not official is not positional.<p>In the past, some young men came to us, taking the attitude that they were elders. They rebuked us, telling us that we did not know how to be elders. What they actually meant, however, was that we did not know how to control people. They knew how to control people based upon their misuse of Spiritual Authority. In my opinion, that book should be taken out of their hands.<p>If there is no rank, no position, and no controlling power for the elders, no one should be ambitious to be an elder. I do not believe anyone would be ambitious for slavery. It is not sufficient enough to tell people not to be ambitious. We must see that the holy Word takes away the rank, the position, and the controlling power of the elders; then no one would be ambitious.<p>Thus far, we have seen that in the New Testament there is no rank for the elders, and in this sense there is no position for the elders. Also, strictly speaking, there is even no authority given to the elders. First, the Lord Jesus charged us to be slaves, not to be masters or lords. A slave does not have any authority. Second, Peter, a fellow elder, charged the elders not to lord it over the flock but to be an example to take care of God’s flock. We may ask, “Doesn’t the shepherd have any authority over the flock?” God’s flock, however, is not a flock of cattle. The shepherd who shepherds a flock of cattle does not need to be an example. For a shepherd to be an example to a flock of cattle is meaningless. Suppose that Peter charged a real shepherd who shepherds a flock of sheep to be an example to his flock. If this shepherd tried to tell his flock that he received a charge from the Apostle Peter to be their example, they would not understand what he was talking about. We must see that the flock of God is not a flock of cattle but of men, so the shepherd can, should, and must be an example.<p>The word in Matthew 23 and in 1 Peter 5 does not give us any hint that the elders have the authority. This shows us that our understanding of the Bible is still greatly leavened. We still have certain kinds of traditional, religious, human, and natural understanding within us. To say that the elders do not have any authority is against our natural thought. However, if we would be quiet, and objective, and not hold on to any kind of old understanding, allowing our mind to be purified and sober, when we come to the pure Word, looking to the Lord, we will see pure light.<h2 class=head2>The Leading Ones</h2><p>We should reexamine the Bible to see if any verse indicates or even hints that the elders have been assigned with authority. Let us look at Hebrews 13:17: “Obey the ones leading you and submit to them, for they watch over your souls as those who will give account, that they may do this with joy and not groaning, for this would be unprofitable to you.” We may ask, “Doesn’t the New Testament say in this verse that the members in the church have to obey those who lead them? Doesn’t the word obey indicate that there is a certain kind of authority?” This verse, however, tells us to obey the ones leading us, not ruling us. We obey their leading, not their authority. Merely by looking at the words obey and submit we might understand that there is some authority with the elders. But we must see that this verse does not tell us to obey the rulers but to obey the leading ones.<p>When we were on mainland China we did not use the term “leading ones.” It was when we came to Taiwan that I began to further consider this matter in the New Testament. Hebrews 13:7 and 24 also refers to “the ones leading you.” This corresponds with the thought of being an example. If you are going to be an example, you must take the lead. In order to help the saints get into the Word of God, you must do it first. You must take the lead. To obey the ones who lead means to obey their leading. The elders themselves should not claim any kind of obedience from the saints. They must check with themselves concerning how much leading they have rendered to the church, including the weak ones, the young ones, and the new ones. The actual situation, however, is that there has not been that much leading on the side of the elders, but there has been the claiming or requiring of the believers, the members, to be under them.<p>If we do not render the adequate leading, yet we claim, require, and demand obedience from the other members, this is a shame to us. For an elder not to render much leading to help the saints and yet to claim much obedience and submission from the saints is a shame, not a glory. How nice and how beautiful it would be to see that in the local churches there would only be the rendering of leading on the elders’ side with no demand or no claim of the believers’ obedience and submission.<p>Hebrews 13:17, of course, is a charge given to the members of the church. If the elders did not render any kind of leading or inadequately render the leading to the saints, then how could they claim that all the members should obey them? Hebrews 13:17 does not indicate the authority of the leading ones. It is not a matter of ruling, but a matter of leading. Strictly speaking in the New Testament, concerning the elders in the local churches, you cannot find a Greek word referring to the thought of ruling. If there were such a verse, it would contradict the Lord’s word. The Lord’s word is that among you there is no master, no ruler. Whoever wants to be great has to be a slave.
