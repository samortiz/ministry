HIS CONCLUDING WORD</H2><P>Psalm 145:21 is David's concluding word. He concludes by saying, "My mouth will speak the praise of Jehovah,/And all flesh will bless His holy name forever and ever."</P><P>We all need to learn from these six psalms to have nearness and dearness in our contact with the Lord. We all need to have a heart that loves the Lord and treasures Him. If we do not have such a heart toward the Lord, then all the higher and deeper things that I have been ministering since 1962 concerning Christ, life, the Spirit, the church as the Body of Christ, and God's eternal economy with the divine dispensing will not mean anything to us. In order for these things to be meaningful to us, we need to love and treasure the Lord to the uttermost.</P><P>Speaking to certain people regarding these deeper and higher things may be compared to playing a piano to a cow: there is no interest or response. Many believers today have no interest in God's economy but instead care only for their concept of living a godly life and going to heaven to be with their loved ones. When they hear the truth concerning God's economy, they have no interest in it or response to it.</P><P>What about our situation today? We may hear so many precious truths, but we may not have a heart that loves and treasures the Lord. We need to be like John Nelson Darby who, while alone one night in a hotel at the age of eighty-four, could say, "Lord Jesus, I still love You." I believe that whoever loves the Lord and treasures Him will also treasure the truths that have been released concerning Christ, life, the Spirit, the church, the divine economy, and the divine dispensing.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_340.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_342.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Life-Study of Psalms &nbsp; pg 341</div><br></body></html>
