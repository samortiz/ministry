<h1 class="title">FIVE PRACTICAL MATTERS<br />
FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:1-3</h1>
<p>Bible students agree that the book of Ephesians may be divided into two sections. The first section of three chapters gives us a revelation, a definition, of the church, showing us what the church is, from where it comes, and where it stands. Then the second section of three chapters shows us how to realize the church life in a practical way. At the opening of the section concerning the practice of the church life Paul says, &ldquo;I beseech you therefore, I, the prisoner in the Lord, to walk worthily of the calling with which you were called, with all lowliness and meekness, with long-suffering, bearing one another in love, being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace&rdquo; (4:1-3). Many of us are very familiar with verses 24 and 25 of chapter 5, which are a charge to husbands and wives. In addition, many Christians who talk about the church life pay attention to the seven &ldquo;ones&rdquo; in 4:4-6: one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God. However, not many Christians pay adequate attention to verses 1 through 3.</p>
<p>Paul was a prisoner not merely in a physical prison, and he was not only imprisoned for the Lord; he was a prisoner in the Lord (v. 1). He had lost his liberty in the Lord. As such a one he besought the Ephesians to live a life worthy of the calling with which they were called. As a young Christian I thought that God&rsquo;s calling was for us to go to heaven. According to the whole book of Ephesians, though, our calling is to practice the church life. Ephesians is not a book about the heavens nor even about salvation. It is a book on the church. This book tells us that God has called us for the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s election of us includes two ends. At one end is His choosing, and at the other end there is His calling. His choosing was in eternity, but His calling is in time. According to 1:4-5 God predestinated us, He marked us out beforehand for His eternal purpose concerning the Body of Christ. Likewise, His calling in time is also for the Body. We need to have a walk, to live a life, worthy of our calling for the church life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KEEPING THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT, WHICH IS CHRIST HIMSELF AS THE SPIRIT WITHIN US</h2>
<p>The first item of the Christian walk that is worthy of God&rsquo;s calling is that we must be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit. According to the Greek text, to be diligent includes the meaning of striving and struggling. To keep the oneness is not an easy matter. This oneness is already within us, so there is no need to attain, gain, or receive it. What we need today is to keep, preserve, and maintain what we already have gained. For this purpose we need to be diligent, and strive, struggle, and even fight to keep, maintain, and preserve the oneness.</p>
<p>Just as the current of electricity is the electricity itself, the oneness of the Spirit is the Spirit Himself. At the time we believed in the Lord Jesus, this wonderful, inexhaustible Spirit came into us as the oneness. We know this in a practical way because we have loved the brothers and have wanted to contact them since the day we believed in the Lord Jesus and He came into us. Before I was saved, I saw many Christian preachers and ministers, and I was raised under them, but I hated them and all Christians. I used to say, &ldquo;Look at those poor Christians. I would rather follow Confucius. The followers of Confucius are much better than the Christians.&rdquo; This was my slogan. However, on the day that I was saved, the whole universe changed for me. Christians became so dear to me. I loved everyone who said that he was a Christian, and I wanted to be with the believers. Sometimes when people ask me how they can know if they are saved, I reply, &ldquo;Do you now love the believers?&rdquo; If anyone says that he still hates Christians, I do not believe that he is saved. At first I thought this was my own concept, but then I read 1 John 3:14-15, which indicates that the love for the brothers is a proof that we have eternal life within us.</p>
<p>Therefore, the genuine oneness is the very Spirit who is within us. Every real Christian has this oneness, which is nothing less than the living Lord Himself as the wonderful, all-inclusive life-giving Spirit who is within us (2 Cor. 3:17; 1 Cor. 15:45b). Now what we need today is not to receive or gain this oneness but to endeavor, strive, and struggle to keep, maintain, and preserve the oneness.</p>
<h2 class="head1">FIVE PRACTICAL MATTERS<br />
FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE CHURCH LIFE</h2>
<p>Five phrases in Ephesians 4:1-3 give us the practical way to keep the oneness: <em>lowliness, meekness, long-suffering, bearing one another in love,</em> and <em>the uniting bond of peace.</em> We should not quickly think that we know what all these terms mean. We may know the meaning of these phrases from the dictionary, but we may not know their reality. We can know mainly from our experience what these matters are. According to my experience and learning in the past, these five items are a test to us in the practice of the church life. By this test we can see whether or not we are practically in the church life.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_048.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_050.html">Next</a> </body></html>
