   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR THE GENUINE AND PROPER LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>OF THE SONS OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>As Christians today we all have been very much influenced in our human culture by religion.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Even those who claim to have no thought about religion, the atheists, cannot stay away absolutely from the influence of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>As long as you are a human being, born as a descendant of Adam and living on this earth, you are under the influence of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Religion is a very big matter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even in the constitution of many countries, there is a part concerning religion.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Religion is so common to human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is natural to human culture.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In a sense religion is more natural than marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In human history and among human societies a good number of persons were never married.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But no one has ever escaped the influence of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Religion is a big influence.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>I would liken the influence of religion to a thick, strong box.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>All the descendants of Adam have been put into this box.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Although we have given more than twenty-five messages on Romans 8, it may be that you still consider Romans 8 as something religious.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>For example, when we talk about the leading by the Spirit, spontaneously you may consider that you need to seek after the Lord s leading concerning a business trip or concerning getting married or concerning what school you should attend.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the religious understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To consider that the leading by the Spirit is just a matter of our activities, our actions, our programs, our enterprises, our education, our housing, or our car is just according to the religious understanding.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>MORE THAN ONE KIND OF LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>I am afraid that many of the brothers and sisters have at least three kinds of lives the family life, the church life, and the meeting life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Are you the same in your home life, in your church life, and in your meeting life?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It might be that you talk one way at home, but then talk another way in order to prepare yourself for the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This means your living in your home life is one way, and your living in the meeting life is another way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When you read the newspaper you may live in one way, and when you read a Life-study message you may live in another way.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>You may consider that the Life-study messages bring you into the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If so this means that when you read the newspapers you are outside of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>So you have two lives, or two livings.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>One is in the Lord, and the other is not in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>As a little minister of the Word, whenever I am speaking I am also exercising simultaneously to sense the condition of the dear saints who are the listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The more I speak in these Perfecting Meetings, the more my realization is that the speaking may make the audience more religious.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In other words I am afraid you may understand what we are speaking on Romans altogether in a religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Because you don t apply what you have heard in this meeting to your home life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>You don t apply what you have heard in these meetings to all the small avenues of your daily living.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You don t apply what you have heard in these meetings to some of the corners of your private life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>It may be you have applied some of the points to your living.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But your kind of application makes the speaking religious.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>A DEFINITION OF RELIGION</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the past we have given a definition of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Religion is to do something for God, to worship God, yet without the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Now I would add something more to this definition of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When we say something is religion, we also mean that you have more than one way to live in your human living.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In one of the ways for living, you don t apply the spiritual teachings to your life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You live a life without God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You just live it by yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But because you are religious and you are loving God, you would not do anything grossly sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This means that in your living there are two sections: one is the secular section.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is not bad or sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The other is the religious section.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It seems with your human life there is the outer court and there is the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Some of the things you do in the outer court, and other things you do in the sanctuary.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the meeting you are all very religious, but when you are dismissed, the religious atmosphere changes.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It becomes only a little better than the atmosphere at a ball game.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This means that unconsciously you have made the spiritual things from Romans 8 religious.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>All these things have not become your living.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>They are still in the realm of your performance.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>As long as you make a spiritual thing only a section of your daily living and not your whole daily living, that is a performance.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>That is religion.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Today human society everywhere is filled with performance.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Politeness is performance.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the offices and in the schools people are nice and polite and regulated.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>But if you go into the back room and if you check their weekend life, you may see something different.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Sometimes a brother may act one way with the brothers at the meeting and another way with his wife at home.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>With the brothers he is so gentle and nice, but he may treat his wife as if she were a slave.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This means he has two ways of living.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>One way is the way of living with his wife, and the other way is the way of living with the brothers in the church.</S>
