<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE RECOVERY OF THE BODY<br />AND THE AUTHORITY OF THE MINISTRY</h1><h2 class="head4">(Co-workers' Meeting)</h2><h1 class="scripture">Date: April 10, 1948, 9:00 a.m.<br />Place: Hardoon Road, Shanghai</h1><h2 class="head1">CONCERNING THE TRUTH</h2><h2 class="head2">Not Arranging the Sequence of Truth<br />according to One's Personal Experience</h2><p>Questions: Do we first know the individual life and then the Body life? Is the basis of the Body life the individual life? Is individualism a hindrance to the Body?</p><p>Brother Nee: At the time of the Reformation, Luther emphasized justification by faith. That was, of course, a recovery of the truth. However, at that time men only saw that faith before God is needed, rather than work. Luther was supposed to have recovered the truth of justification by faith. Actually, he only emphasized faith; he did not fully realize what justification is. It was not until men like J. N. Darby were raised up in the last century that justification was covered. Even though the word "justification'' was used, they had not touched the reality of justification. They did not know what, in fact, is justification. In spite of this, they spoke much on the truth of justification.</p><p>In the last century some people also began to talk about the doctrine of regeneration. But what is the relationship between regeneration and justification? It is difficult to say which one comes first and which one comes later. There was a brother who once preached the doctrine of justification unceasingly; he had never heard of the doctrine of regeneration. After three years he began to hear about the doctrine of regeneration, and he realized that he was regenerated. From that time on, whenever he preached the gospel, he would always tell others that a man is justified and then regenerated. Not only was he preaching this, but all the people around him began to preach the same thing. Actually, for a person to say that justification always comes first and then regeneration is making too definite and too subjective a distinction.</p><p>A person who has no experience cannot preach God's word. But a person who only trusts in his experience cannot preach God's word either. A person who preaches God's word must be free from the limitation of his own experience. It is possible for a person to experience certain truths according to a certain sequence in time. But he must never think that the order of the truths is necessarily according to the way he experiences them.</p><h2 class="head2">The Two Sides of the Truth</h2><p>There are two sides to the truth. Many times, some doctrines only cover one side of the truth. For example, we know that there are two aspects to the result of the cross. On the one hand, it removes our sins (Col. 2:14). On the other hand, it justifies us (Rom. 8:3-4). But we cannot say that the cross is clearly divided into these two things. They are actually two aspects of one thing. We are actually justified from sin through the cross. We who are dead have been freed from sin and justified from sin. This does not mean that being delivered from sin is one thing and being free is another thing. Neither does it mean that being delivered from sin is one thing and justification is another thing.</p>
