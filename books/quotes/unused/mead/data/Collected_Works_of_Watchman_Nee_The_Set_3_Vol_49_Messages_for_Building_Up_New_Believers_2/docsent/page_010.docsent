   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A Sixteen-year-old Youth</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>A sixteen-year-old youth was working as a copy writer in a construction firm.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The chief engineer of the company had a very bad temper and almost everyone was afraid of him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the youth was saved, he started to pray for the chief engineer.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He was afraid of the engineer and dared not open his mouth, yet he prayed earnestly for him daily.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After a short while, the engineer asked him, "I have over two hundred people in the company, but I feel that you are different.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Can you please tell me why you and I are so different?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The engineer was about forty to fifty years old, and the youth was only sixteen.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The young man answered, "I have believed in the Lord, and you have not."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The engineer immediately said, "I also want to believe in Him."</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The youth brought him to the church, and the engineer was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Two Sisters</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Europe there are guest houses which are open to strangers.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They are not hotels, but they receive travelers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Once there were two Christian sisters whose house was open to travelers.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Sometimes, as many as twenty or thirty would stay at their place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They noticed the luxury of the travelers' attire and the vanity of their conversation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The sisters were bothered and wanted to win them over to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, there were many guests and only two of them.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How could they win them over?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>They decided to sit at the two ends of the room during the conversation and pray for the guests from each end.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>On the first day during the after-dinner conversation, each sister sat at one end, praying for the guests one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One prayed from one end, and the other prayed from the other end. They prayed for each and every one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This stopped the guests' jesting and chatting on that first day.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They asked themselves what had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On that day, one person was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The next day, another lady was saved.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>One by one they were gradually all brought to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Prayer is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The first condition in bringing people to the Lord is intercessory prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We must pray systematically, orderly, daily, and relentlessly, until our friends are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>GOING TO MAN ON GOD'S BEHALF</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Merely going to God on man's behalf is not enough.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We also have to go to man on God's behalf.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We have to tell men about God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many people have the courage to speak to God, but they have no courage to speak to man.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We have to exercise boldness to speak to men.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to tell them the kind of Lord our Lord is.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>When we speak, we need to pay attention to a few things.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>A. Never Engaging in Useless Arguments</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First, never engage in useless arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This does not mean that there should never be any arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Acts tells us of a few arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Even Paul argued cf.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Acts 17:2, 17-18; 18:4, 19 .</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, useless arguments do not save people.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sometimes it is all right to engage in arguments.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But this is mainly for the benefit of other listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Try to avoid arguing with the ones you are trying to save because arguments often drive people away instead of bringing them in. If you argue with them, they will run away.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Many people think that arguments can touch men's hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Actually, this never happens.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>At the most, arguments can convince men's minds.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Their mouths may be shut, but their hearts will not be won over.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Arguments produce little result.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Try to say less in the way of argument and more in the way of testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You have only to tell others that you felt happy and peaceful after you believed in the Lord Jesus, that you sleep well now, and that even meals are becoming tastier.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No one can argue with you about these things.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>They can only wonder.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>You have to show them that they do not have your kind of peace and joy and that they should therefore believe in the Lord.</S>
