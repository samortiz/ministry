<P>Union is concerning our oneness in life with the Lord. Mingling is related to the divine and human natures. The Lord has gone further to show us that our relationship with Him is not only one of union and mingling but also one of incorporation. John 14 stresses the word in four times. Verse17 says that the Spirit of reality, another Comforter, would not only be with the disciples but also in them. The Spirit of reality, the person, is in us. Humanly speaking, we can have our physical father's life and nature, but our father as a person cannot be in us. But John 14:17 says that the Spirit of reality as a person would be in us.</P><P>Then in verse 20 the Lord said that on the day of resurrection the disciples would know that He is in the Father, that they are in Him, and that He is in them. The Son, the person, is in the Father, another person. Then we, the millions of persons, are in the Son, the person. Also, the Son is in us. Union and mingling refer to our relationship with the Lord in our life and nature but not in our person. Humanly speaking, no person can be in another person. But in the divine and mystical realm, the consummated God and the regenerated believers, the persons, indwell one another. This is an incorporation. In this universal, divine-human incorporation, persons indwell one another, that is, they coinhere.</P><P>In the whole universe, there are God, man, Satan, and the angels. The angels, including Satan and his fallen ones, are not considered persons. God and man are both corporate persons. God is not just a single person. He is three&#151;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&#151;a corporate person. We, the millions of believers, are also a corporate person. These persons are now in one another. This is not a mingling but an incorporation.</P><P>The word incorporation also indicates that these persons are incorporated together to carry out their purpose, that is, to carry out God's economy. God's economy is a big career, a big business. In order to carry out His economy, God needs man to be incorporated into Him. Man and God, humanity and divinity, as persons, are incorporated together for the same purpose, for the same goal, to carry out the same career, that is, God's eternal economy.</P><P>This divine-human, unlimited incorporation is the highlight of the Gospel of John. God's intention, His desire, and His career are to carry out His economy. The centrality and universality of God's eternal economy is Christ. Through His incarnation, death, and resurrection, Christ as the one grain of wheat became the many grains to be ground and blent together into one loaf. This loaf is the church, which is the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 10:17). Eventually, this Body of Christ, at the end of the sixty-six books of the Bible, will be the New Jerusalem. This holy city is the goal of God's economy&#151;the enlarged, universal incorporation of the consummated God with the regenerated believers. The Triune God intends and desires to have this. This is His purpose, His goal, to fulfill His desire to satisfy His heart. The conclusion of the entire sixty-six books of the Bible is the New Jerusalem. The Bible begins with God and ends with a city. The unique God is eventually enlarged into one city for His eternal enlargement and eternal expression as a great universal incorporation.</P>
