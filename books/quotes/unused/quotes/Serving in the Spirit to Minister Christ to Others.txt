The first is that in the church all the serving ones must be built up together as a spiritual house, the priesthood
Among them there is a priesthood, a priestly body, a corporation, a coordination of a group of believers built up together, serving the Lord
The holy priesthood is a group of serving ones who have been separated from the satanic system of the world unto the service of God
Because they are separated from the world and entrusted with heavenly authority, they are qualified and equipped to serve the Lord
From that time, we need to learn to live, to walk, to act in the spirit, not in the mind or emotion, not in the soul
We need to learn not only to walk, to live, in the spirit but also to serve in the spirit, and to serve in the newness of the spirit
To walk, to live, in our spirit means that we will be in the Holy Spirit because the Holy Spirit is now indwelling our spirit
Suppose on the Lord's Day morning we are having a morning service in the way of the letter, and we have one to take charge of the service
For the prayer meeting, you may look in the index of the hymnal and select a good hymn related to prayer just according to the letter
There is a way that is not according to your mind, your mentality, but according to the inner feeling of your spirit
We must learn not to act or serve according to knowledge, but to act and serve according to the inmost feeling
Word by word, sentence by sentence, the message came out, not according to the mentality, but according to the anointing
One way is to offer a prayer according to knowledge, according to a routine, much like coming to an office to do routine work
We should not pray according to knowledge or routine, but according to the inner feeling, the inmost feeling of the anointing
In such a case we can sense something living, something anointing, something enlightening, not just something of teaching
By the inner sense we know when a brother or sister is praying in the spirit or merely praying in the letter, according to knowledge
When anyone utters a prayer from the spirit, there is a spontaneous expression of agreement from the spirit of the others
Within them there is an 'Amen,' but they suppress it, they would not release it, simply because of their opinion
Whether they would utter it or not, when anyone prays in the spirit, there is always an echo in the spirit of others
You must take care of this anointing and fellowship with the saints according to the inner feeling, the inner sense
During the very time you are listening to her, you must exercise your spirit to sense her spirit and to sense the anointing within you
At that very moment you have to forget your knowledge of the Scriptures your knowledge of the Christian teachings and give up that knowledge
Merely to preach that we are all sinners and that the Lord Jesus is the Son of God who died on the cross for our sins does not work
He had actually stolen chalk from the school, but when he heard these words, he said to himself, 'That doesn't matter'
Your husband works hard to earn a living for you, and at the end of the year you forced him to buy a pair of high-heeled shoes for you
There are living stories of such experiences in the gospel preaching according to the inner feeling of the spirit
If you would keep your knowledge in your memory at that time, you will do a lot of damage, and you will hinder the Spirit
While you are speaking, you have to forget about your knowledge and come back to the spirit to minister in the spirit
She was very strong in character, and she was very prominent in everything that was done for the whole evening
Another sister was serving at that same dinner, and she was the only one of the serving ones who did anything wrong
She had learned something of Christ, how to live in Christ, how to act in Christ, and even how to adjust her wrongdoings in Christ
It is possible to do many things in the Lord's service and yet have nothing of Christ ministered through you or by you
There are many lessons to learn in ministering Christ to others by cleaning, by cooking, and by doing many different practical things
We need to learn the lesson to serve others and to serve God by ministering Christ to others no matter what we are doing
If you are in the spirit when you are playing the piano, by playing the piano you will minister Christ to others
It was her habit to invite the young missionary ladies who had just come to China to have tea with her in the afternoon
A number of those young sisters could testify how much the life of the Lord was ministered to them by the serving of that tea
While they were drinking tea, several times this sister pulled her skirt down so that she was more fully covered
If others cannot sense Christ in the kitchen while you are cooking, it is doubtful that they will sense Him in the meetings in a real way
Unless we learn the lessons in these matters, the church life will be damaged, and death will be brought in through the practical matters
In that case, the more the saints come together for the practical service, the more the church life will be damaged
