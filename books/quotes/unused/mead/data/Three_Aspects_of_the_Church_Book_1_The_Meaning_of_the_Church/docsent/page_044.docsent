   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Having Two Tenons</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Each board had two tenons Exo 36:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Bible the number two signifies testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The basic principle of the number two is not being individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our standing by means of our two feet indicates that we are not individualistic.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When a person stands, he uses both of his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the church some brothers and sisters are not steady in their stand because they stand on only one foot; they are individualistic and have no testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There were two tenons for each board and two sockets under the two tenons.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>These two tenons fit perfectly into the two sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This indicates a testimony vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>22, 24, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If there had been only one tenon matching one socket, there would not have been a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, there were two tenons matching two sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Each tenon had to match its respective socket.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When both tenons matched their respective sockets, there was the testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If each board had only one tenon matching only one socket, then the board could be set up in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>With two tenons, however, the board had to be set up in a way so that each tenon matched a particular socket.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The board would not have been able to stand if only one tenon matched a socket and the other did not.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Both tenons had to match the sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This type implies that a board cannot stand by itself.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Every board had two tenons.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Similarly, every believer in the church should stand by means of two tenons in two sockets.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>No action in the church should be individualistic but should require two sockets; it should be testified to by another person.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This will ensure a stable standing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Having Bars</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>There were horizontal bars crossing and connecting all the standing boards.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>These bars served as connecting bands vv.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>31-34 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the bars signify the oneness of the Spirit cf.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eph 4:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Originally the boards were separate, but with the addition of the bars, the boards became one.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the same in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The brothers and sisters start out as individuals, but by the Holy Spirit operating as the bars within them, they become one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The boards had golden rings to hold the bars Exo 36:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The golden rings may be compared to the nose-ring put upon Rebekah s nose Gen 24:47 .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The ability of the boards to stand depended upon the acacia wood, whereas their being connected together depended upon the golden rings.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Holy Spirit unites us together by the divine life, which entered into us on the day of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The golden ring typifies the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, the oneness of the church is altogether in the Holy Spirit and in the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The oneness of the church cannot be found in man.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In man there is only separation and dispersion.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The oneness of the church is altogether in God.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In the tabernacle the golden rings, not the wood of the boards, were used to join the boards together to form a wall.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The many independent and separate boards were united by the golden rings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The boards by themselves could never be united with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The boards were linked together as a wall because golden rings were holding the bars.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The boards of the tabernacle signify the saints in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All the saints have both humanity and divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In our humanity we have no way to be joined together, but in divinity we can be joined together as one.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Thus, if we live only in our humanity, we will be separated and scattered, but if we live in the divine life, we will be one.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The oneness of the church is altogether in the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Holy Spirit who descended on the day of Pentecost possesses humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Hence, the bars were gold without and wood within.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This matter is very mysterious, but this truth was made clear at the time of Andrew Murray.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the Old Testament, God was merely God, having nothing to do with humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, His Spirit possessed only divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, through incarnation, divinity entered into humanity, and through Christ s death and resurrection, humanity entered into resurrection and was brought into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Christ became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection 1 Cor 15:45b , and on the day of Pentecost the Spirit who came to earth possessed not only divinity but also humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>John 7:39 says that the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus was not yet glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>At that time the Spirit of God existed, but the Spirit was not yet, because Jesus had not yet been glorified in His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>The title the Holy Spirit was not used before the incarnation, because divinity had not yet been brought into humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Similarly, the title the Spirit was not used before the glorification of Jesus, because humanity had not yet been brought into divinity.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Thus, the term the Spirit refers to the Spirit of God who now possesses humanity in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Today we are able to fellowship with the Lord because we are in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is very deep in significance.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is the Spirit who causes all the saints in the church to be one.</S>
