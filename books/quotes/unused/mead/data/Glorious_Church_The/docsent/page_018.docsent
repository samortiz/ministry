   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>EVE MADE FROM ADAM'S SLEEP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE CHURCH PRODUCED THROUGH CHRIST'S "NON-REDEMPTIVE DEATH"</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have already seen that Eve was not made of dust, but of Adam; Adam was the material of which Eve was made.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Likewise, Christ is the material for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God used Christ to make the church.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Now we will see how Eve was made, and how the church was made.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Let us read Genesis 2:21-23.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>"And the Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and he slept; and he took one of his ribs, and closed up the flesh instead thereof.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>And the rib, which the Lord God had taken from man, made he a woman, and brought her unto the man.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>And Adam said, This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh: she shall be called Woman, because she was taken out of Man."</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>God brought forth the church out of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Regarding the death of Christ, the words in Genesis 2 are very special.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It says, "The Lord God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam" v. 21 . This verse does not say that God caused Adam to die, but that He caused him to fall into a deep sleep.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If death had been mentioned, then sin would be involved, because verse 17 in the preceding passage says that death and sin are related.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Adam's sleep typifies the aspect of Christ's death which was not related to redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the death of Christ there was an aspect which was not related to redemption but to the release of Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We are not saying that the death of Christ is not for redemption we truly believe that it is but His death involved an aspect which is not related to redemption.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This aspect is the releasing of Himself for the creation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It has nothing to do with sin.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God is taking something out of Christ and using it to create the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, "sleep" is used to typify His death through which man receives life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Redemption and the receiving of life are two distinct things.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Redemption involves a negative aspect of dealing with our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have sinned and deserve to die; therefore, Christ came to bear our sins.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>His death accomplished redemption for us.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This aspect of His death is related to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But there is another aspect of His death which is not related to redemption: It is the imparting of Himself to us so that through His death we may receive life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Adam's sleep was not for Eve's redemption; it was so that a rib could be taken out for her creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Sin had not yet entered the scene that account is in Genesis 3.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Eve came into existence through Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Eve was able to receive life because Adam slept.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In the same manner, an aspect of the death of Christ is for the imparting of life to the church.</S>
