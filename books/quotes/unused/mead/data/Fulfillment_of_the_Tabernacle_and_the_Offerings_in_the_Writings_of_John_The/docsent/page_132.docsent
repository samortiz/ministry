   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>AN ABSTRACT OF THE BIBLE AND ITS EXTRACTS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The Gospel of John is an abstract of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Whereas the Gospel of John is an abstract of the Bible, the fulfillment of the tabernacle and the offerings is an extract of this Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Because the Bible is so long, we need an abstract of it in order to see a sketch of the whole.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then we need an extract of this abstract to see its essence.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In these messages our concern is with the extract of each chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>As we have previously pointed out, an extract may be understood as a liquid extracted from a plant or other organic matter and that contains its essence in concentrated form.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A synonym for extract is "spirit," which is the essence of a substance extracted in liquid form.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Wine, for example, may be regarded as an extract, or spirit, of grapes.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Whenever you extract the essence of a particular substance, you get the spirit of that substance.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The extracts of certain substances are sometimes used as medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We may say that the twenty-one chapters of the Gospel of John are a certain substance, and in these messages we are concerned with the extract of this substance.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Likewise, this extract may cheer us, or, like medicine, it may heal us.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We have pointed out that the content and reality of the universe is God's people as His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The universe may be compared to a shell, and God's people as His dwelling place, to the content of this shell.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Today God is building His people together to become His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This dwelling place is the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>According to the picture in the Old Testament, God's serving ones, the priests, dwelt in the tabernacle; that is, they dwelt in God's dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hence, the tabernacle is a mutual dwelling place, a dwelling place for both God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This dwelling place is the center and reality of the universe and also the center and reality of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>THE TABERNACLE AND THE LAMB OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We have pointed out that the Gospel of John is an abstract of the entire Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In this book we have the fulfillment of the tabernacle and all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have the tabernacle in the first chapter of John: "In the beginning was the Word and the Word was God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>And the Word became flesh and tabernacled among us" 1:1, 14 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This is a literal translation of the Greek.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, some versions are not literal in rendering verse 14 and use the word "dwelt" instead of "tabernacled."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But writing this Gospel under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, John selected the word "tabernacled" to indicate that Jesus, the very God incarnate, was a tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>While the Lord Jesus was in the flesh dwelling among men, He was tabernacling among them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Therefore, John 1:14 indicates that Christ is the real tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>First, He was God's dwelling place, and now He has also become our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This means that He is the mutual dwelling place of God and of God's chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Old Testament we have the type of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But in the Gospel of John we have the fulfillment of the type.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The type of the tabernacle in Exodus was a shadow or model; it was not the real tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The real tabernacle, the fulfillment of the type, is in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God incarnate is this real tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>As God in the flesh, Jesus is the real tabernacle in which God dwells and in which we also may dwell.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By this we see that the fulfillment of the type of the tabernacle is in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In chapter one of the Gospel of John we have not only the tabernacle but also the Lamb of God: "Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world" v. 29 . What is the Lamb of God? Here in John 1 the Lamb of God is the aggregate of all the offerings, the totality of the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In typology the offerings were a number of categories: the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering and the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In addition, there were the wave offering, the heave offering, the freewill offerings, and also the drink offering.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>But the basic offerings are the sin offering, the trespass offering, the burnt offering, the meal offering, and the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>All these offerings are represented in John 1 by the Lamb of God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Therefore, in chapter one of John we have the tabernacle and the aggregate of all the offerings.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>To say that in John 1 we have the tabernacle and the offerings means that in this chapter we have the tabernacle and the altar that is in front of the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Of course, the word "altar" cannot be found in this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Nevertheless, here we have the fact of the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Verse 29 tells us to behold the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Where did the Lamb of God take away our sin?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He did this on the cross, and the cross is the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, in John 1 we have the tabernacle and the cross, the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The altar is for the entry into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Apart from the offerings, we do not have a way to enter into the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lamb of God is the way for us to enter into the real tabernacle.</S>
