[2]  CHAPTER ONE THE TENT OF MEETING AND ALL THE OFFERINGS Scripture Reading: Gen 1:1, 26-27; 50:26; Exo 1:1; 40:34, 38; Lev 1:1-17; 6:8-13; Heb 10:5-7; 9:14a; Phil 2:7-8
[3]  The first important matter in regard to seeing Christ as the reality is to realize that Christ is the reality by which we worship God.
[4]  In the universe, the relationship between man and God is man's worship to God.
[5]  Whatever we are, whatever we do, and whatever we work must all be for the worship to God.
[6]  To take Christ as our reality means to take Christ as our being, our doing, our living, and even as our worship to God.
[7]  I believe that we know something of Christ as reality in a general way, but we are not so clear concerning Christ as reality in details.
[8]  After Exodus we need the book of Leviticus, because in the tent of meeting God wants to enjoy Christ as the reality.
[9]  The tent of meeting brings God to the earth.
[10]  "In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God and the Word was God And the Word was made flesh, and dwelt among us" John 1:1, 14 .
[11]  CHAPTER TWO GOD'S REQUIREMENTS AND GOD'S FOOD Scripture Reading: Lev 1:1-10, 14-17; 6:8-13; 7:8; Psa 20:3; Num 28:2
[12]  Note: In order to be more accurate according to the original language, changes should be made in the above verses.
[13]  Christ has brought God down to the earth by being the tabernacle, but without Christ as the offerings, we simply cannot meet the requirements of God.
[14]  Christ is the righteousness of God, Christ is the holiness of God, and Christ is the glory of God.
[15]  I was a Christian for years before I realized that God needs food.
[16]  Then one day I read Numbers 28:2, which says that the burnt offering is the bread of God.
[17]  God is hungry; God needs something to satisfy Himself, and this something is the burnt offering offered by His people.
[18]  If only you will stay in your spirit where you are one with Christ, there will be some killing, some flaying, some cutting into pieces, and some washing.
[19]  If we are one with Christ in the spirit, we will experience the killing, the flaying, the cutting, the washing, and eventually the burning until we become ashes.
[20]  CHAPTER THREE EIGHT POINTS OF THE BURNT OFFERING Scripture Reading: Deut 12:8-14; Lev 1:3, 7-10, 14, 16; 2 Cor 4:10-12, 16
[21]  God needs food to satisfy His hunger, and the burnt offering according to divine revelation is not just a kind of sacrifice, but food for God.
[22]  Leviticus 3:11, speaking of the burnt offering, says, "And the priest shall burn it upon the altar: it is the food of the offering made by fire unto the Lord."
[23]  This verse, along with Leviticus 21:6, 8, 21, and 22, shows us that the burnt offering is food for God.
[24]  But when ye go over Jordan, and dwell in the land which the Lord your God giveth you to inherit, and when he giveth you rest from all your enemies round about, so that ye dwell in safety; then there shall be a place which the Lord your God shall choose to cause his name to dwell there; thither shall ye bring all that I command you; your burnt offerings, and your sacrifices, your tithes, and the heave offering of your hand, and all your choice vows which ye vow unto the Lord: and ye shall rejoice before the Lord your God, ye, and your sons, and your daughters, and your menservants, and your maidservants, and the Levite that is within your gates; forasmuch as he hath no part nor inheritance with you.
[25]  The second of the four things which we need in order to properly present the offerings to God is the tent of meeting.
[26]  Without the church meetings, how could we present the burnt offering to God as His food?
[27]  You may enjoy Christ in your home tonight, and you may enjoy Christ in your home tomorrow morning, and you may enjoy Christ anytime in any place, but you can never present Christ as the burnt offering to God for God's food in any place other than the meeting of the local church.
[28]  The fourth point is that in presenting the burnt offering, we are one with Christ.
[29]  Yet, on the other hand, if we would present Christ as the burnt offering, we must be one with Him.
[30]  Now we come to the fifth point of the burnt offering: when we present Christ as the burnt offering in the tent of meeting, we have the full acceptance of God.
[31]  If we have been one with Christ during the day, when we come to the meeting we have something to present.
[32]  When we present Christ as the burnt offering, we have the deep sensation that we are fully accepted by God.
[33]  We have the full acceptance of God, and we have the full assurance that we are so pleasing to God.
[34]  When we are identified with Christ in our daily walk and we come to the meeting to present Him as our burnt offering, we are fully assured that God is pleased with us.
[35]  CHAPTER FOUR THE HUMANITY OF JESUS THE MEAL OFFERING Scripture Reading: Lev 2:1-16 Note: change the word "meat" to "meal" throughout this chapter.
[36]  We have pointed out that there are five kinds of offerings because we are in five situations before God.
[37]  Our first situation is that we are not for God; therefore, we need the burnt offering.
[38]  The burnt offering is Christ who is absolutely for God.
[39]  Now we come to our second situation before God, that is, we are not perfect and fine.
[40]  THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MEAL OFFERING AND THE MANNA
[41]  Now we must see something of the ingredients of the meal offering.
[42]  As we have mentioned, the main substance is the fine flour, which is derived from the vegetable life.
[43]  We must realize that the meal offering is mainly for us.
[44]  CHAPTER FIVE THE SPICES OF THE MEAL OFFERING Scripture Reading: Lev 2:4-16; 6:14-18
[45]  The oil, the frankincense, and the salt are the positive spices in the meal offering, but there are also some negative spices.
[46]  "No meal offering, which ye shall bring unto the Lord, shall be made with leaven: for ye shall burn no leaven, nor any honey, in any offering of the Lord made by fire" Lev 2:11 .
[47]  Leviticus 2 also reveals the different appreciations of Christ as the meal offering.
[48]  We have already seen this with the burnt offering.
[49]  Besides these three appreciations, there is the appreciation of the meal offering of the firstfruits.
[50]  "And if thou present a meal offering of thy firstfruits unto the Lord, thou shalt present for the meal offering of thy firstfruits green ears of corn roasted by the fire, even corn beaten out of fresh and full ears" Lev 2:14, lit.
[51]  CHAPTER SIX THE HUMANITY OF JESUS IN LUKE Scripture Reading: Lev 2:4-7; Luke 2:40, 49, 51-52; 3:21-22; 4:1, 13-14, 18a, 22a, 28-30; 5:15-16; 6:11-12; 9:55; 10:21; 11:53-54; 19:41, 47; 22:28, 44, 51, 61; 24:19 DIFFERENT DEGREES OF THE MEAL OFFERING
[52]  Before we consider the humanity of Jesus in Luke, I feel that we still need to consider the appreciation of the meal offering in different degrees.
[53]  We mentioned in the last chapter the different appreciations of the Lord Jesus as the burnt offering and the meal offering.
[54]  These books tell us to worship God by first coming to the unique place of unity Deut 12:5-8, 14-15 .
[55]  All these verses in Luke cover four main points.
[56]  First of all they show Jesus as the fine flour.
[57]  Second, we can see in these verses something of the oil.
[58]  He was born of the Spirit, and the Spirit even descended upon Him in the bodily form of a dove.
[59]  "Now when all the people were baptized, it came to pass, that Jesus also being baptized, and praying, the heaven was opened, and the Holy Spirit lit. descended in a bodily shape like a dove upon him, and a voice came from heaven, which said, Thou art my beloved Son; in thee I am well pleased" Luke 3:21-22 .
[60]  CHAPTER SEVEN THE HUMANITY OF JESUS IN MATTHEW, MARK, AND JOHN Scripture Reading: Matt 3:15; 4:4, 7, 10; 8:20; 11:29; 12:19-20; 17:27; 20:28; 21:27; 26:63-64; 27:12, 14; Mark 1:35; 3:20-21; 6:31, 39-40; John 6:12; 7:6, 46; 11:33, 35, 38; 13:4-5
[61]  The four Gospels give us a full picture of the Lord Jesus from four directions.
[62]  I believe we all know that Matthew reveals the Lord Jesus as the King.
[63]  The last Gospel, John, reveals that Christ is God Himself; He is the Son of God.
[64]  Many years ago, a Christian teacher argued with me, saying that we would all be kings when the Lord comes back.
[65]  Do you believe that we can be so sloppy in our humanity now, yet when the Lord Jesus returns He will suddenly make us a king?
[66]  Later on in Matthew the Lord Jesus says, "Take My yoke on you and learn from Me; for I am meek and lowly in heart" Matt 11:29 .
[67]  Jesus did not say that He was meek and lowly in appearance, but in heart.
[68]  In Matthew 20:28 the Lord said, "The Son of Man came not to be served, but to serve."
[69]  Later on in Mark 6, we see something more of the Lord's humanity.
[70]  CHAPTER EIGHT THE BOUNDLESS SUPPLY OF THE HUMANITY OF JESUS Scripture Reading: Gen 3:15; 22:18a; Gal 3:16; Rom 5:15b, 19; 1 Cor 15:21; 1 Tim 2:5; Heb 2:9, 14-18; Rev 1:13; John 19:5 TWO EXTREMES
[71]  In Christianity, there are two extreme views concerning the Person of Jesus.
[72]  The modernists talk much about Jesus as a man.
[73]  They say that Jesus was only a Jewish man, denying the Lord's divinity and not recognizing that He is the very God incarnated to be a man.
[74]  We must realize that although Christ is the Son of God, whatever He did, and all that He is today depends not only on His divinity, but even more on His humanity.
[75]  By the one man, Adam, we were all constituted sinners, but by another man, Jesus, we were all constituted righteous.
[76]  In Jesus all the nations are blessed, and through us as Christians, the people around us should also be blessed.
[77]  God told Abraham that through Christ all the nations would be blessed.
[78]  Now we must go on to see the supply of the Lord's humanity in Hebrews 2.
[79]  "Since therefore the children have partaken of blood and flesh, He also Himself in like manner shared in the same, that through death He might destroy him who has the might of death, that is, the Devil; and might release those who through fear of death through all their life were held in slavery.
[80]  Some Christians tried to argue with me in the past, saying it is wrong to tell people that Christ is in heaven as a man.
[81]  They said that Christ was a man only up to the time when He was crucified.
[82]  CHAPTER NINE THE MEAL OFFERING FOR THE STANDING BOARDS Scripture Reading: Exo 25:8, 9, 10a, 11; 26:15, 29; John 1:14a; Rev 21:2, 3; 1 Tim 3:15, 16; 1 Pet 2:4, 5; Eph 2:15; 4:24
[83]  After pray-reading the above verses, we can realize how much the church is something of humanity.
[84]  The church is in need of the proper humanity.
[85]  Now we need to read 1 Timothy 3:15-16.
[86]  "But if I delay, that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.
[87]  The next point that we must see is in 1 Peter.
[88]  Here the Apostle Peter tells us that Christ is the living stone, and we are the living stones.
[89]  CHAPTER TEN THE UNITING POWER FOR THE CHURCH LIFE Scripture Reading: Exo 26:26-29; Luke 15:22; Eph 1:13b; 4:2, 3; Acts 16:6, 7
[90]  We have seen how the tabernacle was composed of wooden boards overlaid with gold.
[91]  It is so clear that the tabernacle did not stand by the gold, but by the wood.
[92]  What is the difference between the sealing of the Holy Spirit and the keeping of the unity of the Spirit?
[93]  Many Christians talk about the Holy Spirit or the Spirit of God.
[94]  But have they ever heard of the Spirit of Jesus?
[95]  The proper translation of Acts 16:6-7 is this: "Now when they had gone throughout Phrygia and the region of Galatia, and were forbidden of the Holy Spirit to preach the word in Asia, after they were come to Mysia, they assayed to go into Bithynia: but the Spirit of Jesus suffered them not."
[96]  This is because the Spirit today is not only the Spirit of God, but also the Spirit of Jesus.
[97]  CHAPTER ELEVEN THE HUMANITY OF JESUS AND GIFTS TO THE BODY Scripture Reading: Psa 68:18; Eph 4:7, 8, 11-16
[98]  The previous seven chapters on the meal offering cover five major points.
[99]  We have seen that the meal offering is a present to God of the humanity of Jesus which we have experienced, enjoyed, and appreciated.
[100]  I believe we all know how Christ made such a rebel as Saul of Tarsus into an apostle.
[101]  Please do not misunderstand what I mean when I speak of the proper humanity.
[102]  I realize that some may think that we must simply be human.
[103]  Today the Lord Jesus is constituting certain members of His Body into the proper gifts to the Body, and He is doing this by the way of His humanity.
[104]  Therefore, the fastest way for us to grow is by feeding on the humanity of Jesus.
[105]  CHAPTER TWELVE THE HUMANITY OF JESUS FOR THE FLOWING OF LIFE Scripture Reading: John 7:37-39; Phil 1:19
[106]  In the last chapter we saw how the humanity of Jesus has so much to do with the making and producing of gifted persons.
[107]  Christ as the Head of the church received all the useful, gifted persons from the Father in the position of man.
[108]  It was about eighteen or twenty years ago when we began to see this matter in John 7:37-39.
[109]  At that time we began to minister these things according to what we had seen and experienced.
[110]  I was always a little hesitant, however, to say that today the Spirit of Jesus contains not only the divine element but also the human essence.
[111]  When poured out at Pentecost, He came as the Spirit of the glorified Jesus, the Spirit of the incarnate, crucified, and exalted Christ, the bearer and communicator to us, not of the life of God as such, but of that life as it had been interwoven into human nature in the person of Christ Jesus.
[112]  Stated in a simple and brief way, Jesus was God incarnated to be a man.
[113]  Now let us apply all these things in a practical way.
[114]  If we are drinking daily of the Spirit of Jesus, whatever we are will be a flow of life that will satisfy not only ourselves, but also others.
[115]  Such a flow of life is not a matter of speaking in tongues or the manifestation of gifts; nor is it a matter of power, knowledge, or teaching; rather, it is a life that is always drinking of Jesus.
[116]  To be a mother is a very human matter, but you should not be a mother by your own humanity, but by the humanity of Jesus.
[117]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN THE HUMANITY OF JESUS FOR THE SPIRITUAL WARFARE Scripture Reading: Gen 3:15; 1 John 4:2-3; Matt 4:3-4; 8:29; 2 Cor 10:1-4; 2 Tim 1:7; 1 Thes 4:3-4; 1 Cor 6:15, 18-19
[118]  We have seen six main things in the past chapters on the meal offering: 1 it constitutes the proper worship to God; 2 it affords the proper diet for the priesthood; 3 it produces the standing boards; 4 it forms God's house by uniting the boards; 5 it produces the proper gifts; and 6 it produces the flow of life.
[119]  Now in this chapter we must see that the humanity of Jesus is absolutely necessary for the spiritual warfare.
[120]  And as I do, I look to the Lord for the covering of His prevailing blood as I expose the enemy's tactics.
[121]  The issue of this kind of mental damage is of three categories.
[122]  Paul also says that every one of us should know how to possess his vessel in sanctification and honor 1 Thes 4:4 .
[123]  We all need to keep our body in sanctification and honor because our body is the temple of the Holy Spirit and a member of Christ 1 Cor 6:15-16, 18-19 .
[124]  CHAPTER FOURTEEN THE HUMANITY OF JESUS FOR THE CHURCH SERVICE Scripture Reading: 1 Tim 2:8-10; 3:2-3, 8, 11, 14-15; 4:12; 5:1-2; 2 Tim 4:22 THE DEFINITION OF SERVICE
[125]  In the local church the main feature is the service.
[126]  But when we say "service," we do not mean a kind of Christian meeting.
[127]  There is also something concerning the deacons in these two books.
[128]  First Timothy 3:8 says, "Deacons must similarly be grave, not double-tongued, not addicted to much wine, not seeking gain by base means."
[129]  We all need to be solid men and women with a proper humanity.
[130]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE HUMANITY OF JESUS FOR OUR DAILY WALK Scripture Reading: Titus 2:2-6; Gal 5:22-23; Phil 2:15; 4:8; Matt 5:13-16
[131]  We have seen that the humanity of Jesus is necessary for the spiritual warfare and for the church service.
[132]  If we would fight the spiritual warfare for the kingdom of God, we need a proper humanity.
[133]  God needs man to deal with His enemy, Satan, and this man is Jesus.
[134]  Before we are enlightened in the church, we may not admit that we are wrong; we may not admit any kind of evil or corruption in ourselves.
[135]  When Paul wrote these three books, the church was degraded, and under that kind of degradation, the need was not mainly for teachings or gifts, but human virtues.
[136]  CHAPTER SIXTEEN THE HUMANITY OF JESUS FOR THE LORD'S RECOVERY Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 3:1-5, 16-17; 2:21-22; 1:7; 4:22
[137]  The eleventh point concerning the humanity of Jesus is that it is necessary for the Lord's recovery.
[138]  We must realize that the letters written by Paul to Timothy and Titus were written for recovery, because at that time degradation had already occurred in the church life.
[139]  The first five verses of 2 Timothy 3 show us the situation that existed at that time: "But know this, that in the last days difficult times shall come; for men shall be lovers of self, lovers of money, boasters, arrogant, revilers, disobedient to parents, unthankful, unholy, without natural affection, implacable, slanderers, without self-control, savage, nonlovers of good, traitors, reckless, blinded with pride, lovers of pleasure rather than lovers of God; having a form of godliness, but having denied its power; from these also turn away."
[140]  The Lord is doing a recovery work in which He needs a people who realize and take Him as their humanity.
[141]  In the midst of the degradation of the churches and the corruption of society, we are here for the Lord's recovery.
[142]  CHAPTER SEVENTEEN THE HUMANITY OF JESUS FOR GOD'S KINGDOM Scripture Reading: Gen 1:26, 28; Ezek.
[143]  1:26; Dan 7:13-14; Matt 19:28; John 5:27; Rom 14:17; 1 Cor 6:9-10; Gal 5:19-21; Eph 5:3-5; Rev 20:4 IMAGE AND DOMINION
[144]  In the above verses, we can see from Genesis 1 to the end of Revelation that humanity has much to do with God's kingdom.
[145]  Let us look at Ezekiel 1:26: "And above the firmament that was over their heads was the likeness of a throne, as the appearance of a sapphire stone: and upon the likeness of the throne was the likeness as the appearance of a man above upon it."
[146]  Look at the corruption and lawlessness of today's situation, especially among the young generation.
[147]  First Corinthians 6:9-10, Galatians 5:19-21, and Ephesians 5:3-5 are verses which show us the humanity which is not fit for God's kingdom.
[148]  I do not even like to mention all these things; they are the negative side of human virtues.
[149]  These verses mean that if we do not have the proper human virtues, we are finished as far as the kingdom of God is concerned.
[150]  CHAPTER EIGHTEEN THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST AS OUR PEACE OFFERING Scripture Reading: Lev 3:1-17; 7:11-21, 29-34; Num 10:10; Deut 27:7; Col 1:20-22a; Rom 5:1; Luke 15:23
[151]  The past fourteen chapters have been on the meal offering, and I do believe that by them the Lord has shown us something of the humanity of Jesus.
[152]  The third point concerns the shedding of the blood.
[153]  The offering was killed on the altar by the presenter, and then the priest sprinkled the blood around the altar.
[154]  The fifth point is that the peace offering is a matter of joy.
[155]  "Also in the day of your gladness, and in your set feasts, and in the beginnings of your new moons, ye shall blow with the trumpets over your burnt offerings, and over the sacrifices of your peace offerings; that they may be to you for a memorial before your God: I am the Lord your God."
[156]  All the people of God who are clean are also entitled to enjoy the peace offering.
[157]  God's portion of the peace offering is the hidden part.
[158]  Besides these five parties, there is still another party, the cut-off ones.
[159]  "But the soul that eateth of the flesh of the sacrifice of peace offerings, that pertain unto the Lord, having his uncleanness upon him, even that soul shall be cut off from his people" Lev 7:20 .
[160]  CHAPTER NINETEEN THE PEACE OFFERING AND THE LORD'S TABLE Scripture Reading: Lev 7:14-21, 29-34; 1 Cor 10:16-18, 21; 5:11-13 THE NEED OF CLEANSING
[161]  The peace offering always mentions the sprinkling of the blood.
[162]  As we have pointed out, the sprinkling of the blood in the peace offering is not within the holiest of all, but around the altar where the people enjoy and partake of the peace offering.
[163]  This is because when we enjoy Christ, we need the sprinkling of the blood.
[164]  Another point concerning the peace offering is the difference in the appreciation of the Lord.
[165]  Suppose we are the people of Israel and we are having a feast in the tent of meeting.
[166]  Now we must see something more concerning the peace offering.
[167]  In the appreciation of Christ, there is another kind of difference.
[168]  CHAPTER TWENTY THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST AS OUR SIN OFFERING Scripture Reading: Lev 4:1-15, 22-28, 32; 6:25-30; 2 Cor 5:21a; Rom 8:3b; Heb 9:12; 13:11-12 FIVE OFFERINGS
[169]  This chapter will cover the sin offering, which is the fourth kind of offering.
[170]  When discussing the first offering, we pointed out why the five kinds of offerings were needed.
[171]  It is because, in the presence of God, we are in five kinds of situations or conditions.
[172]  Therefore, we need Christ as the One who is absolutely for God as our burnt offering.
[173]  But there is something more that we need to see.
[174]  At the time we repented to take the Lord Jesus as our Savior, we did not realize that we were so sinful.
[175]  We may have realized that we were not so good and that we had done many wrong things, but we never realized that we are just sin itself.
[176]  Whether we intend to do something sinful or we do not intend to do something sinful, we are just sin.
[177]  "And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Speak unto the children of Israel, saying, If a soul shall sin unwittingly against any of the commandments of the Lord concerning things which ought not to be done, and shall do against any of them: if the priest that is anointed do sin so as to bring guilt on the people; then let him bring for his sin, which he hath sinned, a young bullock without blemish unto the Lord for a sin offering" Lev 4:1-3, lit.
[178]  This is a picture, and it means that we must realize while we are enjoying the Lord as our burnt offering, meal offering, and peace offering, we are just sin.
[179]  For many years after I was a Christian, I could not understand how Christ took away my sins.
[180]  I was sinful, and I had committed many sins, yet Christ took away my sins by dying on the cross.
[181]  In the first sin offering, the blood must be brought into the sanctuary to be sprinkled in the presence of God, but with the second, this was not necessary; the blood only needed to be put on the four horns of the burnt offering altar.
[182]  Now we must see something concerning the vessel which is used to boil the sin offering.
[183]  CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE EXPERIENCE OF CHRIST AS OUR TRESPASS OFFERING Scripture Reading: Lev 5:1-19; 6:1-7; 7:7; 1 Pet 2:24; Isa 53:6b, 10a, 11b THE SIN AND THE TRESPASS OFFERING
[184]  The last of the five offerings is the trespass offering.
[185]  We must realize that not only have we committed sins, but we are also sin.
[186]  We may have never committed anything evil, but inwardly we are sin.
[187]  By now we all should be clear that we have two needs.
[188]  Whenever we come into the presence of God, regardless of whether we have done wrong or not, we are just sin.
[189]  Even if we have never done anything wrong, we still need Jesus as our sin offering.
[190]  If we would realize that we are not only sinful but that we also are sin and apply Jesus both as our sin offering and trespass offering, and if we would also be made absolutely right with God and with all others, we would all be so living, so prevailing, and so released.
