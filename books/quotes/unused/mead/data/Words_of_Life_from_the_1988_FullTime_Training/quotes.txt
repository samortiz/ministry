[1]  Words of Life from the 1988 Full-Time Training CONTENTS
[2]  CHAPTER ONE WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 8:2; 6:6; 8:10, 23, 6b, 4, 11, 13 OUTLINE The vision: The processed Triune God wanting to be our life Rom 8:2.
[3]  The old man of our tripartite man having been crucified with Christ Rom 6:6.
[4]  The consummated and completed Spirit of the Triune God making our spirit life and becoming our enjoyment of the firstfruit Rom 8:10, 23.
[5]  The Spirit of the Triune God, who passed through death and resurrection, giving life to our mortal body Rom 8:11.
[6]  From the Bible we see that the relationship between God and man, whether before man s fall or after man s fall, is a matter of the spirit.
[7]  After His resurrection, in one of His last meetings on earth with His disciples, He revealed to them the name of the Triune God, the name of the Father, the name of the Son, and the name of the Holy Spirit Matt 28:19 , declaring the Triune God in full.
[8]  The Spirit of God is not only the Spirit of the Triune God, but also the Spirit of the consummated and completed Triune God.
[9]  If you want to know how to experience God as your life, you must know all the things concerning God and man mentioned above.
[10]  For you to be a person who serves the Lord, the primary thing is not your way of doing things outwardly, nor your outward expression, but the kind of person you are.
[11]  At that time God did not give him any methods; rather, God led him step by step, showing him that what He wanted was his person, not his methods.
[12]  For this, He terminated the old man of our tripartite man with Christ on the cross in order that He as the Spirit of the Triune God could come into our spirit, making our spirit life for us to enjoy Him.
[13]  OF THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Heb 8:10, 11; Rom 8:6; 2 Tim 1:7; 1 John 2:27; Matt 12:36; Phil 2:14 OUTLINE The feeling of the spirit being the feeling of life.
[14]  This life is not our natural life, but the life of God.
[15]  Because the spirit is life and life is the spirit, the feeling of the spirit is the feeling of life.
[16]  CHAPTER THREE LIVING THROUGH DYING Scripture Reading: Gal 2:20a; Rom 8:13b; Gal 5:24-25 OUTLINE The important items in God s New Testament economy being fully accomplished facts: The Triune God having become flesh John 1:14.
[17]  Christ having accomplished the all-inclusive death Heb 9:26, 28; Rom 6:6a; Heb 2:14; John 12:31; Eph 2:15; John 12:24.
[18]  Christ having accomplished the resurrection which produced the firstborn Son of God and the many sons to be the church Acts 13:33; 1 Pet 1:3; Rom 8:29; Heb 2:12.
[19]  Christ having accomplished the ascension which made Him the Christ, the Lord, the Head, and the Savior Acts 2:36; 5:31.
[20]  Now there are two kinds of elements within the man God created: one is the good element which came from God s creation and bears God s image; the other is the evil element which came out of the evil one Satan and bears the evil nature of Satan.
[21]  Now let us examine a few obvious and important verses concerning this profound principle of living through dying.
[22]  First, Galatians 2:20a says, I have been crucified with Christ, and it is no longer I who live, but Christ lives in me.
[23]  According to God s economy, when Christ was crucified on the cross, I was also included in Him.
[24]  Hebrews 9:26 shows us that through the offering up of Christ as a sacrifice, He dealt with the sinful nature, that is, the singular sin within man.
[25]  Through our dying and living with Christ, we can experientially know His resurrection Phil 3:10a .
[26]  Therefore, as long as we are in Him, receiving and enjoying the fact of dying and living with Him, we can experience and know the resurrection of Christ.
[27]  Our knowledge of the resurrection of Christ becomes a kind of power that enables us to be conformed to the death of Christ, that is, to have the death of Christ as our mold of living Phil 3:10b .
[28]  Therefore, our daily life ought to be a life under the cross, in which our soul life is continually put to death, so that we may live by the life of God.
[29]  OF CHRIST S RESURRECTION 1 Scripture Reading: Phil 3:10; Eph 1:18-20a; Acts 2:23-24; Rom 6:9; 8:11; 1 Cor 15:45b; 2 Cor 4:10-12; Rom 6:4-5; 8:13b THE BASIC PRINCIPLE OF THE TRUTHS
[30]  In the universe, from the viewpoint of God s economy, God has two creations: one is the natural creation which is the old creation; the other is the resurrected creation which is the new creation.
[31]  After we believed into the Lord and were organically joined to Him, we were in Him and were crucified with Him; moreover, through the power of God s life, we were resurrected with Him.
[32]  In this message, we are not talking about the first kind of resurrection, which is resurrection without God s life; we are talking about the second kind of resurrection, the resurrection with God coming into us as life.
[33]  The first portion in Philippians 3:10 says, To know Him and the power of His resurrection and the fellowship of His sufferings, being conformed to His death.
[34]  After that, in our Christian life, the Lord put us into different situations such as our family life, the church life, the training center, the kingdom houses, or the brothers and sisters houses, in order that we would daily experience death and the power of His resurrection.
[35]  The third portion in Acts 2:23-24 says, This man, delivered up by the determined counsel and foreknowledge of God, you, through the hand of lawless men, nailed to the cross and killed; whom God raised up, having loosed the pangs of death, since it was not possible for Him to be held by it.
[36]  Romans 8:11 says, But if the Spirit of Him who raised Jesus from among the dead dwells in you, He who raised Christ Jesus from among the dead will also give life to your mortal bodies through His Spirit who indwells you.
[37]  The reality of the resurrection of Christ being the Spirit: Resurrection being the Spirit who raised Jesus from among the dead Rom 8:11.
[38]  The resurrection of Christ being manifested through His death where the death of Christ is, there being manifested the resurrection of Christ also Rom 6:4-5; 8:13b.
[39]  When the Triune God entered into resurrection, He became the Spirit.
[40]  The Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God.
[41]  In the same way that resurrection is this mysterious Triune God, the Spirit is also this mysterious Triune God.
[42]  Therefore, Matthew 28 records that after the Lord s resurrection and before His ascension, He charged His disciples to disciple the nations and to baptize them into the name of the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit v. 19 . The name of this complete Triune God is the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.
[43]  Therefore, if we want to know the power of Christ s resurrection, the important point is that we must first know this processed Triune God.
[44]  Now we can clearly see that the Christian life mentioned in the Bible is altogether a matter of life and death, a matter of being put to death to receive resurrection.
[45]  The Chinese Confucians made a thorough study concerning human beings, but they did not know God s salvation, nor had they received God s life.
[46]  When we were baptized into the Triune God, simultaneously we were baptized into the death of Christ v. 3 . Through baptism into death, we were buried with Him so that we can walk in newness of life v. 4 . When we passed through baptism and rose up from the death waters, we more or less had a sense of newness of life.
[47]  If our living is conformed to the shape of this mold of Christ, that is, if we die to our human life and live the life of God, we can experience and manifest the power of Christ s resurrection.
[48]  In the New Testament, there are some verses which clearly show us that the death of Christ comes first, followed immediately by the resurrection of Christ.
[49]  Verse 4 says, We have been buried therefore with Him through baptism into death that as Christ was raised from among the dead through the glory of the Father, even so we also should walk in newness of life.
[50]  This teaching concerning first dying and then living for the experience of the resurrection power is quite deep.
[51]  In 1932, the Lord raised up the church life in my home town, Chefoo.
[52]  CHAPTER SEVEN PRACTICING TO PROPHESY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:1-6, 12, 19, 23-25, 26, 31 OUTLINE The meaning of prophesying: Speaking for the Lord.
[53]  Verse 5 says, Now I desire that you all speak in tongues, but rather that you may prophesy; now greater is he who prophesies than he who speaks in tongues, unless he interprets, that the church may receive building up.
[54]  We may have a revelation of a prophet to show people the vision of God s eternal purpose concerning Christ being the mystery of God and the church being the mystery of Christ.
[55]  The five items listed in this verse, whether it is a psalm, teaching, revelation, tongue, or interpretation, are related to our speaking.
[56]  The truths denote reality, which refers to all the real things revealed in the Word of God, which are mainly Christ, the embodiment of God, and the church, the Body of Christ.
[57]  Therefore, from now on not only do you need to learn the Lord s word, know the truths of the Bible, and experience the Lord, you also need to practice speaking the Lord s word in all kinds of meetings and environments.
[58]  OF GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY Scripture Reading: John 16:12, 13, 15; Matt 28:20; Acts 2:42; 2 Cor 4:1; Eph 4:4 THE TEACHING OF GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY
[59]  Its content is the Triune God, who has passed through all the processes to be wrought into those who believe in Him, to make them sons of God and the members of Christ, that they may be constituted the Body of Christ.
[60]  For us to preach the teaching of the apostles today is to preach what the Lord Jesus preached, what the apostles preached, and what Paul and John preached.
[61]  If today we want to serve the Lord for our entire life, we need to serve in the teaching of the apostles, the New Testament ministry, the Body of Christ, and the churches of God.
[62]  THE LEARNING NEEDED IN THE BODY Not Disputing Who Is Great
[63]  As young people serving the Lord from your youth, you must learn the lesson never to have any ambition to be a leader in God s house.
[64]  When the Lord Jesus told the disciples that He would be handed over to man s hands and be killed, not only were the disciples not able to hear it, on the way they were even disputing who should be great and who should sit on the Lord s right hand and left hand.
[65]  Now that I am clear about the staying behind or leaving from the training of the full-timers next term, I would like to have a word of fellowship with you, or a charge to you before this term of training is over.
[66]  Brothers and sisters who have been trained and who hope to serve full-time their entire life still need to have further testing.
[67]  On the other hand, if you have been full-time for a while, and it has been manifested that the gift you have received from the Lord does not warrant full-time work for the Lord, it would be proper for you to return to a job and continue to serve the Lord on the side.
[68]  CHAPTER TEN A WORD OF CHARGE 2 Scripture Reading: 2 Tim 1:15; 4:10, 14; 2 Cor 6:8; 4:11; 1 Cor 16:9; Phil 2:19-22; Rev 2:4, 5, 7; Matt 10:24; 1 Tim 6:12; 2 Tim 4:1, 2, 5, 6, 7, 18
[69]  Following the last fellowship, I have some more unfinished words within me for you.
[70]  Paul told the saints in Philippi in the second chapter of Philippians, But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be of good cheer, knowing the things concerning you.
[71]  For I have no one like-souled who will genuinely care for what concerns you; for all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus.
