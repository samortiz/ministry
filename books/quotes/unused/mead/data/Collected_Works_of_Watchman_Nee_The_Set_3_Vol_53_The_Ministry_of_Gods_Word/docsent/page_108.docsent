   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Suppose we know what the Lord wants us to say.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It may be something long that cannot be expressed in one word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Perhaps seven or eight words are required.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Lord wants us to speak these words, but we are afraid that we will forget them.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Therefore, we try hard to remember them.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we come to the meeting, our mind is set on these seven or eight words.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We tell ourselves that we have to remember them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our heart is set on them, yet we often find that our memory does not serve us on that day.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Our spirit is not released.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The mere retention of the word in the mind is useless; such a word is powerless.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When it is released, the spirit does not move.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>With a minister of the word, the functioning of the memory has to be something very spontaneous.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we try to muster it artificially, it will turn the other way when the Spirit calls for it.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A minister of the word needs not only a perfect mind but a perfect memory.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Memory is like an electrical connection; as long as one end is broken, the electricity is cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When a certain part in our memory is blocked, the Lord's Spirit does not flow out.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As long as our memory is slightly cut off from the source, we are through.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we try to make our memory or mind the source, we are through.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Holy Spirit is the source, our mind and memory can become very useful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is when the Holy Spirit shines from within us that we realize how short our mind is.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When light is lacking in our spirit, we become very proud of our mind, memory, and eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These faculties may seem to be functioning very well.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But when we are enlightened by the Holy Spirit, we realize the uselessness of our mind, memory, and eloquence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the reason that we have to pray; we have to pray that our memory would become the memory of the Holy Spirit and that God's Spirit would be able to use it when He has need of it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When we speak, we may or may not be able to recall certain crucial words.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The difference here is very great.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we recall these words, the utterance will be released, and the spirit will be released.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But if we cannot recall these words, we will feel a burden like a big millstone upon our back.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This burden will weigh heavily upon us, and both the word and the spirit will be quenched.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We have to exercise total concentration in making ourselves available to the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We have to gather everything that we have experienced in our life, all the discipline that we have learned, all the things we have read and heard, all the revelation we have seen in our life, and all the teachings we have learned from the light.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to put them all before the Spirit and make them available to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They must be gathered together and made available at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Originally, we were like a house with all the windows open to the distracting noise and color outside.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Now the windows should be closed, allowing no outside influence.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All the things we have acquired in our whole life should be at the Spirit's disposal.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every time the ministry of the word is released in a strong way, the Holy Spirit takes up everything of our life and uses it within a period of five or ten minutes.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Ministry of the word involves a price.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Every release of the spirit involves a price.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The outer man has to be shut out; all the windows to the outside have to be shut.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have to focus all of our memory; our whole being has to be kept under strict surveillance.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>At the critical moment, we must make everything available to the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>When this happens, we will have a powerful ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There cannot be any disruption, distraction, or carelessness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We have to maintain our memory in top condition; our memory has to be on full alert every time we speak.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We have to gather up everything in a way that has never been done before during our entire life.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We should collect all the things of our life and make them available to the Holy Spirit all at once.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the duty of the memory in the ministry of the word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In order for the memory to have the adequate materials, we have to learn many lessons before the Lord and experience many things.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Ministry of the word is based on the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Without the discipline of the Holy Spirit, we do not have the supply, and we have nothing to say.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We receive the supply through the discipline of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As we increase our deposit gradually and continuously, there is room in our memory storehouse to keep the inventory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>But if we have only received a little discipline from the Holy Spirit, we will have few lessons to draw from.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>There will be little place in our memory to direct our inventory, and we will have nothing for the Spirit to draw from.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Therefore, the riches of the ministry of the word depend on the wealth of discipline that the minister receives.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The more the minister learns his lessons and receives discipline, the more room his memory possesses to maneuver the goods, and the more materials his mind has from which to generate the words.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In serving as a minister of the word, we must have substance to our words; we cannot speak vain words, and we must have enough memory to apply everything that we have learned in our lifetime to our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If God's Spirit is directing the speaking, everything we have learned in our life will be used.</S>
