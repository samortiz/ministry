<h2 class="head1">ALL THINGS BEING NOW READY</h2>
<p>In the Bible God likens His salvation to a dinner (14:16). Have you ever heard someone invite a guest, saying, &ldquo;I would like to invite you to dinner because I am concerned that you have nothing to eat&rdquo;? If someone invited me in this way, I probably would rather be hungry than eat dinner with him. We do not invite someone to dinner because he is in need of our dinner but because our dinner needs him. We invite people to dinner because we want them to come and enjoy our dinner, not because they are hungry.</p>
<p>It is not unusual for employees to refuse to work or for students to refuse to go to class, and it is not too strong to say that we often refuse God&rsquo;s invitation to dinner. This really grieves His heart. If we were to see God&rsquo;s need, we would realize that it is quite easy to be saved. This is because God needs man even more than man needs Him. If we see this, we will say, &ldquo;Thank the Lord, it was not me but God who was more concerned that I needed to be saved. It was not me but God who was more concerned that I needed power. It was not me but God who was more concerned that I needed faith. It was not me but God who was more concerned that I needed to be fervent.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We need to see that God truly needs us. Actually, there is no one who feels that he needs God, and there is no one who seeks God (Rom. 3:11). There is none. It is God who seeks man, and it is God who finds man. It is not we who want God; it is God who wants us. It is not we who choose God; it is God who chooses us. It is not we who love God; it is God who loves us. Our Lord was incarnated so that we could receive Him.</p>
<p>If we see that God needs us more than we need Him, we will realize that it is quite easy to be saved and to be faithful. We will even be able to say, &ldquo;O God, it is not me who needs You; it is You who needs me. It is not that I need Your grace because I am weak but that Your grace needs my weakness.&rdquo; We should be able, like Paul, to say, &ldquo;Most gladly therefore I will rather boast in my weaknesses that the power of Christ might tabernacle over me&rdquo; (2 Cor. 12:9). The power of Christ cannot be manifested without our weaknesses. We should thank God that our weaknesses give Him the opportunity to shine forth. Although we certainly cannot do anything without God, He cannot be expressed to others without us. The more Paul boasted in his weaknesses, the more God shined forth from him. Paul even declared, &ldquo;Where sin abounded, grace has superabounded&rdquo; (Rom. 5:20). It is not light bulbs that need electricity; it is electricity that needs light bulbs to express its power as light.</p>
<p>If you think that your children are so troublesome, you need to realize that the more children you have, the more opportunity there is for you to be connected to God, just as a light bulb is connected to electricity. If you are afraid of being bothered by people, you need to realize that every troublesome person whom you encounter is another opportunity to be connected to God. God supplies us according to our need. This is a principle. When we are weak, His strength can be displayed. When we fail, His victory can be displayed. When we are poor, His riches can be displayed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">&ldquo;COME, FOR ALL THINGS ARE NOW READY&rdquo;</h2>
<p>We need to come, for all things are now ready. There is no need for us to bring anything or to exert any effort, because the Lord has prepared everything for us. We should not only come but also open ourselves to fully enjoy Him. If a person is not saved, he needs to come and receive salvation, and if a person is saved, he needs to come and enjoy salvation. Some are saved but are not overcoming; some are saved but are not filled with the Holy Spirit; some are saved but are not living a heavenly life; some are saved but are without peace. We need to come as we are, without struggling and striving, no matter what our condition is. If we lack power, if we lack faith, or if we lack a fervent pursuit, we need only to come because all things are now ready.</p>
<p>One day two foreign soldiers came to the meeting place in Tsingtao to buy wine. The brothers who were there told them that the meeting place had no wine for sale. The soldiers were surprised because a verse written on the outside wall said, &ldquo;Come, for all things are now ready.&rdquo; They asked the brothers, &ldquo;Does this not mean that people can come and buy wine to drink?&rdquo; When they asked this, the brothers encouraged them to come and receive salvation. Like these soldiers, we need to come because all things are now ready. We need to come to the Lord with our sins and with our weaknesses so that we can meet His need to be expressed through us.</p>
