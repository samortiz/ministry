   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX BUILDING UP IN LOVE AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>KNOWING PEOPLE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>John 13:34-35 says, A new commandment I give to you, that you love one another, even as I have loved you, that you also love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>By this shall all men know that you are My disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The words know that you are My disciples can also be rendered know that you are those who follow Me. John 17:21 says, That they all may be one; even as You, Father, are in Me and I in You, that they also may be in Us; that the world may believe that You have sent Me. Verse 23 says, I in them, and You in Me, that they may be perfected into one, that the world may know that You have sent Me and have loved them even as You have loved Me. When people in the world see the oneness of the serving ones, they can believe that the Lord was sent by God, that He is the Christ of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This oneness is the oneness of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The above verses show that harmony in love is the characteristic of those who are built up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When people touch this characteristic, they can sense that these people are followers of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The characteristic of loving one another, the harmony in love, causes people not only to know that we are the Lord s followers but also to believe that the Lord is the Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In John 14 through 17 the Lord spoke of loving one another.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we study these chapters carefully, we can know the meaning of loving one another.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>LOVING ONE ANOTHER</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A believer who has not been built up by the Lord will not have genuine love toward people.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A new believer loves the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Although this love is of the Lord, it is a love at the beginning stage and cannot last, because it is not the love spoken of in the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Gospel of John love is an issue of a person s abiding in the Lord, fellowshipping with the Lord, and being one with those who belong to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who have been built by God have such a love.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Paul was one who had been dealt with by the Lord and built up by God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>His love toward all the churches, the brothers, and the co-workers did not come from his natural emotion, his good intention, or from having the same temperament as others.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The love that Paul had came from his being built up in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This love is seen in his Epistles through his words, attitudes, and actions, whether toward the churches, toward the individual believers, or the co-workers, and whether through rebukes or praise.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He had an anxious concern for all the churches.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a co-worker, church, or saint was weak, he also was weak.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they were stumbled, he was sorrowful and indignant over the cause of their stumbling 2 Cor 11:28-29 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>LEARNING TO BE CONCERNED ABOUT OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even though our situation is better than that of those in the world, there is a sense of love and concern among the serving ones that is lacking.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Someone may like a certain brother and have much coordination with him, but this is not love.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The Lord desires that we love one another even as He loves us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Lord s love toward us is not based on emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He does not love us because we are worthy of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We are not lovable, and we do not treat the Lord in a way that is deserving of His love.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we deserved His love and treated the Lord well, we might be deserving of love, but such a love could be based on emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>However, there is nothing in us that deserves to be loved; hence, the Lord s love toward us is not based on emotion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He loves us because we need His love.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There should be this kind of love among those who serve together and among the brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should not love the saints because they are lovable.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should not love a brother because he is nice to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should love the saints because they are our brothers and sisters and because we have been dealt with by the Lord; we have been built up by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We do not need to exhort the saints to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The more building there is among us, however, the more the characteristic of love and concern will be expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Then our administration of the church and our ministry of the word will produce results.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The brothers and sisters will love others also.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Whether or not the brothers and sisters can love others depends on the administration of the church and the person of those who minister the word.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Giving a message on loving one another might not be effective, but our administration of the church can cause the brothers and sisters to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sometimes the more we speak about loving one another, the less the saints love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In some churches those who minister the word never speak concerning love, but the saints love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The elders might not lead the brothers to love one another, but under their administration the brothers and sisters spontaneously love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This happens when the brothers who administrate the church have been built up by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is something in them that is concerned about others, loves others, and cares for them.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Let me give an illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>A brother in the workers home was sick for two days, but none of the other brothers visited him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The four brothers who normally eat breakfast with him did not seem to notice that he was missing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>They may have thought, I am not the one who is missing.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I will eat my breakfast and then take care of my business.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Can such a person serve the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>One who has been built by the Lord must learn to be concerned about others.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If there is the genuine love, the four brothers will immediately check on the condition of the brother who is missing.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is the proper thing to do.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we notice that a brother s socks are worn, we should find out if he has another pair.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If he does not, we should get another pair for him without letting him know who gave it to him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This is to love one another.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We have become degraded if we lack this kind of love for one another.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>It is useless merely to give appealing messages.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we observe that a certain brother always wears the same shirt, we need to find out whether he has any other shirts.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We must have this kind of concern for others.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If we do not have such a concern, it is difficult to serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>We may be able to administrate the church in an orderly manner, but there is no building up in our administration.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We may also be able to give messages, but the saints will not be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Knowledge puffs up, but love builds up 1 Cor 8:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>However, this does not mean that we should give messages on loving one another; rather, we must be dealt with and built up by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Then we will be concerned about others and love them.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When we purchase a pair of shoes, we should consider whether the brother who serves with us has another pair.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should also have this consideration when we purchase new clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Sadly, this is not the situation among us.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We should not take care of only our own living; rather, we should also take care of the brother beside us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This is a great and solemn matter.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Someone once accused me of using money to control others.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Such a word is an insult to me and to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The Lord knows that I have no intention to control the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>My only desire is for the needs of the brothers to be met.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>None of the brothers who serve should have needs in their living.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Simply giving things to others is not an indication of love.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>It can be a matter of emotions only.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We should have a love that is concerned for others and cares for them.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>If a brother is sick or a sister has a problem, we should feel as if we are the ones involved.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We must always think of the needs of our brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>When we buy a pair of shoes, we should think of our brothers shoes; when we have a suit made, we should think of our brothers suit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>We need this kind of consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We should not think that it is a loss to care for those who serve with us.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Even if we incur a loss, it is glorious.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>One who cares only for himself is quite poor; the poorest person is one who cares for himself the most.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>On the contrary, one who learns to care for others is rich.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If we care for others and bear their burdens, we are rich.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We should not bear merely our own burden.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should learn to also bear the burdens of others.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>By the Lord s mercy we should be able to testify that the more we bear others burdens, the more the Lord bears our burdens and strengthens us.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We should not be ones who serve the Lord without caring for those who serve with us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>If we care for those who serve with us, our ministry of the word and our administration of the church will be able to build up the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If an elder desires his administration of the church to bring in the building, he must learn to love and care for people.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>During one conference, there was a flu going around, and many people were sick.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>One of the brothers who did the cleaning was sick with the flu.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>I did not see him for several days.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>When I found out that he was sick, I went to visit him.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>When I saw him, I learned that no one had been taking care of him, not even those who shared the room with him.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>He was lying in bed with a fever and did not even have a cup of water.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>My heart was saddened when I saw the situation.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>If we are all like this, we do not need to speak or listen to any more messages, because they are useless.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>This brother was lying in bed with a fever, but everyone was indifferent to him.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>If a person who is indifferent becomes an elder or ministers the word, he can edify the saints but not build them up.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Edification is for the benefit of an individual; building up causes the saints to be built up together.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>God does not want to gain individual persons; rather, He wants to gain a building.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>God cannot use work that has only individual results.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>Our work must produce a corporate result in order for God s will to be carried out.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>A brother might not be able to give dynamic messages, but when he administrates the church, the saints are blended and built up.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>This is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>The church is a corporate, built-up entity.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>The gathering of several thousand people is not the church if they live independently and are not built together.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>God has no building among them.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>God needs the building, a corporate building.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>When brothers and sisters serve and meet together in love, their gospel preaching will be prevailing, and many will be brought to salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>In some meetings, however, the brothers and sisters lack power when they preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>There is no sense of building with them; there is only a sense of desolation and dispersion.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>A church in which the brothers care for one another has a future.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>When our concern comes from the Lord s building work within us and not from exhortation, we have the building.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>If the serving ones do not care for one another, we should not expect our work to result in the building.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Our love for one anther is not an emotional reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>Our love for one another should not be the issue of being nice to one another.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>When you are not sick and have no problems, I may not come to your room for two months, because you do not have a need.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>However, when you are sick and in need, I will definitely be by your side.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>If we genuinely love one another, we will be concerned no matter what our problems may be.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>There is genuine love for one another when we are concerned for each other.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>This is the issue of being worked on by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>The more a person has been worked on and built by the Lord, the more he is concerned for others, cares for others, and loves others.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Dead and lifeless things do not need love.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>In a house there is no need for the wood to love the bricks or for the bricks to love the tiles, because they are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>However, living things must love one another to stay together.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>In some localities even though the brothers are together, they are in discord and lack mutual love.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>There is no building among them.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Roommates who live in the same room and do not argue may still be in discord if they have not been built.</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>This is a sad situation.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>It is very sad when we only notice a brother s new socks but not his worn socks.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>The normal condition should be that we do not notice when a brother purchases new socks, but we notice his worn socks.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>If this is our condition, we can do a solid work.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>We need to love the brothers and sisters and care for them, but such a love should be based on their need, not our emotions.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>When they have a need, we have a need.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>We should learn to bear their burdens Gal 6:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>Then the administration of the church and the ministry of the word will bring much building to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>The building of the church is not an easy matter.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Bringing people to salvation and edifying them is easy, but building up the church is not that easy.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Bringing people to salvation and edifying them do not require us to learn lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>However, in order to build up the church, to build a group of people together, we must learn lessons.</S>
   <S PAR='152' RSNT='1' SNO='152'>For the elders administration to build up the church and for the ministry of the word to build up the church, we must pay attention to the points above.</S>
   <S PAR='153' RSNT='1' SNO='153'>If we do not learn these points, we should not expect our administration of the church and our ministry of the word to build up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='154' RSNT='1' SNO='154'>Some people think that the elders should be humble and careful and that those who minister the word should be cautious with their words.</S>
   <S PAR='155' RSNT='1' SNO='155'>This may be correct, but being humble, careful, and cautious is not what is important.</S>
   <S PAR='156' RSNT='1' SNO='156'>These qualities will not cause the brothers and sisters to have a high regard for us, much less to be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='157' RSNT='1' SNO='157'>Rather, their being built up depends on the practical points we have considered.</S>
   <S PAR='158' RSNT='1' SNO='158'>We need to learn these points and be equipped with them.</S>
