   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This book is a collection of messages given by Brother Witness Lee, a servant of the Lord, in Taipei in 1950.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It contains ten messages, covering the way for a saved person to progress in life: to be pure in heart, to remove all that covers God s light within him, to confess his sins, to ask for God s enlightenment, to consecrate himself to God, to deal with his conscience, to live before God, and to have a proper service in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These messages have been hidden for half a century; now that they are being published, the abundance of life contained in them is once again released.</S>
