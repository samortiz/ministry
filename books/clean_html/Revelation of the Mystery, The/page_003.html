<h2 class=head1>CHRIST AS THE EXPLANATION OF GOD AND THE UPHOLDER OF ALL THINGS</h2><p>God is a great mystery. A mystery is a story. A story that can be clearly explained is not a mystery. However, if there is a story that cannot be clearly explained, it is a mystery. A mystery is a story that cannot be made known or explained in a complete way. God is a mystery because although God is a story in the universe, no one can explain Him or describe Him thoroughly.<p>God is a mystery, and this mystery is in Jesus Christ. Jesus Christ is God’s mystery, God’s story. Do you want to know God? You must look at Jesus. Do you want to know more concerning what God is all about? You must come and see Jesus, and then you will know. Jesus is God’s story, God’s mystery. God has put all the fullness of His Godhead in Christ. Christ is the embodiment of God, the depository of God, and the expression of God. Christ is not merely God, He is God’s embodiment, depository, and expression. God is hidden, but Christ is expressed. God is inexplicable, but Christ is explained. If you do not understand God, who is a mystery, you only need to come and see Christ. Christ explains God, who is a mystery. Hence, Christ is God expressed, God explained, and God spoken forth.<p>John 1:1 says, “In the beginning was the Word.” The Word is God explained and God coming forth. This is Christ. You cannot find God outside of Christ. God has put all that He is in Christ. Ephesians 1:10 says, “Unto the economy of the fullness of the times, to head up all things in Christ.” God’s intention is to head up all things in Christ. Today God is still proceeding with this work of heading up all things in Christ.<p>When I stand, is it my two legs that support my body, or is it my head that holds up my body? Those with a shallow view will say that the feet and the legs uphold the body, but actually, according to the inner life, it is the head that holds up the body. If someone were to cut off your head, your body would immediately collapse and drop to the floor. Apparently, when I stand, it is my legs that support my body, but actually it is my head that holds up my body, heading up all the members in oneness. The head heads up and holds up the entire body.<p>Today the universe is in a state of collapse and disarray because it does not acknowledge Christ as the Head. The United Nations is actually a group of quarreling nations because not one nation acknowledges Christ as the Head. One day all the nations of the world will become the kingdom of our Lord and of His Christ (Rev. 11:15). At that time Christ will head up all the nations as their Head in order for God to be expressed. We all must see that God needs to obtain a corporate man to be His expression, and He also needs all things to be headed up in Christ as the Head.<h2 class=head1>CHRIST WITH THE CHURCH AS THE UNIVERSAL, GREAT MAN</h2><p>This corporate man is the Body, and Christ is the Head. Christ and this corporate man together form a universal, great man. The Head of this universal man is Christ, and the Body is the church. This universal man is God’s full manifestation, God’s full expression. This is God’s eternal plan, God’s eternal purpose.<p>We need to see that this is our destiny. Our destiny is not to make a fortune, to have a good family, or to have longevity, but to be the members of the corporate man with Christ as the Head to express God. This is the meaning of the universe, and this is the meaning of human life.
