   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR ALLOWING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO LIVE HIMSELF OUT OF US SPECIAL CONFERENCE 2</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Date:Evening, December 27, 1947</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Place:Hong Kong</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Speaker:Witness Lee</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Scripture Reading: Phil 2:12-13; 3:8-10 GOD'S PURPOSE IN MAN WORKING HIMSELF INTO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If we read through the Old and the New Testament, we will see that God has one specific purpose in man.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether in creating man or in redeeming man, God desires to achieve this purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This purpose can be considered the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If a man does not meet this purpose while he lives on earth, he will feel empty.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even a Christian who does not see this purpose will feel that his life is meaningless.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>God has shown us in many ways through His word what this purpose is.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's purpose is to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>At the end of Revelation we are told that in the new heaven and new earth, when God's work is completed, He will have worked Himself completely into man.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>By that time, God will be fully in man, and man will be fully in God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God and man will become one.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We may think that we were destined for perdition and hell.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>After we are saved, we may think that now, as a saved person, we are satisfied as long as we can go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>However, this is not the highest purpose of God, His ultimate purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God's highest purpose, His ultimate purpose, is to work Himself into man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>SALVATION BEING GOD ADDED INTO MAN</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>God created man according to His image Gen 1:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is the meaning of an image?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>When you see a picture, you recognize the person represented by the picture.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There are many great men in this world; it is difficult for us to meet them face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>However, we can recognize them from their pictures.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Man is God's picture.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>At the time of creation, man had only God's image; he did not have God's life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>At that time, man bore only God's outward appearance.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>After he is saved, he possesses God's life as well 2 Pet 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Salvation means that God comes into us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>By this, we become a man with God, having received nothing other than God and nothing less than God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Salvation is not a matter of turning an evil man into a good man, or turning a filthy man into a clean man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>No matter how much man cleanses himself, he is still only a man.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The meaning of salvation is God added into man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Man's number is seven, and seven is three plus four.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Four is the number of the creatures, and three is the number of God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Three plus four means God added into man.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In 1932, I was meeting in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There were many people in my denomination, and not a few were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One older gentleman was a professional man in the law.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Although he was old, he was very healthy.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>I noticed him in the services, but I had never had a chance to talk to him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>One day I met him on the street, and I asked him, "Have you believed in the Lord?"</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He told me happily that he had.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I asked, "Are you saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He said that he was.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I then asked, "How do you know that you are saved?"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He said, "I know I am saved because God and I have become one."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This word was marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Even if you were to give the whole world to me, I would still be one individual person, an empty person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But one day I was saved, and God entered into me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>From that time on, the two became one.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is like an electric light.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before the switch is turned on, the light does not shine.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But once the switch is turned on and the electricity comes, the light comes on.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we are saved, God is added into us.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The two have become one.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is not something for the future, but something that is for the present.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What does this mean?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>It means that God is added into man.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In the future, who will the perishing ones be?</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The perishing ones will be those who are empty, those who do not have God inside them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Who are the saved ones?</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They are the filled-up ones, those who have God inside them.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>On the day of salvation, God entered into us.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Many times, I considered myself an evil person.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Sometimes I have even hit myself.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>But then I would remember that the God within me is marvelous.</S>
