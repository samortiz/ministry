   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WAY TO BUILD THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Eventually in the Gospel of Matthew, He says, I will build my church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>And I say also unto thee, That thou art Peter, and upon this rock I will build my church; and the gates of hell shall not prevail against it Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>What is the way to build the church?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It is by Jesus getting into you and me.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>To build the church is not simply to bring people to the Lord, that they may obtain some kind of church membership.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>No, to build the church is to dispense Christ into people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Then, once Christ is in us, He will transform us from our natural being into something else.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Old things will pass away, and all things will become new.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We are transformed from our old being into something new.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Then we are part of the New Man, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Whatever Jesus did and whatever He was called were for the purpose of dispensing Himself into a group of people that they might be transformed from their old natural being into something new to be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>THE NEGLIGENCE OF RELIGION AND POLITICS</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>TO THE NAZARENE</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Gospel of Matthew, Jesus is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He is the son of David, a king.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>And He is the son of Abraham, the first generation of the Hebrew race.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>He is also Emmanuel, God with us.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>And He is Jesus, Jehovah the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In chapter one He is the son of David, the son of Abraham, Jesus, Emmanuel, Jehovah the Savior.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But in chapter two, we immediately see the negligence of religion and the persecution from politics towards this wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Religion did not pay attention, but politics came in to persecute.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Jesus is such a wonderful person for the producing of the church, but if we really mean business with the Lord for His purpose, our destiny today will be the same.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If He has come into us and we are one with Him, our experience will be the same as His.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The influence of religion and the power of politics constitute almost the whole of human society.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we mean business with the Lord for Him and for His church, religion will neglect us, and politics will persecute us, just as they did to the Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then we will become Nazarenes.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is what happened to Jesus, even as a young child.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But when he heard that Archelaus did reign in Judea in the room of his father Herod, he was afraid to go thither: notwithstanding, being warned of God in a dream, he turned aside into the parts of Galilee: and he came and dwelt in a city called Nazareth: that it might be fulfilled which was spoken by the prophets, He shall be called a Nazarene Matt 2:22-23 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To be a Nazarene is to be a person under the negligence of religion and the persecution of politics.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The religious will say that we are very little, and the political people will say that we are nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We are nothing, and we are nobody.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is what it means to be a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Nazarene life is for the church.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The church is produced by a Man who is called a Nazarene.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>FULFILLING ALL RIGHTEOUSNESS</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This wonderful person is despised, opposed, and persecuted by man, but He is perfect in the eyes of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In everything related to God, He is right.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>And Jesus answering said unto him, Suffer it to be so now: for thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness Matt 3:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Righteousness is simply to be right with God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Suppose you park your car in a no-parking zone.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>That is unrighteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We should realize that we have Jesus as our life, and Jesus is righteous in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If there is no righteousness, there is no church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Suppose you give a dollar for a forty-five cent hamburger, and you are given three quarters in change.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What shall you do?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>You may consider that you got a cheap hamburger.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You may gain twenty cents, but if so, you lose Jesus life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Jesus is right in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you are taking Him as your life, you will return the twenty cents.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>For thus it becometh us to fulfill all righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Perhaps you are working in an office.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many office workers take the company s paper, pencils, and erasers home for their own use.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Of course, you may say that this means nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But if it means nothing, why don t you buy some paper, pencils, and erasers and bring them to the office for the company to use?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>You would never do that.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Jesus would never take anything away from the office.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He is right in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It becomes Him to fulfill all righteousness.</S>
