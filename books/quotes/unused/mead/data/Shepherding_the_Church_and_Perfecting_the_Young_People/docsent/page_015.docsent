   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHANGING OUR CONCEPT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>AND LEARNING TO TEACH OTHERS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There are different ways to teach.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For example, a Chinese mother teaches her child in a way that is different from an American mother.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>I know a Chinese family with three daughters.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Because the mother felt that none of her daughters knew how to do house chores, she did all the chores.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>American families are different.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From an early age the children learn to do chores.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>As soon as a child learns to walk, his parents teach him to do chores.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From generation to generation they have taught their children in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Chinese parents do not know how to teach their children, because they themselves were not taught.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the United States children do chores from their youth.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The children are taught to bring in the newspaper.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>As the children grow older, they are taught to water the flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Initially, the children may make a mess in the garden.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>After a few times, however, they find the proper way to water the flowers.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>By the time the children are seven or eight years old, they are taught to sweep the floor or to vacuum.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The children are even taught how to set the table for a meal.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>They place napkins, plates, and knives and forks on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, the children all have chores to do.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In some homes the mother has to go to work in the morning, so she leaves a note for her children, telling them what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For example, she tells them to wash up, eat breakfast, get dressed, and go to school.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When the mother returns home in the evening, she will check to see that the children did as they were told.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The children are taught in this way from an early age.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Washing the dishes is another example.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>After dinner there are usually many dishes.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The mother will prepare soapy water and let an older child wash the plates, forks, and knives.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A younger child is responsible for drying them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Another child must put everything in its designated place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>According to their ages, the children are assigned tasks.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Every child is assigned a specific job.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This saves time and is very orderly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The children do their tasks without any noise or confusion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This kind of training is very good.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>American parents know how to do things, and they know how to teach their children.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In contrast, Chinese parents do not teach their children and often rebuke the children for making mistakes.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our work bears the same flavor.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We must have a thorough turn.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Beginning from the simplest things, we must teach the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We must have a change.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Some brothers said that the situation would change if we lead the saints to pray and have a revival.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This method may be useful for a short time, but it will not be useful in the long run.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many Christians have revival meetings; however, after the revival, the excitement ends.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Eventually, the saints still do not know how to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We do not have a great need for a revival, because we all love the Lord and contact Him daily.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Instead of praying for a revival, we need to learn how to teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Our learning depends on whether we are willing to make an effort.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>We must learn from the American families so that we can do things and also teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>THE CO-WORKERS TEACHING THE ELDERS AND PERFECTING THE SAINTS</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We need to change our concept, be willing to learn, and be patient.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We need to teach others to do what we do.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then many saints will be raised up as apprentices.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The first ones whom the co-workers should teach are the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The elders may be older and may consider themselves to be qualified and experienced, but they may also admit that they do not know how to perfect the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They have been meeting and discussing church affairs for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Nevertheless, not many elders know how to bring the saints into the service, because the elders did not learn in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The co-workers should teach the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The co-workers must spend the time to teach the elders until the elders can do things better than the co-workers, but the elders must be willing to be taught.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The co-workers should teach and perfect the elders and the saints to fulfill their respective functions.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A local church is under the administration of the elders, and it receives teaching and shepherding from the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>For this reason, the elders should endeavor to bear the responsibility of administrating, teaching, and shepherding.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Administrating is relatively easy, but shepherding is not easy, because it includes supplying the word, visiting the saints, and contacting people.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>There are many things for the elders to do.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Some elders are very busy with their jobs and attend numerous meetings; hence, they often have the heart but do not have the strength to shepherd the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Some elders are older; they are in their sixties or seventies.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>According to the standard in the world, this is the age for retirement.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Their strength is fading, and it is not easy for them to learn new things.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These are two problems: the elders who have jobs are entangled, and the elders who are older are short of energy and stamina.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The elders who are between thirty and forty are able to learn new things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>If we want a church to spread, we must have elders who serve full time and elders who are trained.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The elders need to endeavor in shepherding and teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We have studied the Bible many times and have found that a local church should not depend on the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The early churches relied on the elders.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>This is not our situation or the situation in the denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We rely too much on the co-workers.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>A family cannot depend on a professional cook to prepare its daily meals.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>A family depends on the parents for meals.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The elders must endeavor to learn to do things, and they must also learn to teach the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Otherwise, we will remain in our present situation.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Without the co-workers teaching the elders and the elders teaching the saints, it will be difficult for us to have a breakthrough.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>We must change our system and change our concept.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>We must teach and train the saints in order for them to be useful.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Otherwise, no matter how much we preach the gospel, it will be difficult for us to gain the increase.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The only way out of our present situation is for the co-workers and elders to change their concept and begin teaching the saints how to do things by giving them responsibilities.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Then the elders who are older will not be so tired, because they will not be required to do as much; they will teach others and delegate many things to the younger saints.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>This is the way that we must take.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This is also the basic problem that we must resolve.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The co-workers must learn how to teach others, and the elders must be willing to learn so that they also can teach others.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This is the need in Taipei and also in Kaohsiung.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The elders and co-workers can only do so much.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>We must be willing to ask the saints to come and help so that we will be able to carry out the burden of increase.</S>
