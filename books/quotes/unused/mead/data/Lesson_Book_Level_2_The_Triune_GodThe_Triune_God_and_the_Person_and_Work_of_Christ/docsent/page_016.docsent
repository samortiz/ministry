   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE GOLDEN LAMPSTAND</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>SYMBOLIZING THE TRIUNE GOD</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Exodus 25 describes the golden lampstand in the tabernacle.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This lampstand is a marvelous picture of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We cannot understand this symbol in a shallow way: it is not just an object that holds some lamps to give light in the dark.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>With the lampstand we see three important things: the gold, the stand, and the lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>First, the lampstand was made of one talent of pure gold about 100 lbs. which was beaten into the shape of the stand.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>On its top it had seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The substance or essence of the lampstand, then, was gold.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Bible, gold stands for the nature of God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Unlike iron, gold will not rust or change chemically, no matter where it is put.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God's nature is constant, unchanging.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The gold, then, represents God the Father as the essence and source.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Second, the golden lampstand was not just a formless lump of gold.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>It was gold formed and shaped into the form of a lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This means that the gold was embodied into a shape; the shape is God the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in the Second of the Trinity bodily Col 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Jesus Christ is the form of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Third, there is the expression of the lampstand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The lampstand is for shining, and the shining is the expression.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The expression is the seven lamps.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Bible tells us that the seven lamps are the seven Spirits of God Rev 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The lampstand, then, also symbolizes the Triune God expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Its substance is the Father, its form and shape is the Son, and its expression is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What a wonderful picture of the Triune God the gold, the shape, and the shining.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This lampstand is seen throughout the Bible until it appears finally in the last book, Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In Lesson Twelve we will see how the lampstand in Revelation shows something even more wonderful about the expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>V. THE TRIUNE GOD AS REVEALED</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>BY THE CLEFT ROCK</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The cleft split rock in Exodus 17 is a picture showing us that the Triune God is for our enjoyment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The children of Israel were journeying in the wilderness but had no water to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord told Moses to smite hit the rock for water.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When Moses struck the rock with his rod, water flowed out for the thirsty people to drink.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>First Corinthians 10:4 says, "The rock was Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moses with his rod represents the authority of God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Moses' striking the rock shows us that when Christ died on the cross, He was judged by the authority of God's law.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the eyes of God, the Lord Jesus was put to death not by the Jews, but by the law of God.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The water, of course, shows us the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Just as the water issued out of the smitten rock, the Spirit issued out of the judged Christ John 19:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The Israelites could not have the water without the smitten rock, and we cannot have the Spirit without the judged Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John 7:37-39 shows us that the Spirit would be available for anyone to drink after Christ was judged on the cross for our sins and resurrected to be the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Praise the Lord for Christ our smitten Rock!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He was judged on our behalf that we might enjoy the eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>That life is now in the Spirit and we were all given to drink of that Spirit 1 Cor 12:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Do you ever have hardships?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Are you ever dissatisfied?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Do you ever complain?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>These are signs of being "thirsty."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>You need to drink!</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>No one can live without water.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As Christians, we need to drink the living waters of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Do you realize you have a Rock in your spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>"Oh, Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Oh, Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>You are my smitten Rock!"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord Spirit will revive us, refresh us, and make us living.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We hope you realize by this lesson that the Old Testament is not just some stories about the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Together with the New Testament it unveils to us the infinite riches of the Triune God and we have only covered a few points out of hundreds of pages!</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The pictures in the Old Testament greatly help us appreciate and enjoy the Triune God; each one is surely worth a thousand words.</S>
