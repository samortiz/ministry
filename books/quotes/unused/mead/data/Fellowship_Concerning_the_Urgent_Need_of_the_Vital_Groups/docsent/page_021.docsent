   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FELLOWSHIP CONCERNING THE URGENT NEED OF THE VITAL GROUPS MESSAGE NINE THE VITAL GROUPS IN THE CHURCH LIFE 3 Scripture Reading: John 17:19-21; 13:34-35; Acts 2:42-47 PRAYING IN A NEW WAY TO MEET THE NEW NEED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>For the vital groups, the first thing is our prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Thus, the first matter in this training will be to train the vital group members concerning how to pray in the new way to meet the new need.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First, we should not repeat our old prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Our way of prayer has become a form; week after week we pray in a habitual way, repeating the same prayers to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such prayers are not genuine prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we pray, we should simply tell the Lord directly what we want: Lord, we want to be revived.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We are dead and cold.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We want to be burning.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>To say this much is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the Bible we cannot find any example of habitually repetitious prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In Luke 18:41 the Lord Jesus asked the blind man, What do you want Me to do for you?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The blind man answered, Lord, that I may receive my sight!</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Lord said to him, Receive your sight, and instantly the man received his sight vv.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>42-43 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the Lord s table meeting we can pray, Lord Jesus, You are so fair.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You are the chief among ten thousand; I love You, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There is no need for us to pray long prayers in which we teach, explain, and expound the Scriptures to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We all need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>No one should excuse himself by saying that he does not have the burden to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>How can human beings not have a burden to pray?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We all need God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If we need to breathe, we need to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We need to pray just as we need to breathe.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Nearly everyone eats three meals a day without having any special burden.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, we should not take the excuse that we do not have the burden to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We need to learn to pray in a new way and to pray new prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We need the Lord to come and stir us up that we may pray in a new, refreshing, and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In our prayer there is no need for us to tell the Lord what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we desire to be revived by the Lord, we should simply ask Him to revive us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We may pray, Revive me, Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>I am pitiful.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I need You to revive me.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He does not need us to tell Him what to do.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Our telling the Lord what to do is not prayer; it is instruction.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Often the prayers in the church prayer meeting are composed of repetitious words, telling the Lord what to do and explaining the situation to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In the four Gospels the Lord Jesus did not pray in this way Matt 6:7-13; John 17 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In Ephesians the apostle Paul prayed two prayers 1:17-23; 3:14-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In those prayers he did not give any instructions to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Rather, he prayed, he begged, and he entreated.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Let us learn this way.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In praying for the matter of fruit-bearing, some of the saints have prayed, Thank You, Lord, You are the vine and we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>You are the fruitful One.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We command You to bear fruit in all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We do not need to tell the Lord that He is the vine and we are the branches.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is no need for such explanation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can simply pray, Lord, we are so barren.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We hate our barrenness.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Deliver us from this sin, or Lord, forgive me; I do not bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Lord, have mercy on me.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Burden me and even press me to bear fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We need to relearn how to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We have been spoiled by the condition of the church and have picked up many bad habits, yet we think that these are good.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, our habitual way is not good.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>We have been praying that way for years.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>What has been the result?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In an entire year we might not have borne ten remaining fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>In his prophecy Haggai, speaking for the Lord, said to God s people, Consider your ways 1:5, 7 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We surely need to reconsider our way.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Before we open our mouth to pray, we should consider carefully what we should say.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not pray anything in the habitual way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>When we say, Lord Jesus, I praise You, we must mean that we praise Him.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Instead of Lord, I praise You, the Lord may lead you to say, Lord, I just worship You.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When you say that you worship the Lord, you should mean it.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Often when certain saints begin their prophesying, they say Praise the Lord several times.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This is a bad habit.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is meaningless and simply wastes time.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>I beg you to take my word concerning your prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>RECOVERING THE DYNAMIC MOTIVATION</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>OF THE LORD S DYNAMIC SALVATION</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Now we are desperate with the Lord to have a new beginning with a new start by first building up the vital groups.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should fully realize that the church as the Body of Christ is definitely a group of the believers of Christ who have been saved by His dynamic salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I believe that from the first day, the salvation that I received was dynamic.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>I was saved dynamically.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>At that time I gave up the world.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I told the Lord that I did not want anything from the world.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I just desired to follow Him, to take a Bible and travel through all the villages to preach Him.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>From that day until today I have never had any change.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>A dynamic motivation was in me and has been in me all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Even today I am here, burdened and laboring for the Lord s interest.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The recovery has been damaged.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Thus, we need a real revival.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We all need to recover the situation in which we came into the recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>That is to overcome the leaving of the first love, which is actually the best love.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>To recover the first love, or the best love, is to give the Lord Jesus the preeminence, the first place, in everything Col 1:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>If we give the preeminence to the Lord Jesus in everything, surely we will gain Him.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He is the best love; He is the super-excellent love.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>This is all that we need.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Again I would like to say that the church is a group of people who have been dynamically saved by God.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>We need to be continually under this kind of dynamic motivation.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>A proper Christian, an overcomer, is one who is constantly under a dynamic motivation.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This we must pray to recover.</S>
