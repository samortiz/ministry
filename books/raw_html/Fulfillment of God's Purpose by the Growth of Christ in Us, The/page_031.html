<H1 CLASS=MSG>CHAPTER EIGHT</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE DEVELOPMENT OF LIFE<br>FOR THE EXPRESSION OF LIFE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: 1 Thes. 2:14; 1 Cor. 4:17; 7:17; 11:16; 14:33; Rev. 2:7a, 11a, 17a; 2 Pet. 1:1, 3-5; Eph. 5:18-22; Col. 3:16-18</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE CORPORATE BUILDING</H2><P>Life builds, and this building is not just a local matter, because a local church is a part of the Lord's Body. The Body of Christ is universal, including all the local churches. So if we are continually in the process of growing, we will be built together in our locality, and all the local churches will be built together as one. This does not mean that all the local churches have to be organized into one. Although the churches are local in their administration, they are all the parts of the Body of Christ, and every local church is a local expression of the Body of Christ. Thus, in principle, all the local churches must be the same. All the local churches must follow one another (1 Thes. 2:14).</P><P>The apostle did not have different teachings toward different local churches. He taught the same thing everywhere in every church, and he commanded the same thing in all the churches (1 Cor. 4:17; 11:16; 14:33). In Revelation 2 and 3 there are seven epistles from the Lord to the seven local churches respectively, yet the end of each epistle says, "He who has an ear, let him hear what the Spirit says to the churches" (2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22). Each epistle is written to one definite local church, but that particular epistle is also for all the churches. This implies that all the churches, as the Lord's testimony in the Spirit, should be the same.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>HOW LIFE WORKS IN US</H2><P>Now we want to see how life works in us to grow, transform, renew, save, and build. We need to see the concept of God in His divine economy. Our natural concept is always different from God's concept. We consider either that God does everything for us or that we do everything, but God's way is higher than ours.</P><P>Second Peter 1 gives us a clear picture of how God's life works. First, God has given us all things pertaining to life within and godliness without (v. 3). But on the other hand, verse 5 says that we have to use diligence to develop what God has given: "And for this very reason also, adding all diligence, supply bountifully in your faith virtue; and in virtue, knowledge." The word adding means to develop.</P><P>Faith is like a seed, and this seed needs to be developed. God created the seed and has given us the seed. Now on our part we have to be diligent. We have to use our diligence to sow the seed. To sow the seed is to have the seed developed. After sowing the seed, we have to water it. Then the seed will grow. Out of the seed, the roots develop. Out of the roots, the stump develops, and then the branches, the leaves, the blossoms, and the fruit develop. This is a step by step development of life.</P><P>Neither God nor we do everything. On the one hand, God has created the seed and has given us the seed. On the other hand, we have to sow the seed, water it, and take care of it. Then it grows step by step until we have the fruit and the harvest. This is the way that life works. This is a life principle.</P>
