   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FOUR LAYERS OF OPPOSITION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WHICH CHRIST OVERCAME</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN HIS TRANSCENDING</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We need to realize that in the universe there are four layers of opposition, four layers of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The first layer is Hades with death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This is the bottom layer of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hades with death retains people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Hades even sends out death to gather and grasp people.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When death comes, no one can resist it.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>So death captures people and brings them into Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Hades becomes a prison and the gates of Hades retain people.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No one can open these gates, and no one can overcome them.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Within these gates there are many dead persons, and no one can come out of them.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But the Lord Jesus said, "I will build My church, and the gates of Hades shall not prevail against it" Matt 16:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the universe there is a struggle going on between the gates of Hades and the dead ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Lazarus and the rich man are there Luke 16:19-31 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The rich man was struggling to get out of Hades, but the gates would not release him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is the first layer of the problem in the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The second layer is the human world.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ephesians 1 says that when Christ ascended to the heavens, He transcended above all the human names, names at His time and names in the ages to come Eph 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>History tells us that since Christ's time, many big names have risen up against Him and against the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Caesar Nero was the strongest one.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Napoleon was one, and Hitler became one.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But Christ ascended far above every name that is named.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>First, He rose up from the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many dead persons were struggling to get out of the gates of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They could not do it, but Christ could.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>He rose up, the gates of Hades opened for Him, and He came out of Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He resurrected from the dead to overcome Hades.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then in His ascension, He transcended above all the names, not only the big names opposing Christ and His church but also the small names.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We were there among the small names opposing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He transcended above us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is another layer of trouble which Christ overcame.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Russia, Lenin began a kind of revolution against God and against the church.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Eventually, after just seventy years, who defeated whom?</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Christ defeated Lenin.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Jesus transcended above all the names.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>No one can oppose Jesus on this earth without being defeated.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The third layer of trouble is in the air.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the air is the power of darkness the rulers, the authorities, the power, and the lordship in the air Eph 1:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In the air among the angelic race there are rulers, authorities, power, and lordship, good ones and bad ones.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Even on the earth among human beings there are also the rulers, authorities, power, and lordship see Eph 1:21 and note 211 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We also need to see that the fourth layer of trouble is in the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even the third heaven was polluted by Satan's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The book of Job tells us that Satan appeared in the third heaven before God at a heavenly council, accusing God's people 1:6-12a; 2:1-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Thus, even the third heaven needs to be under the feet of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Hebrews 4:14 tells us that Christ passed through the heavens, and 7:26 tells us that He has become higher than the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He is not only higher than Hades, than the earth, and than the air but also higher than the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Therefore, Christ actually passed through four layers: Hades, the earth, the air, and even the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ had to transcend through Hades, through the earth, through the air, and even through the third heaven to reach a place that is far above even the third heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Hebrews 7 tells us that today Christ is higher than the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He is there as the highest One to transmit not only His authority but also His transcending power to the church that the church may be formed.</S>
