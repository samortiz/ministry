   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RESULT OF THIS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>A LIFE OF EXPRESSION, NOT A LIFE OF SUPPRESSION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The result of an overcoming life is a life of expression rather than a life of suppression.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The problem with our victory is that most of it comes by suppression.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>There was an old lady who always suppressed her temper when she was irritated.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>She would maintain her smile outwardly, but she would struggle to suppress herself inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This kind of suppressed life will only result in internal bleeding when it is allowed to continue for years.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>All the bitterness remains inside with a suppressed life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But thank and praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our victory is a life of expression, not a life of suppression.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>A life of expression lives out what one has already obtained.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is what Philippians 2:12 means when it says to work out your own salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the past, we tried to hide ourselves as much as possible.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Now the victory of Christ expresses itself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is expressible.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In the past, the more we suppressed, the better it was.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Now the more we express, the better it is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Christ lives within us, and we live Him out before men.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Mrs. Jessie Penn-Lewis had a young lady friend who was a poet.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>She was very good at helping children understand the meaning of the overcoming life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>One day Mrs. Penn-Lewis visited her and tried to find out from her the way to teach children.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>On that day her friend invited dozens of children to come together to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After the meal and before the table was cleaned, a visitor suddenly came.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The lady asked the children, The table is so messy.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What shall we do?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The children proposed covering up the table with a clean piece of tablecloth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>She agreed and covered the mess on the table with a clean tablecloth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>After the visitor left, she asked the children, Did the visitor see the mess on the table?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>They answered, No. She then asked, Although he did not see the mess, was the mess still on the table? They answered, Yes.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Although the visitor did not see the mess, the mess was still on the table.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Brothers and sisters, many people allow themselves to be unclean within but do not like to be unclean on the outside.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The thoughts and feelings in our heart cannot be exposed to men s eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We think that we are victorious.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Others may commend us for our humility, and we may call it humility.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may appear to have much patience, but actually everything is merely locked up inside.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brothers and sisters, I must say honestly that there is no victory when we suppress everything within us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Victory is when we go and Christ moves in. Victory is something that is expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>There was a sister who easily lost her temper.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One day her servant broke a vase.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Immediately she went to her bed and covered herself with a blanket in an effort to keep from losing her temper.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is a life of suppression.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>A hawker may come to you to sell his fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>You may tell him that you do not want to buy and ask him to go away.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>He may come the second time, and you may refuse and send him away again.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He may come to you the third time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He comes because he wants to sell his fruit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>He can control himself and make sure that he does not lose his temper.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But this is not overcoming; this is not victory.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is merely a business practice.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Suppressing your temper is not victory.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Christ overcame by purging man s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Hence, victory means purity in the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A brother who is over fifty years old had been reading Confucius s teaching all his life.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He had been a Christian for over three years.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Although he believed in the cleansing of the Lord s blood, he did not know the difference between Christianity and Confucianism.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Confucian way of cultivation is the way of self restraint: it is trying to achieve sainthood through suppression and cultivation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After he became a Christian, he still tried to practice suppression, always attempting to look away from problems and even eliminating them altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Later, he experienced the way of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He testified that victory had nothing to do with him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Christianity is different from all other religions.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>The difference does not lie merely in the cross but in the fact that we have a living Christ living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>We can preach a doctrine of redemption and also a living Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The aforementioned person was a true disciple of Confucius, and nothing inside was exposed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Yet he now testifies that he can let go of himself; he no longer has to suppress himself, and problems no longer arise.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Brothers and sisters, I have to say hallelujah to this!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Victory is a matter of letting go of one s self and expression.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>An overcoming life is none other than Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>These five points are the characteristics of this life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Finally, allow me to say an honest word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Please remember that victory, like salvation, is definite.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>There is a definite date when one experiences it.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>You are saved on a definite date.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Of course, some have forgotten the month and day of their salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You should also write down the date that you overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>There should also be a definite date.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Everyone should have a definite date when they overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is a specific gate which one passes through.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>You have either passed through it or have not passed through it; there is no maybe in this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>No one in the world is maybe saved; if you are saved, you are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In the same way, no one in the world is maybe victorious; if you have overcome, you have overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Those who have perhaps overcome have not overcome at all.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>All of us should pass through this gate.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>I cannot speak further today.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In the future we will see that victory is not just an individual matter; there is a greater issue at stake.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This is all the more reason for us to overcome.</S>
