   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Hindrances from Roman Politics Persecution</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Early in the history of the church, the Roman Empire aided the spread of the church by providing public security and ease of travel over a good transportation system.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This was a great help in building up the church.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, the Roman Empire soon began to persecute the church; we do not know how many Christians were killed by the Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>They persecuted the church to such an extent that one Roman official reported to Caesar that the more they killed Christians, the faster Christianity spread.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Historians have noted that the Romans could not continue to kill Christians because the population of the Roman Empire would have decreased dramatically.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Roman Empire passed laws to persecute and kill Christians, and it even slaughtered them in large groups.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But the more the Romans persecuted the Christians, the more people believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Roman Empire stirred up ten great persecutions of the church in which they killed countless Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Confusion</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>In the fourth century, the emperor Constantine changed tactics, ended the persecution, and united the Roman Empire with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, many elements of the Roman Empire and the church were intermixed, producing an illegal union of the church and the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Since the church should be the pure bride of Christ, its union with the Roman Empire was spiritual fornication; this was the fulfillment of the church in Pergamos in Revelation 2.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Throughout church history the church has constantly faced this kind of problem and has shown a tendency to be mixed with politics.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Not long after Constantine took the throne, Christianity became the national religion of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Even today the Protestant churches are not entirely free of this mixture.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When Martin Luther led the Protestant Reformation, he did not bring the church out of politics; on the contrary, the church under Luther became involved with politics.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many European countries have made Christianity their state religion and have not separated the church and the state.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>For example, the Anglican Church is the state church of England.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Politics and the church are united; this mixture is even more serious than mixture with Judaism or Greek philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Thus, the church has changed in nature and lost its standing as the church.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The church has fallen from the heavens to the earth and from the hands of the Holy Spirit into the hands of political authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the situation of the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The union of the church and politics reached its peak in Catholicism, as seen in the fact that countries send ambassadors to the Vatican.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>To know the church in these last days, we must know Hebrew religion, Greek philosophy, and Roman politics, all of which should not have any position in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Mixture changes the nature of the church and causes it to lose its standing.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Bringing these three things into the church has caused the church to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>By A.D. 600 the Roman Catholic Church already included these three kinds of mixture; the religion, philosophy, and politics that the apostles had driven out of the church were welcomed into the Roman Catholic Church.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The apostles had driven away Hebrew religion, Greek culture, and the Roman Empire, but the Roman Catholic Church joined herself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Catholicism incorporates many human things.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Roman Catholic Church is the mysterious Babylon the Great.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>She should have been a pure woman, but she became a great harlot.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This harlot mixed together God, the devil, heaven, hell, the New Testament, the Old Testament, culture, and even the Lord s truth; all these have been mixed together in Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In Revelation 18:4 the Lord says, Come out of her, My people.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Whether good or bad, the Lord wants us to discard all things that are not of Christ, because the church is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>God will not allow any human thing to be mixed into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Even Judaism, which was treasured by His people, cannot be mixed with the church, much less other things such as politics and philosophy.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Catholicism has caused the church to lose its holiness, purity, and standing and to become a roosting place for demons and the dwelling place of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We study church history for the sake of the church today.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We are in an era of confusion, darkness, and contrasting methods; therefore, we must examine in the light the biblical revelations and types concerning the church and the course of the church on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Only in this way will we see what the church is, what its standing is, and the way it should take.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why we have taken the time to examine the nature of the church, the types of the church, and the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The church is spiritual, heavenly, and of Christ; the church is pure.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Anything that is not spiritual, heavenly, and of Christ should not be brought into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whenever we bring human things into the church, its nature is changed, it loses its standing, and it cannot bear its responsibility.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In such a situation, the church has no function before God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The church is a vessel for Christ and the Body of Christ, and everything in it is out of Christ and for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Therefore, the church can only be filled with Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This should be the condition of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The church is absolutely separate from the world; although it is in the world, it is not of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since the church is only passing through the world, it does not have the element of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church is just Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>May the Lord give us the grace that this light would become stronger and stronger.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today we are in a thick fog; may the Lord dispel the fog and cause us to see what should be the condition of the church and to see the way we should take.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>I hope that in the future others could also see this light and not go astray.</S>
