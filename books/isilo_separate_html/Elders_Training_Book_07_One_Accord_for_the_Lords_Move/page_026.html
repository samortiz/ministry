INTO PRECIOUS MATERIAL FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING,<br />
AND BEING CAREFUL NOT TO DAMAGE OR DESTROY<br />
CHRIST&rsquo;S BODY, GOD&rsquo;S TEMPLE</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 3 shows us what life is. First; we all have to realize that we are plants; you are a plant and I am a plant. Let us forget about things such as service, work, eldership, and apostleship. I want to remember that I am a little plant. As a little plant in life, I need to grow, and to grow I need water. I will take water from whoever can water me. Then I will grow. Furthermore, I want to be transformed into precious material for God&rsquo;s building&mdash;gold, silver, and precious stone. The first basic thing we have to learn is the matter of the growth in life. As a plant I am growing in the soil with all the riches. My soil is the processed and consummated Triune God. I want to dwell in Him and be rooted down in Him to absorb all His riches through my contacting Him. I like to contact Him, absorb Him, dwell in Him, be rooted in Him, and grow in Him to enjoy all His riches. Then I will grow into transformation to become precious material for His unique building in this universe.</p>
<p>While I am growing, He will lead me to participate in the divine work. What a privilege that I can be participating in God&rsquo;s divine work! Then I work in this divine building, not by my natural ability, not by wood, grass, or stubble. These categories of material are natural and worldly, having nothing to do with growth, life, and transformation. I would never work with this kind of material. I should deny myself, put my soul life aside, and condemn my natural ability. I build with what I grow with. I build with my growth, with my enjoyment of the Triune God. This is what it means to build with gold, silver, and precious stones.</p>
<p>I am also careful not to damage or destroy Christ&rsquo;s Body; otherwise, I will suffer destruction because the church, Christ&rsquo;s Body and God&rsquo;s temple, is a treasure so dear and precious to Him, purchased with His own blood (Acts 20:28). If I destroy the temple, God will destroy me. I do not want to be a Christian like the Corinthians. They did not take care of the growth in life. Paul said that they were still babes, behaving, acting, and touching the church affairs altogether in the flesh (1 Cor. 3:1-3). Because they were fleshly and even fleshy, Paul could not give them solid food. He could only feed them with milk.</p>
<p>The Corinthians were puffed up on behalf of Apollos against Paul and on behalf of Paul against Cephas (1 Cor. 4:6). This is all in the flesh and is to build the church with wood, grass, and stubble. To criticize or condemn others carelessly is to destroy the temple, not discerning the Body, and will cause one to suffer loss. Most Christians today are suffering loss. Many are under a kind of destruction. Years ago I warned the saints, but the opposers twisted my word to say that I am cursing and threatening people. Actually, my warning was a word in love. We have to realize that it is not a small thing to touch the church.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE QUALIFICATIONS OF AN ARCHITECT</h2>
<p>First Corinthians 3 is a chapter not on fighting but on growing. To be a planter like the Apostle Paul and to be a plant, you need some life. As a plant you need to grow, and through growth you will have transformation to become the precious material for God&rsquo;s building. You then will do the right work with what you grow and with what you have been transformed, building with gold, silver, and precious stones for the building of God. You would never use anything of your natural life or worldly ability&mdash;wood, grass, or stubble&mdash;to build the church. Nor would you touch the Body, the church of Christ, the temple of God, carelessly to suffer destruction spiritually, soulishly, or physically.</p>
<p>If you were such a person, the Lord would probably assign a portion to you that you might be qualified and able to be a designer because you know His concepts, His heart&rsquo;s desire, His eternal purpose, His eternal plan, His good pleasure. You also know His economy, the Old Testament economy and the New Testament economy, the eternal economy. Since you know all these things, this qualifies you to be a designer, an architect, a wise master builder. Because you know what you design, you also know how to superintend the construction.</p>
<p>An architect does not control the workers. His controlling would keep them away from their work. Nobody could work under another&rsquo;s control; they may even go on strike. An architect does not exercise control, but his view of the construction. Based upon this view, he renders much helpful, positive, and constructive instructions. He helps by adjusting and sometimes by giving a warning. The master builder is not the controller but the one who has the design and the one who oversees, superintends, the construction work in detail.</p>
<p>Paul exercised much of his superintending ability in writing 1 Corinthians. In this one Epistle Paul dealt with eleven problems among the believers in Corinth; some of these problems were concerning division, fornication, bringing brothers to the law, and marriage. Could you have such an all-inclusive view to write an Epistle to such a complicated and complicating church? Maybe all that you would be able to tell them would be to contact the Lord and pray often. You might even tell them to fast and pray and to love one another. Your fellowship may sound very good. You may be very spiritual, loving, kind, and nice, but I do not think that someone &ldquo;who is building a house would hire you as an architect.&rdquo; You might be qualified to be a pastor in a small denomination.</p>
<h2 class="head1">TRAINED FOLLOWERS WHO ARE<br />
GROWING IN LIFE TO BE TRANSFORMED<br />
INTO PRECIOUS MATERIAL FOR GOD&rsquo;S BUILDING,<br />
WHO WOULD NOT SAY OR DO ANYTHING<br />
TO DESTROY GOD&rsquo;S TEMPLE, AND<br />
WHO SEE THE VISION OF<br />
GOD&rsquo;S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY</h2>
<p>I am trying my best to present to you what the Lord has shown me. By presenting these things to you in such a way, I hope you can see the great difference between the Lord&rsquo;s recovery and Christianity. There is no comparison. Such fellowship concerning the deeper truths of God&rsquo;s New Testament economy may cause some to be angry with me. This has been my suffering.</p>
<p>Some of you may say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, we will follow you and go to fight.&rdquo; How will you go to fight? Even the soldiers in today&rsquo;s United States Army need to be trained. You need to be trained in your character. Get rid of your looseness and inaccuracy in doing things. You cannot be a wild soldier. We must be so fine in being dealt with by the Lord to grow in life. We should have the attitude that we do not like to be anybody. We only like to grow to be transformed into precious material for God&rsquo;s building. We should be altogether careful not to do or say anything to damage or destroy any part of God&rsquo;s temple, which is the very dear Body of the Head, the Lord Jesus Christ.</p>
<p>With this building work there must be an architect who gives us the proper design. To lay the foundation is to give the design. These two things are one. Then the architect tells us, charges us, and warns us to be careful how to build and with what we build. This is his superintending of the construction. The architect, the wise master builder, gives us the design, which is to lay the foundation. No one can give you another design, another foundation, which is the all-inclusive Christ becoming the life-giving Spirit as the very embodiment of the processed and consummated Triune God. This foundation is the very contents of our belief, the very contents of the New Testament economy of God. The architect laid this foundation by such a design. After giving such a design, after laying such a foundation, he is now superintending to see how the building is going on. We need such a view in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. I believe this vision will control us, restrict us, and preserve us from being wild. &ldquo;Where there is no vision, the people run wild&rdquo; (Prov. 29:18&mdash;Heb.).</p>
<p>You may say that you follow Brother Lee, that you are one with this ministry. This sounds very good, but I am a little concerned that you may not know what it means to be one with the ministry. You may want to take me as your commander in chief and follow me, but I do not want to have many followers who know nothing about God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. We are not doing anything but carrying out God&rsquo;s New Testament economy. Christianity has delayed the Lord and missed the mark for centuries, but in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery the one thing, the unique thing, the Lord has been showing us is the New Testament economy of God. I hate that you would not see this. Because of your not seeing, some of you have been ambitious to be something and have tried to have another line in the Lord&rsquo;s recovery. The seeing of the vision preserves you. The seeing will be the white line for your driving. What I have presented to you in this chapter is the white line for your driving to save and preserve you.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_025.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_027.html">Next</a> </body></html>
