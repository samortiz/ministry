        <h2 class="head1">THE THRONE AND THE LIVING WATER PRODUCING<br />
GOLD, PEARL, AND PRECIOUS STONES</h2>
<p>The city is pure gold, the gates are pearl, and the foundations of the wall and the wall itself are precious stones (21:18-21). The city is built with these three materials because there is a flow of life with authority in the city. The flow of the river of water of life produces gold, pearl, and precious stones. This is clearly seen in Genesis 2:10-12, which speaks of a river producing gold, bdellium, which is a pearl-like material produced from the resin of a tree, and onyx, which is a precious stone. Hence, without the flow of the living water, there would be no gold, pearl, and precious stones.</p>
<p>Verses 8 and 9 speak of God putting man in the garden with the tree of life. Verses 10 through 14 speak of the river that went forth from Eden in four branches, and then verses 16 and 17 return to speak of the tree of life. Verses 10 through 14 are an inserted word concerning the flowing of water. The implication of this picture is that when man receives life from the tree of life, life will flow within him and result in gold, pearl, and precious stones. Hence, in order for the church to be full of gold, pearl, and precious stones, it must have the flow of the river of water of life, that is, the fellowship of life. If there is no flow of God&rsquo;s Spirit and God&rsquo;s life in a local church, it will be difficult for such a church to produce much gold, pearl, or precious stones. These three precious materials can only come out of the flow of life. If we want to pay attention to God&rsquo;s building, we must pay attention to the flow of life.</p>
<p>Today the Lamb of God is emphasized very much in the preaching in Christianity. Everywhere we can hear people say, &ldquo;Behold, the Lamb of God!&rdquo; However, it is rare to hear people speak of the Lamb releasing God&rsquo;s life so that we may receive His life and be built up as the church. There is little speaking concerning the flow of His life in the church, and there is even less speaking concerning the flow of life bringing the authority of the throne and the fellowship of life to every member so that the church may be full of authority and the fellowship of life. The church must have the fellowship of life that comes with authority so that gold, pearl, and precious stones can be produced for the building. This is the ultimate goal of Christ being the Lamb of God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE THRONE AND THE LIVING WATER<br />
SPEAKING OF THE LORD<br />
HOLDING THE OFFICES OF<br />
THE KINGSHIP AND THE PRIESTHOOD</h2>
<p>Revelation 22 is a picture that portrays how the redeemed Israelites in the Old Testament age and the saints in the New Testament age are built into a city, the New Jerusalem. The Bible concludes with the throne of God and of the Lamb being the center among God&rsquo;s people; this throne is also the center of the whole Bible.</p>
<p>The river of water of life that proceeds out from the throne of God and of the Lamb is Christ as the Lamb of God who was put to death and who was released as the Spirit in resurrection in order to flow as life into those who are redeemed. Christ is the way, the reality, and the life of the redeemed, just as He is the way, the reality, and the life of the New Jerusalem. All these items flow from the throne of God and of the Lamb, which is at the center of the New Jerusalem. As the way, the reality, and the life of God&rsquo;s people, Christ brings God&rsquo;s authority, the authority of the throne, to God&rsquo;s people. The throne and the water of life speak of Christ being both the King and the Priest. He came to be the way, the reality, and the life so that the redeemed could have fellowship with God and blend with one another. The water of life points to the aspect of Christ as the Priest. He also brings the authority of the throne to the redeemed. The throne points to the aspect of Christ as the King. The fellowship of life and the authority of the throne are related to the offices of the priesthood and the kingship, both of which belong to the Lord.</p>
<p>According to the picture of the New Jerusalem, the authority of the throne and the fellowship of life are for the building of the New Jerusalem. This corresponds to Zechariah 6:12-13, which speaks of the offices of the priesthood and the kingship converging in Joshua, who is a type of the Lord Jesus, for the sake of the building of God&rsquo;s temple.</p>
<p>In the New Testament the book of Hebrews deals particularly with the aspect of Christ as the Priest. This book shows that Christ, as the Priest, enables us to enjoy God as our way, our reality, and our life. He brings the believers into the Holy of Holies, that is, into fellowship with God (2:17; 3:1; 4:14; 5:6; 7:1). In the New Testament the Gospel of Matthew deals particularly with the aspect of Christ as the King. This book shows us that Christ is Emmanuel, joining God with man and bringing the authority of God to man (1:1, 23; 2:6). Although Hebrews speaks of Christ as the Priest and the Gospel of Matthew speaks of Christ as the King, both books speak of the matter of building. Hebrews speaks of the building of a city (11:9-10, 16; 12:22), whereas the Gospel of Matthew speaks of the building of the church (16:18). The building of the church and the building of the city are the same thing.</p>
<p>Christ is the Priest for God&rsquo;s building, and Christ is the King for God&rsquo;s building. These are not two separate matters. Although Hebrews speaks in a detailed way concerning the Lord Jesus as a priest, it speaks of the Lord Jesus being a priest according to the order of Melchizedek, who is the king of Salem (6:20&mdash;7:1). Hence, the Lord as a priest is also a king. Similarly, although the Gospel of Matthew shows that Christ is the King, there is also an indication of His being a priest. For example, He came to shepherd His people Israel and to serve (2:6; 20:28). These examples speak of His being a priest. In Christ there is both the fellowship of the priesthood and the authority of the kingship, both of which are for God&rsquo;s building.</p>
<p>The Lamb of God was with the Israelites in the Old Testament in type and with the church of the New Testament in fulfillment. With the redeeming Lamb there is a flow of the water of life into man. As Christ flows out God&rsquo;s life, He also brings the redeemed under God&rsquo;s throne. On one hand, He flows out the fellowship of life to us, and on the other hand, He brings us under the authority of the throne. He is both the Priest and the King. Revelation 21 and 22 present such a descriptive picture.</p>
<p>In principle, the elements in this descriptive picture were present when the tabernacle was erected at Mount Sinai. The tabernacle speaks of Christ as the center of God&rsquo;s people. As the Passover lamb, He was killed so that the Israelites could have fellowship with God in God&rsquo;s building. Furthermore, He brought God&rsquo;s authority to man. As a result of the building of the tabernacle, God&rsquo;s people had the fellowship of God&rsquo;s life and the authority of God&rsquo;s throne. They were able to enjoy all that God is and has and to be built up together as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Hence, when the Israelites built the tabernacle, it was a miniature of the New Jerusalem. The city of Jerusalem, which the Israelites built in the land of Canaan, also was a miniature of the New Jerusalem. In Ezekiel 47 the prophet Ezekiel saw a river flowing out of God&rsquo;s temple in Jerusalem, and wherever this river went, everything lived and prospered (vv. 9, 12). God&rsquo;s purpose will be fulfilled when the New Jerusalem is manifested in the new heaven and the new earth. All the elements in the picture of the tabernacle and the picture of the New Jerusalem point to Christ being life to God&rsquo;s people, which brings them under the authority of the throne to be built up together as God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
