   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When I left the following day, I had only a few dollars in my pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Many brothers and sisters came to see me off, and some carried my luggage.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While walking I prayed, "Lord, surely You wouldn't bring me here without taking me back."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Halfway to the wharf, Mr. Philips sent someone with a letter.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The letter read, "Though someone else has assumed the responsibility for your traveling expenses, I feel that I should have a share in your work here.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Would it be possible for me, an aged brother, to have such a share?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Please be good enough to accept this small sum for this purpose."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After reading the letter, I felt I should accept the money, and I did.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It was not only sufficient for my return expenses to Foochow, but also for printing one issue of The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Upon my return to Foochow, the wife of the co-worker who received the five dollars said to me, "I have the feeling that when you left you did not have enough money yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Why did you suddenly give five dollars to my husband?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>I then asked her what had occurred in connection with the five dollars, and she replied, "We had only one dollar left in the house on Wednesday, and that had been spent by Friday.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>On Friday we prayed all day.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Afterwards my husband felt that he should go for a walk, and then he met you, and you gave him five dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The five dollars lasted us through five days; then God provided for us from another source."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>At this point she continued with tears, "If you had not given us the five dollars on that day, we would have suffered hunger.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It does not matter that we suffer hunger, but what about God's promise?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Her testimony filled me with joy.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The Lord had worked through me to supply their need with the five dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Word of the Lord is indeed faithful: "Give, and it will be given to you."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is the lesson I have learned in my life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I have now experienced that the less money I have in my hand, the more God will give.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is a difficult path to follow.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many people may feel that they are able to live the life of faith; but when the trial comes, they are in fear.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Unless you can believe in the real and living God, I do not advise you to take this path.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I can bear testimony today that God is the One who gives.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>To be sustained by means of ravens as Elijah was at his time is still possible today.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I am going to mention something to you which you may find difficult to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It has been my experience that God's supply arrives when I have spent my last dollar.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I have had fourteen years of experience.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In each experience God wanted to get the glory for Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God has supplied all my needs and has not failed me once.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Those who used to give do not do so now.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>There is a constant change of offerers; one lot of people replaces another.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All this does not matter, for God in the highest is a living God.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>He never changes!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>I say this today for your benefit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I must say this that you may go straight forward in the path of living a life of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>There are ten to twenty more cases like these that I have already related to you.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Concerning the matter of offering the Lord money, one ought to set aside a definite amount a tithe of your income or half of your income and put it in the hand of God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>From her natural being, the widow who gave two half-farthings might have grudged doing so, but she was praised by the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We have to be an example for others; we need not fear, for God will not fail.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We should learn to love God, to believe Him, and to serve Him as is His due.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We ought to thank Him and praise Him because of His unspeakable grace!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Amen.</S>
