The four Gospels tell us that of all the times He met with people, there was not even one time when they had a so-called worship service
The Psalms tell us that we should shout loudly and joyfully to the Lord: 'Make a joyful noise to Jehovah, all the earth'
When we come to the meetings every Lord's Day, we should not keep religious rituals and perform orderly ceremonies
The book of Isaiah says, 'Cry out and give a ringing shout, / O inhabitant of Zion,' and 'With a voice of shouting declare'
Due to this kind of carelessness in translation, it is unavoidable that much of the true meaning of this word is lost
When we baptize people into the name of the Father and the Son and the Holy Spirit, we immerse them into the Triune God
Sorry to say, the natural human mind does not have the concept of eating the Lord as the tree of life and drinking Him as the water of life
Because Eve saw that the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil was good for food, she was tempted and ate wrongfully
After they were delivered, they went into the wilderness and ate manna every day until they entered the land of Canaan
We see that the entire Bible speaks of the matter of eating, but regrettably most Christians overlook this point
There is a hymn in Chinese that says, 'Abiding in the Lord, His fatness to enjoy; / Abiding in the Lord, His light will brightly shine'
Paul's use of the word implies that God established an economy, that is, a plan, an arrangement, to have a great enterprise
Many of us were not clear when we believed in the Lord, and we did not know what we were doing when we believed
Sometimes we rebuke the brothers and sisters, saying, 'You have been going regularly to the meetings; how could you still do such a thing'?
John says that this life which is the eternal life and which has been manifested today is Jesus Christ Himself
When the Lord Jesus was on earth, He said, 'I am the bread of life,' 'I have come that they may have life,' and 'I am the life'
John said that the Lord Jesus is this life and that he saw, handled, and was made sure of Him; then John reported this eternal life to us
In other words, the flow of electricity causes the lightbulbs to have fellowship with one another and with the electric plant
If the lightbulbs want to maintain their fellowship, they must abide in the electricity and not cut off the switch
If the lightbulb abides in the electricity, it will shine by enjoying the source of power, and the owner will not throw it away
In the same way, if we want to shine and function, we must abide in the Lord and enjoy Him as our supply and source
In this way we who abide in the Lord do not live a life of ethics and morality but instead live a life that is the Lord's
John 15 says that we should 'abide' in the Lord, but the Chinese Version says that we should 'always be' in the Lord
In John 15 the word abide is not a light word but a very important one; it means to dwell, not merely to stay awhile
In Ephesians 317 Paul strengthens the meaning of this word by adding the preposition kata making it katoikeo which means deeply make home
To be saved is to be connected with the 'electricity' after the wires have been laid and the appliances have been installed
After the electrical connection has been made, we, the appliances, should take another step to 'enjoy' and 'apply' the electricity
In other words, Christ has already entered into us, so we should take another step, which is to abide in the Lord
We Christians have the Lord in us, so our reaction should neither be to get angry, nor to behave in a cultured manner, nor to be tolerant
Wang Yang-ming, a Chinese philosopher, said that man must develop his instinctive moral sense and innate ability to do good
As Christians, we do not act according to the function of our conscience or according to the influence of any teaching
There are some people who are not very clear about this truth nevertheless they can vaguely feel that there is another One who lives in them
Before we were saved, we did not have this kind of experience; we only had the struggle in our conscience between reason and lust
When the electrical appliances remain in the current of electricity to enjoy the supply of electricity, they abide in the electricity
According to the letter, it is 'to abide in the Lord,' but according to experience, it is 'to live by the Lord within us'
We often have this kind of old ailment, because we pay attention to abiding in the Lord only in big things but not in small things
May the Lord have mercy on us to show us that today we are one with the Lord, and we should live together with the Lord
If a husband and wife do not argue about big things but always quarrel about little things, their marriage life is not normal
When we view it from this angle and understand it from this kind of experience, we can realize more the meaning of 'abiding in the Lord'
If you reason even just a little with your spouse, then you know that you are not in the Lord because you have not lived by the Lord
After we receive God's salvation, we should learn to let the Lord live in us, and we should allow Him to be magnified in us
In chapter two we saw that for us to abide in the Lord and enjoy His life, we need to live and walk by the Spirit
After such a fellowship some brothers and sisters may not understand and still wonder how we can remain in spirit all the time
If the switch was not securely installed, the lightbulb does not function properly and, therefore, does not shine steadily
If one is a careless Christian, he is indifferent about continuously abiding in the Lord and does not think there is a problem
In your home life however your spouse and children needless to say even you yourself are capable of turning off your spiritual electricity
The best way to keep the spiritual electricity from being turned off is to install a safety box and lock the switch in
There is one book in the New Testament that specifically covers the matter of abiding in the Lord, and that is the first Epistle of John
If we want to have a life that is always shining without flickering, we need to pray unceasingly and give thanks in everything
If we want to get in and not come out but remain inside all the time, we need to pray unceasingly and give thanks in everything
All three of these books were written by the apostle Paul, and their contents show a sequence that is mysterious and wonderful
These philosophers taught people to develop their 'bright virtue' and to be blameless and pure, yet they did not have Christ in them
As you walk on the spiritual pathway, do not ask whether you should start with your right foot or with your left
If you pay your attention to trying to decide which foot should go first, you will probably have difficulty in walking
In our Christian life we should pray and give thanks, and we should give thanks and pray; we should always walk this way
Perhaps before you go to bed, you pray first and then give thanks, but in the morning when you get up, you give thanks first and then pray
If one foot is missing, walking becomes extremely difficult; if both feet are missing, walking becomes impossible
Among the organs of our body created by God, there is one that is used continuously, and that is our nose, which we use for breathing
We have never heard anyone say that he has been using his nose for breathing all the time and, therefore, his nose is tired and needs a rest
We still did not become accustomed to exercising this organ, and even when we prayed, we did not use it very much
At such a time, even a Christian who does not know how to pray will be able to cry out, 'O Lord Jesus, rescue me'!
When we live and walk in our activated spirit, we pray unceasingly, and spontaneously we abide in the Lord and enjoy Him as our life
We truly offer up our worship to You from the depths of our being because You have drawn us to seek You and Your word
O Lord, give us the utterance and pour out Yourself again upon us so that Your thought, Your feeling, and Your rich word may dwell in us
In the previous chapter we clearly saw that a living way for us to abide in the Lord is to pray unceasingly and to give thanks in all things
A doctor will tell us that after a lifelong study, he still is very limited in his understanding of the human body
The longer a doctor practices medicine, the more he feels that his knowledge is short because the human body is too mysterious
In the Greek text the clause in everything give thanks does not have the notion of blessings as the Chinese translation indicates
The well, which the leaders sank, / Which the nobles of the people dug, / With the scepter, with their staffs'
Now we need only to look to Him to take care of us so that we may be good persons, fearing God, reading the Bible, and praying
For this reason Christians in general became deadened; this led to the rise of the Pentecostal movement in the middle of the last century
The birth of the Pentecostal movement was due to the fact that there were some believers who felt that Christians in general were too dry
At the beginning of the New Testament He Himself was born to be a man and lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years
It was at this juncture that the Lord Jesus came into their midst and breathed into them, saying, 'Receive the Holy Spirit'
Ordinarily, night is the best time for fishing, and Peter and John were experienced fishermen, but that night they caught nothing
The Lord knew that they went fishing for their livelihood; they were hungry and hoped to catch some fish for their food
Later when the disciples got out onto the land, 'they saw a fire of coals laid there, and fish lying on it and bread'
From that day to the present, for close to two thousand years, He has always been on the earth and has never left
For the past two thousand years war, famine, and death have occurred incessantly on this earth, and they are on the increase
When you hear the gospel and call on His name, the Spirit enters into you, and you become one spirit with the Lord
The problem today is that we do not pray, and as a result the 'mud' piles up and obstructs the flow of the river of living water within us
In the Old Testament types, there is not only the water flowing out of the smitten rock but also the digging of the well
The production there depends not only on the rain from heaven but also on the water drawn from the flow of water under the ground
Part of California was a desert previously, but now all of Southern California is irrigated by the underground water drawn by electric power
In the same manner, today we do not depend on the Spirit to strengthen us from outside because the Spirit is already in us
Stanza 3 says, 'I will dig by praying, / Dig the dirt entirely, / Thus release the Spirit, / Let the stream flow freely'
By thus digging away all the obstructions, the living water will flow, and spontaneously we will be abiding in the Lord
We always have air within us for whatever we do; without air we would stop breathing and thus could not do anything
The Triune God became flesh and died for us on the cross, bearing our sins; then He resurrected and became the life-giving Spirit
The Spirit's indwelling us is not a matter of His being high or mighty; instead, He is lowly and gentle and is often wronged by us
The anointing ointment is the Spirit, and the anointing of this ointment, that is, the moving of the Spirit, never stops
If you argue, He anoints you silently; when you calm down, He moves you again, causing you to repent and confess your sins
For us to abide in the Lord, we must learn to not quench the Spirit at all but to cooperate with Him completely and to not argue with Him
When you pick up an item in the department store and within you He is telling you to put it down you should simply put it down quickly
When you get into your car, while driving home you will sense that you have a heavy burden and you will become sad
If you keep the item, you will feel that it is a bothering, and when you use it, you will have no peace at all
When you do not quench the Spirit it means you have not neglected the Lords words but when you neglect the Lords words you quench the Spirit
According to 1 Thessalonians, if we are unable to give thanks, it is because we have quenched the Spirit and neglected the prophecies
Do not quench the Spirit and do not despise prophecies mean do not quench the Spirit of God and do not neglect the words of the Lord
In other words, while you may not sin, it is still possible that you are one hundred percent not abiding in the Lord
Confucius never heard about Christ or knew the Lord, yet he could say, 'One cannot pray when he sins against heaven'
At the age of seventy he was able to do the desires of his heart yet not transgress what was right; that is, he did not sin
Because they did not know God, they tried to change man altogether by teaching benevolence and justice according to their moral concepts
No matter how much others may offend you, if you simply hold on to this secret of keeping your mouth shut, you will not get angry
Not only so, even with us Christians who love the Lord and who are zealous for Him, our zeal often does not last for more than five days
Religion, ethics, or any kind of philosophical concept requires us to become perfect people who are without sins or transgressions
In John 1915 when the Jews pointed to the Lord Jesus who was standing before Pilate and said Crucify Him what they meant was Get rid of Him
Their purpose for putting the Lord on the cross was not that He would suffer but that they would get rid of Him
Every time we speak about abiding in the Lord, we think that this refers to being blameless, to sinless perfection
To abide in the Lord means that in all things it is not you who are doing and living, but it is the Lord who is doing and living
Any time you live by yourself, you may feel very good and that you do not have any problems, but actually this is the most dangerous time
Those who frequently lose their temper are in the habit of losing their temper, so they do not readily go into a rage
Rather it is those who are very gentle who are the most like lambs that when they explode with anger they become altogether uncontrollable
If you love by your self and you are gentle by your self, eventually, you will hate by your self and explode with anger by your self
The tree of the knowledge of good and evil comprises not only the knowledge of good but also the knowledge of evil
It would be best that in our thoughts and in our concepts there is no such thing as sin, for then it is guaranteed that we will not sin
To say that it means 'by' may seem quite correct, but in Greek the word is not by but a word that is hard to interpret
The Gospel of John tells us that when the Father God sent the Lord Jesus, the Father God came with and in the Lord Jesus
The young people are full of energy; therefore, it is difficult for them to deny themselves in all things and live by the Lord
The older they are, the more they think they are experienced; thus, it is even harder for them to deny themselves and live by the Lord
The Pharisees said that He violated the Sabbath, but the Lord said that He was not wrong because He is the Lord, He is God
We love the Lord very much and are willing to live by the Lord, but whenever we do anything, we always live ourselves
You might feel that when you have learned to speak and can be an instant sensation, then you will be willing to open your mouth
If you truly live by the Lord, when you have the inner sense to pray, you will not care whether it sounds good or bad; you will pray
He moves continually within us so that we would not do anything by ourselves but instead allow Him to do everything
Just as He lived because of the Father, He also wants us to be transformed into His image and live because of Him
We thank the Lord that due to His infusion and influence, even though we often live by ourselves, we do have a measure of His image
Whether we are shepherding others or going to work or school, we all need to ask for the Lord's leading and to live by the Lord
Whenever you do not live by the Lord, even if you do good, you are still outside of the Lord and not abiding in the Lord
May we all be able to practice so that in every action, word, and attitude we would entirely live by the Lord and live because of the Lord
How good it is that we can be here around Your word, and by this we can draw near to You and contact You as the Spirit!
Lord, we have no fear within us because our conscience has been purified by being sprinkled with the precious blood
The term heavenly hall does not exist either in the Hebrew text of the Old Testament or in the Greek text of the New Testament
After they entered into the good land, Canaan, and settled down there, they built a fixed tabernacle of stones, and that was the holy temple
The contents of the temple were the same as that of the tabernacle having three parts the outer court the Holy Place and the Holiest Place
To enter the Holy of Holies, the priests had to first pass through the gate of the outer court which was on the east toward the sunrise
At the entrance of the tabernacle in the outer court there was the altar of burnt offering, where they offered sacrifices to God
As to the Holiest Place, only the high priest, who had the highest office among the priests, was allowed to enter it once a year
In the Holiest Place was the ark, within which were the Ten Commandments which God had established with His people
It was on this cover that God forgave the sins of the people; it was also here that God fellowshipped and spoke with the high priest
Within the outer court there was a tabernacle, the outer part of which was the Holy Place and the inner part of which was the Holiest Place
The first stanza of Hymn 770 says, 'In the holiest place, touch the throne of grace, / Grace as a river shall flow'
From their study of the Word they saw that at the apostles' time, on the day of Pentecost, the Holy Spirit was poured out upon people
Corinthians 3:16 says, 'Do you not know that you are the temple of God, and that the Spirit of God dwells in you'?
Only the saved ones can be the temple of God, because the temple of God is the dwelling place of God, the place in which God dwells
The Lord, who is the God who created the universe, became flesh to be a man named Jesus Christ two thousand years ago
For our redemption He went to the cross to die and bear our sins, and as the last Adam He resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit
He resurrected to become the Spirit to dwell in the spirit of those who believe in Him, and He takes up His residence in them
To enjoy Christ, instead of living in our soul or our body we should enter into our spirit and live in our spirit
The more you speak, the more you feel in your soul that you are right, and eventually you even act in your flesh
When you live in the outer court, you must be warned by this hymn, 'I've believed the true report, / Hallelujah to the Lamb!
Perhaps you feel that if you do not quarrel and give vent to your anger, your heart will not be at ease and your stomach will also hurt
We all need to be reminded that it is best not to use our body, which is the outer court, as the instrument for quarreling and getting angry
As a result, although we exercise control of ourselves to not live in our flesh, we are altogether living in our soul
Every time we turn to our spirit, we repent and confess to the Lord, admitting that we live so much in the flesh and in the soul
If we do this, the living water saturates us and fills us until it overflows so that we are completely in grace
We are able to enjoy the hidden manna within the ark and have a deeper experience of Christ as the life supply
Just as a bad tree does not need to bear bad fruit to become a bad tree, so man does not need to commit sin intentionally to become a sinner
A bad tree automatically bears bad fruit without being taught, and a good tree naturally bears good fruit also without being taught
In the same way, because our nature is sinful, whatever we do, without any special intention, is naturally sinful
The holy ointment here does not refer to the ointment itself or to its essence; it refers to the anointing of the ointment
In Greek this word is used not as a noun or as a verb but as a gerund it does not refer to the ointment but to the function of the ointment
The New Testament Recovery Version in Chinese directly uses an expression which literally means ointment-anointing
It is as if we were treating a wound on our physical body; first we cleanse it, then we rub on some medicinal ointment
Our God, however, is our Redeemer today, and by the cleansing of His blood and by His becoming the Spirit He now abides in us
The anointing refers to a central matter, that we who believe into the Lord and are saved need to abide in the Lord to enjoy His life
In the preceding chapters we pointed out repeatedly the way to abide in the Lord in order to be able to enjoy Him as our life
In the same way, to forgive, to pardon, is one thing, while to cleanse, to remove the stain of sin, is another
Before God and according to His law, we have sins and trespasses, while as to our person, our being, we have been stained
For our trespasses we need God's forgiveness; for our stains we need God's cleansing, which is by the precious blood
The trespass offering was for the outward deeds, the trespasses, and the sin offering was for the inward nature, the sin
Fallen man has contracted leprosy, having an inward sinful nature that is manifested as the outward sinful deeds
Now through the offering of the Lord Jesus as our sin offering and our trespass offering we are redeemed from sin
We are still not cleansed, so we must apply the redeeming blood on our ear, thumb, and toe to obtain cleansing
He put it on the ear, thumb, and toe upon which the blood had been applied; that is, he put the oil upon the blood
Most people do not adequately understand the meaning of fellowship; the average Christian may even think that it means 'social contact'
In Greek, this word fellowship is koinonia, which refers to several people or objects that can be mixed together and mingled thoroughly
The blood in the human body circulates very quickly; before we have finished speaking one sentence, the blood has already been circulating
Because of this fellowship our ears and our feet are connected even though they do not grow next to one another
When we believed in the Lord Jesus, the eternal life entered into us and brought with it the fellowship of life
In the last century, there were some in Christianity who said that once a person is regenerated, sin is eradicated from him
John says that we who are saved and regenerated and even have God's life within us do not have sin eradicated from our being
If someone would say that he has never stolen anything or that he has never lied, he is the top sinner because he has not told the truth
Rather, we like to speak the truth in love, and what we actually want to do is to preach the gospel and proclaim the truth
No one can say that because he has breathed for many years and is very experienced, he can stop breathing for a few days
It does not matter how much experience you have in breathing; as soon as you stop breathing, you will immediately die
In the same way, we cannot depend on our years of experience in the matter of the fellowship of the divine life
By way of illustration, an apple tree is not an apple tree because it bears apples; rather, it bears apples because it is an apple tree
If we say that we do not have sin we consider God a liar because the Bible clearly says All have sinned and fall short of the glory of God
Through one man sin entered into the world, and through sin, death; and thus death passed on to all men because all have sinned'
Before God, however, you cannot say that you have no sins or trespasses outwardly, nor can you deny that you have a sinful nature inwardly
The Bible indicates that the first step God took in saving us sinners was to be incarnated as a man, and this man was called Jesus Christ
Jesus Christ was God incarnated, a true man with a body of bones, blood, and flesh; He was a man with real human blood
The same is true when we read the Bible because this Spirit, who is God and the Lord Jesus, cannot be separated from the word of the Bible
You feel that you have been struggling and laboring, and that even if you have some fame or accomplishment, it has no meaning
In the Bible, the work which the Lord accomplished by His being processed is called redemption, and it is symbolized by the blood
Our God became flesh as the Lord Jesus; He passed through human living, death, and resurrection, thereby accomplishing redemption
The blood representing His redemption refers to what He has accomplished while the Spirit representing all that He is refers to what He is
In this way the redemption God accomplished and all the riches of His being are fully applied to us through our believing
The inward sinful nature and the outward sinful acts always become a problem to us, as we have described above
If we want to remain in the fellowship of the divine life, the first thing we must do is confess our sins to God
When we are not in the light, we do not feel that we have sin; once we are in the light, however, we feel that we truly have sinned
In other words, whenever we come to God and feel that we are wrong or we have a guilty feeling, that means we are in the light
The next time you are about to get angry, the anointing will immediately remind you that you must walk by the anointing
