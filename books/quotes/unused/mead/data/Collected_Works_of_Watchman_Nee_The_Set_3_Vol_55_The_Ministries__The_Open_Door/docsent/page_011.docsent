   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Please Migrate to Zhan-Jiang</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It has been almost half a year since I came to Zhan-Jiang!</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God indeed has had mercy on me and entrusted me with the responsibility for His "recovery."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Some of the brothers and sisters in Siying were cold and backslidden, but they have received mercy from God and have gradually returned to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Other friends have also accepted the Lord one by one and received life!</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Last Wednesday we held the first church meeting in a sister's house.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>There were more than twenty people present including children.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>However, difficulties increase as we grow in size because we must establish the Lord's table sooner or later, and we must baptize the people who are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>However, no more than one or two people understand the truth of the church even I myself do not fully understand it .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I cannot bear such a heavy responsibility alone.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Furthermore, I work for the Railroad Ministry and may be transferred to another place at any time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If the testimony of the church in this locality is to be maintained, one or two believing households should stay here permanently.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For this reason, I ask God to send His children to migrate to Zhan-Jiang.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This matter cannot be delayed and cannot wait any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>I do not ask for much, just two households, one to stay in Siying and one in Chekan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Please remember that I was sent by you; reinforcements must continue coming, or the beachhead here will disappear sooner or later!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>May the brothers and sisters follow the Lord's leading and migrate here.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Blessings from the Lord to you.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Your brother in the Lord,</S>

   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>October 27, 1947</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The Beginning of the Meetings in Siying</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Since the pathway to the chapels was blocked, God having entrusted us with the responsibility for the "recovery," we decided to have a new beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Soon after we made this decision, God opened a sister's house Mrs. Duan Fu-shen for our meeting place.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In the beginning we held believers' meetings there, but in addition to the brothers and sisters, many unbelieving friends came, as well as children.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We tried to divide the meetings into three: a Wednesday gospel meeting, a Friday children's meeting at 6:30, and a Friday meeting for the brothers and sisters at 7:30.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In order to allow the brothers and sisters to participate in the church service, we divided up the different areas of responsibility, such as setting up chairs, ushering, teaching children, leading the hymns, accounting, and clerical duties.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If God does not abandon us, there perhaps will come a time when we will have the need to rent a house.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I really feel the need to remain in Siying for the sake of the church in Siying because I cannot let it go yet .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>May God open a way for me to transfer to the Project Affairs Department so that I may stay in Siying and may meet more colleagues.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Because transportation is still inconvenient, no brothers and sisters have come here yet from Hong Kong or Canton.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Will any brothers or sisters from the church in Shanghai come south in the near future?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord's presence be with you all.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Your brother,</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Yu Pao-sheng</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>November 18, 1947</S>
