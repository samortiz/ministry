<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 4; 10:10; 1 John 5:12; John 6:63</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING AN IMPORTANT MATTER<br />
IN THE UNIVERSE</h2>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; Verse 10 of chapter 10 says, &ldquo;The thief does not come except to steal and kill and destroy; I have come that they may have life and may have it abundantly.&rdquo; First John 5:12 says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; John 6:63 says, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; These verses show that life is a great matter in the universe and an important topic in the Bible.</p>
<p>If there were no life in the universe, the universe would have no meaning. However, there are many organisms in the universe, and each organism has its own life. This is true even in a family. If there is no life in a family, a family has no purpose or meaning. For a normal family to have the pleasure of life, it should be filled with many expressions of life. We should also consider the many kinds of plant life and animal life. With the plant life, there are flowers, grass, and trees, and with the animal life, there are cats and dogs. Besides these, there is also the human life. What would be the meaning of a family without life? Life is very important. The meaning of human life lies entirely in life. The history and the meaning of the entire universe also lie in life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIFE BEING A MYSTERY</h2>
<p>Life is the most wonderful and mysterious thing. Scientists are able to make almost anything; however, they are not able to produce life. Scientists can make an artificial egg that looks exactly the same as a real egg in its shape and composition, but the artificial egg does not have life. There are also artificial flowers and trees, some of which are so skillfully made that it is difficult to tell whether or not they are real. However, no matter how skillful the work of scientists is, they cannot give life to artificial things. This is because life is in the hand of God.</p>
<p>I once asked several renowned doctors whether a person has fewer elements within him when he is dead than when he is alive, since when he is alive, he has life, and when he is dead, he has no life. They replied that the only thing missing in a dead person is life; all the elements that were in him when he was alive remain intact. However, they could not determine what life is. In the universe life truly exists, but even until today scientists are still not able to give an accurate definition of life. What is life? Even now, no one is able to clearly define life. Hence, life is a mystery.</p>
<p>The mystery of life can be illustrated by electricity. Although science has advanced, no one has ever seen electricity. The light that comes out of a lamp is not electricity. It is merely the expression of electricity. Electricity is used everywhere; however, no one has seen electricity. Although we can see only the expression of electricity, we are able to contact electricity. Electricity is a mysterious thing; it is powerful and useful and mysterious. Similarly, there is &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; within us. This &ldquo;electricity&rdquo; is life. Even though our existence lies in life and our meaning also lies in life, no one understands life or the mystery of life.</p>
<p>Every kind of life has an innate ability that enables it to have a certain kind of living. For example, a cat is able to catch mice, and a dog is able to bark, but they are not taught to do this. There are many other examples, such as fish swimming in water and birds flying in the air. These are spontaneous expressions of life. A fish that is kept out of water will not live; similarly, a bird that is put into the water will not live. We are human beings because we have the human life, which enables us to do human things and have a human living. This is an obvious law. Every kind of life has its kind of innate ability, which produces a certain kind of living.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HUMAN LIFE BEING SINFUL AND WEAK</h2>
<p>What kind of life do we have from birth? We have the human life from birth. This life was created by God, and it has three areas of function: mind, emotion, and will. The mind is used for considering matters, the emotion is related to preferences, and the will is related to decisions. All three of these functions have two sides. For example, a person can have good thoughts as well as have bad thoughts. With regard to his emotions, he may love good things and love bad things. With regard to his will, he may choose good things and choose bad things. From the standpoint of experience, a decent person may spend half of his time thinking about good things, loving good things, and choosing good things. The other half of his time might be spent thinking about bad things, loving bad things, and choosing bad things.</p>
<p>Let us consider further. What kind of life enables a person to do good things as well as bad things and to have good thoughts as well as bad thoughts? This kind of life cannot be the life that we have in the Lord after we are saved. It comes from the life that we have from before we were saved. All human beings have life, but this life has problems, because sometimes it leans toward good things and at other times toward bad things. Previously we said that a decent person spends half his time on good things and the other half on bad things, but this is not truly accurate. It is more accurate to say that a person spends ninety percent of his time on bad things and ten percent on good things. We are bad more often than we are good because we can appear to be good on the surface but not be good inwardly. Even when we are good, there is an element of bad in our good intentions.</p>
<p>For example, sometimes we love others, but there are pride, selfishness, greed, and self-interest in our love. In itself love is good; however, in our love there are pride, selfishness, greed, and self-interest, all of which are not good. Suppose you are a gentle person. Your gentleness is good, but in your gentleness there is a &ldquo;worm&rdquo; of pride that grows and surrounds your gentleness. Those who are very gentle are often the most proud. There is a hidden pride within them. They dislike and condemn others who are not as gentle as they are. Here is another example. Suppose you are a person who honors your parents. You always respect and obey them. This is good. However, even though you listen to your parents and honor them, in your honoring there is an impure element.</p>
<p>After considering these examples, it is easy to see that there is not much good in us. This can be compared to buying fruit. We are often deceived by the appearance of the fruit, because it may look very nice, but when we cut it open, we discover that half of the fruit is rotten or discolored. The discolored part may even have a worm in it. If we use a knife to cut out the rotten portion, the deeper we cut into the fruit, the more we need to throw away. Sometimes no part of the fruit is edible. Therefore, fruit may look good, but after all the cutting is done, nothing good is left, and the entire fruit has to be discarded. Similarly, you may appear to be a good person, but if you investigate, you will find that your so-called good part is not really good. You may live a life that is seemingly good, but if you examine yourself thoroughly, the Holy Spirit will speak to you and enlighten you concerning the impure elements in your love, gentleness, humility, and honoring and obeying of your parents. You may say that you are an honest person, but eventually you will discover that there are problems in your honesty. You will also discover that in your living there are problems that cannot bear careful examination. You will see your mistakes and understand that you have stains and that you are not entirely good. The reason you are not good is that the life you have from birth is a sinful life.</p>
<p>We should never think the reason we are not good is simply that we were influenced by others or because we picked up a bad habit. We must realize that the reason we can be influenced by others or pick up a bad habit is because of the nature of our life. In my home we have a cat and a dog, and they get along well with each other. However, although they have lived together for a long time, the cat never barks, and the dog never chases after mice. When the dog sees a stranger coming, it barks incessantly. The cat has been watching the dog for many years, but the cat never barks. When the cat sees a mouse, it will immediately lunge after it. The dog has also been watching the cat for years, but it has never been influenced by the cat, nor has it picked up the habit of chasing after mice. This is because the dog and the cat have different lives; hence, the innate ability of their lives is also different.</p>
<p>If two lives are the same, they can influence each other. Consider your human life. If you live with a classmate for a period of time, whatever bad things he does can affect you. If he is good at taking advantage of others, you might become more skillful than he is in taking advantage of others. If he is capable of lying, you may become more capable than he is at lying. However, you should not blame your classmate; instead, you should realize that if your life and his life were not the same, neither life could influence the other. You are influenced because your life is the same as his life. His life is dark, and is yours; his life is evil, and so is yours. Young people may not do too many bad things when they are apart. However, if two young people have evil intentions, when they come together, they will incite each other to do bad things.</p>
<p>You should never think it is only other people who affect you. Gradually, you will also affect others. After you are affected by others, you may become even more skilled at doing bad things. Then in another six months other people may become better than you at doing bad things. By competing in this way, you become more advanced in doing sinful things. This is the way many young people end up doing wicked things. Before a young man gets together with a classmate, he may not know too much, and he cannot do too many wicked things. After he meets an evil classmate, however, the wickedness within him is stirred up by this classmate. The wickedness that comes forth reinforces the wickedness in his evil friend. In this way, they both become more skilled and advanced in doing sinful things.</p>
<p>You should never think that these sinful things are learned and passed on to you. None of these sinful things are an outward matter. They come out from within man. Every person has wicked and corrupted things in him. This is because man&rsquo;s life is a wicked life; it is a life full of all kinds of evil, and it is capable of doing all kinds of evil. Do you consider yourself to be a good person or an evil person? This is not an easy question to answer. I would say that I am the most wicked person. Every wicked thing is in me, every deceitful thing is in me, and every evil thing is in me. Not only am I an evil and vile person with tens of thousands of sins in me, but my inward being can be likened to a warehouse of wicked things. We all must admit that nothing good dwells in us (Rom. 7:18).</p>
<p>According to the Old Testament, when God called Moses to lead the Israelites out of Egypt, Moses felt that he was not qualified and asked God to give him some signs. God asked Moses to put his hand into his bosom (Exo. 4:6). Many years ago when I read this portion, I had the concept that when Moses put his hand in his bosom, he should have pulled out something precious that would become a magic weapon for him to deliver the Israelites out of Egypt. However, when Moses put his hand in his bosom and took it out again, his hand was leprous. Leprosy is a most unclean disease. Moses did not bring out anything good from within himself. God&rsquo;s intention was for Moses to realize that there was nothing good in him.</p>
<p>Everyone who is called by God and wants to be used by God must know himself to the same extent; that is, he must know that there is nothing good in himself. Everything in him is evil, sinful, and leprous; therefore, he must not depend on himself. God seemed to tell Moses, &ldquo;Do you want to be My servant? Do you want to be used by Me to deliver the Israelites? Then please remember this sign, this miracle, this evidence, this manifestation, so that you may know yourself and realize that you are corrupt. The more you realize your corruption, the more you will become a person in My hand. The more you realize your corruption, the more you will be used by Me. The more you realize your corruption, the more you will receive My grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I was also a youth. I know that every young person is proud and considers himself to be good. However, let me tell you this: When you think that you are good, that is when you reject and lose the Lord&rsquo;s grace. If you would receive His mercy and allow Him to enlighten you, in His light you will discover that you are entirely corrupt. Your corruption is not only outward in your conduct, but even more, it is inward in your life and nature. You must know that there is nothing good in human life; the inner being of every human being is full of deceit. There is even deceit in honesty, and there is pride in humility. There is evil in every human goodness.</p>
<p>Human life is not only sinful but also weak. For instance, if someone says something that is not pleasant, we are offended. This shows that human life is weak. Furthermore, if we are not careful, we may become sick. When the sickness is severe, it may end our life. Hence, the human life is weak and cannot endure trials, tests, or temptations. A little sin or a little temptation causes us to fall. In its morality and in its nature, human life is very weak.</p>
<h2 class="head1">RECEIVING THE LORD&rsquo;S WORD<br />
AND TOUCHING THE LORD&rsquo;S SPIRIT<br />
TO HAVE THE DIVINE LIFE</h2>
<p>Because human life is exceedingly corrupt, weak, and temporary, it is impossible for us to live a good human life with eternal value. Hence, this life must be replaced by another life in order for us to live a good human life with eternal value. This is the reason that we need to be regenerated. We need a higher life&mdash;the life of the Lord Jesus. We must realize that human life is the second best life in the universe. Human life is higher than the plant life and the animal life. However, such a higher life is still a corrupt life, a weak life, and a temporary life. It is an undependable life. For this reason, we must have another life, a higher life, even the highest life. In the universe no life is higher than God&rsquo;s life. This highest life is God Himself. This life is strong and altogether good. It is holy and distinct from all other lives. This life is also transcendent, high, and eternal.</p>
<p>This life is in the Lord Jesus. John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Then verse 4 says, &ldquo;In Him was life, and the life was the light of men.&rdquo; The higher life that we need is in the Word, in God, and in the Lord Jesus; this life is in Him. The Lord said that He came that we may have life and have it abundantly (10:10). First John 5:12 says, &ldquo;He who has the Son has the life; he who does not have the Son of God does not have the life.&rdquo; Some people may ask, &ldquo;How do I have the life of God?&rdquo; We need to see that the life of God is in the Son of God. This transcendent, holy, and eternal life is in the Son of God. John 6:63 says, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life;...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; This life is now in the Spirit and in the words that the Lord speaks. How does the Lord cause this life to enter into us? This life enters into us through the Spirit and through the word. He is the Spirit, and the Spirit is life. At the same time, He is the word, and the word is life. This life is in the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus is the Spirit, and the Lord Jesus is also the word. When we receive the word and touch the Spirit, we receive this life into us.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must realize that human life is corrupt and weak, that we need a higher life, and that this higher life is in the Lord Jesus. The Lord Jesus is the Spirit, and He is also the word. When we believe in the word and receive this word, we will touch the Spirit. Once we touch this Spirit, we will have life. We need the Lord Jesus to be our life. He is the Spirit, and He is also the word. When we receive His word and touch Him as the Spirit, we have life in us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWO</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE PURPOSE OF REGENERATION&mdash;<br />
MAN HAVING ETERNAL LIFE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 1:1-4; 3:1-16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE MEANING OF LIFE IN CREATION<br />
IN GENESIS 1 AND 2</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Lower Forms of Life Being Generated<br />
on the Third Day</h2>
<p>Genesis 1 speaks of life. It begins by saying, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth&rdquo; (v. 1). This refers to God&rsquo;s original creation. After this creation was judged by God due to Satan&rsquo;s rebellion, God worked for six days to restore the heavens and the earth in order to have a further creation. On the first day of His work, &ldquo;God said, Let there be light; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness...And there was evening and there was morning, one day&rdquo; (vv. 3-5). On the first day God caused light to shine. At this point life had not yet been generated; there was only light shining into the darkness and separating the darkness from the light. On the second day God &ldquo;separated the waters which were under the expanse from the waters which were above the expanse...And there was evening and there was morning, a second day&rdquo; (vv. 7-8). On the second day God did a further work of separation. On the first day He separated light from darkness, and on the second day He separated the waters under the expanse from the waters above. On the first day light was used for separation, and on the second day the expanse was used for separation. However, life had not yet come forth.</p>
<p>On the third day &ldquo;God said, Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear; and it was so. And God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas; and God saw that it was good. And God said, Let the earth sprout grass, herbs yielding seed, and fruit trees bearing fruit according to their kind with their seed in them...And God saw that it was good. And there was evening and there was morning, a third day&rdquo; (vv. 9-13). On the third day the dry land was separated from the water. Hence, God&rsquo;s work of separation was in three steps: the separation of light from darkness, the separation of what was under the expanse from what was above it, and the separation of the dry land from the water. By means of these three steps of separation it was possible for life to be generated.</p>
<p>First there was the plant life with the sprouting of grass, herbs, and trees. Both herbs and trees bring forth seeds, which possess life. Since the life of most plants is contained in the seed, the story of life begins with the bringing forth of grass, herbs, and trees. We must remember that it was not until the third day, after the three steps of separation, that life came forth. The first life that came forth was the lowest form of life, the plant life. Although grass and trees have life, they have no consciousness. Thus, they are the lowest form of life.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Higher Forms of Life Being Generated<br />
on the Fourth through the Sixth Days</h2>
<p>Verse 16 says, &ldquo;God made the two great light-bearers, the greater light-bearer to rule the day and the lesser light-bearer to rule the night, and the stars.&rdquo; There were two great light-bearers in the sky&mdash;the sun for the day and the moon for the night. In addition, there were innumerable stars. This is the story of light. On the first day God called forth light, and on the fourth day of His work He brought forth stronger lights. On the first day there was light in the waste and emptiness, but there was not the solid shining of light. There was light in the first day, but the light was not solid. It was not until the fourth day that the light became solid and had a definite form. Not only were there great lights, great bodies; there were also small lights, small bodies. As a result, people can see the sun in the day and the moon and many stars at night. There is light during the day as well as at night; there is light no matter what time it is. This is what God accomplished on the fourth day. On this day light became more definite in form and more solid. This light was for the further generating of life. Without light, there is no life.</p>
<p>On the first day light separated darkness from light, and on the second and third days there were the separation of the water under the expanse from the water above and the separation of dry land from water. Then the plant life was generated on the third day. However, since the first-day light was not sufficiently strong, only a lower form of life was generated. In order to have higher forms of life, there was the need of solid light. Therefore, the solid light on the fourth day was for the generating of higher forms of life. On the fifth day &ldquo;God created the great sea creatures and every living animal that moves, with which the waters swarmed...and every winged bird according to its kind&rdquo; (v. 21). What was created on the fifth day was a higher form of life than that of the plant life. If you walk up to a bird standing on the ground, it will fly away. This proves that birds have consciousness. The same is true with the fish in the sea. When fish sense that people are approaching, they swim away. Some fish are even able to eat bait on a fishhook without being caught. These examples show that the life created on the fifth day is higher than the plant life.</p>
<p>God created many things in the universe. It is wonderful that according to the record of Genesis 1, God did not focus on the various items which He had created. Instead, His attention was entirely on light and life. If we read chapter 1 carefully, we will see that the record in this chapter does not stress God&rsquo;s mighty power or His wonderful works. Genesis 1 stresses the generating of life through the shining of light. This is the meaning of the record in this chapter.</p>
<p>On the first day light was brought in, and subsequently there were three steps of separation to generate the lowest forms of life. Then on the fourth day the strong light came in to generate higher forms of life. Not only so, God worked on the sixth day to bring forth still higher forms of life. There were two steps in the work of God on the sixth day. First, the living animals were created: &ldquo;cattle and creeping things and animals of the earth according to their kind&rdquo; (v. 24). <em>Cattle</em> refers to cows and sheep, and <em>animals of the earth</em> refer to other creatures, such as lions, tigers, and elephants. There are also various kinds of creeping things. The most prominent among them are probably snakes. These living creatures have a higher form of life than that of the fish in the sea and the birds in the air. Most of the fish in the sea and the birds in the air are oviparous, not viviparous. However, the animals that came forth on the sixth day, such as cows, sheep, lions, and tigers, are viviparous animals. These animals possess consciousness and feelings that are much higher than the consciousness and feelings of fish and birds. Hence, the creatures created by God on the sixth day have a much higher form of life.</p>
<p>In the second part of His work on the sixth day, God created man. Verse 26 says that God created man in His own image and according to His own likeness. From this verse we see that man has the highest form of life, because man&rsquo;s life is similar to God&rsquo;s life. The plant life is not similar to God&rsquo;s life nor is the animal life. Oviparous life is not similar to God&rsquo;s life and neither is the viviparous life. The last creature created by God was man. Man&rsquo;s life is similar to God&rsquo;s life because man was created in God&rsquo;s image and according to God&rsquo;s likeness; that is, man has God&rsquo;s image as well as God&rsquo;s likeness. Hence, man&rsquo;s life is the highest of all the created life. Man not only has feelings and consciousness, but he can express God and exercise God&rsquo;s dominion. Therefore, God gave all that He had created in the sea, on the land, and in the air to man for man to exercise authority over them. Man has the highest form of created life.</p><h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Life Being Manifested<br />
as the Tree of Life in Genesis 2</h2>
<p>In Genesis there is a clear picture explaining God&rsquo;s work of restoration and further creation in six days. This work can be divided into two parts: the first three days, which are related to light, and the second three days, also related to light. In chapter 1 the light came on the first day and again on the fourth day. In chapter 2 we see the tree of life (v. 9), signifying that God came to be man&rsquo;s life in the form of food. During the first three days there was light, but the light was not solid. Consequently, the light generated only a lower form of life. The light on the fourth day was solid and thus generated higher forms of life. The forms of life progressed upward in three levels: from the plant life to the animal life, from oviparous life to viviparous life, and from viviparous life to human life, which is the highest form of created life. However, in the universe the progression of life does not stop with human life. There is a life that is higher than human life. This life is God&rsquo;s life. Therefore, in chapter 2 God came to be life by manifesting Himself as the tree of life. The God who came as light is also life (1 John 1:5; John 1:4). He came as food to be received by man (6:51). He came to be eaten by man so that man can receive Him. God is the tree of life as well as the bread of life to be eaten by man. Man needs to receive Him as life.</p>
<p>In the first two chapters of Genesis there are several levels of life. The lowest form of life is the plant life, which is a life without consciousness. The next level of life is the animal life, the fish and the birds. This life is higher than the plant life and possesses consciousness, but it is an oviparous life and is very low. The third level of life is the viviparous animal life, which is the middle level of life with consciousness. Above this is the created life with the highest consciousness, that is, human life. Therefore, there are at least four levels of life. First is the life without consciousness, which is level one. Then there is the life with consciousness, which has three levels: low, middle, and high. However, in the universe, in addition to these forms of life, which are all created, there is still another life, the uncreated life. This life is the highest form of life. This life, which not only has consciousness but has the highest form of consciousness, is the divine life. It is God Himself&mdash;God&rsquo;s life. This is the life that is signified by the life of the tree of life in chapter 2.</p>
<p>Genesis 1 speaks of the created life, and chapter 2 speaks of the uncreated life, God&rsquo;s life, God Himself. Five levels of life exist with three levels of light. The first level of light is the first-day light. The second level is the fourth-day light, which is solid. The third level of light is in Genesis 2, where God Himself came to be light to shine Himself into man. God desires to enter into man to be man&rsquo;s life so that man can obtain Him as the highest life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ADAM HAVING ONLY THE HUMAN LIFE</h2>
<p>Let us now consider how God created Adam. Genesis 2:7 says, &ldquo;Jehovah God formed man from the dust of the ground and breathed into his nostrils the breath of life, and man became a living soul.&rdquo; This verse shows that Adam was created with only the human life; he did not have God&rsquo;s life. According to the record in the Bible, the life that Adam had when he was created was good. We know this because God considered His work of creation in the first five days to be good (1:4, 10, 12, 18, 21, 25), but on the sixth day &ldquo;God saw everything that He had made, and indeed, it was very good&rdquo; (v. 31). This indicates that what God created on the sixth day was very good. Since what God did was very good, we must believe that Adam&rsquo;s life was good. Nevertheless, even if Adam could love others and show humility and gentleness, and even if he was not proud, did not hate others, and did not steal, he had only the human life; he did not have God&rsquo;s life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE PURPOSE OF REGENERATION BEING<br />
FOR MAN TO HAVE ETERNAL LIFE</h2>
<p>The Bible speaks concerning regeneration. What is regeneration? According to its literal meaning, the prefix <em>re</em> means to do something again; hence, <em>regeneration</em> means &ldquo;to generate again.&rdquo; Regeneration is a great truth in the Bible. It is also necessary in order for man to satisfy God&rsquo;s intention in His creation of human life. In John 3:7 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;You must be born anew.&rdquo; No matter what the state of our original life is, we must be born again to satisfy God&rsquo;s intention. Regeneration is for us to obtain God&rsquo;s eternal life in addition to our human life. In chapter 3, after speaking at length about being born anew, the Lord pointed out that the life we obtain from regeneration is the eternal life (v. 36). This eternal life is God Himself; it is also the life of God, the life signified by the tree of life. As a created being, Adam had a created life; he did not have the uncreated life. He had human life but not God&rsquo;s life. Although his life was good, his life was not God&rsquo;s life; it was merely human life. God placed Adam in front of the tree of life, indicating that God&rsquo;s intention was for Adam to obtain the life of God, in addition to his human life. A person is regenerated when he obtains the uncreated life of God in addition to his created life.</p>
<p>In Genesis 2 God&rsquo;s intention was for Adam to eat the tree of life; however, according to the record in chapter 2, Adam did not eat of the tree of life. The record concerning Adam&rsquo;s eating is in chapter 3. Adam did not eat the tree of life. He ate the wrong tree; he ate from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Therefore, at the end of chapter 3 God guarded the way to the tree of life (v. 24). Since Adam ate of the wrong tree, he was not allowed to eat of the right tree. If Adam had eaten the fruit from the tree of life, he would have received God&rsquo;s life into him; he would have been regenerated.</p>
<p>Today in the New Testament age a person needs to believe into the Lord Jesus in order to be regenerated. Concerning regeneration, the Gospel of John says, &ldquo;In Him was life&rdquo; (1:4). The Lord Himself told His disciples that He is a tree (15:1) and that He is &ldquo;the bread of life&rdquo; (6:35). These three points show that the Lord Jesus is the tree of life and that He is God coming to be our life. He said, &ldquo;He who eats Me, he also shall live because of Me&rdquo; (v. 57), and &ldquo;He who believes into the Son has eternal life&rdquo; (3:36). In these verses eating is the same as believing. Believing into the Lord Jesus is equivalent to eating Him. We usually say that we receive the Lord Jesus. However, the word <em>receive</em> is not specific, because there are many kinds of receiving. For instance, when I give a person a hymnal, he receives it. That kind of receiving is outward. If I give him a glass of water to drink and he drinks it, that is also receiving, but this kind of receiving is inward. Our receiving of the Lord Jesus is not an outward receiving. Our receiving of the Lord Jesus is to take Him into us by eating Him.</p>
<p>Not only so, what a person eats becomes part of him. Hence, if Adam had eaten the tree of life, it would have been equivalent to Adam receiving the Lord of life into himself to be his life. Adam was a created man with only the human life. He received the breath of life from God, which became his spirit, but he did not obtain the element of God. He had only the created life, not God&rsquo;s uncreated life. He still needed to be born again.</p><h2 class="head1">ALL HUMAN BEINGS WHETHER GOOD OR BAD,<br />
NEEDING TO BE REGENERATED</h2>
<p>We should never think that only fallen men need to be born again, or that a person who is not fallen would not need to be born again. Even if man were not fallen, he would still need to be regenerated. Even the best man is only human; he does not possess the element of God. He has only man&rsquo;s life, not God&rsquo;s life. God ordained that His element and His life would enter into man so that God would be mingled with man. Therefore, whether a person is good or bad, he needs to be born again. Man needs God to enter into him to be his life. Besides the created life in him, man needs to obtain another life, the uncreated life.</p>
<p>Regeneration means that in addition to our life, we obtain another life, God&rsquo;s life, which is a second life, the eternal life, the highest life. How can a person obtain this life? After God created man, God placed man in front of the tree of life so that man would receive God as life. If man had received Him, God would have entered into man to be man&rsquo;s life. In other words, the life of the tree of life would have entered into man; the tree of life would have been planted into man. Thus, God would be in man, and man would have obtained the highest life.</p>
<p>I hope that this picture will be deeply etched into us: human beings need to have God&rsquo;s life. It is not that we are fallen and thus we need God&rsquo;s life. Even if man had not fallen, he would still have needed God&rsquo;s life. God&rsquo;s intention is to work Himself into us as our life. We should not have a religious concept and think that God wants us to worship Him and do things for Him. This is not God&rsquo;s intention. God has only one intention: He desires that we receive Him into us as our life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">HAVING CHRIST AS LIFE<br />
IN ORDER TO LIVE OUT THE HIGHEST LIVING</h2>
<p>In John 3 Nicodemus went to see the Lord Jesus. Nicodemus was a religionist who was full of religious concepts. He addressed the Lord as &ldquo;Rabbi,&rdquo; because he thought the Lord Jesus had &ldquo;come from God as a teacher&rdquo; (v. 2). A teacher teaches others. Nicodemus considered the Lord Jesus to be a teacher, who came for the sole purpose of teaching people in order to improve them and make them better persons. For example, if a brother loses his temper often, someone may come to teach him, and say, &ldquo;Do not lose your temper. You should speak with patience and have a good attitude, because God does not like people to get angry. Our anger does not fulfill God&rsquo;s righteousness. Blessed are those who are meek.&rdquo; To give this kind of advice is to teach. Let us use another example. Suppose a brother is narrow-hearted and often jealous of others. When the sisters are praised, he becomes angry. Someone may come to him and say, &ldquo;You should not be bothered when the sisters are praised, because brothers are different from sisters. The sisters have their heads covered, and the brothers have the headship. Hence, you should enlarge your heart.&rdquo; This is teaching. It is an attempt to improve the brother, to make him better.</p>
<p>A person with dirty clothes and messy hair can be given clean clothes and a comb, but this would improve only his outward appearance. This can be likened to the work done in a mortuary. People who work in a mortuary dress up dead people and make them look nice. The dead people in a mortuary may be dressed up and look nice, but they still have the appearance of death. They do not have a desirable appearance.</p>
<p>Those who are teachers can be likened to a mortician in a mortuary. If a person attempts to teach you in this way, you should say, &ldquo;Do not teach me in this way. Do not do the work of a mortician on me. Yes, I am dead, but the work of a mortician cannot help me. You may change my clothes, but I am still dead; you may put makeup on my face and wash me, but I am still dead. What I need is life. I do not need outward improvement.&rdquo; This is what the Lord Jesus revealed to Nicodemus. Nicodemus seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Lord, since You have come from God as a teacher, I have come to You to let You do the work of a mortician on me to change me, teach me, and improve me.&rdquo; However, the Lord Jesus replied, &ldquo;Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&rdquo; (v. 3). The Lord told Nicodemus that teaching and improvement availed nothing; Nicodemus needed to obtain another life. Without this other life, Nicodemus was in a different sphere, a different realm, and a different kingdom. God&rsquo;s kingdom is God&rsquo;s sphere, God&rsquo;s realm. Without obtaining God&rsquo;s life, Nicodemus could not understand the things in God&rsquo;s sphere, God&rsquo;s kingdom. He needed to obtain God as his life.</p>
<p>Similarly, we need to have God&rsquo;s life, not only our human life. Do not think that we are asking you to join a religion. Please remember that all the work in religion is the same as the work done in a mortuary. If anyone attempts to teach us, telling us to be patient and meek and to have good behavior, we should tell him not to do the work of a mortician on us. We do not need any dead work. We need to have God&rsquo;s life within. We need to eat the tree of life and receive its fruit into us. This is regeneration. Only when a man receives Christ as his life can he live out the highest living.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THREE</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE CROSS SOLVING<br />
THE PROBLEM OF MAN&rsquo;S SIN<br />
FOR MAN&rsquo;S REGENERATION</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 7:8, 17; 8:3; Num. 21:4-9; John 3:14-16; 1 Pet. 2:24</h1>
<h2 class="head1">MAN HAVING SIN</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Three Aspects of Sin&mdash;<br />
Sinful Deeds, the Sinful Nature,<br />
and the Record of Sin</h2>
<p>In order to see how man can obtain the highest life, God&rsquo;s life, we need to see that we are different from Adam when he was first in the garden of Eden. In the beginning in the garden of Eden, Adam had the created human life but not the uncreated life of God. Similarly, when we were born, we also had the created human life but not the uncreated life of God. However, we have something more than Adam had; in the beginning in the garden of Eden, Adam was sinless, but we are sinful.</p>
<p>Sin involves both outward sins and inward sin. These two aspects of sin result in a third aspect&mdash;a record of sin before God. Whenever sin is mentioned, these three aspects are involved: one is outside of us, another is inside of us, and the third is before God. Outside of us are sinful deeds, sinful acts; inside of us is a sinful nature, a sinful disposition; and at the same time, before God there is a record of our sin.</p>
<p>Sinful deeds refer to sinful acts, such as lying, reviling, cheating, and stealing. I believe that we all have stolen something from others. At the least we have stolen from our parents; some steal candy, and others steal money. In our heart we all know what we have stolen. Moreover, we all have hated others and been jealous of others. For example, we are discontent when we score ninety-seven in an exam but someone else scores ninety-eight. These are sinful acts.</p>
<p>The sinful nature refers to an element in our nature. In our nature there is an element called sin. What is sin? Romans 7:8 says, &ldquo;Sin, seizing the opportunity through the commandment, worked out in me coveting of every kind.&rdquo; Hence, the sin in us is something living. It is not only living; it also has power and authority. Verse 17 says, &ldquo;Now then it is no longer I that work it out but sin that dwells in me.&rdquo; This verse points out that sin with its power dwells in us. The word <em>dwells</em> is a particular verb. We do not say that a bench dwells in a room, because a bench is not living. We can say that a dog or a cat dwells in a room, because they are living. For something to dwell, it must be living. Sin not only lives in us; it also dwells in us. Therefore, we should never think that sin refers only to the sinful deeds we commit. There is something living in us that drives us to commit sins and that thing is our sinful nature.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Man Having a Sinful Nature,<br />
and Sin Having Power</h2>
<p>Romans 6:6 and 14 say that we are slaves of sin and that sin is ruling over us as our lord. Sin dwells in us as our lord, and the power of sin is able to rule us. Not only so, sin also has the power to force us to do the things that we dislike. This can be likened to a person who is standing in the middle of a river. The river exerts such power on the person that he is carried along by the flow of the river. The sin in us has this kind of power. It will cause us to do the things that we hate and go to places that we dislike. This proves that the sin in us is living and has authority and power.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE SINFUL NATURE IN MAN<br />
BEING THE NATURE OF SATAN, THE DEVIL</h2>
<p>What is this sinful nature, the power of sin, within man? To put it simply, it is the nature of Satan. When we were saved, we were born of God to have the life and nature of God; in the same way, when man fell, he was born of Satan, to have the life and nature of Satan. The Bible says that all who sin are children of the devil (1 John 3:10; John 8:44). Every child is born of his father and, hence, has his father&rsquo;s life and nature. All the descendants of Adam are sinners and children of the devil. They are born of the devil and have the life and nature of the devil. This nature of the devil within us is sin. The sinful nature in us is the nature of the devil.</p>
<p>Everyone who is saved has God&rsquo;s nature within him. This nature of God, which is God Himself, is the element of God. In the same principle, fallen sinners as Adam&rsquo;s descendants have the sinful nature within them. This sinful nature is the nature of the devil, or we may say that it is the devil himself, his element.</p>
<p>When someone says that the devil is in us, perhaps we do not believe it, or we may even become angry. However, if someone says to me that I am a wicked person, I would reply, &ldquo;Of course I am. Since I have the devil in me, how can I not be wicked?&rdquo; When Adam was created, he was pure and had only the human element. However, one day he received Satan&rsquo;s word and ate the fruit from the tree of the knowledge of good and evil. Thus, Satan, through his word and through the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, entered into Adam. From that time Adam was no longer pure, because within Adam there was not only the element of man but also the element of Satan, the devil.</p>
<p>We can use a glass of water as an illustration. Originally, Adam was like a glass of water. In the garden of Eden he was very pure. However, one day Satan, through his word and the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, injected his element and thoughts into Adam. From that time onward, Adam was no longer pure; instead, he was filled with Satan&rsquo;s poisonous element. Adam became another person; he became the devil, Satan.</p>
<p>Whom do you look like when you are angry or play mah-jongg? If you look at yourself in the mirror, will you see a demon or a human being? You may seem to be kind and polite and to look like a human being who is very proper. However, since you are fallen, you are contaminated and damaged, and you have the poisonous element of Satan in you. I am not saying this in a casual way. The gamblers in a casino look like demons. The Chinese refer to gamblers as gambling demons, drunkards as drinking demons, and opium-smokers as opium demons. There are all kinds of demons. When people commit sin, they look like the devil.</p>
<p>Initially, Adam was like a glass of water; however, Satan, through his words and the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, injected his thoughts as poison into Adam. Therefore, as Adam&rsquo;s descendants, we have inherited this poison in our nature. Therefore, we are not only human beings from birth; we are also contaminated with the element of Satan. We have to admit that as sinners our sinning is involuntary; it is not dependent on us.</p>
<p>The first time a person plays mah-jongg, he may think that he likes it. Later, however, he becomes sick and tired of playing and even hates playing mah-jongg. At this time he discovers that whether or not he plays mah-jongg is not up to him. He discovers that there is a force within him that propels him and forces him to play. There was once a man who played mah-jongg to the extent that he felt that he was imprisoned by it. Then he began to hate playing mah-jongg. However, he could not stop playing, because there was a force in him propelling him to play.</p>
<p>There was another person who would dance until two or three in the morning every day. It was as if his two legs would mysteriously begin to dance as soon as the sun went down. After dancing, his back would ache and his legs would be sore, such that he lay on the bed and wondered why he caused himself to suffer so much. When he woke up in the morning, he would tell himself that he would never go dancing again. However, as soon as the sun set, inexplicably he would go to the dance hall. When he finished dancing and returned home, he would berate and loathe himself. It was not until he was saved that he realized that it was not he who went to dance but that there was an evil power, an evil nature or a corrupted life, within him that propelled him, forced him, and pushed him to dance. Those who drink, smoke, or gamble will invariably discover that there is an evil force compelling them to do these things.</p><h2 class="head1">THE CROSS SOLVING MAN&rsquo;S PROBLEMS OF SIN<br />
FOR MAN TO OBTAIN GOD&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>For the created man, Adam, to obtain God&rsquo;s life in the garden of Eden, all he had to do was eat the fruit of the tree of life and thereby contact God. Regrettably, Adam was tempted by Satan to eat the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil and was corrupted. Consequently, today we also suffer from the same poisonous damage and thus have a mixture within us. We not only have the element of man but also the element of the devil, Satan. It is therefore not as simple for us to obtain God&rsquo;s life as it was for the created man, Adam, in the beginning.</p>
<p>If we would receive God&rsquo;s life, first of all the problems of sin need to be solved. On the one hand, we have a sinful nature within us, and on the other hand, we have many sinful deeds outside of us. In addition, before God we also have a record of sin. If these matters are not solved, we cannot receive God. God can give us His life only when these three aspects of sin&mdash;the sinful deeds, the sinful nature, and the record of sin&mdash;are solved.</p>
<p>In Genesis 3, after Adam ate the fruit of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, he became fallen, because Satan&rsquo;s evil element entered into him. For this reason, God immediately drove Adam out of the garden of Eden and closed the way to the tree of life. God could not allow a corrupted man, a man who had the element of Satan, to contact the tree of life and receive God&rsquo;s element and thereby live forever. This kind of mixture would not be accepted or approved by God. God wanted to solve the problem of man&rsquo;s sin. He wanted to deal with the sinful element, the satanic element, within man. God wanted to &ldquo;detoxify&rdquo; man. Only then could He give man His life. It was therefore necessary to have redemption through the cross. There was a need for the Lord Jesus to accomplish redemption on the cross.</p>
<p>Before man became fallen, there was no need for redemption in order for him to receive God&rsquo;s life. Even though God still needed to pass through incarnation, death, and resurrection in order for man to receive God&rsquo;s life, such a death would have only been a life-dispensing death, not a redemptive death as well. This is similar to a grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying to bring forth many grains (John 12:24). It is also similar to food going through the process of cutting and cooking so that it can be eaten by us and turned into nutrients to be the life element in us. In both cases the process of &ldquo;death&rdquo; is necessary, but only for the impartation of life. Before the fall God still needed to be processed in order for man to obtain God as life. However, for fallen and corrupted people to obtain God as life, God also had to pass through death to accomplish redemption. Hence, when the Lord Jesus was crucified, both blood and water flowed out of His side (19:34). Blood signifies the redemptive aspect of His death. Water signifies the life-imparting aspect of His death, which can be compared to a grain of wheat falling into the ground and dying yet bearing many grains.</p>
<p>Furthermore, when the Lord Jesus died on the cross, He stood in the position of a sinner and bore the sins of sinners. Isaiah 53:6 says, &ldquo;Jehovah has caused the iniquity of us all / To fall on Him.&rdquo; He bore up our sins in His body on the tree (1 Pet. 2:24). During the second half of the time that the Lord was on the cross, darkness fell over all the land. During that time He cried out, &ldquo;My God, My God, why have You forsaken Me?&rdquo; (Matt. 27:46). God forsakes a man entirely because of sin. However, the Lord Jesus was sinless even when He was on the cross. Why did God forsake Him? The Lord Jesus was forsaken by God because He was bearing our sins. Jehovah caused all our sins to fall on the Lord Jesus; the Lord Jesus bore all our sins. He stood in the position of a sinner; hence, He was forsaken by God, judged by God, stricken by God, and put to death by God. Thus, the Lord accomplished redemption for us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD AS THE BRONZE SERPENT<br />
BEING JUDGED ON THE CROSS</h2>
<p>When the Lord Jesus accomplished redemption, not only did He stand in the position of a sinner and bear the sins of all sinners, but He also bore us, the sinners. What does this mean? He is the Word who became flesh. He became the same as we, who have flesh; that is, He became the same as we are by putting on the body of flesh. In our flesh there is the element of sin. However, the flesh which the Lord Jesus became did not have the element of sin. He had only the likeness of the flesh of sin (Rom. 8:3) without the element of sin. He had the outward form of sin without the inward poison of sin. Numbers 21:4-9 records the incident of Moses lifting up a bronze serpent. The bronze serpent, which was set on a pole, was a type of the Lord Jesus. John 3:14 says, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up.&rdquo; This shows that the bronze serpent refers to the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>According to Genesis, the serpent in the garden was the devil. One day the devil went to Eve and seduced both her and Adam. Thus, the poison of the devil entered into Adam. This can be likened to a person being bitten by a venomous snake. The poison of the snake is injected into the blood of the person. In Genesis 3 Satan as a serpent &ldquo;bit&rdquo; Adam, and his serpentine poison entered into Adam. Thus, Adam was filled with the serpentine poison, the element of Satan.</p>
<p>Numbers 21:4-9 says that the people of Israel spoke against God in the wilderness and that fiery serpents came to bite them. When the serpents bit the people, the serpentine poison entered into them. In the eyes of God, all those who were bitten by the serpents became serpents. We are not only human beings; we are also serpents.</p>
<p>In the eyes of God, the Israelites who were bitten by the serpents all became serpents. They committed sin, were poisoned by the serpents, and were to be judged by God. The children of Israel committed sin and offended God; consequently, God had to judge them. But Moses prayed to God and asked God to forgive them. Therefore, God told Moses to make a bronze serpent and set it on a pole. If a person who was bitten looked at the bronze serpent, he would live. God judged the sinful Israelites, and at the same time He set up a way of salvation to deliver them. God asked Moses to make a bronze serpent to be judged as a substitute for the Israelites.</p>
<p>Every descendant of Adam is poisoned by the devil and has become a serpent. However, God&rsquo;s way of salvation, which He set up for us, is to make a bronze serpent to be judged as our substitute. Though this bronze serpent has the form of a serpent, it does not have the serpent&rsquo;s poison. The bronze serpent is a type of the Lord Jesus. He was the serpent lifted up on the pole, but He had only the form of the serpent without the serpent&rsquo;s poison. When He was hung on the cross, He had only the likeness of the flesh of sin; the poison of sin was not in Him. He took the form of a serpent, the flesh of sin, that is, the form of fallen man, the form of Satan, in order to deal with the serpent&rsquo;s poison, the poison of sin, and to deal with Satan, the devil. Hence, in the Lord&rsquo;s death on the cross, not only were all the sinners crucified there, solving the problems of sin and of death; Satan also was crucified. In this way the Lord judged all fallen men and also judged Satan on the cross.</p>
<p>Before the Lord Jesus was crucified, He said, &ldquo;Now shall the ruler of this world be cast out,&rdquo; and &ldquo;the ruler of this world has been judged&rdquo; (John 12:31; 16:11). The ruler of this world is the devil who, being in fallen men, was judged on the cross by God. When the Lord Jesus was incarnated, He put on the likeness of the flesh of fallen man. However, the Lord Jesus, being without sin, had only the likeness of the flesh of sin. He was without the poisonous substance of fallen man. Through incarnation the Word, who is God, became flesh, in the likeness of the flesh of sin, that is, the likeness of a fallen man (1:1, 14). Christ was crucified in the flesh and died in the flesh (1 Pet. 3:18b). Although Christ was a fallen man only in likeness, when He was on the cross, God counted that likeness as real. Since sin, the old man, Satan, the world, and the ruler of the world are all one with the flesh, when Christ died in the flesh, sin was condemned (Rom. 8:3), the old man was crucified (6:6), Satan was destroyed (Heb. 2:14), the world was judged, and the ruler of the world was cast out (John 12:31). Hence, through Christ&rsquo;s death in the flesh all negative things were dealt with.</p>
<p>This is a marvelous matter. When the Lord Jesus was on the cross, not only did He stand in the position of a sinner and bear all our sins, but He also bore us, the sinners. Because Satan is in us, the sinners, the Lord Jesus became a man with the likeness of the flesh of sin. Thus, on the cross the Lord judged man, and He also judged Satan. He judged Satan in man, He condemned sin in the flesh, and He judged sin, which is Satan&rsquo;s nature, Satan himself. The Lord stood in the position of a sinner, bore the sins of man, and had the likeness of the flesh of sin when He died on the cross. He shed His blood to end sin, to terminate Satan, and to redeem man, thereby accomplishing redemption before God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BELIEVING IN THE LORD<br />
IN ORDER TO BE REGENERATED<br />
AND TO SOLVE ALL THE PROBLEMS OF SIN</h2>
<p>Therefore, if we would receive God as our life, we must believe and receive this Savior who died on the cross. As soon as we receive this Savior, we receive the redemption that He accomplished on the cross, which solves the problems of our sinful deeds, our sinful nature, and the record of sin that we have before God. The Lord Jesus solved all the problems of sin. After He died, He released the divine life, and He resurrected from the dead to become the life-giving Spirit (1 Cor. 15:45). Now He is presented to us in His word. If we believe in His words, He, as the life-giving Spirit, will enter into us to be our life.</p>
<p>Once we believe into the Lord Jesus, we pass out of death into life. Formerly, we were those who were bitten by the serpent and were under the pole on which the bronze serpent was set. But as soon as we look at the bronze serpent, we become alive. We come out of death and will not perish. We have eternal life. The Lord Jesus was sinless and did not know sin, but He put on the likeness of the flesh of sin to become sin in order to solve all the problems of sin. Now through faith we may have the life of God and become the righteousness of God in Him (2 Cor. 5:21). We have died to sins so that we can live to righteousness (1 Pet. 2:24). In this way all the problems brought in by Satan are fully resolved. We have God as our life. We have the eternal life within us. This is regeneration.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOUR</h1>
<h1 class="title">WHAT IS REGENERATION</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THAT WHICH IS BORN OF THE SPIRIT BEING SPIRIT</h2>
<p>John 3:3-8 is a record concerning regeneration: &ldquo;Jesus answered and said to him, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God. Nicodemus said to Him, How can a man be born when he is old? He cannot enter a second time into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born, can he? Jesus answered, Truly, truly, I say to you, Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God. That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit. Do not marvel that I said to you, You must be born anew. The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>We must pay special attention to verses 3, 5, and 6. Verse 3 says, &ldquo;Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Then verse 5 says, &ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God.&rdquo; Verse 5 is an explanation of what was said in verse 3. Verse 3 mentions being born anew, and verse 5 explains what is involved in being born anew. To be born anew, to be regenerated, is to be born of water and the Spirit. When one is born of water and the Spirit, he is regenerated, born again.</p>
<p>The second half of verse 3 says, &ldquo;He cannot see the kingdom of God,&rdquo; and verse 5 explains that &ldquo;seeing&rdquo; is &ldquo;entering.&rdquo; To see the kingdom of God is to enter into the kingdom of God. In spiritual matters, seeing is equivalent to entering. As soon as you see a certain spiritual matter, you enter into that matter. To look at it from another perspective, only those who have entered can see. Hence, to see the kingdom of God is to enter into the kingdom of God, and to enter into the kingdom of God is to see the kingdom of God.</p>
<p>Verse 5 explains what is said in verse 3, and verse 6 is a conclusion and summary: &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; These three verses are very precious. Every believer must be able to memorize at least these three verses. Until this day, I can still remember what I memorized before I was twenty-nine years old. While you are still young, learn to memorize the Scriptures. The younger you are, the easier it is for you to memorize. You do not have to memorize the Scriptures chapter by chapter; however, you must memorize the important and precious verses. All the verses in these messages are very important. You should memorize all of them. If you are willing to take the time and make the effort to memorize them, they will make an eternal impression within you and will become a fountain in you to gush out a rich, inexhaustible supply for the rest of your life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">REGENERATION BEING TO HAVE GOD&rsquo;S LIFE<br />
IN ADDITION TO MAN&rsquo;S LIFE</h2>
<p>Now we will see what regeneration is. Regeneration means to be born again, that is, to obtain the life of God in addition to man&rsquo;s life. Even if man did not fall, he would still need God&rsquo;s life in addition to his own life. This means that a person must have two lives: his own human life and God&rsquo;s life. One life is a created life, and the other is an uncreated life. One life is bound by time, and the other life occupies eternity; it is a life that transcends time and space.</p>
<p>Man not only needs to be saved; he also needs a second life. Today Christianity presents the gospel at a low level. Christianity gives people the impression that they need salvation because they are sinful and destined to perish. Actually, we need God&rsquo;s salvation because we need God to be our life. It is not enough for us to have only our human life; we need God&rsquo;s life. It is not enough for us to be born once; we need to be born a second time. This second birth is regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING BORN OF WATER AND THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>According to the record in John 3, initially Nicodemus thought that to be born again was to enter into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born a second time. However, he could not understand how he could enter into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born again. Hence, the Lord Jesus added an explanation. He told Nicodemus, &ldquo;Unless one is born of water and the Spirit, he cannot enter into the kingdom of God&rdquo; (v. 5). To be born again does not mean that a person is born from his mother&rsquo;s womb a second time; rather, it means that a person is born of water and the Spirit.</p>
<p>What do water and the Spirit refer to? When I was young, I read many books concerning this matter, and there are many views. Most of the books said that water denotes the Word and that to be born of water and the Spirit means to be born of the Word and the Spirit. Others said that water denotes something else. We need to carefully consider what it means to be born of water and the Spirit.</p><h2 class="head2">Being Born of Water unto Repentance</h2>
<p>We must first understand that the words of the Lord Jesus were spoken to Nicodemus, who was a Pharisee. The Lord spoke to Nicodemus in plain words, not in symbols. When Nicodemus heard the Lord&rsquo;s words, he understood what they meant. He did not bother to ask the Lord Jesus about the meaning of the word <em>water.</em> This shows that the Lord spoke to Nicodemus in plain words, not in symbols. Water refers to water, and the Spirit refers to the Holy Spirit. Nicodemus understood this.</p>
<p>What do <em>water</em> and <em>the Spirit</em> denote? In John 1:33, John the Baptist said, &ldquo;I did not know Him, but He who sent me to baptize in water, He said to me, He upon whom you see the Spirit descending and abiding upon Him, this is He who baptizes in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; This verse speaks of baptizing in water and also of baptizing in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Matthew 3:7 says, &ldquo;When he saw many of the Pharisees and Sadducees coming to his baptism, he said to them...&rdquo; In this portion John the Baptist was speaking to the Pharisees. In verse 11 he said, &ldquo;I baptize you in water unto repentance, but He who is coming after me is stronger than I, whose sandals I am not worthy to carry. He Himself will baptize you in the Holy Spirit and fire.&rdquo; John the Baptist told the Pharisees that he baptized them in water unto repentance but that He who was coming after him would baptize them in the Holy Spirit. John the Baptist&rsquo;s words concerning water and the Holy Spirit were spoken to the Pharisees. Thus, these terms were familiar to the Pharisees.</p>
<p>John the Baptist said that he baptized people in water unto repentance but that another One was coming who would baptize people in the Holy Spirit unto life. The Pharisees heard these words and understood them. Then, not too long afterward, one of the Pharisees called Nicodemus went to see the Lord Jesus and confessed that the Lord Jesus had come from God as a teacher (John 3:2). The Lord Jesus immediately responded, &ldquo;Unless one is born anew, he cannot see the kingdom of God&rdquo; (v. 3). The Lord was telling Nicodemus that he needed to be born again.</p>
<p>However, Nicodemus thought that to be born again was to enter into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born a second time. The Lord Jesus told him that this was not the case; rather, He was referring to the baptism of water and the Spirit spoken of by John the Baptist. When Nicodemus heard this word, he immediately understood. John the Baptist had said that he baptized people in water unto repentance, but that there was another One who would baptize people in the Holy Spirit unto life. This is what it means to be born of water and the Spirit. Water refers to the baptism of John the Baptist, and the Spirit refers to the baptism of the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>In the New Testament age God first sent John the Baptist to preach the baptism of repentance. A person who received John&rsquo;s preaching would be completely immersed into water; he would be buried in water. What does this mean? When John came preaching the word of repentance, he was saying that all had sinned against God and were corrupt, even incorrigibly corrupt. Hence, they were good for nothing but burial. John told the people who came to listen to his preaching that they were sinful, utterly wicked, and that they were worthy only of death. They were worthy of being terminated and buried.</p>
<p>John the Baptist baptized, buried, people. The baptism of repentance was the center of John&rsquo;s ministry. John told people that his baptizing them in water could only put them into death, bury them, and terminate them. If the Lord Jesus had not come, these people would merely have been terminated. They would not have been born of water; instead, they would have merely gone into water to die. However, not only did John come, but the Lord Jesus also came, and He was greater than John. John could not cause people to have life; he was sent by the Lord merely to put people into death, to bury them and terminate them. John could not give life to people or enliven them. However, the Lord Jesus came to baptize people in the Holy Spirit. To baptize people in the Holy Spirit means that the Triune God wants to enter into people and enliven them so that they may have life and the regenerating Spirit.</p>
<p>In order to be born of water and the Spirit a person needs to confess before God that he opposes and rebels against God. He should turn to God and acknowledge that his inner being is so corrupt and his heart is so wicked that the only remedy is for him to die, to be buried, and to be terminated. A person needs to acknowledge this fact and say, &ldquo;O God, not only is my conduct corrupt, for which I need Your forgiveness and the washing of Your precious blood, but also my nature is so corrupt that I am worthy only of being put to death and buried.&rdquo; The day that I was saved, I did not hear about sin. I only heard about the world&rsquo;s usurpation of man. I was saved, and I did not want the world anymore. Later, when I prayed, the Holy Spirit enlightened me, causing me to see my sins. I remember the experience very clearly. On that day I confessed my sins for at least one or two hours. It seemed that I could not finish confessing them; after I confessed one sin, I became aware of two more, and after I confessed those two, I became aware of more sins. The more I confessed, the more sins I became aware of, until I realized that I am utterly corrupt. I will never forget that experience. I told myself that there was no one in this world who was as rotten as I am. I wished the ground would open up and swallow me. This kind of repenting and confessing is John&rsquo;s water baptism. This is being born of water.</p>
<p>Why should we be baptized as soon as we believe in the Lord? Is baptism a ritual for joining a religion? Sometimes when I ask a person whether he has believed in the Lord, he says that he has believed but that he has not yet been baptized. Baptism is not a ritual for joining a religion. Baptism is to bury us because we are wicked. God in His ordination has already terminated fallen and corrupt man. When the Lord Jesus was put to death on the cross, we were crucified there with Him (Rom. 6:6). We are identified with Christ by faith; hence, His death was our death. We have died in Him. Since we have died, we should be buried. This is what baptism accomplishes. The Lord terminated us on the cross. We died in Christ and were buried together with Him (vv. 3-4).</p>
<p>Hence, on the negative side, we first confess our sins when we believe in the Lord. We confess that we are corrupt to the core and that we are worthy only of death and burial, that is, that we are worthy of being put to death and terminated. Then the Holy Spirit will open our eyes to see that when the Lord Jesus was crucified, He terminated us. We need to be terminated because we have Satan&rsquo;s poison, Satan&rsquo;s element, within us. When the Lord was on the cross, He was in the flesh. He bore every sinner when He was crucified. Therefore, we were crucified together with Him. Through the cross of Christ God terminated us, crucified us. When we believed into the Lord and acknowledged this fact, we were buried and terminated. This is to be born of water.</p><h2 class="head2">Obtaining the Life of God through the Spirit</h2>
<p>What does it mean to be born of the Holy Spirit? When a person believes in the Lord and confesses his sins, the Holy Spirit enters into him to enliven his human spirit. His spirit is immediately enlivened. First there is death, and then there is life. We pass from death into life. This is the way that we obtain a second life. This is the way God&rsquo;s life enters into us.</p>
<p>The life that we receive is resurrection life, which is able to raise us from death. When we are baptized, we do not remain in water to be buried there and never rise again. We must realize that there is not only the ministry of John the Baptist but also the ministry of the Lord Jesus. John&rsquo;s ministry is a ministry of condemnation and death, but the ministry of the Lord Jesus is an enlivening ministry. It is a ministry unto life. The Lord causes people to have life. When the life of God enters into people, they are made alive. When a person is baptized, on the one hand, he is baptized in water, which is a burial; on the other hand, he is raised up out of the water, which is resurrection. The old creation is buried, and the new creation is resurrected. What is in Adam is buried, and what is in Christ is resurrected. Through this process of death and resurrection we are born again, and we obtain a second life&mdash;the life of God.</p>
<p>Without going through this process of death and resurrection, we can have only the human life, not God&rsquo;s life. It is through believing and repenting that we receive this spiritual fact, and it is through our going into death that we can come out of death and have God&rsquo;s life in us, thereby having a second birth and a second life. This is to be born of water and the Spirit. This is regeneration. This is death and resurrection. Water is for death, and the Spirit is for resurrection. Being born of water means that we enter into water and are baptized in water. Being born of the Spirit means that we are resurrected in the Holy Spirit. This is death and resurrection. We receive life through death, and this is also to be born of water and the Spirit. This is regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">ENTERING INTO GOD&rsquo;S KINGDOM<br />
THROUGH REGENERATION</h2>
<p>Once we are regenerated, we have two lives: God&rsquo;s life is added to our human life. We are in God&rsquo;s kingdom, and we know the things of God&rsquo;s kingdom. The word <em>kingdom</em> does not refer merely to a sphere of authority, but even more, it refers to a realm. For instance, there is an animal world and a plant world. Animals know the things in the animal world and do not know the things in the plant world. Likewise, plants know the things in the plant world and do not know the things in the animal world. Birds occupy one section of the animal world, and they know the things in that section. Birds do not know the things in the dog section, the cat section, or the cattle section. Similarly, mankind also has its own world. The human world is the human kingdom. Man has the human life and therefore knows the things in the human kingdom. Likewise, God is also a &ldquo;world.&rdquo; If man wants to understand the things in God&rsquo;s realm and be able to submit to the authority in God&rsquo;s kingdom, man must have God&rsquo;s life. When we have God&rsquo;s life, we are in God&rsquo;s world. Spontaneously, we know the things in God&rsquo;s world, and we can see the things in God&rsquo;s world. This is the result of regeneration.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OBTAINING A SPIRITUAL LIFE<br />
THROUGH REGENERATION</h2>
<p>Through regeneration we have God&rsquo;s life, are in God&rsquo;s world, know the things in God&rsquo;s world, and can submit to the authority of God&rsquo;s kingdom. The life that we obtain through regeneration is not a life of the flesh; it is a spiritual life. Hence, in John 3:6 the Lord said, &ldquo;That which is born of the flesh is flesh, and that which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&rdquo; Nicodemus thought that to be born again was to be born from his mother&rsquo;s womb a second time, but the Lord Jesus said that not only was Nicodemus unable to be born again from his mother&rsquo;s womb, but that even if he were able to enter into his mother&rsquo;s womb and be born again, he would still be born of the flesh and would still be flesh. Since he was born of the flesh, he had only the natural life; that is, he had man&rsquo;s original life, which is now a corrupt life. No matter how many times one could be born of the flesh, his life would still be a corrupt life. This is not regeneration. To be regenerated is to be born not of the flesh but of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO CONTACT GOD WITH OUR SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Man has a body and a spirit deep within him, and between the body and the spirit is the soul. We often confuse the spirit with the soul, but our spirit is different from our soul. Regeneration means that we are born of the Spirit; we are born not in the flesh nor in the soul but in the spirit, which is the deepest part of our being. God is Spirit, and the words that He speaks to us are also spirit (6:63). Since God is Spirit, those who worship Him must worship in spirit (4:24). If we want to contact God, we must be in our spirit. We cannot touch God with our hands nor see God with our eyes nor smell God with our nose. We cannot use any of the sense organs in our physical body to contact God.</p>
<p>Which organ do you use to differentiate the color white from green? If you close your eyes and use your ears, which are for hearing, you will not be able to tell whether a color is white or green. If you close your eyes, you cannot use your ears to hear a color or differentiate any colors. Nevertheless, you cannot say that there are no colors. It is not that there are no colors, but that you are using the wrong organ and hence cannot discern colors. You know when someone is speaking, because you have ears, and you use your ears to hear. You use your eyes to see, but are you able to see sounds? Although there are sounds, they cannot be seen with your eyes; they can be heard only with your ears. If you use the wrong organ, your ability to touch or sense will be annulled.</p>
<p>God is Spirit, and we must worship Him in spirit. We cannot worship God with our ears, eyes, nose, or hands. We must worship Him with our spirit. When we pray, we usually go to a quiet place and close our eyes, because our whole being needs to be calm. All our physical organs need to be brought to a stop so that we can use our inner organ, our spirit, to contact God. We do not contact God and worship Him according to our thoughts, views, feelings, or preferences. On the contrary, we need to stop all these faculties, calm ourselves down, and turn to our spirit. Only then can we contact God. God is Spirit; therefore, we must contact Him with our spirit.</p>
<p>We cannot see God with our eyes, and we are unable to hear Him with our ears. However, if we calm down and use our spirit, if we turn to our spirit to draw near to God and contact Him, immediately we will sense something in our spirit. We will sense that our spirit is bright. There will also be some activity in our spirit that causes us to sense that this or that matter is wrong, or that we should love and cherish others. The fact that there is such activity in us means that God is touching us in our spirit. When God&rsquo;s Spirit touches our spirit, we become enlivened within.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HOLY SPIRIT MOTIVATING<br />
AND OPERATING IN MAN LIKE THE WIND</h2>
<p>The regenerated life inside of us is the Spirit. This Spirit is invisible and intangible. The Lord Jesus said that the Spirit is like the wind. &ldquo;The wind blows where it wills, and you hear the sound of it, but you do not know where it comes from and where it goes&rdquo; (3:8). The Spirit is like the wind and can be very strong.</p>
<p>Every year in Hong Kong, around August or September, there is a strong wind. Sometimes a ship is even blown onto the shore. But have you seen the wind? You may say that you have not seen the wind, but it seems that you have seen it. The wind comes with power and with a manifestation that causes us to recognize that there is wind. Sometimes when we are walking on the street, the wind blows so strongly that it becomes difficult for us to walk. Sometimes the wind blows faster than a car can move. The wind blows where it wills; so is everyone who is born of the Spirit. Although we cannot see or touch the Spirit, He is blowing in us, and sometimes He causes us to be beside ourselves. For this reason, people often say that those who believe in Jesus are not normal. This is true. How can a ship that is blown onto the shore be normal? How can a person who is being pushed by the wind be normal? God operating in us is like the wind blowing on us.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost, the place where the disciples gathered was filled with the wind. A violent wind came and blew upon Peter and John, making them look like they were drunk with wine; they were crazy and fearless (Acts 2:1-13). This is the result of being born of the Spirit. This is a spiritual birth. This is man obtaining the eternal life of God within him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME<br />
AND THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h1>
<p>When some Christians experience an adverse situation or encounter difficulty, other people cannot tell that they are in any kind of turmoil. This does not mean that these Christians do not have any feeling but that they do not express their feeling. I received much help from a brother who knew the Lord. He once said that he did not react in a situation, because the Lord had not reacted within him. His inward situation could not be shaken by outward factors.</p>
<p>We have also seen some Christians who love the Lord, are living, and are often joyful but who are unable to handle any difficulty. When they encounter difficulty, they panic and burst into tears. There was a sister who, after hearing the inaccurate news that her child might have been involved in a car accident, immediately became hysterical. Those who were with her tried to comfort her, saying that she should not panic, because the news may not be accurate, and her child may not have been in that car. They also said that she needed to find out what happened. However, she would not calm down but continued to cry. While she was crying, her child returned. When she saw her child, she could not calm herself down. She held her child tightly and jumped continually for joy.</p>
<p>Some may say that this was a normal human reaction. However, even though a person who allows the Lord to make home in his heart is full of feeling, he is calm in any circumstance he encounters. Even when he is so sad that he is in tears, he is still calm. No matter what kind of pain or joy he experiences, he is calm and secure.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THOSE WHO ALLOW THE LORD<br />
TO MAKE HOME IN THEM BEING CALM AND SECURE</h2>
<p>When the Lord is making His home in our heart, joy and sorrow cannot govern our reactions. A person in whom the Lord is making His home will be calm when giving a message and calm when imprisoned. He is calm whether he is joyful or sorrowful. On the day of Pentecost, Peter spoke in front of a large crowd, yet he was secure (Acts 2:14-41). When Peter was brought before the magistrate, he did not panic when he spoke, and when he was locked up in prison, he was also secure (4:1-20). Peter was calm and secure because the Lord, who is calm and secure, had made His home in Peter. Not only did Peter have the Lord within him and not only did he have the Lord&rsquo;s appearing, but even more the Lord was making His home in Peter.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THOSE WHO ALLOW THE LORD<br />
TO MAKE HOME IN THEM<br />
GIVING THE LORD COMPLETE LORDSHIP</h2>
<p>In order for a person to make home in a house, he must be given the legal right of possession to the house. Then he can completely settle down in the house. If you ask me where the loveliest place in the whole world is, I would say that the loveliest place is my home. Last year I visited several places, but it was only when I returned home that I felt truly at rest, because not only is my body in my home, but my heart is also in my home. Every part of me is in my home. The Lord wants to be life in us to the extent that all that He is can be secure in us. He wants to be life in us to the extent that we become a place where He can dwell securely because He can put everything, including His intention, His way, His work, and His everything, in us.</p>
<p>The Lord gradually becomes our life until He can make us His dwelling place by making His home in our heart. This is what the apostle Paul prayed for in Ephesians 3. He bowed his knees to the Father for this cause, praying that God would cause Christ to make His home in the hearts of the saints through faith (vv. 14, 17). Paul was clear that Christ was in the saints and that they had the Lord&rsquo;s appearing. However, Paul also knew that Christ desired to make His home in the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CHRIST NEEDING TO MAKE<br />
HIS HOME IN THE SAINTS<br />
FOR THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH</h2>
<p>Since the church is the dwelling place of God, the building up of the church will be frustrated if Christ cannot make home in the saints. The church can be manifested and built up only when Christ has made His home in a group of saints. Such saints are not merely saved to have the Lord in them. Neither do these saints merely have the Lord&rsquo;s appearing. They also allow Christ to be their life until Christ occupies every corner of their heart, and they become His dwelling place. When there is such a group of saints, the church is manifested practically and can be built up.</p>
<h2 class="head1">MANIFESTATIONS OF<br />
CHRIST MAKING HIS HOME IN US</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Being Restful in Circumstances</h2>
<p>Several situations manifest that the Lord is making His home in us. The first situation is that we are at rest within. This rest is not limited to certain matters, nor is it manifested only when everything is peaceful. On the contrary, we are at rest within no matter what the time or the circumstance is. We can be at rest because Christ is making His home in us. A lack of joy proves that the Lord needs to make His home in us. The continual absence of peace proves that the Lord needs to make His home in us. We should ask ourselves whether we have peace within and are at rest. If we are at rest and cannot be disturbed, having a calmness that cannot be shaken, the Lord is making His home in us.</p><h2 class="head2">God Being Enthroned in Our Heart<br />
and Ruling over Us in Everything</h2>
<p>When the Lord makes His home in our heart, we will have His throne within us. This is the situation of the New Jerusalem. The New Jerusalem is a city with foundations that are steady, solid, and unshakable. The New Jerusalem is unshakable because it is God&rsquo;s dwelling place. God dwells in the New Jerusalem.</p>
<p>According to the book of Revelation, God&rsquo;s throne is in the New Jerusalem (22:3). This signifies that all authority belongs to God. Every situation that is related to the New Jerusalem is under God&rsquo;s ruling (v. 1). Whether we are God&rsquo;s dwelling place and whether God is making His home in us depend on God&rsquo;s throne being in us and His having the right to rule over us. If we still reserve legal rights to ourselves, that is, if we do not have the throne of God in us, He has not yet made home in our heart.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Full of the Operation of Life</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem is full of the operation of life. The river of water of life flows through the city, and the tree of life grows in it (vv. 1-2). This is altogether a situation of life flourishing. Life is flowing and watering, and life is also supplying and growing. If we read the Scriptures concerning the New Jerusalem carefully, we will see that the New Jerusalem is entirely a manifestation of life. Such a rich manifestation of life is the issue of the river of water of life, which flows continuously without any obstruction. There is no thirst or hunger; rather, the city is full of watering and supply. This is altogether a story of life.</p>
<p>God wants to make home in us in the same way that He is at home in the New Jerusalem. When our condition is that of the New Jerusalem, we will have not only God&rsquo;s throne but also the flow of life. Daily we will be watered within, and we will be without dryness. Daily there will be a flow within us, and we will not be stagnant. Daily we will be satisfied within and not experience any shortage, because we are full of the life supply.</p>
<p>Regrettably, this is often not our situation. On the contrary, we often feel dry, as if life has come to a halt. We are often empty, hungry, weak, depressed, and unable to rise. All of these sensations are because God has not made His home in us. When God cannot flow in us or water and supply us, we are not satisfied. However, the situation in the New Jerusalem is without stagnation, thirst, hunger, or lack. The New Jerusalem is full of the watering of life, the flow of life, the supply of life, and the satisfaction of life, because God has made His home there.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Transparent, Bright, Fresh, and Living</h2>
<p>The New Jerusalem is also in the light. There is absolutely no darkness in it. The light in the city is not the light from the sun or from the moon, but God Himself is the light&mdash;God&rsquo;s glory shines as the light (21:23-25). If God is making His home in us, our inner being will be very bright. Not only will we feel bright, but when other people contact us, they will immediately sense that we are transparent and bright persons. Furthermore, the gold in the New Jerusalem is also transparent (v. 18).</p>
<p>Sometimes when we touch a saint, we may sense that he is in darkness. Within him there is no light, and he is not transparent. His whole being is like a wall made of iron or steel, which no light can penetrate and out of which no light can shine. After sitting with him for half an hour, we feel as if we have been judged by darkness. When we sit with a person who is in darkness, we fall into darkness and are judged by darkness.</p>
<p>Our experience with other saints is different. When we sit with them, we feel bright and transparent. There is a brightness that surrounds them, because their being is full of light. This light shines through a person who is transparent. After sitting with such a saint for an hour, or even half an hour, we feel that we have been blessed and enlightened and that we are abiding in the light. God is making His home in a saint who is full of light. The result of God&rsquo;s making His home in us is that our inner being becomes bright.</p>
<p>The normal condition of a Christian should be that no matter how difficult his circumstances are, how many trials he endures, or how much he suffers, he is always fresh. His condition can be compared to the rising of the morning sun. Whenever and wherever we run into him, we will feel that he is as fresh as the morning and is full of vigor like the dawning of the sun. The only reason for such a condition is that God is making His home in him. Not only does such a saint make us feel fresh, living, secure, at peace, and bright, but when we touch him, we sense that we are touching light. This is the situation of a person in whom God has made His home.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Expressing God</h2>
<p>The result of God&rsquo;s making His home in us is that we express God. The New Jerusalem expresses the glory of God. The only thing that shines in the New Jerusalem is God&rsquo;s glory. The glory of God shines from within the city because God has made His home there. Therefore, when a brother allows God to make His home in him, others cannot see anything but God&rsquo;s expression in him, and all that they can smell is God&rsquo;s aroma. God is expressed through him.</p>
<p>When we let God be our life and live by Him, we not only have light within, know God, and have God as our Lord so that we manifest our function, but even more, we become God&rsquo;s dwelling place. As we continue to let God be our life and let Him live in us, He will eventually occupy our entire being. Our whole being will be occupied and filled with God so that we become His dwelling place and so that He makes His home in us. Then He will not only be within us and appear to us, but He will make His home in us.</p>
<p>In John 14:20 the Lord said, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; Then in verse 23 the Lord said that He and the Father will come to His believers and make an abode with them. This shows that it is one thing to be in the Lord, and it is another thing to allow the Lord to make His home in us. We can experience the Lord to the extent that we not only have the Lord in us and have His appearing, but we also have the Lord making His home in us, dwelling with us, and making an abode with us.</p>
<p>When the Lord makes His home in us, we become a calm and restful person. We become a person who is stable and not easily tossed about. We yield all our legal rights to the Lord and are full of the operation of life, the flow of life, the supply of life, and the satisfaction of life. Not only so, we are also full of light within; there is no darkness, and everything is transparent. Furthermore, what we express is God, because the glory of God shines through us. This is the issue of God making His home in us. Only as we experience this will it be possible for the church to be practically built up and to express God. May we all be graced to know that the Lord is our life and to allow Him to live in us. We must learn to live by Him and cooperate with Him, letting Him appear to us regularly so that He may make His home in us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SIX</h1>

<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 14:3, 10-11, 16-21, 23</h1>
<h2 class="head1">JOHN 14</h2>
<p>In John 14:3 the Lord said, &ldquo;If I go and prepare a place for you, I am coming again and will receive you to Myself, so that where I am you also may be.&rdquo; The Lord said that where He is, we also will be. Where is the Lord? In both verses 10 and 11 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am in the Father and the Father is in Me.&rdquo; These verses show where the Lord is. The Lord clearly says that He is in the Father.</p>
<p>Verses 16 through 19 say, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever, even the Spirit of reality...but you know Him, because He abides with you and shall be in you. I will not leave you as orphans; I am coming to you...But you behold Me; because I live, you also shall live.&rdquo; We live because the Lord lives. In these verses the Lord&rsquo;s living refers to His living after His resurrection. In His resurrection the Lord regenerated us; hence, we live because the Lord lives.</p>
<p>Verse 20 says, &ldquo;In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; The word <em>in</em> is used three times in this verse. In verse 3 the Lord said, &ldquo;Where I am you also may be.&rdquo; Where is the Lord? Both verses 10 and 20 say that the Lord is in the Father. Furthermore, according to verse 20 the Lord wants us to be in Him. If we are in the Lord and He is in the Father, we are also in the Father.</p>
<p>Verse 21 says, &ldquo;He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him.&rdquo; Not only is the Lord in us; He will also manifest Himself to us. It is one thing to have the Lord in us, but it is another thing to have the Lord manifest Himself to us. We often like to use the expression <em>brothers and sisters in the Lord.</em> When we write letters, we often write &ldquo;Dear brother in the Lord&rdquo; or &ldquo;Dear sister in the Lord.&rdquo; A saved one is a person in the Lord, and any person who is in the Lord also has the Lord in him. However, verse 21 says that the Lord will manifest Himself to us. The Lord does not manifest Himself to us because we are saved, but because we love Him. Those who love Him keep His commandments; that is, they walk according to the Lord. These are the ones to whom the Lord manifests Himself.</p>
<p>In verse 23 the Lord said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; Not only will the Lord manifest Himself to us, but He will also come to us and make an abode with us. One translation renders <em>make an abode with him</em> as &ldquo;abide with him.&rdquo; However, in the original language, to make an abode means much more than to abide. There is the meaning of abiding together, but these words imply more than that. The Lord and the Father &ldquo;will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; The abode mentioned in verse 23 is one of the abodes mentioned in verse 2. From our side, this abode is the Lord, but from the Lord&rsquo;s side, we are this abode. From our side, God is our abode, and from God&rsquo;s side, we are His abode.</p>
<p>If after we are saved, we love the Lord, follow Him, and keep His commandments, the Lord will manifest Himself to us and make an abode with us. This means that He will have an abode and that we also will have an abode. This is a mutual abode of God and man. We are God&rsquo;s abode because God is dwelling in us. God is our abode because we dwell in God. We are mingled with God, and this mingling is an abode, a dwelling place. As far as we are concerned, it is our abode, and we dwell in God. As far as God is concerned, it is God&rsquo;s abode, and God dwells in us. The Lord and the Father &ldquo;will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; This means that all the lovers of the Lord will have an abode, and the Son and the Father will also have an abode.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD ASKING THE FATHER<br />
TO SEND THE HOLY SPIRIT<br />
SO THAT WHERE HE IS WE ALSO MAY BE</h2>
<p>In verse 3 the Lord said, &ldquo;So that where I am you also may be.&rdquo; Most people who read John 14 think that this is a reference to the Lord&rsquo;s bringing us to heaven because He is in heaven. However, <em>where</em> in this verse is not a matter of heaven or earth. In verse 10 the Lord said, &ldquo;I am in the Father.&rdquo; Therefore, <em>where</em> in verse 3 is not a matter of a place but of a person. Where the Lord is does not refer to a place but to a person. The Lord is in the Father. The Lord also said, &ldquo;The Father is in Me&rdquo; (v. 10). The Lord is in the Father, and the Father is in the Lord. This indicates that the Lord and the Father are joined. The Lord wants us to be joined to Him, just as He is joined to the Father. For this purpose, He needs to work in us. In this message we will now consider how the Lord works.</p>
<p>Verse 16 says, &ldquo;I will ask the Father, and He will give you another Comforter, that He may be with you forever.&rdquo; Speaking concerning the Comforter, the end of verse 17 says, &ldquo;He abides with you and shall be in you.&rdquo; In these verses the Lord speaks of Himself, the Father, and the Holy Spirit. In verse 3 the Lord said that where He is, there we also will be. The Lord accomplishes this through His asking the Father to send the Holy Spirit.</p><h2 class="head1">THE TWO &ldquo;BECOMINGS&rdquo; OF THE TRIUNE GOD</h2>
<p>In verses 16 and 17 the Lord, the Father, and the Holy Spirit are mentioned. Are these three Gods? Matthew 28:19 says, &ldquo;Baptizing them into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In this verse the Father, the Son, and the Holy Spirit are plural in number, yet the word <em>name</em> is singular. This shows that God is triune. He is the one unique God, yet He is the Father, Son, and Spirit. This is something that the human mind cannot explain. For this reason, some theologians have attempted repeatedly to use analogies to explain this three-one reality. One of the analogies that is often used is vapor, water, and ice. Apparently, these are three substances, but they are actually one. It is one substance in three forms. When vapor cools down, it becomes water, and when water cools down further, it becomes ice. Ice is water, and water is vapor. The theologians who use this analogy say that the Father, the Son, and the Spirit are just like ice, water, and vapor.</p>
<p>However, this analogy is not only incomplete; it also has the danger of deviating from the truth. In an ordinary situation ice, water, and vapor cannot exist simultaneously. According to the revelation of the Bible, the Father continued to exist when He was incarnated in the Son, that is, when the Word became flesh. Furthermore, the Son continued to exist when He became the Spirit. The three&mdash;the Father, the Son, and the Spirit&mdash;exist simultaneously. Therefore, human analogies cannot give a correct and complete explanation of the Triune God.</p>
<p>In the beginning God was in heaven, dwelling in unapproachable light. He was dwelling in light that man can neither comprehend nor approach (1 Tim. 6:16). He is the Father as the source. One day God was manifested. The Word which was in the beginning became flesh (John 1:1, 14). This is the first becoming of God. The only begotten Son, who is in the bosom of the Father, declared the God whom no one has ever seen (v. 18). Hence, the Son is the manifested God. No one has ever seen God, but the Son manifested Him. The Father is the hidden God. The God who hides Himself in a place that no one can see is the Father. The Son is the manifested God. The God who manifests Himself is the Son. Therefore, when the Bible speaks of the Father, it refers to God as the source. When the Bible speaks of the Son, it refers to God manifested. As the Son, God could only be manifested among men. He could not enter into men. Hence, God needed to go through another &ldquo;becoming.&rdquo; First, the Word became flesh; the hidden Father became manifested in the Son. Then the Son &ldquo;became a life-giving Spirit&rdquo; (1 Cor. 15:45b). These are the two &ldquo;becomings&rdquo; of the Triune God.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN&mdash;<br />
GOD IN MAN AND MAN IN GOD</h2>
<p>As the source, God is the Father, whom man cannot approach. However, He came in the Son to be among men and was seen by men. At that time, the Lord was with the disciples on the earth. One day the disciples asked the Lord to show them the Father, and the Lord answered, &ldquo;He who has seen Me has seen the Father&rdquo; (John 14:9). Hence, knowing the Lord is equivalent to knowing the Father. The Lord came to manifest the Father. The Lord is the manifested God; hence, he who has seen the Lord has seen the Father. However, there was still one more thing that needed to be accomplished&mdash;the Lord needed to enter into His disciples. If the Lord did not enter into His disciples, the mystery in the universe would not have been accomplished; that is, God would not have been mingled with man. In order for the Lord to enter into His disciples, He had to go through another &ldquo;becoming.&rdquo; For this reason, the Lord said that He would ask the Father to give us the Comforter, the Holy Spirit (vv. 16-17, 26). The Holy Spirit is the Son, and the Son is the Father. The Father came in the Son to be among men, and the Son became the Spirit to enter into man. Because the Son lives, we who believe in Him also live (v. 19). When we live because of the Son, we know that He is in the Father and that we are in Him, and He is in us (vv. 19-20). This is the mingling of God and man.</p>
<p>My desire is that we would see God&rsquo;s salvation. Today not only do educated people, such as scientists, politicians, and philosophers, not know God&rsquo;s salvation, but even many theologians and pastors do not have a complete understanding of God&rsquo;s salvation. God&rsquo;s salvation is the mingling of God and man; it is God in man and man in God. The Bible is a story of the Triune God working Himself into man and working man into Himself. This is God&rsquo;s salvation. Just as our clothes, eyeglasses, and pens are not our person, matters such as forgiveness of sins, justification, sanctification, and escape from eternal perdition are not the focus of God&rsquo;s salvation. Forgiveness of sins and sanctification are not the substance of God&rsquo;s salvation. The substance of God&rsquo;s salvation is the Triune God being mingled with man and man being mingled with the Triune God.</p>
<p>Are you joyful to have the Triune God dwelling in you? You might rejoice because you have a gold watch. However, now that the Triune God, who is the Lord, is in you, are you rejoicing? Do you treasure this? Nothing can be more glorious and precious than having the Lord in us. It is a pity that many people do not realize this. If we tell a child that there is water in the air or that there is vapor in the air, he may not understand or believe us. However, we know that vapor is in the air. Vapor is water, and though we may not be able to touch it or feel it, it is in the air. Similarly, it is a fact that the Spirit of the Lord lives in you. It is also a fact that the Spirit is the Lord and that the Lord is God. Hence, the Spirit being in you is God being in you. Perhaps you do not feel it, but this is the fact. The Spirit is in you, the Spirit is the Son, and the Son is the Father. This is the Triune God in you.</p><h2 class="head1">GOD BEING MANIFESTED IN US<br />
THROUGH DIFFICULT ENVIRONMENTS</h2>
<p>Although we may not necessarily feel that the Holy Spirit is in us, if there is a change in our environment or we suffer persecution, the Spirit in us will come forth, and the Lord will be manifested. This proves to the world that God is in us. The Spirit who is in us is the Triune God in us, and nothing can shake, overcome, or subdue Him. The numerous stories of martyrs prove that God was in them. When their environment was difficult, the God who was in them was manifested. Nothing can change this fact. There were believers in China who experienced this.</p>
<p>A brother once testified that his believing in the Lord was not the result of hearing the gospel. His salvation was the result of an event that he witnessed. During the Boxer Rebellion, he was a young apprentice in a shop in Beijing. One day the atmosphere in the street was very tense, and all the shops closed their doors. He stayed inside the shop and watched through a crack in the door. He saw the Boxers parading in the street as they sent the believers of Jesus to an execution ground. The Boxers were brandishing their swords and knives in the air. It was a frightening scene. Among those who were being paraded to execution was a young lady about twenty years old. She was a Christian and had been arrested by the Boxers because of her faith in Jesus. This woman showed no fear; she was even singing and praising God.</p>
<p>That scene made a deep impression on the young apprentice. He felt that there must be something special about Christians; otherwise, how could this woman sing and rejoice instead of fearing death. Because of the impression this incident left in him, when he later met a Christian in northeast China, he heard a clear word concerning the Lord&rsquo;s salvation and was saved. Later he became a preacher. This is the way God is mingled with man. When our environment becomes difficult or we are persecuted, God is manifested. When there is no persecution, we can all pray and read the Bible. However, when persecution comes, the genuine Christians are set apart from the false ones, because God is manifested.</p>
<h2 class="head1">BEING IN THE LORD,<br />
HAVING THE LORD&rsquo;S MANIFESTATION,<br />
AND THE LORD MAKING AN ABODE WITH US</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s salvation is the Triune God being mingled with man. One day you were saved. Since that day the Lord has been in you, and you have been in the Lord. However, that is not the end. The Lord said, &ldquo;He who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him&rdquo; (John 14:21). Then He said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him&rdquo; (v. 23). We know that the Lord is in us, and that we are in the Lord, but we need to ask whether we have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation. It is one thing to have the Lord in us, it is another thing to have the Lord manifest Himself to us, and it is still another thing for the Lord to come to make an abode with us. We are all saved, and the Lord is in us, but does the Lord manifest Himself to us every day? Is the Lord making His abode with us?</p>
<p>Our being in the Lord is different from the Lord&rsquo;s manifesting Himself to us, which is also different from His making an abode with us. When we believed, we entered into the Lord, but how can we abide in the Lord? We abide in the Lord by loving Him. By believing in the Lord, we are in Him; by loving Him, we abide in Him. We love the Lord by obeying Him and keeping His commandments. Those who keep the Lord&rsquo;s commandments are those who love Him, and the Lord will manifest Himself to them. Moreover, He will make an abode with them. After we receive God&rsquo;s salvation, we should have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation continually. We have the Lord in us, and we are in the Lord. This is to receive God&rsquo;s salvation. Afterward, we should have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation continually, and He should make an abode with us. This is the living of a Christian. Such a living is the issue of our loving the Lord, keeping His commandments, and obeying Him.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER SEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY TO PROPERLY DEAL WITH<br />
THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Eph. 5:18-20; Col. 3:16-17; 2 Tim. 3:15-17; Jude 20; John 15:7; 6:63</h1>
<h2 class="head1">CRUCIAL VERSES IN THE NEW TESTAMENT<br />
CONCERNING THE SPIRIT AND THE WORD</h2>
<p>We will look at some crucial verses in the New Testament concerning the Spirit and the word. Ephesians 5:18-20 says, &ldquo;Be filled in spirit, speaking to one another in psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing and psalming with your heart to the Lord, giving thanks at all times for all things in the name of our Lord Jesus Christ to our God and Father.&rdquo; These verses say that we should praise and give thanks to God at all times. We praise God with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and we give thanks to God in the name of the Lord Jesus. Furthermore, we praise and give thanks because we are filled in our spirit with the Holy Spirit. In these verses, being filled in spirit is linked to praising and giving thanks. We need to be filled in spirit with the Holy Spirit by praising God in psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs and by giving thanks to God in the Lord&rsquo;s name.</p>
<p>Colossians 3:16-17 says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly in all wisdom, teaching and admonishing one another with psalms and hymns and spiritual songs, singing with grace in your hearts to God. And whatever you do in word or in deed, do all things in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving thanks to God the Father through Him.&rdquo; These verses also say that we should praise and give thanks. We praise with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and we give thanks in the Lord&rsquo;s name. However, there is a difference between this portion and Ephesians 5:18-20. Ephesians says that our praising and giving of thanks are the result of our being filled in our spirit with the Holy Spirit, whereas Colossians says that our praising and giving of thanks are the result of our being filled richly with the Lord&rsquo;s word.</p>
<p>If we compare these two portions of Scripture, we see that both speak of praising and giving thanks to God; of praising with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs; and of giving thanks in the name of the Lord Jesus. However, the first part of both portions is different. Ephesians says that we should be filled with the Holy Spirit, whereas Colossians says that we should be filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word. In other words, the result mentioned in both portions is the same&mdash;praising and giving thanks; however, the cause is different. In Ephesians the cause is our being filled with the Holy Spirit, and the result is that we praise and thank the Lord. In Colossians the cause is our being filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, and the result is that we praise and thank the Lord.</p>
<p>One portion begins by saying that we should be filled with the Holy Spirit, and the other begins by saying that we should let the word of Christ dwell in us richly. However, the results are exactly the same. When we are filled with the Holy Spirit, we can praise and give thanks, and when we let the word dwell in us richly, the result is also that we can praise and give thanks.</p>
<p>Second Timothy 3:15-17 says, &ldquo;From a babe you have known the sacred writings, which are able to make you wise unto salvation through the faith which is in Christ Jesus. All Scripture is God-breathed and profitable for teaching, for conviction, for correction, for instruction in righteousness, that the man of God may be complete, fully equipped for every good work.&rdquo; All Scripture is the breathing out of God.</p>
<p>Jude 20 says, &ldquo;You, beloved, building up yourselves upon your most holy faith, praying in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; To build up ourselves upon our most holy faith is to read and understand the Word. The most holy faith is the Word, the Bible. We must build up ourselves upon the most holy faith. The verse continues, &ldquo;Praying in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; In this verse two matters are placed together: building up ourselves upon the most holy faith and praying in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>John 15:7 says, &ldquo;If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.&rdquo; This verse speaks of the relationship between the Lord&rsquo;s word and prayer. We need to abide in the Lord and let His words abide in us, then we can ask whatever we will, and it shall be done for us.</p>
<p>Lastly, John 6:63 says, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life; the flesh profits nothing; the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; In this verse we see the relationship between the Lord&rsquo;s words and the Spirit. The words that the Lord speaks to us are spirit and are life.</p><h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO DEAL WITH THE WORD PROPERLY<br />
IN ORDER TO HAVE THE LORD&rsquo;S MANIFESTATION</h2>
<p>In the previous chapter we fellowshipped concerning the Lord&rsquo;s words in John 14:3: &ldquo;Where I am you also may be.&rdquo; Since the Lord is in God the Father, He is bringing us into God the Father. Not only so, since He is one with God and is mingled with God, He will cause us also to be one with God and mingled with God. It is rather easy for those who are one with God and are mingled with God to have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation and to have His making an abode with them. What condition is necessary for us to have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation and His making an abode with us? According to 14:21 and 23 two conditions must be met: one is that we love Him, and the other is that we keep His word.</p>
<p>The first half of verse 21 says, &ldquo;He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me,&rdquo; and the first half of verse 23 says, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word.&rdquo; These verses show that in order to have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation and His making an abode with us, we need to properly deal with the Lord&rsquo;s word. Hence, the burden of this chapter is a continuation of our previous fellowship, which is, if we desire to have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation regularly and to have His making an abode with us, we must deal with His word in a proper way. We must have a proper attitude toward and a good relationship with the word. Whether we can have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation and His making an abode with us depends on how we deal with the word.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, there are several matters that should not be neglected when dealing with the Lord&rsquo;s word. If we neglect these matters, we will not properly deal with the word, and there will be a problem between the word and us. If there is a problem or if we do not deal with the word properly, we will not have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation, that is, His face, nor will the Lord make an abode with us. If we would have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation, the Lord&rsquo;s face, and have His making an abode with us, we must have a proper attitude when dealing with the word, and we must have a proper relationship with the word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN<br />
THE HOLY SPIRIT AND THE WORD</h2>
<p>We must first pay attention to the wonderful relationship between the Holy Spirit and the word. Concerning this, we have already mentioned Ephesians 5:18-20 and Colossians 3:16-17. We compared these two portions and saw that while these two portions show the same result, they have different causes. The result is that those who are saved praise the Lord with psalms, hymns, and spiritual songs, and they also give thanks at all times to God in the name of the Lord Jesus. In this respect these two portions are similar. They can be likened to twin sisters who have similar facial features but who, if you look at them closely, are actually different. These verses in Ephesians and Colossians are very similar in what they say, but there is still a difference. Ephesians says that when the believers are filled with the Holy Spirit in their spirit, they are able to praise and thank the Lord, whereas Colossians says that when the believers are filled with the Lord&rsquo;s word, they can praise and thank the Lord. This shows that the word cannot be separated from the Spirit; they are two aspects of one thing. A person who can praise and thank God must be one who is filled with the Spirit as well as with the word.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Word and the Spirit Being One</h2>
<p>Being filled with the word and being filled with the Spirit are not two different types of filling but two aspects of one filling. In other words, the word and the Spirit are actually one, not two. In order to be filled with the Spirit, one must be filled with the word, and in order to be filled with the word, one has to be filled with the Spirit. The word and the Spirit cannot be separated. We have a clear basis in the Bible for saying that the word is the Spirit. In John 6:63 the Lord said, &ldquo;It is the Spirit who gives life;...the words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; It is not surprising that Paul says in Ephesians that we can praise and give thanks when we are filled with the Spirit, and in Colossians he says that we can praise and give thanks when we are filled with the word. He says this because the word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is in the word.</p>
<p>John 1:1 says, &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word, and the Word was with God, and the Word was God.&rdquo; Then John 4:24 says, &ldquo;God is Spirit.&rdquo; The Word is God, and God is Spirit. Let us now compare these two verses together with 6:63. John 1:1 says that the Word was God, 4:24 says that God is Spirit, and 6:63 says that the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit. This is surely wonderful. In these verses we see God, the Word, and the Spirit. The Word is God, God is Spirit, and the Lord&rsquo;s words are spirit. On the one hand, God is the Word, and on the other hand, God is the Spirit. Thus, the Word is also the Spirit. The three&mdash;God, the Word, and the Spirit&mdash;are one. Hence, when we touch the Word, we touch the Spirit. Moreover, when we touch the Word and the Spirit, we touch God because the Word is God, and the Spirit is also God.</p>
<p>If we would have a proper attitude toward the Lord and His word, we must see that the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is God. God is Spirit, and the Spirit is in the Word. God&rsquo;s words are the words in the Bible, and these words cannot be separated from the Holy Spirit. We must have the Holy Spirit in us in order to have the Lord&rsquo;s word in us. Likewise, when we have the words of the Bible in us, we will have the Holy Spirit, because these two are one&mdash;they are God. The Word is the Spirit, God is the Word, and God is also the Spirit. Hence, the Word is God, the Spirit is also God, and the Word is the Spirit.</p>
<p>On the one hand, God is the Word, and on the other hand, God is the Spirit. Therefore, the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word. This may sound simple, but it is not so easy to explain this accurately. This is the relationship between the Word, the Spirit, and God: God is the Word, and God is also Spirit. Hence, the Word is the Spirit, because both are God. It is no wonder that when the apostle Paul was moved by the Holy Spirit to write Ephesians and Colossians, he uttered this light to cause the believers to see that they are full of praise and always give thanks because they are filled with the Holy Spirit and with the Lord&rsquo;s word. Indeed the word and the Spirit are actually one.</p><h2 class="head2">The Word of Scripture<br />
Being both God and the Holy Spirit</h2>
<p>Second Timothy 3:16 says, &ldquo;All Scripture is God-breathed.&rdquo; The Scripture as the word of God is breathed out of God; it is what God breathed out. Hence, the word of the Scripture is God. We may also say that the word of the Scripture is the Spirit, because God is Spirit and what He breathes out is also Spirit. We should never regard the words in the Bible as merely words. The words in the Bible should not be regarded as merely black and white letters. They are God-breathed; they are God&rsquo;s breathing out. Therefore, when we touch the words in the Bible, we touch God.</p>
<p>In John 6:63 the Lord said, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken to you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; Since the Bible is God-breathed, God&rsquo;s breathing out, the words in the Bible convey God. Since God is Spirit, the words that come out from within God are also Spirit. Let us use a glass of grape juice as an illustration. We know that the liquid that we pour out of this glass must be grape juice because it came from a glass that contains grape juice. The words of the Bible are God-breathed. Since the essence of God is Spirit, whatever God breathes out is God and is also Spirit. In other words, the words of God are breathed out from within God and are God. Therefore, in essence the words in the Bible convey God. Furthermore, since God is Spirit, the words breathed out from God, which are God, must be Spirit.</p>
<p>If we would understand the relationship between God, His word, and the Holy Spirit, we need a proper attitude toward the words in the Bible. The Lord&rsquo;s word and the Holy Spirit are one. Hence, in order to have a proper attitude toward the Lord&rsquo;s word, we must have a proper relationship with the Holy Spirit. If we are not filled with the Holy Spirit within, it will be difficult for us to have a proper attitude toward the word. If the Holy Spirit does not have the ground within us, it will not be easy for the word to have the ground within us. We must be filled with the Holy Spirit so that we may have a proper attitude toward the word.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO PRAY IN THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>In order to have a proper attitude toward the Lord&rsquo;s word, we must learn to pray in the Holy Spirit so that we may be filled with the Holy Spirit. A person who is filled with the Holy Spirit must be one who prays. A person of prayer will be filled with the Holy Spirit. The Holy Spirit can be likened to air. If a person desires to be filled with air, he must breathe in air. When we take a deep breath, we are filled with air. Similarly, if we would be filled with the Holy Spirit, we need spiritual breathing. Our prayer can be likened to breathing. When we pray, we breathe the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>Jude 20 says, &ldquo;Praying in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; When a person breathes, he is neither in water nor in fire; rather, he is in the air, and consequently he inhales air. Whatever sphere we are in when we breathe is what we inhale and receive. If we are in the air, we will inhale and receive air. In the same principle, when we pray in the Holy Spirit, we receive the Holy Spirit. What we receive in our prayer is the Holy Spirit. We breathe in the air, and as a result we are filled with air. We breathe in the Holy Spirit, and as a result we are filled with the Holy Spirit. When we pray in the Holy Spirit, spontaneously we are filled with the Holy Spirit. On the day of Pentecost the Holy Spirit came down, and the one hundred twenty disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit (Acts 2:1-4). They received the Holy Spirit because they had prayed for ten days in one accord (1:14). They prayed and prayed until they received the outpouring of the Holy Spirit&mdash;the outward filling of the Holy Spirit. Therefore, in order to have a proper attitude toward the word, we must deal with the Holy Spirit properly. In order to deal with the Holy Spirit properly and be filled with the Holy Spirit, we must be a person of prayer. We must pray in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD ENTERING INTO MAN<br />
ALONG WITH THE HOLY SPIRIT</h2>
<p>When we pray in the Holy Spirit, we must accept the Lord&rsquo;s word and let it have the ground in us. When we pray, we are in the Holy Spirit, and the Holy Spirit fills us. Since the Holy Spirit and the word are one, when the Holy Spirit enters into us and fills us, He brings the word into us. The word is the Spirit. Consequently, when the Spirit enters into us, He brings the word into us. Whenever the Holy Spirit fills us, the word also enters into us. It is impossible to be moved by the Holy Spirit and not have the word within us. When the Holy Spirit comes, the word also comes. We cannot separate the Holy Spirit from the word.</p>
<p>Suppose you want to go to a movie. The Spirit will touch you and tell you not to go. This shows that the Holy Spirit is moving within you. While He is moving, there is also a speaking within you, telling you not to go. The moving of the Holy Spirit is the Lord&rsquo;s word. Every time the Holy Spirit touches you, you have the word. The Spirit is the word, and the word is the Spirit.</p>
<p>In John 14:21 the Lord said, &ldquo;He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me.&rdquo; Then in verse 23 He says, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word.&rdquo; How does the Lord&rsquo;s word come to us? The word comes to us with the Spirit, and the Spirit comes into us mainly through prayer. Most of the time we have the moving of the Holy Spirit through our prayer. Whenever we pray, the Spirit will operate and move within us, and the Spirit&rsquo;s moving and operating is the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. Whenever there is the moving of the Holy Spirit, there is the Lord&rsquo;s speaking. When the Holy Spirit moves within us, we should receive the word. This is to receive the moving of the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We should also keep the Lord&rsquo;s word. This means that we should obey the Lord&rsquo;s speaking in us and His leading. Some might ask what they should do if they do not have the strength to carry out the Lord&rsquo;s leading. Since we have the Holy Spirit in us, we do not lack strength when the Lord speaks. The Spirit is inside of us. The word in us is the Holy Spirit in us; the two cannot be separated. The word is the Spirit. The Holy Spirit comes into us when we pray, and once the Holy Spirit comes into us, we have the word. Once we receive the Lord&rsquo;s word into us, we immediately have the Lord&rsquo;s presence, His manifestation, and the Lord will make His abode with us. This is the time that we should pray more. The more we pray, the more we will be filled with the Holy Spirit and have the word. The more we have the word, the more we will have His presence in us, and the more we have His presence, the easier it will be to pray. This is what John 15:7 says: &ldquo;If you abide in Me and My words abide in you, ask whatever you will, and it shall be done for you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The crucial point is that the relationship between the word and the Holy Spirit is absolute. The word conveys the Holy Spirit. Therefore, if we want the word in the Scriptures to enter into us, we must be persons of prayer; we must pray in the Holy Spirit. Without the realization that the word and the Holy Spirit are one, our attitude toward the word will not be proper. Similarly, if we are not persons who regularly pray in the Holy Spirit, even if the word comes into us, there will be no ground in us for it. Hence, we must first know that the Word and the Holy Spirit are one. Next we must learn to pray regularly in the Holy Spirit. Whenever we pray in the Holy Spirit, the Holy Spirit will fill our inner being. When the Spirit fills us, He brings the Lord&rsquo;s word into us. As we receive the word, we spontaneously touch His presence and obtain His manifestation. Then we are filled further with the Holy Spirit, and we have a desire to pray. The more we pray, the more we are filled with the Holy Spirit, and the more we are filled with the Holy Spirit, the more we have the word. Furthermore, the more we receive the word, the more we touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence and obtain His manifestation. Then there will be a further moving of the Holy Spirit within us, and we will have more prayer. We should experience this in our spiritual life all the time.</p>
<p>Therefore, we must pay attention to one thing: we must exercise to live in the Lord and to have His genuine manifestation, that is, His presence. To this end we must be persons of prayer who learn to pray diligently, and we must also be persons who read the Word and study it.</p><h2 class="head1">PRAYING AND READING THE BIBLE IN A PROPER WAY</h2>
<p>We must learn to pray and read the Bible in our spirit. This is not a ritual of kneeling down, closing our eyes, and saying, &ldquo;Lord Jesus, I thank and praise You for giving me peace and keeping me from having a car accident. Hallelujah, Amen!&rdquo; This is not the kind of prayer we are referring to. Such a prayer is merely from the lips; it is not a prayer in the spirit. Regrettably, most Christians pray this kind of prayer. Sometimes we close our eyes and mumble a few words before a meal. We may say that we have prayed. However, it is hard to say from where we have prayed, or whether we prayed in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>We know that the Holy Spirit is in us; He is living in our spirit. But perhaps some young people among us are not clear concerning their human spirit. Our spirit is the deepest part of our being. Suppose you have an argument with your sister at home; she says that you are wrong, and you say that she is wrong. However, as you continue to say that she is wrong and that you are right, in the deepest part of your being there is a sense that you are wrong. Outwardly you may be unyielding, but inwardly there is a different feeling. The feeling in the depth of your being is different from your reasonings and conduct. This feeling in the depth of your being, this other feeling, is the feeling in your spirit. The Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit, which is our deepest part.</p>
<p>Jude 20 says, &ldquo;Praying...in the Holy Spirit.&rdquo; Hence, every time we pray, we must turn from our outward being to our inward being. Our prayer must not be a ritual in which we kneel down to say, &ldquo;Hallelujah! Thank and praise You! In Jesus&rsquo; name, Amen.&rdquo; We cannot pray like this. When we pray, we need to stop our person and turn to our spirit. Then we can pray according to the feeling in our spirit. This is to pray in the Holy Spirit. This kind of prayer in the Spirit will cause us to touch the Spirit.</p>
<p>We must always return to our spirit and pray in our spirit. We also must read the Word in our spirit. Every time we read the Bible, we should read it in our spirit and not merely in our mind. If we do not read the Bible in this way, the Bible will be like any other book, which can be understood by reading and reciting. A person who reads the book of Genesis in this way can understand that Abraham&rsquo;s son was Isaac, Isaac&rsquo;s son was Jacob, Jacob had twelve sons, and the youngest was Benjamin. He can also understand that Jacob and his sons went down to Egypt, and later God rescued them out of Egypt. This kind of reading is like reading history. It is useless, because then the Bible is neither the Lord&rsquo;s word nor the Spirit to us. The Bible can be the Lord&rsquo;s word and the Spirit when we pray in our spirit and touch the Spirit. Then we will be in the Spirit. If we open the Bible and read it while we are in the Spirit, every word in the Bible will be the Lord&rsquo;s word. When we read the Word in the spirit, the Word will be Spirit.</p>
<p>If we read the Word in this way, we will pray and give thanks when we pray and read the Bible. Because we are filled with the Holy Spirit and with the Word, we are also filled with thanksgiving and praise. This kind of praying and reading of the Bible touches the Spirit in our spirit. This is not the prayer in which we merely move our lips, nor is it reading the Bible merely with our mind. Praying merely with our lips is not effective, nor is reading the Bible merely with our mind effective. These are done outside of the Holy Spirit and cannot help us touch God nor help us &ldquo;eat&rdquo; the Lord and &ldquo;drink&rdquo; the Lord. If we would touch the Lord, eat the Lord, and drink the Lord, we must pray in the Spirit and read the Bible in the Spirit.</p>
<p>How can our praying and our reading of the Word always be in the Holy Spirit? Whenever we pray, we must be calm and turn to our spirit. Then from within our spirit and according to the feeling in our spirit, we can gradually begin to pray. This is how to pray in the Holy Spirit. The more we pray in this way, the more we will breathe in the Holy Spirit and have the Holy Spirit. This will make us persons in the Holy Spirit. The Spirit will bring the word into us, and we will be able to read the Bible in a proper way. Our reading of the Bible will be in the Holy Spirit, and the words in the Bible will touch us. Thus, the word will be Spirit to us and will give us life and cause us to live. Not only so, our prayer will be effective, because we will not be the source of the prayer. The Lord in us, the Holy Spirit in us, and the word in us will enable us to pray in the Lord&rsquo;s feeling and according to His desire. Moreover, whatever we ask, the Lord will do for us. This kind of reading and praying enable us to touch the Holy Spirit and be in the Holy Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">EATING, DRINKING, AND ENJOYING GOD<br />
DAILY IN THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>The burden of this message is to point out a way for us to read the Bible and to pray every day. In other words, my burden is that we would eat God, drink God, and enjoy God, that is, that we would touch the Lord&rsquo;s presence and have His manifestation. For this we must learn to pray in the Holy Spirit and read the Bible in the Holy Spirit. If we are not willing to learn, this message will be empty and useless. However, if we are willing to learn, this message can give us a way that will enable us to touch the source of unlimited blessing. If the young people can be brought into this practice, they will be brought into immeasurable blessings. They will be brought deeper and deeper into God, and God will fill them with His riches. They will also have deeper and richer experiences of the Lord. Such a living far surpasses listening to messages, attending meetings, or participating in various kinds of Christian activities. We must all see that to pray in the spirit and to read the Lord&rsquo;s Word in the spirit are precious, practical, and intimate.</p>
<p>I hope that we can all learn to turn to our spirit and pray in the Holy Spirit. Then the Spirit will bring the word into us, and we will be able to read the Lord&rsquo;s word when we open our Bible. As we pray in the spirit and read the Word in the spirit, every word of the Bible will be living. We will have the Lord&rsquo;s presence, His manifestation, and the Lord will make an abode with us. We will also pray more, which will enable us to touch the Spirit more. The more we touch the Spirit, the more we will have the Lord&rsquo;s word, which brings us more of the Lord&rsquo;s presence and further enables Him to make His abode with us. Thus, we will be persons who touch the Lord, eat the Lord, drink the Lord, and enjoy the Lord. In this way, the elements of Christ will gradually increase within us, and the Lord will grow in us daily.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER EIGHT</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE SIGNIFICANCE OF BREAKING BREAD&mdash;LIFE AND BUILDING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 10:16-17, 21b; 11:17-29</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE SIGNIFICANCE<br />
OF BREAKING BREAD</h2>
<p>We have the bread-breaking meeting every Lord&rsquo;s Day. There are two aspects of the significance of breaking the bread, and both aspects are related to life and building. God entered into us to be our life so that we can be built up together. God is in us to be our life. This is a crucial matter. Another crucial matter is that God causes us to be built up together as a corporate entity. Hence, God&rsquo;s intention with man has two crucial aspects: He desires man to receive Him as life, and by means of this life and through this life, He builds us up into a corporate entity. If we comprehend the significance of the Lord&rsquo;s setting up of His table, we will see that according to His intention, the matter of breaking bread includes life and building.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Receiving the Lord into Us<br />
and Enjoying Him as Life</h2>
<p>The first aspect of the significance of the bread-breaking meeting is that the Lord wants us to receive Him as the bread of life. When the Lord established His supper, He said, &ldquo;This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me&rdquo; (Luke 22:19). This shows that true remembrance of the Lord is to receive Him and enjoy Him.</p>
<p>Every time we break bread, we receive the bread and take it into us. This may seem to be an outward form; however, we know that this is a symbol which speaks of a spiritual fact. Therefore, when we receive the bread with our hand, we should also use our spirit to contact the Lord Jesus as the bread of life. When we take the bread into us, we should also use our spirit to receive the Lord Jesus as the bread of life into us. As we contact the Lord, receive the Lord, and enjoy Him in this way, we receive Him into us. This is our true remembrance of the Lord.</p>
<p>For many Christians, to remember the Lord is to think about the Lord and to praise Him a little. However, this is the way people in the world remember their family members or a famous person. Our remembrance of the Lord far exceeds this kind of remembrance. There are many times when we think of the Lord and praise Him. However, this cannot be considered as our remembrance of the Lord. The central focus of our remembrance of the Lord is that we enjoy Him and receive Him into us as our element. This is our central focus: the Lord has entered into us to be our life and our food.</p>
<p>If in our remembrance of the Lord, we merely think of Him and praise Him, without receiving Him and enjoying Him, then our remembrance of Him is lacking, and we have not touched the intention of His heart. None of our relatives can work themselves into us nor can any famous person. Even our parents, who love us the most, cannot work themselves into us. All their acts of love and favor are merely outward. When they pass away and we remember them, our remembrance, at the most, will be to miss them and thank them.</p>
<p>What the Lord has done for us far exceeds all the things that our parents can do for us. Not only has the Lord blessed us outwardly; He is also working Himself into us to be our life. The focus of what the Lord is to us is that He enters into us to be our life. Hence, when we remember Him, we should not think merely of how great He is and how much He has done for us. When we remember the Lord, we must touch the central point; we must receive Him with our spirit. What we do outwardly is merely a symbol that represents what we do in our spirit. When we receive the bread into our hand, our spirit should contact the Lord as the bread of life. When our mouth eats the bread, our spirit should receive the Lord as the bread of life. To receive and enjoy the Lord in this way is true remembrance of Him.</p>
<p>When the Lord established the breaking of bread with His disciples, He said, &ldquo;Take, eat; this is My body&rdquo; (Matt. 26:26). He also said, &ldquo;This is My body which is being given for you; do this in remembrance of Me&rdquo; (Luke 22:19). The Lord did not say that praising and thanking Him are our remembering of Him. He said that when we take and eat Him, we are remembering Him. We can use our spirit to receive, absorb, and enjoy the Lord, and we can have sweet fellowship with Him in our spirit. He said that contacting and enjoying Him in this way is our remembrance of Him. This is the first aspect of the significance of breaking bread.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Believers Being Blended as One Entity<br />
to Be the Mystical Body of Christ</h2>
<p>The second aspect of the significance of breaking bread does not concern what the Lord is to us or what we are to the Lord. It concerns our relationship with one another. The bread that we take during the bread-breaking meeting is produced from many grains that have been ground into powder and blended together. The bread does not refer only to the physical body of the Lord Jesus, which was given for us on the cross; even more, it refers to His mystical Body, which is composed of all the saved ones who are blended together. Everyone who is saved is a grain of wheat. We are many grains. God does not intend for each grain to remain whole and intact. God desires each grain to be broken and blended together with other grains to become one loaf.</p>
<p>In John 12:24 the Lord said, &ldquo;Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit.&rdquo; Formerly, the Lord was the one grain of wheat. After His death and resurrection, He brought forth many grains. The many grains are all those who have been saved and have His life. The Lord desires that all of us, the many grains, be broken and ground together as wheat. We will be ground until I no longer look like myself, and you no longer look like yourself. As the many grains, we will be ground into powder so that we can be blended into one loaf. This one loaf is the mystical Body of Christ, which is the church (1 Cor. 10:17). Although there are thousands of saved ones, we are still one bread, one Body.</p>
<p>The first significance we touch at the Lord&rsquo;s table is that the Lord Jesus gave up His body on the cross so that He could impart Himself into us for our enjoyment. The second significance concerns the joining of every believer to be the one mystical Body of Christ, the church. The Lord Jesus gave up His own body on the cross so that He could impart Himself into us to produce His mystical Body.</p>
<p>When the Lord Jesus was living and walking in the regions of Judea and Galilee, He had only His body of flesh. When He was crucified on the cross, He gave up this body. The giving up of His body was so that He could impart Himself into us and that we could have His life. As a result, thousands of believers have become His mystical and enlarged Body. After His death and resurrection, He continues to live on the earth in His enlarged Body. Even today, He is living on the earth in this enlarged Body. His physical body is His alone by birth; His mystical Body is composed of the believers, thousands of saved ones. Through death He gave up His physical body on the cross; through life in resurrection He gained a mystical Body. He gave up a physical body and gained a mystical Body. By giving up His body, He gained us.</p>
<p>The significance of the bread that we receive at the table meeting has these two aspects. On the one hand, this bread speaks of the physical body that was given up for us; that is, the Lord Jesus gave up His body on the cross for us. Therefore, when we take the bread and eat it, we enjoy the Lord. On the other hand, this bread speaks of the enlarged Body of Christ, which includes thousands of believers. When we receive the bread, we are in this enlarged and mystical Body, having fellowship with thousands of saints and enjoying them in the fellowship.</p><h2 class="head1">LIFE AND BUILDING</h2>
<p>We need to see these two aspects of the bread. The first aspect is that the Lord Jesus entered into us to be our life. The second aspect is that since we have the life of the Lord Jesus, we are part of His mystical Body. This is a matter of building. Ephesians 4:11-12 shows that the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers are gifts for the building up the Body of Christ. This Body is composed of all the believers. However, this composition must go through the process of building. After we are saved, we become a grain of wheat. As the many grains, we need to be broken and then built up. We cannot be individual scattered grains; we need to be blended together to become one bread. Even if we are saved and have the Lord&rsquo;s life, without God&rsquo;s dealing, without God&rsquo;s breaking, and without God&rsquo;s building, we can only be individual, scattered saints. We will not become a corporate entity or a spiritual house as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. We will only be a pile of scattered stones, not a built-up house.</p>
<p>Hence, the second aspect is related to the matter of building. The first aspect is related to life, and the second aspect is related to building. Whenever we break bread, we should sense that we are receiving the Lord and enjoying the Lord. We are eating Him, drinking Him, and enjoying Him as our life and our food. This is the first thing that we should sense. We should also sense that after we eat and drink the Lord, we are being built up together with the saints to become one bread, one Body.</p>
<p>Often when we break the bread, we focus only on the first aspect and neglect the second aspect. We focus only on remembering the Lord, contacting the Lord, and enjoying the Lord. Sometimes we even neglect enjoying the Lord. Even if we focus on remembering the Lord and enjoying the Lord, this is only the first half of the significance of breaking the bread. We neglect the second half of the significance of breaking the bread, which concerns the Body of Christ. Often, we pay attention only to the relationship between us and the Lord but neglect the relationship between us and all the saints. The first aspect of the significance of breaking the bread speaks of the relationship between us and the Lord. He is the bread of life. As we receive and eat the bread, we enjoy Him. The second aspect of the significance of breaking the bread speaks of the relationship between us and all the believers. We all partake of one bread and enjoy one Lord and one life. In this life we are being built into one Body so that there are no barriers among us. We are also being blended together, just as the flour is blended into one loaf.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NEEDING TO DISCERN THE BODY<br />
AND NOT OFFENDING THE BODY OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>When breaking the bread, we often see only the first aspect, which is the relationship between us and the Lord, and we neglect the second aspect, which is our relationship with the brothers and sisters. For this reason, the apostle Paul told the Corinthians, &ldquo;He who eats and drinks, eats and drinks judgment to himself if he does not discern the body&rdquo; (1 Cor. 11:29). Paul&rsquo;s intention was to remind the Corinthians not to forget that the bread they touched signifies the mystical Body of Christ. All those who belong to Christ are in this Body. We are many, but we are still one bread, one Body. Thus, there should not be any divisions among us. Since the Corinthians did not discern the Body in this way, even though they broke one bread together, there were strifes among them, and they were divided. They said, &ldquo;I am of Paul, and I of Apollos, and I of Cephas, and I of Christ&rdquo; (1:12). Hence, Paul asked, &ldquo;Is Christ divided?&rdquo; (v. 13). Surely Christ is not divided. There is only one Body, which is signified by one bread.</p>
<p>Paul seemed to be saying to the Corinthians, &ldquo;The bread that you break is one. This signifies that you are in one Body with all the saints. Why then are you divided? It is not profitable for you to break the bread in this way. You will suffer loss. In the eyes of the Lord, what you are doing cannot be considered as breaking the bread or eating the Lord&rsquo;s supper. You are not qualified to eat the Lord&rsquo;s bread and drink the Lord&rsquo;s cup, because you are divisive. You do not see the principle of the Body, which is that all the brothers and sisters have been blended into one Body, and that though you are many, you are one Body. Although you break the bread together, you have opinions, strifes, jealousy, and divisions. By conducting yourselves in this way, you are not discerning the Body.&rdquo;</p>
<p>There is a heavy burden within me. In many places, when the children of God come together to break the bread, they stress only the first aspect of remembering the Lord. They stress the relationship between them and the Lord, but neglect the second aspect, which is the relationship among all the saints. For example, suppose on a Lord&rsquo;s Day afternoon Brother A comes to me and criticizes another brother. His criticism is very severe, and he expresses strong dissatisfaction toward the other brother. If afterward I saw Brother A and Brother B sitting in the bread-breaking meeting, I would be deeply concerned because they would be eating the bread, even though they were divided. This kind of situation offends the Body of Christ.</p>
<p>In some places the brothers are jealous of each other and despise one another. Suppose I despise a brother, and the brother I despise is jealous of me. As soon as I have an opportunity, I will tell others of this brother&rsquo;s shortcomings, and as soon as he has an opportunity, he will tell others of my wrongdoings. Thus, there is much jealousy, despising, and criticism between us. However, when the time comes to break the bread on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, we still come to the same table and take the bread. He partakes of the bread, and I partake of the same bread, but there is much animosity between us. What kind of bread-breaking is this? Some may say that there is the remembrance of the Lord; however, there is no fellowship of the Body of Christ, because there is no discerning of the one Body.</p>
<p>Furthermore, in many places some brothers are not willing to forgive each other. Suppose you offend a brother, and the brother is not willing to forgive you. At the same time you are not willing to confess your wrongdoing, and you insist that he was wrong. Thus, neither one is willing to forgive the other. We encounter this situation in various places. Although the saints harbor a grudge against each other, when they come to the Lord&rsquo;s table, they conduct themselves as if nothing is amiss. They take the same bread and even pray, &ldquo;We who are many are one bread and one Body.&rdquo; They gather together to break the bread, but among them there is no love, no harmony, no consideration, no compassion, no forbearance, and no forgiveness. On the contrary, there is criticism and judgment. The younger ones despise the older ones, and the older ones are dissatisfied with the younger ones; both privately spread many words of death.</p>
<p>When brothers come together, it is easy to talk about the shortage of the church or the shortcomings of the saints rather than spiritual matters, growth in life, or the gospel. Nevertheless, on the Lord&rsquo;s Day they sit at the Lord&rsquo;s table with those whom they have criticized and are unwilling to forgive, and they take the same bread. This kind of bread-breaking is not discerning the Lord&rsquo;s Body. There might be a little heart toward the Lord and little remembrance of Him; however, these brothers have not discerned His Body, because they are full of misgivings toward the other saints. This is to eat the bread in an unworthy manner.</p>
<p>This is not a small thing. I hope that all God&rsquo;s children will have a fearful heart before the Lord. We must see that when we break the bread together, we are touching the Lord&rsquo;s mystical Body. We all are in this mystical Body. All the saints are in this mystical Body. Hence, we must discern this Body such that we are able to forgive our brothers and sisters, and such that those who offend others ask for forgiveness. We must exercise until we are at peace and in harmony with the other saints, and there is no separation or problem among us. Only then will we not merely remember the Lord when we break bread; rather, we will also have fellowship with all the saints in His Body. We will not only enjoy the Lord but also enjoy all the saints. It is in this way that our breaking of the bread will be profitable to us.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">ENJOYING ALL THE SAINTS<br />
THROUGH BREAKING THE BREAD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: 1 Cor. 10:16-17; 12:24-25; 2 Cor. 4:7; 5:16; Phil. 2:3; Isa. 58:9b-12; Gal. 5:15</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE TWO ASPECTS OF THE SIGNIFICANCE<br />
OF THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</h2>
<p>The significance of bread-breaking has two aspects. One aspect is that we remember the Lord and enjoy Him. The other aspect is that we fellowship with all the saints and enjoy them. The bread we break signifies the body of the Lord Jesus given up for us on the cross. The bread also signifies the Lord&rsquo;s mystical Body, the church, which He obtained through regenerating us with His resurrection life. Hence, when we see the bread, we remember that the Lord Jesus gave Himself up on the cross for us. When we receive the bread, we declare that we are receiving and enjoying the Lord. Our remembrance of the Lord concerns our relationship with the Lord. Not only so, every time we take the bread, we remember that the bread is made of many grains that were blended together. All those who are saved, who belong to the Lord, and who are members of His Body are in this bread. When we take the bread, we have fellowship with all those who belong to the Lord, and we declare that we enjoy all the saints. This aspect concerns our relationship with all the saints.</p>
<p>However, when we remember the Lord, we often remember only the first aspect of the table. We remember and contact the Lord, but we neglect the aspect of our fellowship with all the saints. No one can break the bread by himself. If the breaking of bread had only the aspect of remembering the Lord but not the aspect of fellowshipping with all the saints, a person could break bread and remember the Lord by himself. However, according to the Bible, God does not desire that we remember the Lord individually. As long as there are saints to break bread in remembrance of the Lord, we must break bread corporately. An individual does not have the qualification, ground, or standing to remember the Lord in this way. If we desire to remember the Lord, we must do so with all the saints, because remembering the Lord is not only for us to touch the Lord, but even more, it is for us to have mutual fellowship.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING<br />
BEING A DECLARATION OF THE CHRISTIAN LIFE</h2>
<p>Furthermore, the bread-breaking meeting is a declaration of the Christian life. On the first day of every week, we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table to declare the way that we will live for the upcoming week. One week is one course of our journey, and the next week is another course. Each week is a course and has its beginning. The course of our journey begins on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, which is the first day of the week. The beginning of a week is the beginning of a course of our journey. In this universe we are all declaring that we are ones who have received the Lord as our life and that in the Lord&rsquo;s life we have become one Body. Having been redeemed by the precious blood and having received the life of God, we are not like those in the world who live by their own life, by their intelligence, or by their ability. As saved ones who have received the Lord as our life, we live by eating, drinking, and taking Him as our life.</p>
<p>The first day of every week is the beginning of a new course of our Christian journey. We come together to declare that we live by the Lord. At the same time, we also declare that as those who have the Lord&rsquo;s life and live by this life, we have become one Body. We have a life relationship not only with the Lord but also with all the saints. This can be compared to the various members in our physical body. The members have a relationship not only with the head but also with the other members of our body. In the Lord and in His life we are members one of another and have become one Body. We have received the Lord as our life, and we have a corporate living with all the other members.</p>
<p>The life we have received is Christ, and the corporate living we have is the church. Christ is our life within, and the church is our outward living. The life we have within is the Lord, and the church life that we live out is the mutual coordination of all the members. Week after week we live such a life by experiencing the life journey course by course. Hence, at the beginning of every week, which is the start of a new course of our journey, we come together to make a declaration. Through the fact of our breaking the bread, we declare that we have a life relationship with the Lord and that we also have a life relationship with all the brothers and sisters. Hence, whenever we take the bread, we declare that we receive the Lord as our life. We also declare that we are members one of another, having become one Body.</p><h2 class="head1">ENJOYING ALL THE SAINTS<br />
THROUGH THE BREAD-BREAKING MEETING</h2>
<p>On the one hand, we enjoy the Lord through the bread. On the other hand, we enjoy the saints through the bread. The bread signifies the Lord and all the saints. When we receive the bread, we not only enjoy and receive the Lord; we also receive all the saints. In receiving the bread, we declare that we enjoy not only the Lord but also all the saved ones. In 1 Corinthians 10 Paul says, &ldquo;The bread which we break, is it not the fellowship of the body of Christ?&rdquo; (v. 16). In this verse Paul is not referring to the physical body of the Lord Jesus that hung on the cross for us but to the mystical Body that the Lord Jesus obtained in resurrection. We see this in the next verse, which says, &ldquo;Seeing that there is one bread, we who are many are one Body; for we all partake of the one bread&rdquo; (v. 17). Though we are many, we are still one bread, one Body. The one bread that we share signifies this one Body, which includes us, the many believers. We share the one bread and declare that we receive and enjoy all our brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>However, when we break bread, we may sense only that we are receiving the Lord and enjoying Him. We may not have much feeling toward our receiving the saints and enjoying them. Please remember that the proper way to break the bread is to enjoy the Lord and at the same time to enjoy the saints. In a physical body each member enjoys the supply from the head and at the same time enjoys the supply from all the other members. No member can have an exclusive relationship with the head, and no member can receive and enjoy an exclusive supply from the head by itself. If any member becomes isolated, it loses the supply not only from all the other members but also from the head. In order to maintain a relationship with the head, a member must maintain a relationship with all the other members. It is this relationship that we declare when we break the bread. On the one hand, we receive the Lord, but our receiving of the Lord is in all the saints. On the other hand, we enjoy the Lord, but our enjoyment of the Lord is through our enjoying all the saints. We are members in the Body, and we have a proper relationship with all the saints in the Body through which we maintain our relationship with the Head.</p>
<p>Hence, when we break bread, we remember and enjoy the Lord, and we also fellowship with all the saints and enjoy them. This is not something that we do only on the Lord&rsquo;s Day, but even more, it is a declaration of our daily living. We declare that this is the way we live every day. Every day we have fellowship with our Lord, and we have fellowship with our brothers and sisters. Every day we enjoy the Lord, and we enjoy the brothers and sisters. Every day we receive the supply from the Head, and we receive the supply from other members of the Body. Every day we live by the Lord, and we also live by the brothers and sisters.</p>
<p>Today many children of God may know what it means to live by God and to enjoy the Lord. However, not many children of God know what it means to live by the other members or to enjoy the other members. We should enjoy not only the Lord but also the brothers and sisters. We should enjoy not only Christ as the Head but also the Body of Christ. We should receive the supply not only from the Head but also from all the members. In order to be a proper, strong, vital, watering, and supplying member, we must maintain our enjoyment of these two aspects: enjoying the Lord and enjoying all the saints.</p>
<p>If we consider the Lord to be the only source of our supply, we will miss a blessing because we will neglect the fact that the saints are an even greater source of supply. The saints can be a greater supply to us because ninety percent of the supply that the Lord gives us is through the saints (Eph. 4:16). Some may say that they always receive their supply from the Lord and do not feel that they receive much supply from the brothers and sisters. If this is the case, the supply that they receive must be very little. If we desire to have a rich supply, we must learn to enjoy the Lord as well as the brothers and sisters. If we are willing to enjoy the Lord and the saints, the supply that we receive directly from the Lord will decrease proportionally while the supply from the Lord through the brothers and sisters will increase.</p>
<h2 class="head1">NATURAL CONCEPTS<br />
HINDERING CHRISTIANS FROM ENJOYING<br />
THEIR FELLOW MEMBERS IN THE BODY</h2>
<p>Some saints have said to me, &ldquo;It is surely right to receive the supply from all the saints. However, the brothers and sisters in our locality are not good enough, and there are not many who can supply others. When we go to a brother, it seems as if he does not have much with which to supply us, and he has many problems. The sisters also have problems.&rdquo; Concerning the co-workers, elders, and deacons, some saints say, &ldquo;The co-workers in our locality are in a poor condition. What kind of supply can we receive from them? Our elders are not any better, so what kind of supply can they give us? The deacons are even worse, so what kind of help can we receive from them? Not only so, the condition of the brothers and sisters is poorer still. Therefore, what kind of supply can we get from the Body?&rdquo; Sometimes it seems that I am affected by what they say. Their speaking is like a cloud of smoke that at times has even befuddled me to the point that their words do not seem unreasonable.</p>
<p>However, as soon as I am calm, I am clear within, because I realize that even a weak saint has a portion of Christ. If a saint does not have a portion of Christ, he must not be saved. I have therefore asked those who complain, &ldquo;Are the saints whom you are referring to saved, and do you admit that the Lord is living in them?&rdquo; When they agree, I would ask, &ldquo;The elders, deacons, and co-workers whom you feel are weak and have problems, are they also saved?&rdquo; They would say, &ldquo;Of course they are.&rdquo; Then I would say, &ldquo;You speak of the weakness of the brothers and sisters as well as the shortcomings of the co-workers, elders, and deacons. You also admit that Christ is in them. Now I would like to ask: in the past have you seen something of the Lord&rsquo;s life coming forth from the saints? Have you seen something in them that is for the Lord?&rdquo; Whenever I spoke with them in this way, all the saints who had complained would agree with me.</p>
<p>Some saints have replied, &ldquo;There is no doubt that the saints are saved and that they all have the Lord&rsquo;s life in them. Co-worker So-and-so gave up the world for the Lord, and this can be seen in him. When some of the other co-workers were put in a difficult situation, they would not say a word. We appreciate their experience of the cross.&rdquo; Sometimes I only needed to ask a few questions in order to turn all the negative speaking into something positive. None could deny that the saints they had complained about have a portion of the Lord and are for the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO APPRECIATE THE TREASURE<br />
IN EARTHEN VESSELS</h2>
<p>We all must admit that every saved one has Christ in him. But what kind of vessel contains this precious Christ? One day Mary broke an alabaster flask and poured the ointment on the Lord. The ointment was contained in the alabaster flask. The Lord as the treasure is contained in us, but what kind of container are we? Are we an alabaster flask or a different kind of vessel? Some saints might say that we are all earthen vessels and that the treasure is in earthen vessels (2 Cor. 4:7). If this is the case, we must see that all the co-workers, whether they are brothers or sisters, are earthen vessels. The elders are earthen vessels, the deacons are earthen vessels, every brother is an earthen vessel, and every sister is an earthen vessel. However, there is a treasure in these earthen vessels. Surely the vessels cannot compare to the treasure. Nevertheless, the treasure has been put into the vessels.</p>
<p>The treasure is contained in earthen vessels, not in alabaster flasks or golden boxes. The co-workers, elders, deacons, and the brothers and sisters have this treasure in them, but they are still earthen vessels. Therefore, we must be clear that we have the Lord in us and that the Lord is our treasure. We are vessels that contain this treasure. All those who are around us&mdash;the co-workers, elders, deacons, and the brothers and sisters&mdash;are earthen vessels. What kind of vessel are we? Are we a golden vessel, a silver vessel, or some other kind of precious vessel? We must humble ourselves and admit that we are all earthen vessels. You are an earthen vessel, and I am also an earthen vessel; we all are earthen vessels. Nevertheless, a treasure is contained in these earthen vessels. The co-workers, elders, deacons, and the brothers and sisters all have weaknesses because they are earthen vessels. How can earthen vessels not have weaknesses? Are we not earthen vessels? Do we not have weaknesses? We must admit that we all have the same problem, and we all need the Lord&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>We are all God&rsquo;s sheep. The church is God&rsquo;s flock, and every believer is a sheep. Every sheep has faults and defects. I will never deny that I am full of problems, because I am an earthen vessel in Adam. However, please do not forget that we all have many problems, because we are all earthen vessels in Adam.</p>
<p>We all have defects, and we all are earthen vessels. However, we thank the Lord that He is the treasure in us, the earthen vessels. When we enjoy the saints, we do not look at the earthen vessels; rather, we enjoy and appreciate Christ, who is the treasure in the earthen vessels. No matter how weak a believer is, how many shortcomings or failures he has, or how insignificant he seems to be, we must admit that he has a portion of Christ and that his portion is precious. If we look at the saints from this point of view, we will immediately see that they have a portion of Christ for us to enjoy. There may be a brother who is confused and weak, who does not have our insight, ability, intelligence, or boldness. He may seem very timid and incapable. However, this brother may have a broken and humble spirit. We may desire to adjust his &ldquo;weaknesses,&rdquo; but we sense his humility and brokenness. This is the treasure in an earthen vessel. He may be a brother without much ability, but he has a spirit that is broken, mourning, and humble. There is a portion of Christ in him. When we touch this portion, we will be supplied.</p>
<p>Another brother may seem to be very proud. He is stiff-necked, bold, and unyielding. It seems as though he does not know the meaning of humility. Although we may feel to condemn this brother, we also sense that he has a portion of Christ. He loves and treasures the Lord, and he feels that the Lord is worthy of everything. He is willing to give up everything for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. He may not know what humility is, but he knows what it means to give up everything. As soon as we speak with him concerning the preciousness of Christ, we sense that the fragrance of Christ is coming forth from within him. Therefore, even though we might say that this brother is proud, we cannot deny that he has the fragrance of Christ. He truly considers the Lord to be precious and sweet, and he is willing to give things up for the Lord&rsquo;s sake. We cannot but acknowledge that the treasure is in him. Indeed, the treasure is in an earthen vessel.</p>
<p>If we consider the saints in this way, we will see that there is not one brother or sister who does not have the treasure in him, and we must learn to recognize this treasure. We may meet a sister who is unclear, unruly, and has many rough edges. Everyone may consider her to be a coarse earthen vessel. However, when we contact her, we can touch a fear for the Lord. She fears the Lord and feels that the Lord loves her so much that she cannot be careless or commit sins. She has a reverential love for the Lord, and we cannot but sense this sweetness in her. This is another example of the treasure in an earthen vessel. If we look only at her natural man, her earthen vessel, we will say that she is rough and coarse. Although she is an earthen vessel, there is a portion of Christ in her that is precious and sweet.</p>
<p>If we look at every saint in this way, we will say that there is a treasure in his or her earthen vessel. We will also say that the treasure is even in an earthen vessel that seems to be ugly. The Lord wants us to enjoy the treasure and not look at the earthen vessel. This can be likened to drinking water from a bottle. We should focus on the water, not the bottle that contains the water. We all must see that every believer is an earthen vessel with weaknesses, but he also contains Christ, the treasure.</p><h2 class="head1">NOT KNOWING PEOPLE<br />
ACCORDING TO APPEARANCE OR THE FLESH</h2>
<p>Who does not have weaknesses? Only our Lord Jesus did not have any weaknesses. When He was living in the flesh, He did not have any weaknesses or wrongdoings, but the flesh He put on was a lowly and weak body. In Him was the treasure&mdash;the glory of God; nevertheless, He was in the flesh. The Jews did not recognize the treasure in Him. They knew Him according to the flesh and said, &ldquo;Is not this the carpenter, the son of Mary, and brother of James and Joses and Judas and Simon?&rdquo; (Mark 6:3; cf. Matt. 21:11; John 7:41; 6:42). As a result, they did not know the treasure in Him.</p>
<p>In John 8:15-19 and 28 through 29 the Lord Jesus seemed to say, &ldquo;You know people according to their appearance, their flesh. However, you must know that there is a treasure in Me. What I speak to you I do not speak out of Myself, but the treasure in Me does His works. My living and My speaking are not according to Myself. Outwardly, I look like a poor and rejected Nazarene from Galilee, but within Me is the glorious and precious God. I do not do things according to Myself but according to Him. Hence, you should know Me no longer according to My appearance, My flesh, but according to the treasure in Me.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;Even though we have known Christ according to the flesh, yet now we know Him so no longer&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:16). Before Paul was saved, he was Saul. Saul thought that Jesus was a man from Nazareth, the son of a carpenter, and that He was insignificant. He was determined to persecute those who believed in Jesus, because he knew Christ according to the flesh; he did not know the treasure in Christ. Then one day on the road to Damascus the Lord came to him and said, &ldquo;Saul, Saul, why are you persecuting Me?&rdquo; (Acts 9:4). Immediately Saul asked, &ldquo;Who are You, Lord?&rdquo; and the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;I am Jesus, whom you persecute&rdquo; (v. 5). The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;I am the Jesus whom you despise as the humble man in the flesh. I am now in glory in the heavens, and I am speaking to you from heaven.&rdquo; From that day onward, Paul knew the Lord not outwardly according to the flesh but inwardly according to the spirit. For this reason, Paul wrote, &ldquo;So then we, from now on, know no one according to the flesh&rdquo; (2 Cor. 5:16).</p>
<p>In the church we should not know others according to appearance or according to the flesh. Perhaps someone is farsighted, capable, and able to manage things. We would say that such a person is very good. However, this may be the flesh and not Christ. This person is merely an earthen vessel. An earthen vessel may look nice, but it is nevertheless an earthen vessel; it is not Christ.</p>
<p>We must not know or judge others according to their appearance, their flesh, or their outer man. We must know them according to the Christ in them. Perhaps a brother has a coarse earthen vessel that has never been dealt with, ground, or polished. However, Christ, the treasure, is in him. Let us consider the experience of the apostle Paul. After he wrote his first Epistle to the Corinthians, some of the believers in Corinth said that Paul&rsquo;s letters were &ldquo;weighty and strong&rdquo; (2 Cor. 10:10). The Corinthians felt that Paul&rsquo;s letter to them was the speaking of God and was rather severe. However, they also said that Paul&rsquo;s &ldquo;bodily presence is weak and his speech contemptible&rdquo; (v. 10). From this verse most readers of the Bible speculate that Paul must have been small in stature. It must have been difficult for the believers who judged by appearance to believe that Paul, who was small in stature and contemptible in speech, was an apostle, even the top apostle. He did not even look like Saul in the Old Testament who was tall in stature (1 Sam. 9:2). Paul did not have the appearance of someone who was capable, nor was he eloquent. According to man&rsquo;s natural concept, only a capable and eloquent person is qualified to be an apostle.</p>
<p>However, Paul was not such a person. Paul was not good looking; he was weak, had poor eyesight (Gal. 4:15), and his speech was contemptible. To judge him according to his appearance was wrong. Those who judge people according to the flesh are in society, not in the church. In the church we must see the Christ who is in the saints.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO CONSIDER OTHERS<br />
MORE EXCELLENT THAN OURSELVES</h2>
<p>Our enjoyment of the saints is not based on what they are outwardly but on the Christ who is in them, that is, the treasure in the earthen vessels. This is the way that we consider others to be more excellent than ourselves (Phil. 2:3). Otherwise, we cannot consider them to be more excellent than ourselves. If we compare ourselves with others, we are comparing one earthen vessel with another, and we will think that our earthen vessel is better. Everybody considers his earthen vessel to be the best. Even if there is a man whom we all acknowledge to be intelligent, we may not necessarily submit to him. In contrast, whenever we look at ourselves, we always feel that our earthen vessel is precious. The more we look at ourselves, the more we treasure our earthen vessel. It is amazing that we find it difficult to appreciate the strong points of other people, even though these strong points are only part of their earthen vessel.</p>
<p>The Bible, however, says that we should consider others more excellent than ourselves. When we consider others, we should not consider their strong or weak points, we should consider only the portion of Christ in them. If we look at the Christ in the saints, we will realize that their portion is more excellent than ours. One brother has a love for Christ that causes him to give up the world, but we do not have this portion. Another brother&rsquo;s relationship with the Lord has brought him to a point of being broken by God, but we do not have this portion. Still another brother expresses the humility of Christ, but we do not have this portion. A sister has a love for the Lord and a heart for the Lord, which we also do not possess. When we see this, we will treasure the saints from the depths of our being.</p>
<p>When we can look at the saints and appreciate the Christ in them, we will see the treasure in them and consider them more excellent than ourselves. We will be able to love the saints, respect them, treasure them, and enjoy them. This is how they become a source of supply to us, signified by the bread we break at the table meeting. Then not only will the Lord Jesus be our food, but even the brothers and sisters will be our food. We will receive a supply from every brother and sister.</p><h2 class="head1">NO POINTING OF THE FINGER OR<br />
SPEAKING WICKEDNESS BUT BUILDING UP</h2>
<p>When we look at the earthen vessels instead of Christ, we feel that the saints are full of problems, and as a result, we dislike them, are bothered by them, criticize them, and judge them. In the end, we have nothing to enjoy and are full of criticism. We are accusing the brothers and sisters when we criticize them for this or that reason. If we look at the earthen vessels but do not look at Christ, the treasure, we will always be pointing a finger at others and speaking wickedness. As a result, words of death will spread among us and will infest the church.</p>
<p>The book of Isaiah says, &ldquo;If you remove... / The pointing of the finger and the speaking of wickedness... / Then your light will rise in the darkness, / And your gloom will be like midday&rdquo; (58:9b-10). In other words, the pointing of a finger, the finding of fault, the speaking of wickedness, and the spreading of death are done in darkness. You should check to see whether you feel bright within after you criticize the saints. You may think that you are bright within when you consider that others are wrong but that you are right. However, truthfully, whenever we criticize others, we become darkened within. When we consider others more excellent than ourselves by treasuring the portion of Christ in them, our inner being becomes bright.</p>
<p>Many times, when we point a finger at others, our inner being not only becomes darkened but also dry. We become unsatisfied and dry, like a garden that is not watered (cf. v. 11). You must check with yourself as to whether this is true: the more you criticize God&rsquo;s children&mdash;the church, the elders, the deacons, and the saints&mdash;the more your inner being becomes dry and dark. Not only so, you become a destroyer, not a builder. However, if you stop criticizing others, speaking wickedly, and spreading death, but instead you fear the Lord, treasure the Christ in the saints, and do not look at the earthen vessels, immediately you will be illuminated, refreshed, watered, and satisfied within.</p>
<p>Not only so, you will become a &ldquo;repairer of the breach&rdquo; (v. 12), and you will do a building work in the church. You can build up that which was torn down, and you can repair that which was desolate. Otherwise, darkness, dryness, desolation, and tearing down will be your portion. The apostle Paul says, &ldquo;If you bite and devour one another, beware lest you be consumed by one another&rdquo; (Gal. 5:15). May our heart not be hardened to the extent that we cannot receive the shining of the Lord&rsquo;s word. May we all receive grace from the Lord.</p>
<p>We must see that Christ is in the saints, and we must see that every portion of Christ is precious. We must not forget that we are earthen vessels. If we want to look at shortcomings, we should first look at our own shortcomings before we look at others&rsquo; shortcomings (Matt. 7:3-5). We also should see the Christ in others before we look at the Christ in ourselves. May we continue to learn this lesson.</p>
<p>When we break bread in the table meeting, we are enjoying Christ, and we are also enjoying the saints. For this reason, we must deal with the problems between us and the Lord. Whenever there is disharmony or a barrier between us and the Lord, we must deal with it. At the same time, we must also deal with any barrier or disharmony that exists between us and the saints. We must ask for forgiveness and for reconciliation. We must also forgive others so that we are in harmony with the saints.</p>
<p>If we practice this, we will have God&rsquo;s presence, we will have light, and we will be watered. As a result, we will be builders. Although we are earthen vessels full of weaknesses and deserving of criticism, we will be full of the presence of the Lord, and His presence will make up for our lack. The Lord&rsquo;s presence will make up for whatever shortcomings we have, and His presence will rescue us from our mistakes. We will be blessed. Then our bread-breaking will be genuine, and we will be blessed instead of suffering a loss. We must not be those who argue, criticize, or judge the saints yet at the same time break bread with them. Doing this will offend the Lord&rsquo;s Body and make us unworthy of eating the Lord&rsquo;s bread. Furthermore, we may lose His blessing.</p>
<p>We must each fear the Lord. It is not a small thing to fear the Lord. Every time we break bread, we remember the Lord. The bread indicates that the Lord gave His body for us on the cross, and it also indicates that He has regenerated us with His life, making us His mystical Body. Hence, whenever we take the bread, we should deal with any barrier between us and the Lord and any barrier between us and the saints. When we come to the Lord&rsquo;s table, we should be able to say that we have no problems with the Lord and that by His precious blood and in His grace we also have no problems with the saints. We do not criticize, blame, judge, or condemn any brother or sister. They are earthen vessels, just as we are earthen vessels. They are weak, and we are also weak; however, we do not look at weaknesses.</p>
<p>We treasure the saints because there is a portion of Christ in them (1 Cor. 12:24-25). We love and honor them because of the portion of Christ in them. By being in harmony with all the saints and blending with them, we enjoy them. Then when we take the bread, we can declare, &ldquo;I enjoy my Lord, and I also enjoy my brothers and sisters. My Lord is my food, and the Christ in the brothers and sisters is also my food. My Lord is for me to enjoy, and He is in all the saints for me to enjoy. Not only do I enjoy the Lord directly, but I also enjoy the Lord indirectly through all the saints. This is my enjoyment at the bread-breaking meeting.&rdquo;</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LOVING THE LORD TO EXPERIENCE<br />
HIS MANIFESTATION AND HIS ABIDING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: John 14:19-23; Exo. 33:14</h1>
<p>In John 14:19-20 the Lord said, &ldquo;Because I live, you also shall live. In that day you will know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you.&rdquo; In these verses the Lord said that after He resurrected from the dead, He would regenerate us by entering into us to be our life. Therefore, we live because He lives; we live in His resurrection life with Him. This is the reason we will know that the Lord is in the Father and is one with the Father, that we are in the Lord and are one with the Lord, and that the Lord is in us and is one with us. This is the situation of everyone who has been saved.</p>
<p>Verses 21 through 23 go on to say, &ldquo;He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him. Judas, not Iscariot, said to Him, Lord, and what has happened that You are to manifest Yourself to us and not to the world? Jesus answered and said to him, If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; This shows that after we are saved, our living should be one in which the Lord manifests Himself to us and makes an abode with us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENCE BEING HIS MANIFESTATION</h2>
<p>Let us look at the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation from the example of Moses in the Old Testament. In Exodus 33:14 God said, &ldquo;My presence shall go with you, and I will give you rest.&rdquo; In this verse the word <em>presence</em> in the original language means &ldquo;face.&rdquo; This means that God&rsquo;s countenance, His face, would go with Moses and give Moses rest.</p>
<p>God asked Moses to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt. When they left Egypt and arrived at Mount Sinai, God called Moses to the top of the mountain while the children of Israel waited at the base of the mountain. However, when they saw that Moses delayed to come down from the mountain, they made a golden calf and worshipped it (32:1-6). Worshipping the idol greatly offended God. God said that Moses would still lead the children of Israel into the land of Canaan, a land flowing with milk and honey, but He Himself would not go up in their midst (33:1-3). God seemed to be saying, &ldquo;Moses, take the Israelites up to the land. I will send an Angel to help you drive out all your enemies so that you may gain the land of Canaan as your dwelling place, but I will not go with you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When Moses heard this word, he prayed and negotiated with God (vv. 12-17). Moses seemed to be saying, &ldquo;You brought the children of Israel out of Egypt. It was not I who brought them out of Egypt. I was not looking for You when I was shepherding the flock of sheep in the wilderness; You looked for me and asked me to bring the children of Israel out of Egypt into the land of Canaan. I did not initiate this; You did. These are Your people, not mine. Yes, they committed a sin and worshipped the idol. But since You brought them out of Egypt, You still have to bear this responsibility. If You will not bear this responsibility, neither will I. If You withdraw, I will also withdraw. If You want me to bring them into the land, You must go with us. If You will not go with us and lead us, we will not go further.&rdquo; In verses 15 and 16 Moses uttered a strong prayer in which he negotiated with God. After he prayed, God was bound and had to agree. God told Moses not to withdraw. God also assured Moses that He would bear the responsibility and that His presence, His face, would go with Moses.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s face is His presence. A brother once asked, &ldquo;What is the difference between God&rsquo;s face going with us and God going with us?&rdquo; I replied, &ldquo;Many times the Lord goes with a person, but He hides His face from that person. It is not that the Lord does not go with you. He goes with you, but He hides His face. His face is not manifested.&rdquo; I gave an illustration: &ldquo;Suppose five of us travel to another city to preach the gospel. However, while we are traveling, I hide my face. Even though I am traveling with you, you do not see my face.&rdquo;</p>
<p>While Moses led the children of Israel on their journey to the land of Canaan, Moses did not lose God&rsquo;s presence, God&rsquo;s face. God was always manifested to Moses. God did not only accompany Moses by walking with him; God also manifested Himself to Moses throughout the journey. Every day Moses saw God face to face. Moses had God&rsquo;s face, God&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>In the New Testament age the Lord&rsquo;s salvation is to save us into Himself so that we are joined to Him in life and in essence. The Lord&rsquo;s salvation is not focused on our being forgiven of our sins so that we are spared from perdition to wait for the enjoyment of some eternal blessing in the future. This is not the focus of the Lord&rsquo;s salvation; rather, this is only a human concept. It is true that the Lord&rsquo;s salvation solves the problem of our sins and that there is forgiveness of our sins and deliverance from perdition. However, this is not the meaning or the goal of salvation. The meaning of salvation is to bring those who are outside the Lord into Him. We often address believers as &ldquo;brothers and sisters in the Lord,&rdquo; or when referring to a believer, we say, &ldquo;He is a person in the Lord.&rdquo; Sometimes when we speak of unbelievers, we say, &ldquo;They are not in the Lord. They do not have the Lord. Only believers are in the Lord.&rdquo; Do not think that this is merely an expression; it is a fact. Being in the Lord is a fact. God is saving us from being outside of the Lord to being in the Lord. We are people in the Lord.</p>
<p>Some may ask how to become a person who is in the Lord. The Lord shed His blood on the cross for our sins. Therefore, when we believe into the Lord, we are forgiven of our sins and are cleansed (Heb. 9:22; Acts 10:43; 1 John 1:9). The Lord became the life-giving Spirit in His resurrection from the dead (1 Cor. 15:45b). Now the Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17), and He is able to enter into us so that we can be joined to Him (John 1:12-13). We can use a microphone as an example. As soon as it is plugged into an outlet, electricity enters into it. When electricity is transmitted into the microphone, the microphone is in the current of electricity; it is in electricity. We can all understand this example. A three-year-old child, however, would not be able to understand that the microphone is in electricity, because he thinks that electricity is intangible. To him, it is incomprehensible that the microphone can be in electricity. Those who have some knowledge of physics know that since electricity has been transmitted into the microphone, the microphone is in electricity.</p>
<p>Similarly, those who believe in the Lord Jesus are in Him because the Lord is the Spirit, and His Spirit has come into us. We are in Him because we have the Lord Spirit. If we were to tell unbelievers that we are in the Lord Jesus, they would say that this is superstition, because Jesus Christ is intangible to them. It is hard for them to believe, because they can neither see nor touch Jesus Christ. Nevertheless, this is our experience. We know that the Spirit is in us, and therefore we live in Him. We are joined to the Lord (1 Cor. 6:17). A saved person has the Lord in him, and he is in the Lord. He is joined to the Lord.</p><h2 class="head1">A NORMAL OVERCOMING<br />
CHRISTIAN LIFE ALWAYS HAVING<br />
THE LORD&rsquo;S PRESENCE&mdash;MANIFESTATION</h2>
<p>What kind of living should we have after we are saved? This is the focus of our fellowship in this chapter. After we are saved, the Lord should continually manifest Himself to us. We should have His face and His presence. Moreover, the Lord should make His abode with us.</p>
<p>We will first consider the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation and then consider the Lord making an abode with us. Suppose two people are sitting together, facing each other. Each one has the other&rsquo;s manifestation. If one goes to another room, he will become hidden, and the other will no longer have his manifestation. As long as one cannot see the other, he does not have the other&rsquo;s manifestation. The other will be manifested only when he returns. Hence, in order to have someone&rsquo;s manifestation, we must be able to see his face. After a person is saved, if his living is normal and overcoming, he should constantly have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation, the Lord&rsquo;s face.</p>
<p>I believe that we all have had this kind of experience. Many times we have had the Lord&rsquo;s face. We did not see His face physically, but we had His face within us. In our inner being we were very clear that the Lord was manifesting Himself to us and that His presence was with us. However, there have been many times when we knew that the Lord was not manifesting Himself to us; instead, He was hidden from us. The young brothers and sisters are often concerned about watching movies. Many of them have argued with me, saying, &ldquo;Why can we not go to the movies?&rdquo; I do not have to argue. I only ask, &ldquo;While you are watching the movie, is the Lord Jesus with you? Does He manifest Himself to you? Is His face with you? Do you have the shining of His face?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Being a Christian is not a matter of sin or of love for the world. These are negative things. Being a Christian is a matter of having the Lord&rsquo;s presence by seeing His face. Fundamentally, being a Christian is not a matter of dealing with the world or sins, nor is it a matter of doing good or evil. Being a Christian is entirely a matter of having the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Hence, our primary concern is not dealing with sin or the world. Our primary concern is our dealing with the Lord, that is, our relationship with the Lord. Whether or not a person is saved does not depend on whether he sins or loves the world. Rather, it depends on his relationship with the Lord Jesus Christ. This is the only thing that matters.</p>
<p>Similarly, whether or not a believer can have an overcoming life does not depend on the things he does, nor does it depend on whether he deals with sins and the world. His life depends on how he deals with the Lord. Even if we do not sin, if the Lord hides His face from us, it will be difficult for us to have a good Christian life.</p>
<p>Losing the Lord&rsquo;s presence is something that Christians should fear more than anything else. Sometimes people say, &ldquo;Brother Lee, you are always giving messages; you speak daily and even many times a day. We are concerned for you. Even if you have three hundred topics, sooner or later you will exhaust them. Then what will you do? Will you still give messages?&rdquo; I always say, &ldquo;I am not worried about running out of messages. What I fear is losing the Lord&rsquo;s presence, His manifestation, His face. I am not concerned about whether I have something to speak in the meetings. To me, the most fearful thing is that the Lord would hide His face from me. I am fearful that the Lord would not manifest Himself to me and would not be with me. This is what I fear. If the Lord&rsquo;s presence is with me, everything will be all right.&rdquo; If we have the Lord&rsquo;s face, everything is all right. There will be messages to give and words to speak. If we have the Lord&rsquo;s face, all sinful things will be under our feet, and the world will be behind us. Hence, a Christian must not lose the Lord&rsquo;s face, the Lord&rsquo;s presence.</p>
<p>Do you have the Lord&rsquo;s face, His manifestation, His presence? You should not take this as a matter of doctrine. When you leave your home, does the Lord say, &ldquo;My face will go with you&rdquo;? What do you say? Perhaps you say, &ldquo;Lord, I am going out. If You do not go with me, I will not go. My going out is Your business, not mine. If Your face, Your presence, does not come with me, I will not go.&rdquo; If you contact the Lord in this way, the Lord will say, &ldquo;I will go with you,&rdquo; and you will always have His manifestation, His face. You must always ask whether you have the Lord&rsquo;s presence, His manifestation.</p><h2 class="head1">HAVING THE LORD&rsquo;S MANIFESTATION<br />
BY LOVING THE LORD AND<br />
KEEPING HIS COMMANDMENTS</h2>
<p>How can we have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation? The Lord says, &ldquo;He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him&rdquo; (John 14:21). A person who has the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation loves the Lord and keeps His commandments. Such a person is loved by the Father and the Son. Not only so, the Son also manifests Himself to him. Whether you have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation depends on whether you love the Lord and keep His commandments. This is a practical and serious test.</p>
<p>We have received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation, and the Lord is in us. We are people in the Lord. However, it may be difficult for us to take a further step and have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation. The problem is whether we love the Lord and keep His commandments. Some people are saved but do not love the Lord or keep His commandments. Others are saved and love the Lord, but they have only a partial love for the Lord. A person who has a partial love for the Lord keeps the Lord&rsquo;s commandment when it suits him. When the Lord&rsquo;s commandment is disagreeable to him, he will not keep it. At such a time, he does not let the Lord win; rather, he defeats the Lord. Any dispute between us and the Lord in which we defeat the Lord instead of letting Him defeat us, proves that we do not love Him enough. Some may ask when and in what matters they have defeated the Lord. The Lord has been defeated by us in many things. Going to the movies is an example. We may have a strong desire to go see a movie, but the Lord gives an inward command, saying, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; This is the Lord&rsquo;s speaking to us in love. Even though we know that we should obey Him, we disobey and go to the movie. This is the way that we defeat the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord speaks to us because we love Him. If we did not love Him, He would not bother to speak to us. Our love for a person is an encouragement for him to speak to us. If someone does not want a person to speak to him, he should not love him. If he ignores a person and does not bother with him, the person will not come to him, much less speak to him. Conversely, whomever he loves will come to him. This also applies to all of us. Those whom we do not love or whom we dislike will not bother to speak to us. But the more we love someone, the more he will come to be near us and speak with us.</p>
<p>Similarly, as a result of even a little love toward the Lord Jesus, He will come to bother you. He will say, &ldquo;Did you not say that you love Me? Did you not say that you would consecrate yourself to Me?&rdquo; Because you have consecrated yourself to the Lord, you love Him. Therefore, now when you want to go to a movie, the Lord will say, &ldquo;Do not go.&rdquo; This is the Lord&rsquo;s commandment. He who has the Lord&rsquo;s commandments and keeps them loves the Lord. However, after you receive the Lord&rsquo;s commandment, you may argue with Him. The Lord says, &ldquo;Do not go,&rdquo; but you say, &ldquo;I want to go.&rdquo; The Lord says, &ldquo;Do not go,&rdquo; but you say, &ldquo;I will go only this once.&rdquo; The Lord says, &ldquo;You must not go,&rdquo; but you insist, &ldquo;I will go this time but not again.&rdquo; The Lord says, &ldquo;No, not even this time.&rdquo; This is the argument that you have with the Lord. I believe that you all have had this kind of experience. It may not have been concerning movies, but we have many such arguments with the Lord, and it seems that we always defeat the Lord. We all have had the experience of defeating the Lord. The Lord Jesus is so great and we are so small, yet we often defeat Him and overthrow His throne in us. The Lord is daily being defeated by many people whom He has saved. We should consider how many times we have defeated the Lord Jesus.</p>
<p>Many times, when the Lord asks us to do something, we argue with Him. This argument is a battle between the Lord and us. The Lord gives us a commandment, but we receive it grudgingly, or we say that we would rather do something else. If the Lord says no, we argue with Him, and we defeat Him again. Although it seems as if we have only defeated the Lord, we actually have disobeyed His commandment. Many of us have had this experience.</p>
<p>Every time we defeat the Lord and disobey His commandment, we lose His presence within us, and we no longer have His face, because He hides Himself from us. However, there are also times when He gives a commandment, and we say, &ldquo;O Lord, because I love You, I will let myself be defeated. I will receive Your commandment, listen to Your commandment, and obey Your commandment. I will go along with what You say.&rdquo; Whenever we respond in this way, we experience sweetness, joy, and light. We sense that the Lord is with us, and we see His face, His manifestation.</p>
<p>There was a young child who was saved and properly shepherded. He often prayed, &ldquo;O Lord, I belong to You, and I am in You. I give myself to You. Lord, I love You. I am willing to live to You.&rdquo; This is a good prayer. One morning, his mother gave him ten dollars. He was very happy and said, &ldquo;Thank You, Lord. You love me so much that You have caused my mother to love me and give me ten dollars. Lord, I thank You and praise You.&rdquo; Immediately after he gave thanks, the Lord Jesus said to him, &ldquo;I want you to give the ten dollars to the child from a poor family who sat next to you in children&rsquo;s meeting.&rdquo; This made the child sad, and he could not pray anymore. The ten dollars became a problem. The Lord wanted him to give the ten dollars away, but he treasured the money and wanted to keep it. After that the child lost the Lord&rsquo;s presence. This does not mean that the Lord was not with him; it means that he could not sense the Lord&rsquo;s presence. The Lord&rsquo;s presence was hidden from him. He could not see the Lord&rsquo;s face, so he no longer had any joy.</p>
<p>When his mother noticed that something was wrong, she asked why he was unhappy. However, the child was not willing to talk about it; he said that everything was okay. It seemed as if the problem was the ten dollars, but the real problem was his love for the Lord.</p>
<p>The Lord might have asked, &ldquo;Do you love Me more than the ten dollars?&rdquo; This would have bothered the child. The Lord said, &ldquo;He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me...If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word&rdquo; (John 14:21, 23). Christians may appear to have no problem, but there is a problem concerning their love for the Lord. This child had a problem because he regarded the ten dollars more than the Lord&rsquo;s word, the Lord&rsquo;s commandment. It seemed as if he would rather have the ten dollars than the Lord.</p>
<p>Because the child did not want to let go of the Lord, he wished that the Lord had not given him this commandment. He hoped in his heart that the Lord would change this commandment, but the Lord insisted on his giving the ten dollars away. Therefore, the child struggled for a period of time. While he did not obey the Lord, he had no light, and he did not have the presence of the Lord. Therefore, he was unhappy. This is the story of a Christian. We have had this kind of experience often. Even a person who has followed the Lord for many years often argues with the Lord. In the midst of his argument, he often realizes that the Lord has withdrawn and is hiding His face. His argument with the Lord is the result of his partial love for the Lord. Genuine love is unconditional. If our love for the Lord is genuine, we will keep His word. Whatever He says, we will do. Whatever He wants, we will give. Whatever He requires of us, we will accept. If we genuinely love the Lord, we will keep His commandments, and we will have His manifestation.</p><h2 class="head1">OBEYING THE LORD&rsquo;S COMMANDMENTS<br />
AND HIS MAKING AN ABODE WITH US</h2>
<p>Having the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation is the first step, and His making an abode with us is the second step. There are two sides to the Lord making an abode with us: His coming to abide in us and our abiding in Him. Hence, this is a matter of rest. The Lord&rsquo;s manifestation is a matter of joy, whereas His making an abode in us is a matter of rest. If we love the Lord and obey His commandments so that there is no barrier between us, and we obey all that He asks of us, we will have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation, and we will have joy within. If we continue to love the Lord and obey His commandments, we will not only experience His manifestation; the Lord will also make an abode with us. When we argue with the Lord, if we are willing to say, &ldquo;Lord, I let You win. I am willing to surrender, to love You, and to listen to You,&rdquo; we will still experience His manifestation, and He will come to make an abode with us. He will abide in us, and we will abide in Him. Then we will have joy and also rest within.</p>
<p>Many Christians have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation, but few experience the Lord making an abode with them. They love the Lord, but they love Him today and do not love Him tomorrow. They are willing to listen to Him in one matter but are not willing to listen to Him in another matter. They often sense the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation but also sense the Lord withdrawing. In one matter they have the Lord&rsquo;s presence, but in another matter the Lord hides Himself from them. They do not have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation in a consistent way. Their experience of the Lord can be compared to a person staying with us for an hour and then leaving. This kind of manifestation is not continuous. A person who lives with us and is a member of our family will abide with us in a consistent way. His manifestation to us will not be temporary; it will be a long-term abiding. This illustration explains why some people have a temporary manifestation of the Lord but do not experience Him making an abode with them.</p>
<p>In order to experience the Lord making an abode with us, we must have an unchanging love toward Him and listen to His words without preference. Some brothers and sisters love the Lord, but they are selective when they listen to His words. When they feel that they can obey the Lord&rsquo;s command, they do so, and thus, they have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. However, when the Lord gives them a command that does not correspond to their preferences, they argue with the Lord and defeat Him. As a result, they lose not only the Lord&rsquo;s presence but also the Lord&rsquo;s making an abode with them. The most precious thing for a believer is to experience not only the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation but also His making an abode with him. It is not enough for us to have the Lord&rsquo;s presence in individual matters. We should have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation in our entire living so that the Lord will make an abode with us. He abides in us, and we also abide in Him. When He is able to obtain a dwelling place in us and have rest, we are able to obtain a dwelling place in Him and have rest as well. We become those who abide with the Lord. The Lord abides in us, and we abide in Him; thus, we have rest.</p>
<p>These two matters, the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation and His making an abode, depend on our loving the Lord and obeying His commandments. We must know and be able to recite John 14:21-23. These verses clearly show how we can experience the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation and His coming to make an abode with us. In verse 21 the Lord said, &ldquo;He who has My commandments and keeps them, he is the one who loves Me; and he who loves Me will be loved by My Father, and I will love him and will manifest Myself to him.&rdquo; Both the Father and the Lord Jesus love a person who keeps the Lord&rsquo;s commandments, and They manifest Themselves to him. This is entirely a matter of love. If we love the Lord and obey His commands, we will have the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation. In verse 23 the Lord said, &ldquo;If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.&rdquo; When we love the Lord and keep His word, He will make an abode with us.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD&rsquo;S MANIFESTATION<br />
AND HIS MAKING AN ABODE WITH US<br />
BRINGING US JOY AND REST</h2>
<p>As Christians we must experience the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation and His making an abode with us. How much has the Lord manifested Himself to you? How much has the Lord made an abode with you? This is the Christian life, and it is an overcoming and sanctified life. You do not have to deal with anything except whether or not the Lord manifests Himself to you and whether or not He makes an abode with you. This kind of spiritual life is very practical. The Lord&rsquo;s manifestation is something you sense within, and His making an abode with you is also something you can sense within. Whenever you experience the Lord&rsquo;s manifestation, you will have joy. Likewise, whenever you experience the Lord making an abode with you, you will have rest.</p>
<p>The Lord is real in us, His manifesting Himself to us is also real, and His abiding in us is real. Furthermore, the Lord who indwells us speaks and makes demands of us. The Lord does not necessarily speak to us when we are listening to a message or reading the Bible. Often the Lord speaks to us when we are not listening to a message or reading the Bible. We only need to lean toward Him or love Him, and He will speak to us. Nine times out of ten when He speaks to us, He makes a demand. Sometimes He asks us to put aside our plans either to go somewhere or to obtain something. Sometimes He asks us to give something away or to go along with His will. Most of the time, His speaking to us is a demand. Such demands cause us to argue with Him.</p>
<p>If the Lord promised to give us something, we would surely praise the Lord and say, &ldquo;Thank You!&rdquo; If He gave us something every time He spoke, none of us would have a problem with His speaking. However, this is not our situation. Most of the time the Lord&rsquo;s words to us are demands, either forbidding us or requesting something of us. Hence, we are easily aroused to argue with Him. When He loses and we win, we lose His manifestation, and His face is hidden from us. Furthermore, we have no joy and no rest. We have no peace and no security.</p>
<p>We must understand that we have no rest, because the Lord is not making His abode in us, and we are abiding outside of the Lord instead of abiding in the Lord. If, by the Lord&rsquo;s grace, we continually obey His demands, His face will be manifested in us. His face will be toward us continually. We will touch His presence, and we will be full of joy. Not only will we have joy; we also will have no problems and no barriers between the Lord and us. He will make an abode with us and dwell in us securely, and He will also cause us to dwell in Him securely. When we abide in Him, we will be persons who are secure and settled. Then we will not only have joy but also rest.</p>
<p>Do you have joy? Are you secure and at peace within? The only reason that you would not have joy or be secure or at peace is that there is a dispute between you and the Lord. If we love the Lord, do not argue with Him, and listen to His words and obey them, He will appear to us moment by moment. We will have His face, and we will have joy. Moreover, He will dwell securely in us and will cause us to dwell securely in Him. This is the way for us to have full rest.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER ELEVEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE WAY OF FAITH&mdash;<br />
LOOKING AWAY UNTO JESUS</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 10:32-39; 11:1&mdash;12:3</h1>
<p>Hebrews 10:38-39 says, &ldquo;&lsquo;My righteous one shall live by faith; and if he shrinks back, My soul does not delight in him.&rsquo; But we are not of those who shrink back to ruin but of them who have faith to the gaining of the soul.&rdquo; Chapter 11 speaks of what faith is and the history of faith, showing that many people in the Old Testament lived and walked by faith.</p>
<p>Verses 1 and 2 of chapter 12 say, &ldquo;Therefore let us also, having so great a cloud of witnesses surrounding us, put away every encumbrance and the sin which so easily entangles us and run with endurance the race which is set before us, looking away unto Jesus, the Author and Perfecter of our faith.&rdquo; In the Chinese Union Version the phrase <em>looking away unto</em> is translated as &ldquo;looking to&rdquo;; however, <em>looking to</em> is inadequate. The phrase <em>looking away unto</em> means to look at what is ahead with undivided attention so that one is separated from all objects that surround him. By looking away unto the Lord Jesus with undivided attention, we are separated from everything in our present and in our past.</p>
<p>The second half of verse 2 and verse 3 say, &ldquo;Who for the joy set before Him endured the cross, despising the shame, and has sat down on the right hand of the throne of God. For compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary, fainting in your souls.&rdquo; The word <em>fainting</em> literally means &ldquo;becoming loosened.&rdquo; Both &ldquo;fainting in your souls&rdquo; and &ldquo;who have faith to the gaining of the soul&rdquo; in 10:39 are related to the soul.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE CHRISTIAN WAY BEING THE WAY OF FAITH</h2>
<p>The Epistle to the Hebrews is probably the only book in the New Testament that speaks of how we follow the Lord on His pathway. Although 1 Corinthians 9:24-27, Philippians 3:13-14, and 2 Timothy 4:7-8 cover the matter of running the course, they stress being regulated, being faithful, and running for the prize. They do not speak concerning the source of our motivation in following the Lord or of our pathway before the Lord. Only Hebrews shows the pathway and the source of our motivation in following the Lord.</p>
<p>The root of the word <em>Hebrew</em> means &ldquo;to pass over,&rdquo; specifically to pass over a river; that is, to pass over from one side of a river to the other side. After traveling on a long journey, a person passes from one side to another. This is the meaning of the word <em>Hebrew.</em> Hence, in the book of Hebrews all those who have been called by God to follow the Lord are to take the way of river crossing. They are to cross from one side to another. We need to cross over from earthly things to the heavenly things, from the temporal to the eternal, from the Old Testament to the New Testament, and from the things outside of the Son of God to the things in the Son of God. Furthermore, we need to cross over from ourselves to God. These items are included in Hebrews.</p>
<p>This book focuses on our crossing over from the things of the present to the things in the future. Hence, the way of river crossing is the way of faith. Whenever there is a problem with our faith, we immediately encounter difficulties. This way of faith is not referred to in 1 Corinthians, Philippians, or 2 Timothy, even though they speak of running the race. Only Hebrews speaks of the way of faith. Furthermore, according to Hebrews the motivating power for Christians to take the way of faith lies in the Lord Jesus Christ. The motivating power for us to take the way of faith lies in our knowledge of Him.</p>
<p>Hebrews first presents the superiority of Christ, the Son of God. Then in chapter 11 it presents the way of faith. The first part of the Epistle gives us the knowledge of the Son of God, and the second part, the way of faith. The way that we take is the way of faith, and the motivating power for us to take this way is our knowledge of the Son of God. The extent to which we know the Lord is the extent to which we will be motivated. Our motivating power depends entirely on our knowledge of the Lord.</p>
<p>Therefore, at the end of Hebrews the author connects our faith to our knowledge of the Son of God. On the one hand, our way is the way of faith; on the other hand, the motivation for us to take this way depends on our knowledge and revelation of the Son of God. Hence, the Son of God should always be set before us. Our mind and our emotion should be occupied with Him, and what we gaze at, observe, and look away to should be the Lord. He is the attraction and the motivation. He attracts us to walk the way that is set before us, and He motivates us to walk this way.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO LIVE BY FAITH DURING TRIALS</h2>
<p>The Lord tries the faith of those who serve Him. In the future we will be placed into periods of longer and more difficult trials. In the days to come, there will be many such trials.</p>
<p>There will be many aspects to these trials. Some trials will affect our feelings. They will cause us to lose our interest in serving the Lord, to lose our sense of the sweetness in taking this way, and to even lose our sense of encouragement from the Lord. Some trials will be problems in our family or problems related to our health. Some trials may be related to material things and financial matters. We may experience poverty and hardships. Some trials may be related to our work for the Lord. We may lack power and light, be unclear, and lack the Lord&rsquo;s leading. Our present situation will change, and we will not be able to touch the Lord&rsquo;s heart or know what to do. Many of us may become unclear and uncertain about the Lord&rsquo;s way and the Lord&rsquo;s heart. Some trials may be related to the result of our work. We may labor and work without seeing any results. Some trials may be related to our co-workers. They may neither understand us, sympathize with us, nor open to us. These are all trials.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s trials in me have not decreased; rather, they have increased in number and in depth. The desire in the Lord&rsquo;s heart is for us to mature, to do His work, and to gain spiritual weight. To this end He is determined to bring us into trials. We will be unable to follow the Lord as we did in the past, when we followed the Lord according to our feelings of excitement, prosperity, and blessings and according to the evident results of our work. If we consider the past ten years, we will see that the Lord has been gradually bringing us into trials and decreasing our excitement and the sense of sweetness that we once experienced. The Lord is bringing us into a situation in which we cannot follow our feelings.</p>
<p>It may not be possible for us to give up this way; however, if we continue, we will not see the results of the past, and we will be unable to sense any sweetness. When this happens, we can be assured that the Lord has brought us into trials. When the Lord brings us into trials, He will place us on the pathway of faith. In the initial stages of the work, we were excited and had results; however, we were not on the pathway of faith. It is not until we enter into trials that we will walk on the pathway of faith.</p>
<p>The Lord brought the Hebrew believers into trials by which all that they had regarded as precious gradually disappeared. Therefore, they became confused and grew weary and fainted in their souls. It was against such a background that the apostle wrote this book to show the Hebrew believers who the Son of God is and how the Lord took the pathway of faith. The Lord, whom they followed, went outside the camp in order to enter within the veil (Heb. 13:12; 10:19-20). After speaking concerning the Lord, the apostle told the believers to have the endurance that is produced from their knowledge of the Lord&mdash;their faith. Once we lose our faith, we also lose endurance. Toward God we need to have endurance and faith. Paul gave the history of the witnesses of faith, beginning with the first witness of faith in the Old Testament&mdash;Abel. The apostle listed the witnesses in order to show that those in the Old Testament who followed God took the way of faith. They lived a life of faith.</p>
<p>Romans 1:17 says, &ldquo;The righteous shall have life and live by faith.&rdquo; The phrase <em>shall have life</em> is related to salvation. In Hebrews 10:38, however, the same phrase is rendered as &ldquo;My righteous one shall live by faith.&rdquo; The emphasis in Hebrews is living. Paul seems to be saying, &ldquo;Daily you are being put into trials so that you learn to live by faith.&rdquo; When there is no excitement, no encouragement, no attraction, and no power to go on, we need faith, not sight. We need to live by faith.</p>
<p>This is the principle of faith. The saints in the Old Testament took the pathway of faith. For example, Abraham left Ur of Chaldea and went to Canaan by faith. In the land of Canaan it did not seem that he was walking by faith, but he was still walking with God. Even though he could not see God, Abraham walked with God his whole life. Abraham did not gain anything, yet he took the way by faith. When he finished his journey and departed from this world, he had not gained an inheritance nor had he seen anything. Abraham had lived by faith (11:8-10).</p>
<p>Sooner or later the Lord will bring us to a situation in which faith is the only way to follow Him. The day will come when the encouragement we received and the things we relied on in the past will vanish. Even the support from the church, the encouragement from the brothers and sisters, the fellowship of the co-workers, and the mutual care will vanish. We may pursue them, but they will vanish. We may seek them for encouragement, but they will be against us. Perhaps we will feel that the church no longer supplies us and has become a problem to us. We may also feel that the brothers and sisters do not support us; on the contrary, they are problems. We may also feel that instead of having fellowship with the co-workers, they have become a trial to us. Sooner or later the Lord will put us in such situations.</p>
<p>I am concerned that some of us may not be able to take this way to the end. Perhaps some will fall, and others will turn back. They will &ldquo;shrink back&rdquo; (10:39). To shrink back does not refer to eternal perdition; it refers to destruction or ruin. Whenever we shrink back, all our previous efforts are nullified. We have consecrated ourselves, given up the world, followed the Lord, forsaken certain things for His sake, and worked for Him. We have learned many lessons before the Lord and have walked with Him. However, if we shrink back, everything will be nullified. The result of our previous efforts will be lost.</p><h2 class="head1">BEING THOSE WHO HAVE FAITH<br />
TO THE GAINING OF THE SOUL</h2>
<p>Paul says that we are those &ldquo;who have faith to the gaining of the soul&rdquo; (v. 39). The saving, or gaining, of our soul does not refer to eternal salvation. The saving of our spirit is related to eternal salvation. The saving of our body will take place at the Lord&rsquo;s return, when our body will be redeemed and transfigured. Between our spirit and our body is our soul. Those who are redeemed by the Lord&rsquo;s precious blood and are regenerated have received the salvation of their spirit and are saved eternally. One day their bodies will also be redeemed and saved. However, in the eyes of the Lord, if they do not walk the way of the Lord, or if they shrink back, they are not saved in their souls. This will be a problem to them in the future.</p>
<p>I am burdened that we would know the situation that the Lord has brought us into. Some of us may feel that our life is depressing and boring, and we may also feel that we are burdened and in a difficult situation. This is the result of not understanding that we are on a spiritual journey. The Lord has placed us on this pathway. Hence, we should not expect these trials to end. Our life is the way of trials. With respect to the environment, this pathway is full of trials. With respect to ourselves, it is the way of faith. Outwardly, it is the way of trials; inwardly, it is the way of faith. From now until we meet the Lord we should not expect to be delivered from trials.</p>
<p>Although other people may not have problems and may do things without difficulty, nothing seems to be easy for us. The Lord will not withhold food from us, but while others eat their food with delight, we do not. It is not that the Lord does not provide for us, but He provides for us according to His assessment of our need. Consequently, while others are enjoying their provisions peacefully, we go through many difficulties. Even though the Lord will bring us through, we will experience thorns and thistles. Outwardly, we may appear to be doing well, but we know the stripping and the torment we have experienced. These are part of the trials.</p>
<p>Since the Lord is bringing us to the pathway of trials, we must learn the lesson of faith. It is better to have what is unseen than what is seen. It is better to choose what is bitter than what is sweet. It is better to choose people&rsquo;s opposition than welcome their sympathy. It is better to be in poverty than to be in wealth and abundance. This requires faith. If instead of learning the lesson of faith, we yearn for the past experiences, some of us will either fall or shrink back.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LOOKING AWAY UNTO JESUS,<br />
THE AUTHOR AND PERFECTER OF OUR FAITH</h2>
<p>As the night becomes darker, we must be prepared to live by faith. However, when the night is at its darkest hour, the dawn will come. If we do not wait for the dawn, we will either fall or shrink back. We must exercise our faith and remember that the saints in the Old Testament were all witnesses of faith. They were not authors of faith or perfecters of faith. The Lord is the unique Author and Perfecter of our faith. Therefore, we must strive to know Him. This is the purpose of Hebrews.</p>
<p>The first few chapters of Hebrews speak of what the Lord is. The revelation of the Lord Jesus in Hebrews is different from the revelation of the Lord in Revelation. Revelation shows the position and glory of the Lord Jesus in God&rsquo;s plan, whereas Hebrews shows who the Lord Jesus is in the believers&rsquo; life of faith. Revelation speaks of the Christ in God&rsquo;s plan; Hebrews speaks of the Christ in the believers&rsquo; living&mdash;His person and position in the believers&rsquo; living. Therefore, when reading Hebrews, we must see that Christ is the object of our faith in our living. Christ will become the motivating power in our living and the object of our faith. For this reason, Hebrews speaks of the Lord&rsquo;s human living.</p>
<p>Hebrews says that the Lord is able to sympathize with and help those who are being tempted, because in His human living He passed through trials and temptations (2:18; 4:15). If we read the first few chapters of Hebrews with this in mind, we will see that the Lord Jesus desires to come into our life to be our motivating power and the object of our faith. The more we know the Lord in this way, the more we will consider Him and look away unto Him.</p>
<p>Chapter 12 does not speak concerning knowing Christ. This chapter speaks of looking away and comparing. Verse 3 says, &ldquo;Compare Him who has endured such contradiction by sinners against Himself, so that you may not grow weary, fainting in your souls.&rdquo; <em>Compare Him</em> means to consider the Lord to see what kind of person He is. We should consider how He lived as a man on the earth, how He conducted His human living, how He walked, where He is today, what He is doing, and what He is to us. These are the things we should consider. The result of our considering the Lord in this way is that we will look away unto Him.</p>
<p>Verse 2 says, &ldquo;Looking away unto Jesus.&rdquo; This means that our looking away unto Jesus cuts us off from everything in our background and environment. Casting ourselves upon the Lord is the motivating power of our walk. On the one hand, we must learn to exercise our faith in all kinds of situations. On the other hand, we must learn to know the Lord in every situation. Furthermore, we should consider the Lord always so that we can look away unto Him. As we look away unto Him, we are separated from our situations of the present and the past. May we cast ourselves completely on Him and look only unto Him. This is our strength. May the Lord lead us to learn these lessons.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER TWELVE</h1>
<h1 class="title">GRACE, MERCY, AND BLESSING</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Heb. 4:14-16</h1>
<h2 class="head1">GOD&rsquo;S WILL BEING CONTRARY TO MAN&rsquo;S CONCEPT</h2>
<p>Few Bible readers understand the book of Job. Job was written from the standpoint of human adversities. The book of Job was written on the human level, but it also reveals God&rsquo;s intention for man in his adversities. At the end of the book of Job God comes in and says that all the words spoken by Job and his three friends were words without knowledge. Nevertheless, their words are frequently quoted by Christians.</p>
<p>For example, Job 22:21-28 often is quoted: &ldquo;Be well disposed to Him and at peace with Him; / By such, good will come upon you. / Receive instruction from His mouth, / And lay up His words in your heart. / If you return to the Almighty, you will be built up. / If you put injustice far away from your tents, / And place your gold nuggets in the dust / And your gold of Ophir in the stones of the brooks, / Then the Almighty will be your gold nuggets / And precious silver to you. / For then you will delight yourself in the Almighty, / And you will lift up your countenance to God. / You will pray to Him, and He will hear you; / And you will repay your vows. / You will also decree something, and it will be established for you; / And light will shine on your ways.&rdquo; This was spoken by Eliphaz the Temanite. Job responded to these words and said, &ldquo;Today also my complaint is bitter; / My stroke is heavy because of my groaning. / Oh that I knew where I might find Him, / That I might come to His seat! / I would present my cause in order before Him, / And I would fill my mouth with arguments&rdquo; (23:2-4).</p>
<p>Many people consider the portion spoken by Eliphaz to be very good, and they like to quote it. However, they do not realize that at the end of the book of Job God judged the words spoken by Job and his three friends. God said that their words darkened His counsel, His will, and that their words were without knowledge (38:1-2).</p>
<p>Some may ask what is God&rsquo;s will and why does God regard the words that we consider to be wonderful as words without knowledge that darken His will? This illustrates the problem that Christians have in reading the Bible. God desires to give man grace, mercy, and blessing. However, man has the thought that he must be pious and accomplish something for God. With regard to this, we can obtain help from the Psalms. Most of the psalms were written by David, who is a good example. From David&rsquo;s life we see that if a person is strong, God will break his strength; if a person is perfect, God will break his perfection; and if a person is capable, God will break his capability.</p>
<p>All human concepts, thoughts, and doctrines counsel people to be strong, perfect, and capable before God. However, the Bible shows that God always breaks those who are strong, perfect, and capable. This does not mean that we should now be weak, imperfect, or incapable before God. This is not what I mean. Rather, we should consider only whether God can supply us with grace, mercy, and blessing, not whether we are strong, perfect, or capable. It is a question of whether in our strength and perfection God can supply us with grace, mercy, and blessing. If this is the case, our concepts will not be a hindrance to God&rsquo;s intention.</p>
<p>The Bible is the utterance of God. However, the words of the Bible passed through men and were often written in the midst of human sufferings. Therefore, there are several veils that can cover us. The snacks we purchase are a good example. They are covered by a layer of wrapping paper, but the wrapping paper is not the snack. Some words in the Bible are like wrapping paper. In the book of Job there are some &ldquo;snacks,&rdquo; but they have many layers of wrapping paper.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible, it is not easy for us to differentiate which words are wrapping paper and which words are snacks. It is easy for us to remove the wrapping paper, considering it to be the main content. The debates in the book of Job are wrapping paper, but it is not easy for us to discern this. Hence, it is not easy to read the Bible. We are often influenced by our natural concepts when we read the Bible. According to our concept, we think that God wants us to be strong, perfect, and capable. We do not realize that these things are a hindrance to God. God desires that we come to the throne of grace so that we can receive mercy and grace.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GRACE BEING GOD REACHING MAN</h2>
<p>Regrettably, few people know what grace and mercy are. Grace is God working Himself into us. For example, our ability to believe is grace, and this is God worked into us. Grace does not mean that God does something for us. Rather, grace is what God is and what God has done reaching us.</p>
<p>On the day of Pentecost the disciples were filled with the Holy Spirit, and they spoke the word of God with boldness. The disciples were regarded as uneducated men and laymen from Galilee (Acts 2:7; 4:13). Their standing up to speak for the Lord was grace. None of the disciples could boast that they were educated or eloquent, nor could they be proud, because they knew that it was God&rsquo;s grace that enabled them to speak. Their ability to speak, their eloquence, and their boldness were the result of God working Himself into them. This was altogether a matter of grace. The disciples did not have any education, nor were they bold. They were uneducated laymen, and they were timid. It was God&rsquo;s grace that they spoke for Him with boldness. Hence, grace is not something that we have, that we are able to do, or that we have done. Grace is God reaching us. God&rsquo;s reaching us can be compared to being struck by electricity. It is not that we reach the electricity but that electricity reaches us. Grace is God reaching man.</p>
<p>We may need to learn many lessons in order to know grace. Sometimes we may feel that a brother does not know grace and that he never feels the need for grace, because he is strong, bold, eloquent, and able to give messages. We may not know what grace is, because we live and work according to our ability. Most of what we do is according to our ability. This is not grace. Grace is God as everything to us. In 2 Corinthians 12 Paul said that he had a thorn in his body so that he would not be lifted up. He prayed three times, asking the Lord to remove the thorn, but the Lord said, &ldquo;My grace is sufficient for you&rdquo; (v. 9). The Lord seemed to be saying, &ldquo;I will not remove the thorn, because if I do, you will depend on your strength and not on grace. This thorn is to help you sense your weakness and your need for grace. You need Me as grace.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Grace involves nothing of ourselves. Grace is God becoming everything to us. Grace is God and all that He is becoming our replacement. If we lack eloquence, grace is God coming to be our eloquence. If we lack ability or wisdom, grace is God coming to be our ability and wisdom.</p><h2 class="head1">MERCY REACHING THOSE WHO ARE FALLEN</h2>
<p>If we were not degraded and fallen, we would have no need for God&rsquo;s mercy. However, in our degraded and fallen condition, we need God&rsquo;s mercy, which reaches us and brings us into a situation in which He is able to favor us with His grace. If the younger son in Luke 15 had not become the prodigal son (vv. 13-14) but instead had stayed at home and enjoyed all that his father had, he would have been in a situation of grace. However, even though he fell into trouble, the father received him and then gave everything he had for the prodigal son to enjoy as grace.</p>
<p>Since we are degraded and fallen, our enjoyment of God begins with mercy. Even though Peter experienced many failures, he stood up and enjoyed God on the day of Pentecost because of His mercy. Without mercy, perhaps only Adam, in the garden of Eden prior to the fall, could have received grace. Peter, who denied the Lord three times, would not have been able to receive grace without God&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>Grace can reach only the people who have a proper standing before God, not the people who have an improper standing. Grace can come to fallen man because of mercy. Suppose I have something that I treasure and would like to give it to a brother who has not made any mistakes. My gift to him is not related to mercy; rather, it is a gift of grace. However, if this brother makes a mistake or even offends me, any gift to him would be related to mercy because his status has changed. My giving him a gift, even though he has lost his proper status, is mercy.</p>
<h2 class="head1">DAVID BEING BROKEN<br />
IN ORDER TO RECEIVE GOD&rsquo;S MERCY</h2>
<p>David was able to build the temple of God through his seed. This was not because of David&rsquo;s strength but because of God&rsquo;s mercy. God intended that His grace would reach David so that David&rsquo;s seed would build the holy temple. Prior to his great failure, David was a man who did not know grace. He knew how to be pious and strong and how to accomplish things for God. We can see this particularly in Psalm 1. David, however, was short of grace. There was no way for God&rsquo;s grace to be manifested in him. In his fall David&rsquo;s piousness, strength, and accomplishments were nullified. In other words, he was broken.</p>
<p>After David fell, his piety, strength, and accomplishments came to nothing. God&rsquo;s intention was to give him grace, but God could not bestow grace on him because of his piety, strength, and accomplishments. God was willing to grace David in spite of his failure, but this willingness was based on His mercy.</p>
<p>God gave David a son who was born of Bath-sheba, the wife he took when he sinned. Matthew 1:6 says, &ldquo;David begot Solomon of her who had been the wife of Uriah.&rdquo; This is not a nice word. Solomon should have been given to David as grace. However, since David lost the position to receive grace, Solomon became a gift of God&rsquo;s mercy. By God&rsquo;s mercy David had a son who was to build the temple. By God&rsquo;s mercy David obtained the land on which the temple was to be built.</p>
<p>According to the record in the Bible, David had two serious falls in his life. The first fall was his taking Uriah&rsquo;s wife (2 Sam. 11:2-27), and the second was his numbering Israel (24:1-10). When he took the wife of Uriah, he was condemned by God and repented. The result of his repentance was that he was given a son who would build the holy temple. David also numbered Israel, which offended God. The result of David&rsquo;s dealing with this sin was that he obtained the site for the building of the temple&mdash;the threshing floor of Araunah (vv. 18-25) (who was also called Ornan, 1 Chron. 21:18). This site was on Mount Moriah (2 Chron. 3:1). This was God&rsquo;s mercy. If David knew God&rsquo;s grace instead of relying on his piousness and strength, God would still have given him Solomon as well as the site for the temple. That would have been God&rsquo;s grace to David, according to God&rsquo;s doing. It would have been something manifested by God in David, not something that David did.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s piousness and strength were a problem to God&rsquo;s grace. They became an adversary and enemy to God&rsquo;s grace, frustrating God&rsquo;s grace. God could not give David grace, because David thought he did not need it. Therefore, God had no alternative but to allow the inability of David&rsquo;s piousness and strength to accomplish His intention to be exposed. After his failures, David realized that he needed God&rsquo;s grace. He even fell to such an extent that grace could not reach him. God&rsquo;s mercy was needed in order to bring him to a position where God&rsquo;s grace could reach him.</p>
<p>David had many concepts concerning piousness that are expressed in the Psalms. When we read the Psalms, we are moved by them and are touched by David&rsquo;s piousness and perfection before God. We are also inspired by his strengths and accomplishments. This is the problem we have in reading the Psalms. Humanly, David was pious, strong, and capable. His psalms show that he was exercised to live this way before God. When we read the Psalms, we are moved by the sentiment expressed in them, and we likewise want to be pious, resolve to love God, and desire to do something for God. Little do we realize that these sentiments prevent us from receiving grace.</p>
<p>David&rsquo;s fall was the result of his own actions; however, God was willing to let him fail in order that he would know God&rsquo;s grace. If God had not loosed His hand, David would not have fallen. Hence, David fell, but God allowed him to fall. In his fall, David lost confidence in everything other than God, including confidence in his piousness and strength. He saw that his piety and strength were worth nothing before God. Then he learned to receive both God&rsquo;s mercy and His grace.</p>
<p>This does not mean that we should seek to fall in order to receive grace (Rom. 6:1-8). Rather, it means that sooner or later God will bring us to the point where all that we have is broken. One day our ability to give messages, our wisdom in administrating the church, our methods in the work, and everything else will be broken. I am afraid that our zeal, faith, love, power, patience, and purity do not have much grace in them; they are mostly of ourselves. God allows this and tolerates it, just as He did with David. God allowed David to live a life of piety for many years. However, David&rsquo;s piety was not necessarily the issue of grace. It was out of his own strength and his self. It was not until David fell that something changed. His later psalms show that he became a different person.</p>
<p>David became a person who knew grace. Psalm 51 shows that David touched grace. Before his fall, his living reflected his piousness, strength, and his desire to accomplish things for God. He said that he had clean hands and a pure heart before God, that he walked in his integrity, that he trusted God, and that he would not waver (24:4; 26:1). The psalms written by David have many expressions of this kind. David often said that he was upright and that he wanted to accomplish things for God.</p>
<p>After David fell, he wrote Psalm 51. This psalm is different. In it David said, &ldquo;Create in me a clean heart, O God, / And renew a steadfast spirit within me... / Do good in Your good pleasure unto Zion&rdquo; (vv. 10, 18). Verse 16 says, &ldquo;You do not delight in sacrifice; / Otherwise I would offer it.&rdquo; These words are different from David&rsquo;s usual expressions. Before his fall David spoke of the sacrifices he would offer to God, but after his fall he realized that God did not delight in sacrifices or burnt offerings. He understood that the sacrifice God wanted was a broken spirit. He said, &ldquo;A broken and a contrite heart, O God, You will not despise&rdquo; (v. 17). He also asked God to do good in His good pleasure unto Zion. David was asking God to have mercy on Zion and to build the walls of Jerusalem. Verse 19 says, &ldquo;Then You will delight in the sacrifices of righteousness, / In burnt offerings and whole burnt offerings.&rdquo; First David said that God does not delight in sacrifices, because they had become mere human activities. Then he said that God will delight in sacrifices that are according to God and that are the result of God&rsquo;s mercy.</p>
<p>Sooner or later we will be brought by God to the point where we know what mercy is and what grace is. Only the pathway of faith can keep us; if we do not live in faith, none of our &ldquo;good&rdquo; situations will last. We must declare that only in God&rsquo;s mercy can anything last. The Lord has a way to break all our piousness, strength, and accomplishments. The Lord has a way to break every one of His followers. The Lord will break all of our strong points. If we are strong in our will, the Lord will break it, and if we are particularly good in being patient, the Lord will break it too. If we are capable in administrating the church or in giving messages, sooner or later they will be broken by the Lord. Even our moral virtues will be broken by the Lord. All the breaking is for us to learn what mercy is and what grace is.</p>
<p>We need to see that our morality, endurance, strong will, ability, and knowledge of how to administrate the church or how to give messages do not matter. We have these things because of the grace of God. However, we often do not recognize or acknowledge God&rsquo;s grace. Therefore, God will allow us to fall into a pitiful state so that mercy can bring us to grace. Then even though we are still the ones living and serving, our eloquence will be God, our morality will be God, and our strength will also be God.</p><h2 class="head1">BLESSING AS THE ISSUE OF MERCY AND GRACE</h2>
<p>Blessing is the issue of mercy and grace. David had a son who built the holy temple. That was God&rsquo;s blessing. David obtained the land that was the site for God&rsquo;s temple. That was also God&rsquo;s blessing. Eventually, the holy temple was built under the oversight of David&rsquo;s house. That was also God&rsquo;s blessing. Let us look at another example. After the Lord&rsquo;s resurrection, Peter went back to his former profession. He went fishing with some of the disciples. They labored the whole night but caught nothing. As soon as the morning broke, however, they listened to the Lord&rsquo;s word, cast their net, and hauled in a hundred and fifty-three fish. That was God&rsquo;s blessing (John 21:3-11). If God does not bless, all human labor on earth is in vain; after a whole night of labor not one fish will be gained.</p>
<p>Suppose we have a big gospel meeting coming up, and we all know that we should pray and be prepared. However, we should believe in and depend on God&rsquo;s blessing more than our prayer and preparation. We should not trust in our prayer or our preparation. We should trust in God. Blessing is the issue of God&rsquo;s mercy and His grace. It is the issue of God reaching us. We should never think that we are able to do anything, that we have methods, are perfect, or have a good character. Such thoughts do not allow us to know mercy or grace, and they do not allow us to know God&rsquo;s blessing.</p>
<p>God wants to work what He is into us. If our condition is normal, what reaches us is grace. If our condition is abnormal, God will still visit us. However, instead of reaching us as grace, He will be mercy to us. Whether He reaches us as grace or mercy, the issue is blessing. Blessing is not the result of our effort. Blessing is the result of God&rsquo;s mercy and grace reaching us. For example, we may labor in a place for a while without perfecting one saint to be an elder, but if we have God&rsquo;s grace, a group of elders will be raised up. This would be a work that God has accomplished, and it will be His blessing.</p>
<p>Theology is taught in seminaries with the expectation that spiritual people will be produced and cultivated. However, it seems that there is not much result. It is God&rsquo;s blessing for us to be able to perfect some spiritual ones after meeting and serving in a place. Blessing is the issue of mercy and grace. The more we live before God and follow Him, the more we will know mercy, grace, and blessing and will realize that what we have is worthless before God. However, if we are too strong and prevent the grace of God from being manifested through us, at the necessary time God will allow us to be broken. Either He will break our ability and intelligence, or He will break our morality and our will. We may need to fall into a miserable situation so that God can give us mercy. This mercy will bring in a result&mdash;the blessing of God. The blessing will produce Solomon, and it will also gain the threshing floor of Ornan&mdash;the site for the building of the holy temple, God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p>
<p>Blessing as the result of mercy and grace ultimately becomes God&rsquo;s dwelling place. The building up of the church is God&rsquo;s blessing. It is the result of our knowing mercy and grace. The building up of the church is not the issue of our effort. Our effort can bring in only temporary prosperity that does not last; rather, it will either pass away or be broken by God. Furthermore, our effort will cause God to raise up an environment to do a breaking work on us. He will break our strength so that the grace of God can be manifested in us according to His mercy. The result of this breaking will bring in God&rsquo;s blessing.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER THIRTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">LEARNING LESSONS FROM OUR TRIALS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO RECEIVE MERCY<br />
AND NOT BE INFLUENCED</h2>
<p>We need to pray for the overseas saints. We enjoy the Lord&rsquo;s blessing, but we hope that the blessing we enjoy will extend to other places, not only to other places in Taiwan. The Lord has brought a good number of overseas saints to be perfected in Taiwan. We need to pray and ask the Lord to have mercy on them and to enable them to have a clear vision.</p>
<p>Often we may not be able to see a matter clearly, because we are not looking at it from a proper angle. For example, if we look at a house from different angles, we will see different views of the house. Furthermore, we can have one view from the front of the house and another from the back. If the angle from which we view a physical object is important, how much more important is it with regard to spiritual things?</p>
<p>Even though we can have different views of a house, these different views will not have much influence on us. However, in spiritual matters, our ability to clearly see depends not only on the pureness of our intentions but also on the depth of outside influence. We must admit that none of us is so strong that we cannot be influenced by others. Consequently, it is always difficult to discern things accurately. It is difficult to know which influence is wrong and should be rejected and which influence is right and should be received. Hardly anyone among us is so strong.</p>
<p>The factor that influences us the most is Christianity. According to my knowledge, the opposition of the Western missionaries against us is unprecedented. You may not be aware of this, because you may not have much contact with others outside of Taiwan. However, the strong and fierce opposition toward us is unprecedented. It is so strong that it has become condemnation. Such opposition may not come directly to us. However, just like radio waves are in the air, the opposition can reach many people.</p>
<p>It is easy for the overseas saints, especially those from the West, to contact opposition. This kind of spiritual radio wave can contact people at any time. We cannot say that people are so strong that they cannot be affected by opposition. Hence, we need to spend time to ask the Lord to cause the visiting saints, whether they are local, from Taiwan, or from the West, to receive mercy. This means that they would not be touched by any improper influence and that if they are, they would receive timely grace to have the proper discernment and be able to know which things to reject and which things to receive.</p>
<p>If a person receives mercy, he will see only positive things. If I am a person who has received mercy, when I visit a brother, I will see only a brother who prays because he loves the Lord. However, if I am not a person who has received mercy, I will see a husband who fights with his wife. It may be that they have never fought before, but on the day that I visit them, there is a fight. The fact that I encounter such a situation proves that I have not received mercy. It may be that the brother fears God and never fights at home. However, the fact that he fights with his wife on the day that I visit him shows that I have not received mercy.</p>
<p>If I witness a brother fighting with his wife, it will be difficult for me to believe that he lives in a godly manner. The fight will influence me to such an extent that even if he truly lives before the Lord, I will still be affected. This shows that I need to receive mercy. Some people receive mercy and always see the good and positive situations in the saints. This applies to what they see in the saints and to what they see in the meetings. When a person who receives mercy goes to a meeting, the meeting is good. However, this is not the case with a person who does not receive mercy; it may be that a brother stands up and gives a negative testimony. These matters are not under human control; they depend on God&rsquo;s mercy. I hope that by the Lord&rsquo;s mercy there would be no negative situations among us but that every situation would be positive.</p>
<p>Those who oppose us are not the only ones who have a negative influence on the visiting saints from overseas. It is possible that some of the saints among us or even those who are serving will be a negative influence. Many times the speaking, attitude, and expression of the saints give visitors a negative impression. We must take this matter seriously. When a person is pursuing spiritual things, he has tender feelings. If a person is not pursuing spiritual things, his feelings are dull, and he is indifferent toward many things. It does not matter to him whether a brother becomes backslidden. He has no reaction and even feels that it does not matter when a brother becomes lukewarm and loves the world, nor does it matter to him that a brother is living in sin. He has no feeling when others lose their temper or even when they are spiritual. Everything is the same to him. However, a person who has been touched by the Holy Spirit and has a desire to pursue the Lord will be &ldquo;hot&rdquo; inside and outside. This means that his feelings will be sensitive and tender. Those who know spiritual matters know how serious this is. They will not dare to carelessly affect a person&rsquo;s spiritual sense.</p>
<p>One rainy day D. L. Moody had a gospel conversation with a woman. The conversation came to a critical juncture, and the woman was touched by the Holy Spirit. In other words, the conversation had come to the point that they were ready to kneel down and pray. Right at that moment a sister walked into the room and put down her umbrella. The noise from the umbrella interrupted the atmosphere, and the gospel friend lost her feeling to pray. Moody was unable to bring the conversation back to the point of prayer.</p>
<p>We may have had similar experiences. Such experiences prove that when a person desires God in his inner being, his feelings are very tender. Hence, we must realize that the saints who are visiting from out of town and those who are participating in the training have tender feelings. They will even sense something that is slightly wrong. The saints who have been here may not sense anything, but the visiting saints are full of feeling. Whatever situation they are in will form an indelible impression that will affect them for the rest of their lives. Hence, our attitude and our words are very important. For this reason, we must pray much.</p>
<p>Recently I have been considering the book of Job and the matter of help. There are different kinds of help. We cannot say that Job&rsquo;s three friends did not intend to help him. They did not go to him with malice. They had a heart of love and wanted to help their dear friend. However, they were self-confident. They thought that they knew God, understood God&rsquo;s logic, and knew God&rsquo;s acts, ways, and principles in dealing with man. They told Job that if he put injustice far away from his tents, he would know God (22:23). They believed that they knew the way to know God and the principle by which God deals with people. They spoke concerning God out of their good intention. However, God said that the words spoken by Job and his three friends were without knowledge and darkened counsel (38:1-2). This is serious. It is not easy to receive help from others, and it is also not easy to render help to others.</p>
<p>When I speak to people concerning knowing God&rsquo;s ways and knowing God&rsquo;s principles, I am always full of fear and trembling. I fear that I would be like one of Job&rsquo;s three friends. I often ask myself, &ldquo;How can you be sure that the help you render to others is not like the help given to Job by his three friends? How can you be sure that your advice is not without knowledge and that it does not darken counsel?&rdquo; This is indeed serious. For this reason, I bear a very heavy burden. Many brothers and sisters will be coming from England, America, Canada, Denmark, and Japan. There will also be many Chinese saints from overseas. They will be here with a heart full of zeal and sincerity. They are coming from faraway places to see and to learn. Their inner being is fresh and tender, and they will be easily influenced. Hence, we must be careful concerning the impression they will receive while they are here. Of course, they also bear some responsibility. If they receive mercy, God will arrange for them to be in positive situations, but if they are not those who receive mercy, then God needs to be merciful to them. Nevertheless, we must be responsible for the kind of influence we have on others.</p>
<p>We cannot rest or be at peace and think that the adversary, who has been damaging the building up of the church for the past two thousand years, will cease his work. He will not stop. The authority of darkness will try its best to damage and to spread negative, dead, and inaccurate information. The enemy will try to blind the saints so that they are deceived into thinking that every situation is the same, and they will not receive mercy. Therefore, I am very burdened. We cannot govern or control any situation. We can only say that we need God&rsquo;s mercy. We all should pray concerning this matter. We should also learn to have a serious attitude. We must be careful not to give the saints the wrong impression.</p><h2 class="head1">LEARNING THE LESSONS FROM OUR TRIALS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Needing to Pass through Trials<br />
in Following the Lord</h2>
<p>The saints who are serving are still passing through trials. For this reason, many do not have a sense of freshness concerning spiritual matters, including their service and spiritual pursuit. This is something we all experience in following the Lord, because we all must pass through trials. The truths we know need to be tested, our way needs to be tested, and our faith also needs to be tested. When we are saved, we sense the sweetness of God&rsquo;s salvation, and our feeling is fresh. Furthermore, we have the full assurance that God exists, that the Lord is our Savior, that we have been forgiven of our sins, and that we have been regenerated. These things seem to be more real to us than physical things. However, we will eventually be tested. God will test us, and He will let us test His salvation. He will even allow us to test Him.</p>
<p>Every person who is saved has doubts concerning God. After I had been saved for some time, I was tested and began questioning myself. I asked whether I made a mistake in believing and whether God was dependable. Although I testified often concerning God&rsquo;s answering my prayers, I still had questions concerning God, Christ, and salvation. I believe that every brother and sister has experienced this. Perhaps some are still on a &ldquo;honeymoon&rdquo; and have not had such a situation. Nevertheless, we all will pass through trials and experience a time of testing.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Being Different in Our Way, Living, and Pursuit</h2>
<p>In many aspects we are different from those in Christianity because of our need to depend on faith. Our way is different from the way taken by those in Christianity, our living is different from their living, and the spiritual goal that we pursue is different from theirs. These three matters are rather serious. Our way, living, and pursuit differ from the way, living, and pursuit of those in Christianity.</p>
<p>Most people in Christianity believe in God&rsquo;s existence, Christ&rsquo;s redemption, and man&rsquo;s salvation. In addition to this general faith, we have seen the way of the church. We are taking a way that is rejected by Christianity; hence, our way is different from theirs. This is the first difference. Next, we are living a life of faith. I can testify that we live a life that is simple, yet it is a life of uncertainty. We have no assurance of our future. We do not know how we will live next year. Even though we have no assurance concerning our future, we continue to live this way before the Lord. We are willing to live a life of faith because we know the object of our faith. We are here to please the Lord. Otherwise, we would not be able to live a life in poverty or simplicity.</p>
<p>Furthermore, we are pursuing to know the Lord and to allow Him to grow in us. We pursue to live in Him and to please Him so that when we see Him face to face, we will not be put to shame. However, most Christians do not have such considerations. They know that in their Christian life they should not commit sins, especially gross sins, and this is sufficient for them.</p>
<p>The way we take, the life we live, and what we pursue are all matters of faith. These matters cause us to go through trials so that we can know whether our way of faith, our life of faith, and our pursuit of faith are right. Some believers think that it is not necessary to have this kind of faith in order to be a pious Christian. They think that it is sufficient to pursue an overcoming life, growth in the Lord, and spiritual maturity. There are also believers who think that it is not necessary to live by faith or that it is wrong to experience poverty when serving the Lord. Even though such thoughts seem correct, intrinsically it is a matter of our attitude and our intention.</p>
<p>In 1935, after the first crisis in the church in Shanghai, I was tested severely with not only trials but also temptations. The church in Shanghai began meeting in 1927. In 1934 a crisis broke out, and all the burdens fell on my shoulders. I did not suffer because of the crisis, but I suffered because the senior co-workers, both brothers and sisters, all left Shanghai when the difficulties began. Consequently, the burdens and the situations that they left fell on my shoulders.</p>
<p>Even though I was thirty years old at the time, the entire situation fell on my shoulders, requiring that I deal with it. When I saw the situation, I could not but question the way I took and the object of my faith; I was tested. I asked myself whether this was the right way. I knew that I was called by the Lord, but was this the way to serve Him? At the time I felt that this way was extremely difficult. There was no one who could bear my burden or share the responsibility with me. I was tested. At the same time, the object of my faith was severely tested. I questioned why I should walk on this way, why I should serve in this way, why I should live in this way, and why I should pursue in this way. Every aspect of my being was tried. However, as a result of this testing, I decided, &ldquo;Since I am a man, I must be a Christian, and since I am a Christian, I must take the way of the church. If I would not take this way, I would not be an absolute Christian, and if I am not an absolute Christian, I should not be a Christian at all.&rdquo; My choice was clear.</p>
<p>I saw clearly that I could not shrink back, even though I had passed through many trials. As a conclusion I said, &ldquo;If I am a Christian, I must be absolute to serve the Lord, and if I am one who serves the Lord, I must take the way of the church, live a life of faith, and have a spiritual pursuit. I cannot take another way, live another kind of life, or have another pursuit.&rdquo; While I was passing through trials, I made up my mind that no matter how poor or how difficult my life would be, I would take this way. Even if others would not take this way, I would press forward and take this way.</p>
<p>In 1943 I was imprisoned by the Japanese army and entered into a very deep and dark valley of the shadow of death. It was an unprecedented time of trials. To this day I have not been tried in such a way. The livelihood of my family was in question. I was sick in bed and could not take care of my children; my family was in a destitute situation. On one hand, I was being tried, but on the other hand, I was testing this way. I doubted whether this was the right way and whether I was right concerning this way. Otherwise, how could I have been in such a situation?</p>
<p>During my years of service to the Lord, I have sensed the Lord&rsquo;s presence. His presence was especially strong in 1942. At this time the church in Chefoo had a great revival, and the work was blessed. However, the trials that came in 1943 really caused me to question. One day as I was reading the Bible, I came across four small words that opened my understanding. In 1 Corinthians 4:11 the apostle Paul said, &ldquo;Until the present hour we both hunger and thirst, and are naked and buffeted and wander without a home.&rdquo; I was very familiar with this portion of the Bible. However, when I came to the four words <em>until the present hour</em> I received a fresh revelation and realized that I was taking the right way. The apostle said that he was suffering &ldquo;until the present hour.&rdquo; Could I expect less than the apostle? On that day in the winter of 1943, I put an end to my questions. From that day until today, for sixteen years, I have never tested this way again.</p><h2 class="head2">Learning to Know Mercy in Faith</h2>
<p>Many of you are passing through trials, and you are testing your faith. Your way, your living, and your pursuit have become trials to you, and you are being tested in these matters. During such times of trials and testing, we are not fresh. In our experience we enter into darkness. This darkness is not bad; it is good. There is bad darkness, and there is beneficial darkness. This is similar to death, which can be either bad or beneficial. The death we have in Adam is bad, but the death we have in Christ is beneficial. The Lord leads us through trials in which we experience darkness that is beneficial. As we pass through this darkness, we must learn the lesson of faith. Furthermore, we must also learn the lesson of mercy. While we are being tested, we must live more and more by faith. The more trials we pass through, the more we live by faith. We must also learn the lesson of not looking at ourselves but of boasting in the Lord&rsquo;s selection and mercy. We cannot claim any credit for our standing before the Lord, because it is only by His mercy that we are still here. It is the Lord&rsquo;s mercy that we have chosen to take this way and to have this living and pursuit. It is His mercy that enables us to make the right choice. Without His mercy, we would be like so many other people who have made the wrong choice.</p>
<p>It is not that we have foresight and therefore know what to choose. It is altogether of the Lord&rsquo;s mercy that we can stand and continue on this way. The Lord leads us through trials so that we will learn lessons and so that we will know that everything is altogether a matter of faith and mercy. After the trials we will know that our relationship with the saints also depends on the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, not on our leading or our labor. I cannot say that you are taking this way because of my leading. I may be able to lead you for a period of time, but without the Lord&rsquo;s mercy, you will not remain on this way for the rest of your life. Whether or not you stay on this way will only be the result of receiving mercy. Even continuous contact will not ensure that someone will remain on this way. We may be able to encourage others to take this way through such contact, but this will not cause them to continue on this way. We must realize that the human hand is not able to restore a person who has a problem with this way. In the past we have not been able to help those who had problems taking this way, in spite of our attempts to help them understand. All our attempts at restoring people are useless. It is altogether a matter of whether or not a person receives mercy.</p>
<p>We must see that this way is entirely of faith and mercy. We should never think that this way is merely a matter of leaving the denominations. There is no position for those who take this way; moreover, those who take this way will be tested. Not only will we be tested, but this way will be tested by us. We have to test this way. It is not enough for others to lead us on this way, nor is it enough for others to contact us, because we will still be tested. I believe that many saints have been tried and that they also have asked whether this way is trustworthy and true and whether the Lord wants them to take this way or do something else. Those who are tested must live by faith, and they must receive mercy. After we are tested, we will be able to declare, &ldquo;I will take this way. Whether or not I have companions to fellowship with, the object of my faith is directly related to me. Even if others do not take this way, I will still take it. I will not be influenced by others.&rdquo; Only in this way can we pass the test and touch faith in simplicity.</p>
<p>Only those who know mercy can say that their taking this way is related directly to God and that even if the apostle Paul did not take this way, they would still take it. The saints who know mercy can say, &ldquo;I know whom I have believed&rdquo; (2 Tim. 1:12). We should never think that because we have heard this word, we must take this way. Only a handful of people are able to take this way. The way of following the Lord is in faith, and it is according to His mercy.</p>
<p>After we are tested, we will know when others have begun to take this way, how far they have gone, and whether they have been tried. We will know whether they are taking this way due to others&rsquo; influence or due to their relationship with God. Many people have taken this way because they were influenced and helped by others, but in the end they must have a direct relationship with God in order to remain on this way. Otherwise, they will not be able to continue without wavering. The only way is to learn the lesson of faith and to know mercy. There is no other way.</p><h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FOURTEEN</h1>
<h1 class="title">THE STANDING BOARDS AND THE TABERNACLE<br />
IN THE BUILDING UP<br />
OF GOD&rsquo;S DWELLING PLACE</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 25:8; 26:15, 26-30; 29:45-46; 40:17</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE CENTRAL REVELATION IN GENESIS AND EXODUS</h2>
<p>When we read Genesis and Exodus, we need to pay attention to the central revelation of God. Without this revelation, it is not easy to see God&rsquo;s intention in Genesis. Jacob is the father of the children of Israel. The crucial point with Jacob is that he saw Bethel in the revelation that he received from God (28:17-19). Many years later God told Jacob to go to Bethel (35:1). <em>Bethel</em> means &ldquo;the house of God.&rdquo; God wanted to obtain His house with Jacob, His chosen one. While Jacob was fleeing from his brother, he was homeless. However, God did not lead him to care for his own house but rather to care for God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<p>God led Jacob to focus on Bethel, which is the house of God. The main item in relation to Jacob is God&rsquo;s house. God chose Jacob out of thousands of people in order to gain a house. God wanted to obtain a dwelling place on earth through Jacob. In other words, God desires to gain a dwelling place, a house, on earth through His chosen ones.</p>
<p>In the beginning of Exodus Jacob&rsquo;s descendants, the children of Israel, were slaves in Egypt. However, God wanted to deliver them out of the land of Egypt. The children of Israel were enslaved in Egypt and were oppressed and afflicted. They needed God&rsquo;s deliverance. Perhaps they never thought of God&rsquo;s house. They thought of their need, but perhaps they did not consider God&rsquo;s need. They may have thought only of their problems, that is, that they were oppressed and afflicted. They did not know that God wanted to obtain a dwelling place on earth. They knew that God cared for them and would deliver them from the land of Egypt, but they did not know why God would deliver them. Not only were the children of Israel ignorant of the reason for God&rsquo;s deliverance, but even Bible readers throughout the generations have not seen the purpose of God&rsquo;s deliverance.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD DESIRING TO DWELL<br />
IN THE MIDST OF THE CHILDREN OF ISRAEL,<br />
TO HAVE A DWELLING PLACE AMONG THEM</h2>
<p>I received the Lord&rsquo;s salvation before I was twenty years old; that was thirty years ago. Since then I have been pursuing to know the Bible. I have read many expositions and commentaries on the book of Exodus, but I have yet to read a book that explicitly says that God delivered the Israelites out of Egypt so that He might obtain a dwelling place among them. I have never read a book that says this clearly. Sometimes there may be one or two sentences in a book that elude to such a purpose, but not in a clear way. We must see that the main reason God delivered the Israelites out of Egypt was not only because they were suffering oppression and affliction. God delivered the Israelites out of Egypt because He intended to build a dwelling place among them.</p>
<p>Exodus 25:8 says that God desired to dwell in the midst of the children of Israel. After God delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt, they crossed the Red Sea and journeyed to the foot of Mount Sinai. There God told them that He wanted to dwell among them. God said, &ldquo;I will dwell in the midst of the children of Israel, and I will be their God. And they shall know that I am Jehovah their God, who brought them out of the land of Egypt, that I might dwell in the midst of them; I am Jehovah their God&rdquo; (29:45-46). God seemed to be saying that He delivered the children of Israel so that He might obtain a dwelling place, a house, in their midst. However, we should never think that the tabernacle was the extent of the house of God. The tabernacle was only a sign, a symbol. We must see that God&rsquo;s house was Israel. God did not want to dwell in the tabernacle. God wanted to dwell in the midst of the children of Israel. In other words, the children of Israel were God&rsquo;s house.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD DELIVERING US OUT OF THE WORLD<br />
FOR A POSITIVE AND GLORIOUS PURPOSE</h2>
<p>The delivery of the children of Israel out of Egypt is a type in the Old Testament. As God&rsquo;s chosen ones, we are today&rsquo;s Israel. We are God&rsquo;s people. God delivered us out of the world, just as He delivered the children of Israel out of Egypt. Before we were saved, we felt that we were desolate and suffering in the world because our life was vain and without hope. But God saved us. God saved us out of the world not merely to deliver us from the afflictions of the world. He saved us for a positive and glorious goal. God saved us because He wants us to be built up to become His house, the church. God desires that we be built up to be His house.</p>
<p>After the Israelites left Egypt, they received a revelation from God at the foot of Mount Sinai, and according to that revelation they built a tabernacle as God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This signifies that the children of Israel were built up as God&rsquo;s house. On the first day of the first month in the second year, the tabernacle was erected, and the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle. This was God coming to dwell in the tabernacle. God dwelt in the midst of the children of Israel. The first chapter of Exodus speaks of the Israelites being slaves in Egypt, and the last chapter speaks of the Israelites being God&rsquo;s dwelling place. This is a very clear picture. Exodus uses forty chapters to present this picture. In chapter 1 the Israelites were ill-treated in the hand of Pharaoh. They were enslaved and making bricks for Pharaoh&rsquo;s cities. However, by the last chapter of Exodus, they were the glorious dwelling place of God. God dwelt in their midst, and the glory of God filled their midst.</p>
<p>We think that God rescued us from afflictions and disasters so that our lives would be meaningful. However, this is not God&rsquo;s goal. God has a glorious and positive goal related to His salvation. He intends to build us up to be His dwelling place, His house, so that He can fill this house for His expression.</p><h2 class="head1">THE GLORY OF JEHOVAH FILLING THE TABERNACLE</h2>
<p>All saved ones can testify that God&rsquo;s presence is in the meetings of the church. Of course, we also have God&rsquo;s presence when we pray and when we read the Bible. However, we know that those experiences cannot equal the presence of God that we experience in the meetings of the church. When we pray, we have the Lord&rsquo;s presence. However, when the church gathers together to pray, we experience the glory of Jehovah filling the tabernacle. Sometimes we do not remember the message we heard in a meeting, but we know that we touched the presence of God, and thus the glory of Jehovah filled our midst.</p>
<p>After a meeting we often sense that the world has no power over us and that sin has lost its ground in us. Moreover, we are able to live in the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Then after two or three days, we gather again for another meeting, and again we see something glorious and touch something real. This kind of experience does not happen only in the large meetings. We often have such experiences. When the condition of the church is normal, the church is full of the Lord&rsquo;s presence. Then even if there are no meetings, we can still sense that the saints have been built up to be the glorious house of God. The church has an atmosphere that causes people to sense that God is present.</p>
<p>Hence, if someone is seeking God, we should be bold to say, &ldquo;Go to the meetings of the church!&rdquo; When Christians meet together in the Lord&rsquo;s name, the people who go into their midst meet God. This happens not only in the large meetings. Even when three or five saints gather together to speak for God, people sense that God is in their midst. This is a wonderful condition, because the glory of Jehovah fills our midst.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Raising Up of the Tabernacle</h2>
<h2 class="head3">The Standing of the Boards</h2>
<p>In Exodus the glory of Jehovah filled the tabernacle after the tabernacle was raised up. The erecting of the tabernacle depended upon one crucial matter&mdash;the standing of the boards. The tabernacle had a total of forty-eight boards: twenty boards on the south, twenty boards on the north, six boards on the west, and two boards for the corners in the rear (26:18, 20, 22-23). Each board was ten cubits in length and one and a half cubits in width (vv. 15-16). The forty-eight boards had to stand and also be united.</p>
<p>The boards were able to stand firm because each board had two tenons, and under each tenon was a socket, which was made of a talent of silver (vv. 17, 19, 21, 24-25; 38:27). Under the two tenons of each board there were two sockets, and each socket had a hole to contain a tenon. In this way the boards were able to stand firm. The silver sockets are very meaningful. Silver signifies the work of Christ&rsquo;s redemption, and the sockets signify stability for standing. We can stand firm before God because of Christ&rsquo;s redemption. The redemption of Christ is our foundation. It is the solid base for our standing in God&rsquo;s dwelling place. We are standing firmly on the foundation of Christ&rsquo;s redemption.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Uniting of the Boards</h2>
<p>Not only were the boards standing; they were also united. The tabernacle was erected by means of the standing and uniting of the boards. Once the tabernacle was erected, it became God&rsquo;s house. A house cannot be called a house until it is built. Piles of wood and stone are merely materials; they are not yet a house. Only when the materials are standing and joined will they become a house. The glory of God filled the tabernacle because the tabernacle was built up. This shows that God&rsquo;s glory will be in the midst of God&rsquo;s children when they are built up. The building does not involve individuals but all God&rsquo;s children. They are joined together not by human organization but by God. God&rsquo;s life and nature join God&rsquo;s children together.</p>
<p>Every board was one and a half cubits in width. This is very meaningful. The numbers three and five are basic numbers related to God&rsquo;s building. Genesis 6 contains the record of the building of the ark by Noah. The ark was three hundred cubits long, fifty cubits wide, and thirty cubits high (v. 15). The basic numbers of these dimensions are three and five. The dimensions of the tabernacle are also composed of these basic numbers. For instance, there were ten curtains divided into two sets of five (Exo. 26:1, 3), and the depth of the tabernacle was thirty cubits. Both the curtains and the depth of the tabernacle contain the basic numbers of three and five. Concerning the standing boards, the length of each board was ten cubits. Ten is a multiple of five. For example, the ten virgins consisted of five who were foolish and five who were prudent (Matt. 25:1-2). Hence, ten cubits is made up of two sets of five. Each board was one and a half cubits wide, which is half of three. This means that a board is not a complete unit. This is similar to a couple. Neither a husband nor a wife is a complete unit; they are halves. Only when the husband and the wife are joined together can they be a complete unit.</p>
<p>We need to see that as boards, none of us is complete. You are one and a half cubits, and I am one and a half cubits. We need to be matched with another to make a complete unit. The number of the boards in the tabernacle was not an odd number but an even number: twenty boards on the south, twenty on the north, six in the rear, and two extra boards for the corners. All the boards were coupled; they were matched with others. It is wonderful that three and five are the basic numbers in God&rsquo;s building. This indicates that we are not complete units. We are one and a half cubits. We are only half a unit. We need a brother or a sister to match us. In the tabernacle no one can stand alone; all are in twos. There were not twenty-one boards nor were there nineteen boards. There were twenty boards, six boards, and two boards. All the boards were in pairs. This means that we cannot stand alone. We need to be matched with another board.</p><h2 class="head2">The Principle of Coordination</h2>
<p>Furthermore, in order for a board to stand, it cannot depend on only one tenon. If there were only one tenon, the board would spin, but with two tenons, the board could not spin. Hence, in the matter of building, there is the need for two; one cannot work alone. This is coordination. If you stand by yourself, you will turn toward the east today, toward the south tomorrow, and toward the west the next day. After turning a full circle, you will turn toward the south again, and after a few days you will turn again. You will always be turning. A Christian who is always turning cannot be built up with others. When there are two tenons, you have no way to turn. Therefore, you must stand with another. You cannot serve by yourself. When the Lord Jesus sent out His disciples, He sent them out two by two (Luke 10:1). The Lord did not want His disciples to go out by themselves.</p>
<p>Our coordination should also be in twos. We cannot be at peace if someone is serving alone, because we are afraid that he will begin to turn. When two persons are in coordination, one cannot turn without the other turning too. There is no way for one to turn if the other refuses to turn. They both must stand firm. Not only so, you must remember that you are only a half. You are only one and a half cubits, not three cubits. You need another person, another one and a half cubits, to be added to you so that you become three cubits. When one sister is added to another sister, the two become three cubits. They become a complete unit. If they are separated, they will each be one and a half cubits. This is a half unit, not a complete unit. For this reason, the Holy Spirit has revealed to us that we must be in coordination.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Gold Overlaying Wood</h2>
<p>In order for us to coordinate, based on the foundation of Christ&rsquo;s redemption, we must be overlaid with gold. This is seen with the boards, which were made of acacia wood and overlaid with gold. This is the only way for us to manifest the proper coordination. Wood denotes the human nature, and gold denotes the divine nature. Gold overlaying wood signifies the mingling of the human nature and the divine nature so that the human nature can express the divine nature. This means that man lives the life of God. In other words, there is a human living that expresses the glory of God. The boards, which were made of acacia wood, needed to be overlaid with gold in order to be joined. Therefore, when we experience the mingling of God and man, that is, the mingling of God&rsquo;s life with our life and God&rsquo;s nature with our nature, we can be coordinated with the other standing boards.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Gold Rings</h2>
<p>The standing boards were also united by gold rings (Exo. 26:29). Gold signifies the divine nature. The uniting rings show that the divine nature is the uniting power among us. We are made of wood. In order to experience the uniting rings in our human nature, we need the divine life and nature to be manifested in us. The more we love the Lord, live before Him, and fellowship with Him, the more He will be manifested in us. Thus, the gold rings, the divine uniting power, are manifested in us and enable us to be united with others.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Bars</h2>
<p>There was also the need for bars. On each side of the tabernacle there were five bars for the boards. The bars were made of acacia wood overlaid with gold (vv. 26-29). The five bars formed three lines, and the middle bar passed through the center of the boards from end to end. The bars were arranged such that two bars formed a line at the top, two bars formed a line below, and one bar passed through the middle. Hence, the numbers three and five are also involved with the bars. Three signifies the three-one God. Five is four plus one, signifying the created man plus the Creator being able to bear spiritual responsibility.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MINGLING OF GOD AND MAN</h2>
<p>The uniting of the boards lies entirely in the gold. The boards were overlaid with gold, and the bars that were overlaid with gold united the boards. The boards were united by means of the gold. Likewise, we can be united to be the church, the house of God, because we have the nature of God. We are &ldquo;wooden boards.&rdquo; If we did not have the divine nature, He could not be expressed in us. If we live according to our human nature, according to the flesh, we will eventually be scattered. When we live in the divine nature, we are overlaid with gold. In this way, we are full of gold, full of the expression of God&rsquo;s glory, His nature. We must remember that we are all united in oneness by the gold of God&rsquo;s divine nature. As a result, not only are we standing, but we are also united.</p>
<p>According to Exodus 27:1-8, the bronze altar in the outer court did not have any silver. The bronze altar had only bronze. Bronze signifies God&rsquo;s judgment. The hangings of fine twined linen in the outer court were held and joined by hooks and connecting rods, both of which were made of silver (vv. 9-17). This means that Christ&rsquo;s redemption, which issues out of God&rsquo;s righteous judgment, links us to God&rsquo;s righteousness, signified by the linen, for God&rsquo;s testimony and expression. In other words, Christ&rsquo;s redemption as our foundation brings us into God&rsquo;s nature and mingles us with God so that we can be overlaid with gold. Then we can have the building. It is not enough for us to be redeemed by the Lord and have a little change in our behavior and our living, because God still does not have His building. We must be overlaid with gold. We must let God mingle Himself with us. As we are overlaid with gold, the divine and human natures are mingled together. On the one hand, we stand on Christ&rsquo;s redemption as our foundation, and on the other hand, we are mingled with the divine nature. This is the way for us to become a structure, God&rsquo;s building, in which there is God&rsquo;s presence and His glory.</p>
<p>If we would express God and be full of His glory and presence, we must be joined to Him. The more we are joined to Him, the more we will have His presence. When we are all joined by the divine nature, we will be filled with the presence and the glory of God. Even though we have the human nature, we will live in the divine nature because we are overlaid with gold. We will be human beings who live by God&rsquo;s life and nature. The more we live in the divine life and nature, the more we will have the atmosphere and element of gold filling our midst. Furthermore, by means of the gold we will be joined into one to become God&rsquo;s dwelling place. Then God&rsquo;s glory will fill our midst. This is the building up of the church, and this is also the presence of God.</p>
<p>Then whoever comes into our midst will sense the glory of Jehovah. When they contact us, they will acknowledge that God is among us and that this is God&rsquo;s dwelling place.</p></body></html>
