   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LESSON TWO KNOWING THAT WE ARE SAVED 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In lesson 1 we considered nineteen aspects of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some of these aspects include being forgiven, reconciled to God, made alive, set free, and being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But our salvation does not consist of merely these aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We also need to help new believers know the kind of persons we have become after being saved.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There are at least eight points related to this matter of our salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>THE NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Second Corinthians 5:17 says that if anyone is in Christ, he is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We know that the universe is the old creation of God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although there are many different items in the old creation, they do not have God s element within.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Even though they were created by God, they are not mingled or united with God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>They were created by God, not begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>They have been created by God s power, not begotten of God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They were out of God s hand, not out of His nature.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But the new creation is completely different.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Within the new creation there is the element of God because the new creation comes from the union and mingling of God with the created ones.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The new creation was created by God and also begotten of God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whereas the old creation was based on God s power, the new creation is based on God s life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God created the old creation with His infinite power, but He begot the new creation with His eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The old creation is old because it did not have the element of God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It was defiled by sin and corrupted by Satan, thereby becoming old.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The new creation is new because God s element of newness has been added to it.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Everything of God is new and eternally fresh.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Therefore, in eternity future the New Jerusalem will exist forever and ever.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Every believer has God s element mingled with him and, therefore, is a new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Although the new creation has the element of God s power, the emphasis is on God s life, not on His power.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>God regenerated us with the life of His resurrection power, thereby causing us to become the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, the old things in us have passed away and have become new.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>CHILDREN OF GOD</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Since we are begotten of God, we are surely the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>John 1:12 says, As many as received Him, to them He gave the authority to become children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Everyone who receives the Lord Jesus is not only saved; he also receives authority from the Lord, and this authority is of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have received a life from the Lord, and this life becomes the authority for us to become the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>First John 3:1 says, Behold what manner of love the Father has given to us, that we should be called children of God; and we are.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We are all children of our natural parents, and at the same time, many of us also have children.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We know that the relationship between children and parents is altogether a relationship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This relationship gives unlimited rights to the children.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The rights that the children enjoy before their parents are unlimited.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>As long as it is within the ability of the parents, there is nothing they will not do for their children.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Not only so, the character, natural disposition, and life of the parents are in their children.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means all that the parents are and all that the parents have belong to the children.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This also applies to the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>As those who have been saved and have become the children of God, we have received all that God is and all that God has as our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We have inherited what God is, and also we have inherited what God has.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>God Himself and all that He has are our portion.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Once we are saved, we become this kind of person.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Previously we were God s enemies, but now we are God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>In the past we had nothing to do with God and could not receive an inheritance from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>All we could do was accept His judgment and His condemnation.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>But now we have become God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have not only escaped His judgment and condemnation, but we have also received God Himself and all that God has as our inheritance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>MEMBERS OF GOD S HOUSEHOLD</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>A child is a member of a family.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We who have been saved are not only children begotten of God but also members of God s household.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Ephesians 2:19 says that we are members of the household of God.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, this is not the experience of many believers.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Many times when a person is brought to salvation to become a child of God, he does not have a home in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This can be compared to people who give birth to a child but who have no home for the child.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, the child is taken to a child-care center or to an orphanage.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The result of our bringing people to salvation may also be the same as sending them to a child-care center or to an orphanage.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This result is because the ones who preach the gospel do not have the church as their home.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Since they do not have such a home, the children they beget cannot be taken to a home.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If they had a home in reality, when the child was born, he would be born into a home and spontaneously become a member of a family.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Everyone admits that the household of God spoken of in Ephesians 2:19 is the church of God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>First Timothy 3:15 says, The house of God, which is the church of the living God.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We should never think that after a person is saved, the church is a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Those who are not properly living in the church are not in the house of God, even though they have the life of God and have become God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, once we are saved, we should properly live in the church as members of God s household.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is truly a blessing for a child to have a home.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The children in a home are often the most blessed.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The riches of the home are their portion.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Because it is their home, they can even enjoy things that their parents would not use for themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>It is truly a pitiful situation if a child does not have a home.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>It is especially a blessing for little children to have a home.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>This also applies to God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We should never be those who are saved, have become God s children, and yet are a homeless people.</S>
