   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Creation through the Word</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The creation came into being through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I like the way the Recovery Version of John renders verse 3.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>All things came into being through Him, and apart from Him not one thing came into being which has come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What does it mean that all things came into being through Him and that apart from Him nothing has come into being?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It simply means that apart from Him nothing has existence.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>One day, through the Word, so many things came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We may say that, in a sense, God did not make anything, for there was no need for Him to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He simply said, Being, and everything had being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>According to our human concept, creation requires a certain amount of labor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>However, in God s creation there was no labor, only speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When God said, Let there be light, light came into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>When He said, Let there be an expanse, the expanse came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When He said, Let the dry land appear, the dry land appeared.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>An atheist would say that this is nonsense, because he does not believe in God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But we believe in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We not only believe in God, but also in the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Through Him as the Word all things came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The principle is the same in the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Although we are men of the old creation, the Bible tells us that we must become men of the new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>According to our human concept, this type of change requires a great deal of work.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, it does not require very much work at all; it is accomplished through the Word, which is Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>If a man will say, Lord Jesus, he becomes a new man even before the words have escaped his lips.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>By simply saying the word Lord something not being comes into being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Abraham believed in the God who calls the things not being as being Rom 4:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>God did not do anything; He just called.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Although once there was no such thing as light, when God said, Light, light sprang into existence.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is God s creation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If He did not create in this way, He might be the same as we are.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>But God is not as we are God is God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Everything came into being through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As long as you have the Word, you have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This should strengthen and confirm our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Whenever you take the Word, something not being comes into being.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Do not say that you are weak, for the more you say that you are weak, the weaker you become, simply because you say that you are weak.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, if, by taking the Word, you say, I am strong, strength comes into being.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Do not say, I have no power.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The more you say you have no power, the more powerless you become.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>However, if you say, Praise the Lord that I have power through the Word, you will have power, the power that things not being will come into being through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If you are afflicted with a certain illness, do not think very much about it, but say, Through the Word I am a healthy person.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If you say this, health, which had no being, comes into being.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Sisters often come to me, saying, Brother, as sisters, we have no wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We come to you because you have wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Sisters, the more you say that you lack wisdom, the less wisdom you have.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Nevertheless, it is a lie that you lack wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Do you not have the Word?</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>As long as you have the Word you must declare, I have wisdom through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If you claim this, you will have wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We have nothing in ourselves, but we have everything through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>What is creation?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Creation is calling things not being as being through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Word is both the means and the sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>As long as you have the Word, you have the means and the sphere.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Thus, you can say, Because I have the Word as the means and the sphere, things not being can come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Learn to say, Not being as being through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>No longer am I apart from the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am in the Word and with the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, through the Word things not being come into being.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>E. Life in the Word</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Now we come to the most important point: life is in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In Him was life 1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The Him in 1:4 denotes the Word who was God and through whom all things came into being.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>In Him is life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Why did He create all things before He came to be life?</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Because in order for Him to be received as life there was the need of a receptacle, a receiver.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Suppose He had not created anything, yet came to be life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>To whom would He be life?</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Although He might be life, there would have been no receiver for Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Thus, before He came to be life He created the heavens, the earth, and man with a spirit to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Zechariah 12:1 says that the Lord stretcheth forth the heavens, and layeth the foundation of the earth, and formeth the spirit of man within him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Thus, the heavens are for the earth, the earth is for man, and man was made with a spirit to receive God.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Now the Word can come as life to be received by the man whom He created.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Creation produced the receptacle for life.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>We have seen that life is in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Life can only be found in the expression of God.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>The Word, which is the expression and explanation of God, contains God as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>When we receive the Word, we receive the life within it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Both the Word and the life are God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Word is the expression of God, and the life is the very content of God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>When we hear the Word, we realize that God is expressed and explained; when we receive the Word, we receive God s very content as life and are thereby born of God and become the children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The life in the Word is the very content of God.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Since verse 2 refers to the creation in Genesis 1, the mention of life in verse 4 should refer to the life indicated by the tree of life in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This is confirmed by John s mention of the tree of life in Revelation 22.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Since life is in Him, so He is life John 11:25; 14:6 , and came that man might have life 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Man was made as a vessel to contain God as life.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>However, by creation he was merely an empty vessel; he did not have genuine life.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>The created life of man is not genuine; genuine life is the divine life, which is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>What kind of life did you have before you received Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>It was, at best, a temporary life; it was not a permanent life, an everlasting life.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Although it was an instant life, it was not a constant one.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Before we received Christ we were uncertain just how long our instant life would endure.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Thus, in a sense, before we were saved we did not have life.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>The life in Christ is eternal, constant, and permanent.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>All men need such a life, the divine and uncreated life that is in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>This life is for man, and man is the receiver of this life.</S>
