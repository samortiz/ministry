[1]  Message Two The Highest Standard of Morality Scripture Reading: Luke 1:31-32, 35, 68-69, 75, 78-79; 2:40, 52 We need to understand clearly what is meant by the highest standard of morality : The highest standard of morality is the standard of life required by God a life in which the divine attributes are expressed in the human virtues Matt 5:48.
[2]  The highest standard of morality is the living of the One the Lord Jesus Christ as the Man-Savior whose life was a composition of God with the divine attributes and man with the human virtues Luke 1:35.
[3]  In the Gospel of Luke we see the kind of man that God intended to have in Genesis 1 and 2 Luke 8:39; Gen 1:26-27; 2:7, 9: God s intention was to have a God-man Luke 1:68-69, 78-79: The man in Genesis 1 was merely a God-created man, not yet a God-man vv.
[4]  Message Three The Man-Savior s God-man Living and Ministry Scripture Reading: Luke 1:35; 2:40, 49, 51-52; 3:21-22;
[5]  5:15-16; 9:51-56; 10:25-42; 23:42-43 The Gospel of Luke unveils the God-man living of the Man-Savior as typified by the meal offering Lev 2:1-16: The conception of the Savior was God s incarnation the mingling of God and man as typified by the meal offering , constituted not only by the divine power but also of the divine essence added to the human essence, thus producing the God-man of two natures divinity and humanity vv.
[6]  Fine flour, the main element of the meal offering, signifies Christ s humanity, which is fine, perfect, tender, balanced, and right in every way, with no excess and no deficiency; this signifies the beauty and excellence of Christ s human living and daily walk Lev 2:1; Luke 23:14: He grew up in a family that was filled with the knowledge and love of God s holy Word, as indicated by Mary s receiving of God s word as the Lord s slave and her poetic praise filled with God s word 1:37-38, 46-55.
[7]  Message Four The Reproduction of the God-man Scripture Reading: Luke 1:31-32, 35; 6:35; John 3:6b;
[8]  The reproduction of the God-man requires that we be reborn of the pneumatic Christ in our spirit and that we be transformed by the pneumatic Christ in our soul John 3:6b; 2 Cor 3:18; Phil 1:21a: The first step in the reproduction of the God-man is that we must be reborn of the pneumatic Christ in our spirit with His divine life and nature John 3:6b: The regenerating Spirit is the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit the Spirit of Jesus Christ, the extract of the all-inclusive, crucified and resurrected Christ 1 Cor 15:45b; Phil 1:19b: The essence, elements, nature, and substance of Christ are all in the all-inclusive Spirit; it is by this Spirit that Christ, the God-man, is reproduced 1 John 2:20, 27; cf.
[9]  Message Five The Man-Savior and His Dynamic Salvation Scripture Reading: Luke 2:11, 30; 3:6; 19:9 The Lord Jesus Christ is the Savior Luke 2:11; John 4:42: The Lord is the Savior of fallen mankind, based upon His person and redemptive work Rom 3:24; Eph 1:6-7.
[10]  Message Six The Kingdom of God Scripture Reading: Luke 1:32-33; 4:43; 13:29; 17:21-22; 19:12 The church today is Christ s increase in life, but the eternal kingdom of God is Christ s increase in administration Dan 2:34-35, 44; Mark 4:26-29: In life Christ increases to become the church; in administration Christ increases to become the kingdom John 3:15, 29a, 30a; Dan 2:34-35, 44.
[11]  Luke 4:16-22; Acts 26:16-19 Announcing the gospel to the poor, proclaiming release to the captives and recovery of sight to the blind, and sending away in release those who are oppressed are the freedoms and blessings of the jubilee Luke 4:18-19: The word jubilee in Leviticus 25:10 means a time of shouting, or a time of the trumpeting of the ram s horn ; the trumpeting of the ram s horn signifies the preaching of the gospel as the proclaiming of liberty in the New Testament jubilee to all the sinners sold under sin that they may return to God and God s family, the household of God, and may rejoice with shouting in the New Testament enjoyment of God s salvation Luke 4:16-22; Acts 26:16-19.
[12]  Our preaching of the gospel is our blowing of the trumpet of redemption to proclaim to the world, Behold, now is the well-acceptable time; behold, now is the day of salvation, the year of jubilee 2 Cor 6:2; Isa 61:1-3: When God created man, He intended to give Himself in Christ to man as man s possession, man s inheritance Gen 2:9; 13:12-15; Psa 16:5; 90:1 ; however, man became fallen, and in the fall man lost God as his possession Gen 3:24; 4:16; Eph 2:12 and sold himself into slavery under sin, Satan, and the world John 8:34; Rom 7:14b; Gal 4:8; Titus 3:3; 1 John 5:19b .
[13]  God s New Testament salvation, accomplished by God s grace based on His redemption in Christ Rom 3:24; 5:1-2; Eph 2:8 , brings fallen man back to God as His divine possession Acts 26:18; Gal 3:14; Eph 1:14; Col 1:12; Luke 15:12-24 , releases man from slavery under sin, Satan, and the world John 8:32; Rom 6:6, 14; 8:2; Heb 2:14-15; John 12:31 , and restores man to his divine family, the household of God Gal 6:10; Eph 2:19 , that he may enjoy fellowship in God s grace 2 Cor 13:14 .
[14]  Message Eleven The Resurrection of the Man-Savior Scripture Reading: Luke 24:6-8, 25-27, 30-32, 44-46 In order for us to see the resurrection of the Man-Savior, we need the Lord Spirit to open our mind to understand the Scriptures through His enlightening Luke 24:6-8, 25-27, 30-32, 44-46; Eph 1:17-18: In order to enter into His life-dispensing resurrection, the Man-Savior died an all-inclusive death with a sevenfold status: the Lamb of God John 1:29 , a man in the flesh Rom 8:3 , a man in the old creation 1 Cor 15:45 , the bronze serpent John 3:14 , the Firstborn of all creation Col 1:15 , the Peacemaker Eph 2:15 , and a grain of wheat John 12:24 .
[15]  The Man-Savior s resurrection was God s vindication and approval of His person and His all-inclusive redemptive work by His death; His resurrection was also His success in all His achievements Acts 2:24; 3:15; 4:10; 5:30; 10:40; 13:30, 33-34, 37; 17:31; 26:8; John 10:17-18; Rom 4:25.
[16]  10:25-37; 15:3-32; 17:20-24; 24:27, 44-53 The Man-Savior s ascension was His inauguration into His heavenly office through the process of creation, incarnation, human living, crucifixion, and resurrection as God and man, as the Creator and the creature, and as the Redeemer, the Savior, and the life-giving Spirit, to execute God s administration and to carry out God s New Testament economy Luke 24:44-53; Acts 2:36; Heb 2:9; 12:2.
