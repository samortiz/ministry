   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SINGING BEING THE BEST WAY</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO NOURISH THE NEW ONES</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To teach the new ones to sing the hymns is the best way to nourish them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>May we all learn to sing hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After the time we go to someone s home to baptize him, the next time we meet in his home we can begin to teach him to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After singing only four or five times, he will be infused and nourished by the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He may have children at home.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When you sing, they may not sing, but after you leave, they will start singing.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>By singing a little, the truths in the hymns will gradually enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Singing is also the best appetizer.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If the singing at the beginning is good, then the home meeting that follows will cause the whole family to be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, the home meeting should not begin in a rigid way of social interaction.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Do not engage in meaningless small talk, such as how the weather is hot or cold and whether or not to wear warm clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Simply sing hymns and learn to teach the family to sing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The hymns among us are especially wonderful.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>As we sing, our spirits are stirred.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Singing is more effective than giving a sermon, and the result is also better.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>TEACHING NEW ONES HOW TO PRAY ACCORDING TO THE CONTENT OF THE HYMN</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After teaching the new ones to sing, you should continue to help them to pray using the phrases in the hymns.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Never have a new one repeat your prayer sentence by sentence; that is a tradition and a formality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>You may say a prayer first and then ask him to follow your way.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You may pray, Lord, thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In tenderness You sought me, weary and sick with sin Hymns, #1068 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then have him continue in prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this way you will teach him to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>DOING ALL THINGS BY THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>AND MOVING BY THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In leading a home meeting, you need to have variations, to be living and flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Do not be set and rigid.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>What we have fellowshipped here is just one of the many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are willing to learn to practice, you will become more and more skillful and flexible.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>You will know that all kinds of changes can be made as long as the spirit is living.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you lead the home meetings in such a way, I believe that the whole family of the new one will receive what is presented.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After you leave, they will reminisce and have further fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, you should never think that we are using gimmicks and wasting our effort.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As long as we have the spirit, what we do will not be in vain, and they will receive what we say.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Next, we have to lead the members of the household to learn to pick up the responsibility in the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>However, this must not be rigidly enforced.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Perhaps the next time you go, you may say, I am so happy to be here with you all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sister, can you lead us in singing this time?</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We can sing the hymn from the last time.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Brother, can you lead us to read the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We can read the section that we read last time.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Afterward, ask the wife to give a testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>It may seem as if you are talking to them; actually you are having them share the responsibility of the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The result of leading the home meeting in this way is that they will know how to meet as a home meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The most important thing is that you never allow these things to become a rigid and ritualistic practice.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Before you go to a home meeting, you must have ample and living fellowship with the Lord and have thorough confession and prayer until you are filled inwardly.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If your spirit is filled with the Lord and His word and you can sing and pray, then you are living, and whatever you do will be living.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Whatever a living person does is living; for him, even a dying business will become booming.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If a person is dead, however, even a booming business will become dead.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We must learn to practice according to this principle.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We need to pay attention to the areas in which we are not living, in which we are too rigid.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In these areas we must be alert and diligent to be exercised.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We may take the Chinese-speaking meeting in a certain locality as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>After singing a hymn in the Lord s table meeting, everyone begins to speak the hymn to one another, making the hymn so good and living.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, in the meeting for reading the Word, everyone becomes dumb and quiet, not knowing what to say.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then when it is time to read the spiritual publications, it is done stiffly and without spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The hymns are spoken, and the Word and the spiritual publications are also spoken, but why are the two speakings so different?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>This is due to habit.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Once we fall into a habit, our spirit is killed.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This is a dreadful matter.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Therefore, I hope that the brothers and sisters will be careful in whatever they do.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Do not fall into a habit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You must be living in whatever you read and always exercise the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Never think that since you often read the Bible and the spiritual publications that you know how to read them.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Once you rely on your habit, your spirit will be killed.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Only with the exercise and the release of the spirit will we be able to read in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As it is in the big meetings, so it should also be in leading the home meetings.</S>
