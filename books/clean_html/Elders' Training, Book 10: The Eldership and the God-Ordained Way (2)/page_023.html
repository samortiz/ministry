<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>For the Expression of<br>the Processed and Mingled Triune God</H2><P>This oneness is to express in His fullness the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected God, who has mingled Himself with the believers in their humanity. The oneness in the divine glory is to express the whole and entire incarnated, crucified, and resurrected God in all His fullness, that is, in all His riches. This rich God has mingled Himself with the human believers for His corporate, all-inclusive expression. Such an expression is a mingling of the incarnated, crucified, and resurrected God with all His redeemed in their humanity. This is to be one in the glory of the divine Trinity.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE ONENESS OF THE SPIRIT</H2><P>The first kind of oneness revealed in the New Testament is the oneness of the Lord's aspiration and prayer. The model for the genuine oneness was there at the time of the Lord's prayer, but the actual oneness had not yet come. On the day of Pentecost, the actual oneness came. At that time the oneness of the Lord's aspiration and prayer became the oneness of the Spirit (Eph. 4:1-6). This matter touches the depths of the holy Word. The Spirit is the very consummated Triune God. When we have the Spirit, we have the totality of the processed and consummated Triune God. The Spirit is the consummation of the Triune God, and this consummation is now one with the saved ones. This is the enlarged oneness in actuality, but still not in practicality. To have something in actuality means that it exists, that it is a fact; whereas to have something in practicality means that such a thing has become our practice, our experience. Hence, in the second kind of oneness, the oneness of the Spirit, we have only the actuality of the oneness; we do not yet have the practicality. First, this oneness was in Christ's aspiration, and it became His prayer. Then this oneness became the oneness of the Spirit, which is the oneness in actuality, the oneness in fact.</P><P>On the day of Pentecost, the Triune God mingled Himself with His redeemed people, and this mingling became the actuality of the oneness. In John 17 this oneness was there among the divine Trinity only as a model; it had not yet been enlarged. But on the day of Pentecost, the Triune God, after being processed and consummated, was poured out as the Spirit; that is, the processed and consummated Triune God mingled Himself with His chosen and redeemed people. This mingling is the actual oneness, and this actual oneness is the enlargement of the model of the oneness of the divine Trinity. In John 17 the oneness was an aspiration in Christ which Christ uttered into a prayer. On the day of Pentecost, the oneness that had been in Christ's aspiration and prayer came into being. This is the oneness of the Spirit, which is fully defined by the Apostle Paul in Ephesians chapter four. In verse 3 Paul said that we all must be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit. Then, in the subsequent verses he gave a definition of the oneness of the Spirit.</P>
