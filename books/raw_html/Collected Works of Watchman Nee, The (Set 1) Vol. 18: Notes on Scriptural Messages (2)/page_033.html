<P>Oh, what a loss to God if one brother or sister walks on the wrong path, unwilling to submit to Him! What a loss God will suffer! Being likeminded will not only make God joyful but make His joy full. Paul, in these verses, represents the Lord. God's heart and the Lord's heart can be made full of joy only when the believers are in the situation in verse 1! There are many things that can make the Lord joyful. But Christians with the same mind make Him not only joyful, but also make His joy full. To save people will make the Lord happy. To overcome will make the Lord happy too. But to be likeminded will make the Lord's joy full. We have to be likeminded to such an extent that whatever our mouth says, our hearts agree, and we practice accordingly. The words in this verse the heart. The Chinese character for the word mind has as its root the word heart. To be one is an inward and not an outward matter. God can make us one to the point that we are one not only in word but also in our heart.</P><P>The like-mindedness of some people is only in word but not in their hearts; their hearts are not one. Their attitude reveals this. People around them can tell the difference. Of course, these ones may still say with their lips that they are likeminded. This kind of like-mindedness is not what we mean. The like-mindedness that we mean is according to being "in Christ" in verse 1.</P><P>Verse 3 says, "Doing nothing by way of selfish ambition nor by way of vainglory, but in lowliness of mind considering one another more excellent than yourselves." This verse is still based on the fact that one is in Christ. Therefore, one who is in Christ should not do something and should do something. What does selfish ambition mean? It means that one has his own preference. Besides Christ he has his own aim. For example, if there is a problem between two persons and you take sides with one of them, you are wrong. You must stand only on the Lord's side for the Lord's sake; otherwise, you have selfish ambition.</P><P>What kind of glory is vainglory? There is a verse in the Bible which says, "More and more surpassingly, an eternal weight of glory" (2 Cor 4:17). Glory has a weight; it is not floating about but it is weighty. This kind of weighty glory can only be seen by God. The obvious glory—that which is easily seen by men—is vainglory. But man cannot secure this kind of glory. He can long for it but never obtain it. Who can secure anything that is vain and floating about? All man can do is constantly long for it.</P><P>Unfortunately, sometimes arguments occur among the brothers and sisters. They are either caused by selfish ambition or by some who are seeking for vainglory. One wants to be greater than the other. Both of them insist and neither will give in. In fact whoever who wants to be great cannot really become great because there are always those who are greater!</P><P>When a person is flattered and highly praised, it seems that he has received much glory. Actually, his feet are walking in vanity and emptiness. Brothers and sisters, please remember that all glory from man is vainglory. There is a story of a renowned English novelist who wrote a very famous novel. One day he was invited to a banquet by an English lord. There he met a lady who continued to praise his novel. He rose up and said to her, "You are not worthy to praise my writing." He considered the lady's compliment as shameful. Oh, who is worthy to compliment us? Apart from the Lord, no one is worthy! Whenever someone praises us, we become degraded. Should we then covet praise? If your heart is for the future, aspiring to the Lord's word of "good and faithful servant," and if you desire the crown in that day, how can you receive and seek after someone's praises today? Moreover, no one is worthy to praise us.</P><P>We should not only shun vainglory on the negative side but, on the positive side, we should in lowliness of mind consider one another more excellent than ourselves. What is lowliness? Lowliness means to leave no ground for oneself. Whoever gives ground to himself can never be lowly. All those who say that they have some kind of authority, and that they should receive something will never be lowly. To be lowly is to leave no ground for oneself. One may speak words of lowliness with his lips, but may not be lowly in his mind. Many things that pass through the lips may not necessarily pass through the heart.</P><P>How is an attitude of lowliness of mind expressed? It is expressed through "considering one another more excellent than yourselves." Considering others more excellent than yourselves is a sign or trademark of lowliness. How difficult it is to consider others more excellent than yourselves! Once I met an elderly Christian who had served the Lord many years. A brother asked him, "Of all the Christian virtues, which is the most difficult to attain?" He replied, "The most difficult thing to attain is Philippians 2:3, which says, `in lowliness of mind considering one another more excellent than yourselves.'" Indeed, being lowly in mind is most difficult! What sin caused Satan to become Satan? It was pride. He fell because he wanted to be equal with the Most High. What sin caused man to become a sinner? It was also pride. Adam thought that after eating the fruit he would be like God, discerning good and evil, so he ate and fell. Lowliness of mind is the most difficult of all the virtues to attain. Perhaps no one on earth can genuinely achieve it. It is possible to find some who have ability, eloquence, or talent. But it is very difficult to find a genuinely humble person.</P><P>How can we consider others more excellent than ourselves? One believer put it well by saying, "When I look at myself, I look at my old man; when I look at others, I look at their new man." If we recognize our nature and corruption, and we consider God's grace upon others and His transformation of others, we cannot help but consider others more excellent than ourselves. The believers in Rome should have received help from Paul, but Paul wanted to receive help from them because their faith had spread abroad. Paul wanted to receive help from the recent work God had done among them.</P>
