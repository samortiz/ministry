<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. No Third Nature Produced</H2><P>[Some Bible students and even some Bible teachers have failed to understand the matter of mingling. In ancient times there was a debate regarding the mingling of the divine essence and the human essence in the Person of the Lord Jesus. Some who misunderstood this mingling said that it caused a third nature to be produced, something which is neither divine nor human. To say that with respect to the Lord Jesus the mingling of the divine essence and the human essence produced a third nature, a nature that is neither fully human nor divine, is heretical. However, we wish to make it clear that this is not our understanding of the word "mingle." We agree with the first definition of this word given in Webster's unabridged dictionary; mingle&#151;"to combine or join (one thing with another, or two or more things together), especially so that the original elements are distinguishable in the combination." According to this definition, when two or more things are mingled together, their original natures are not lost but remain distinguishable.]</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>II. THE SPIRIT WITNESSING WITH OUR SPIRIT</H2><P>["The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are the children of God" (Rom. 8:16). Now that the Spirit is within our spirit through regeneration, He witnesses with our spirit, testifying that we are the children of God. These two spirits within us correspond to each other, together confirming that we are God's children.]</P><P>[This verse does not say that the Spirit witnesses and our spirit witnesses also. It says the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. To say that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit is deeper than saying that the Spirit and our spirit witness, for it indicates that the two spirits are one. To say that the Spirit and our spirit witness means that these spirits remain two. But to say that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit indicates that the two spirits have been mingled and have become one.]</P><P>[Regardless of how young or new you may be, if you are a child of God, the Spirit of God witnesses with your spirit. Notice that it does not say "in our spirit." If it said "in our spirit," it would mean that only the Spirit of God witnesses, but that our spirit does not witness. However, it says that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit, meaning that both witness together. The Spirit of God witnesses, and simultaneously our spirit witnesses together with Him. This is wonderful.</P><P>Some may say, "I don't feel that the Spirit of God witnesses. Where is the Spirit of God? I don't feel Him. I don't have any sensation that the Spirit of God is within me. I never saw Him and I cannot feel Him. I simply cannot sense Him." However, do you not feel that your spirit witnesses? You must realize that as long as your spirit is witnessing it means that the Holy Spirit also is witnessing. You cannot deny that your spirit witnesses within you. The Apostle Paul was very wise. He said that the Spirit witnesses with our spirit. When our spirit witnesses, that is also the witnessing of the Spirit, because the two spirits have been mingled together as one. It is very difficult for anyone to distinguish these two spirits.]</P>
