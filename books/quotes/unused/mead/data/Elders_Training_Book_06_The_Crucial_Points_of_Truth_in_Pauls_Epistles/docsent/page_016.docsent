   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A MAN IN CHRIST AND</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE SUFFICIENT GRACE OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Chapter twelve covers two very crucial points.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In verse 2 Paul said, I know a man in Christ, and in verse 9 he said, And He has said to me, My grace is sufficient for you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>At least to some degree Paul considered these points together in the writing of this chapter.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The man in Christ has a particular characteristic in that he always shows his weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although his weakness was not actually great, he still preferred to display it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In this respect he takes the Lord Jesus as his pattern.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We know that the Lord Jesus was not weak; rather He was powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>However, when He was arrested, brought to the cross, and nailed there, Christ appeared to be weak.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When Judas brought the officers from the temple to arrest Christ, Christ did not struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the eyes of the arresting ones Christ was very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If He were not weak, surely he would have fought back, not tolerating their arresting.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He did not struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He did not have any reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>That was His display of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When He was brought the long distance from Gethsemane to Golgotha, He did not resist.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That was a sign of His weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To nail a living person on a cross is not easy.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Even an animal resists being slaughtered.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus, however, apparently had no strength to struggle.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this He showed His weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Paul, as a man in Christ, was just like Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In the preceding chapters Paul reminds the Corinthians of the many ways in which they had wronged him.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>However, Paul never reacted to them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He always showed them his weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Even when they accused him of manipulating them for the sake of money, he did not fight back or react vv.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>16-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Instead he displayed his weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In verse 5 Paul said, On behalf of such a one I will boast, but on behalf of myself I will not boast, except in my weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The weakness here does not refer to the actual weakness of Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Rather it is like that of the Lord Jesus, who when He was arrested, brought to Golgotha, and put on the cross, did not do anything to resist.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Apparently He was weak, not doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If while one is suffering persecution, he reacts and struggles against it, he is not under the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, he is quite strong.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>No strong person could ever be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Every crucified one must firstly be a subdued one.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only when one is subdued could he be put on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Being subdued is a sign of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Throughout His whole life, Christ was subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>He was subdued by His opposers, and He was subdued by His environment.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Paul followed the Lord to be subdued.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The Corinthians did many unfair and unrighteous things to him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Yet Paul remained subdued, showing his weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The sign of a man in Christ is weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is opposite to our natural feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We may consider that the sign of a man in Christ would be his power and his strength.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>It seems that such a man should be very great.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>But Paul as a man in Christ appeared to be so small.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In verse 9 Paul comes to the matter of the Lord s sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>However, when he comes to this point, he comes in the way of weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In verses 7 and 8 he tells us that there was a thorn in his flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Although he entreated the Lord three times that it might depart from him, the Lord would not answer him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The thorn remained there, and Paul was eventually subdued by it.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Nearly all of the great teachers of the Bible agree that the thorn in his flesh was a disease in his body.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In Acts Paul performed mighty miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Even handkerchiefs carried away from him healed people Acts 19:12 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>However, he himself could obtain no healing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This disease was a sign to him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>A thorn is not a knife to kill you.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>A thorn is something which penetrates into your skin to bother you.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Certain diseases do not kill you but instead bother you continually.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>As an old brother I know what the thorn in the flesh is.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>How glad I would be if there were no thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, I am subdued by the thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The thorn was assigned by the Lord to subdue Paul continually.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Paul prayed three times.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This indicates that he bargained with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He may have said, Lord, why would You not take this away?</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>You used me to do miracles in a mighty way.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>In Acts 19 I could perform miracles of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But now I cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Apparently, the great miracle worker could do nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Not only could Paul not heal himself, but he would not even heal his intimate spiritual son Timothy 1 Tim 5:23 .</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Some of today s Pentecostals might pray on a handkerchief and mail it to the ailing co-worker.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>This has been done many times in this country.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Instead, Paul returned to the practices of ancient medicine.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In the ancient time, one with stomach trouble drank less water and took a little wine.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It seems that Paul had forgotten his healing miracles and had returned to the natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In 2 Timothy 4:20 Paul said, But Trophimus I left at Miletus sick.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Although he cared for his co-worker, he had no way to heal him.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This word is for those who seek after the Lord to be subdued, to learn how to be weak, that they may enjoy the sufficient grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In verse 5 Paul mentioned his weaknesses, and in verse 9 he again said that he would rather boast in his weaknesses.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>This indicates that these two portions are related and should be combined together as one crucial point.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Quite often we understand the sufficiency of grace not in the way related to the man in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>A real man in Christ is one who is not so strong in the physical, natural sense.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Rather he is always troubled.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This means he is subdued, unable to handle his situation.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>This kind of weakness affords a good opportunity for the sufficient grace of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we are not weak but are strong in any way, we do not need Christ s sufficient grace.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If I am a millionaire, I do not need your help.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>But if I am poor in every way, I need your sufficient help.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If I were so strong and rich so that I had the means to walk, act, and do everything, I would not need your help.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>I would be strong, weak in nothing, and poor in nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>In such a case how can I be a man in Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>If we are so strong, so rich, and so perfect in everything, then not only would we not need the grace of Christ, we would not even need Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>We would be sufficient in ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The Lord, in order to train us as a man in Christ to enjoy Himself as the all-inclusive Christ, surely needs to subdue us.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>In the past I have seen some strong brothers, wise and capable in every way, nearly lacking nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>I have seen such a one carefully select his wife from among the sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Eventually his selection became the best thorn for him.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Before their marriage no one knew that this sister would be such a thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>But after their marriage, she became a typical thorn, not to anyone else but to her husband.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Throughout the following years that brother became fully subdued by that thorn.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>In one sense his situation was pitiful, but in another sense it was glorious, because under that thorn that brother experienced the sufficient grace of Christ.</S>
