For example, you may see that Christ is your holiness, with emphasis on the word is. Christ is your holiness; it is not a matter of Christ making you holy. It is not Christ giving you His holiness but Christ becoming your holiness. Your eyes are opened to see that your holiness is not a work but Christ Himself. Your holiness is a person, just as your righteousness is a person. Your righteousness is not the sum of fifty or more things that you do. Christ is your righteousness. God has made Christ your righteousness. Your righteousness is a person. This is a basic revelation: Christ is your righteousness. He is your holiness. Your righteousness is a person, and your holiness is also a person. This is a glorious vision. After two months an occasion may arise for you to take up the ministry of the word. You have to tell the brothers and sisters that Christ is your holiness, and you have to show them the difference between holiness as a thing and holiness as a person. However, you must remember that you cannot count on the revelation you received two months ago. You need to ask the Lord again, "Lord, what should I say?" Only after the Lord has shown you the need to speak such a word will you have the ministry of the word. Every time God wants you to speak such a word, He has to shine once again upon the revelation you received. You have to see the same thing all over again, and you have to see it like you have never seen it before. It has to become something new in you. You are enlightened within, and you see the meaning of Christ as your holiness. When this happens, you can go to the brothers and sisters and preach to them about Christ as holiness.</p><p>What is a revelation? A revelation is a seeing of what is in Christ. The Bible is full of Christ, and revelation enables us to see all the things that are in Christ. Christ is our holiness; this is a fact. It is recorded in the Bible. But the first time we see it, it is new to us. When a man sees something by revelation, it is brand new; nothing in the world seems as new as it. It becomes vibrant with the power of life; it is fresh. Revelation is always new; it makes old things new.</p><p>We wish to point this out: Revelation not only makes the letters living, turning old things into new things and converting what is objective into something subjective; it actually makes the subjective things altogether new once more. A basic revelation turns all the objective things in Christ into subjective things in man. Before a man receives such a basic revelation, everything in Christ is objective to him. Once he receives such a revelation, all the objective things become subjective to him. But this does not mean that once this word is opened up, the job is finished. It does not mean that this one opening will supply a man with what he needs for the rest of his life. Even if we have received a revelation, we need a fresh revelation from God every time we minister the word and serve others with Christ so that the old things can once again be new.</p><p>We must remember that spiritual things have to be nurtured in the environment of revelation. God intends that all the things of Christ and concerning Christ be living in us. He intends that all these things be nurtured through revelation. His revelation can make the old things continually living in us. All the things of Christ have to be kept alive continually by revelation. Once revelation is removed, spiritual things no longer are living. You may think that you saw something in the past and that this vision qualifies you to say something today. But you will find out that you cannot give anything to others. The same is true with preaching the gospel. It is easy to remember that the Lord is the Savior and that your sins are forgiven. Sometimes you touch something when you preach the gospel. At other times, the more you speak, the less boldness you have; you feel like a dried-up bottle of glue. Clearly one speaking is with revelation, whereas the other is without revelation. Only things that are kept in the realm of revelation are living, fresh, powerful, and full of life. We must bear in mind that all spiritual things become dead the minute they are separated from revelation.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> </body></html>
