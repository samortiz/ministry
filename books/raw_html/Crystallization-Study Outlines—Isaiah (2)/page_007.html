<h1 class="title">The All-inclusive Christ<br />
in His Four Stages according to<br />
God&rsquo;s New Testament Economy<br />
(3)<br />
In the Stages of His Resurrection and Ascension</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Isa. 53:10c-12a;<br />
1 Cor. 15:45b; Col. 1:18; Acts 13:33; John 12:24;<br />
Eph. 4:8-12; 2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15</h1>
<ol class="upper-roman">
<li>Isaiah 53 speaks of the all-inclusive Christ in the stage of His resurrection&mdash;vv. 10c-11b:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The seed and the issue mentioned in Isaiah 53:10c-11b imply a great deal&mdash;the various items concerning the produce of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection revealed in the New Testament:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>In His resurrection, as the processed Christ, the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 15:45b; 2 Cor. 3:17.</li>
		<li>In His resurrection Christ, as the preeminent One, the One who has the first place in all things, became the Firstborn from the dead and the Head of the Body&mdash;Col. 1:18; Rev. 1:5a.</li>
		<li>In His resurrection Christ as the God-man, in His humanity, was begotten of God to be the firstborn Son of God&mdash;Acts 13:33; Rom. 1:3-4; 8:29.</li>
		<li>In His resurrection Christ as the resurrection life regenerated all His believers&mdash;1 Pet. 1:3.</li>
		<li>In His resurrection Christ, as the one grain of wheat, produced many grains; the many grains as the increase of Christ are the components of the one bread&mdash;the church, the Body of Christ&mdash;John 12:24; 1 Cor. 10:17; Eph. 1:22-23.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Through His life-releasing death and with His life-imparting resurrection, Christ produced a corporate seed as the issue of the travail of His soul, whom He saw in His resurrection and was satisfied&mdash;Isa. 53:10c-11b:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>As the resurrected Life-giver, the Lord Jesus produced a seed for the building up of His Body as His continuation for Jehovah&rsquo;s pleasure and Christ&rsquo;s satisfaction:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The thought of a life-giver is implied in the seed, which is produced by life.</li>
			<li>Christ as the Servant of Jehovah is the Life-giver so that He can produce a seed&mdash;v. 10b:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) In resurrection He produced a seed for His satisfaction and for the Father&rsquo;s pleasure.</li>
				<li>2) The seed produced by Christ in His resurrection is His believers for the building up of His Body as His continuation&mdash;Eph. 4:16.</li>
				</ol></li>
			<li>The corporate seed implies all the many grains, all the members of Christ&rsquo;s Body, all Christ&rsquo;s brothers, and all the sons of God&mdash;John 20:17; Heb. 2:10.</li>
			<li>The Father is pleased with the Body of Christ, which is constituted with the seed brought forth by Christ as the life-giving Spirit&mdash;1 Cor. 12:12-13; 15:45b.</li>
			<li>Christ has extended His days by producing a seed to build up His Body, and this Body is still extending&mdash;Isa. 53:10c-11:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) This seed is Christ&rsquo;s continuation for the extension of His days&mdash;Rev. 1:18a.</li>
				<li>2) Because Christ continues to live by living in us, we are the extension of His days&mdash;John 14:19; Gal. 2:20.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>This seed is for the pleasure of Jehovah, which will prosper in the hand of the resurrected Christ&mdash;Eph. 1:5, 9; Phil. 2:13; Isa. 53:10c.</li>
		<li>The resurrected Christ, the righteous One, will make the many righteous (v. 11b; Acts 13:39); this is not merely to justify us objectively but to make us righteous subjectively (2 Cor. 5:21) by living within us as the resurrection life.</li>
		<li>Christ will see the issue of the travail of His soul and be satisfied; this issue refers to the many who are justified (made righteous) by knowing Christ, for the purpose of building up the Body of Christ&mdash;Isa. 53:11; Rom. 12:4-5.</li>
		</ol></li>
	</ol></li>
<li>Isaiah 53 speaks of the all-inclusive Christ in the stage of His ascension&mdash;v. 12a:
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>In Christ&rsquo;s ascension there was a demonstration of Christ&rsquo;s victory by the sharing of the spoil, the captives, taken in Christ&rsquo;s victory&mdash;v. 12a:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>The word <em>spoil</em> in Isaiah 53:12a opens a wide window to us, enabling us to see the invisible scene of a war&mdash;Col. 2:15; 1 Pet. 3:18; Acts 2:24; Rev. 1:18:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li><em>Spoil</em> indicates that there was a war, for spoil signifies prey, and prey denotes captives taken in war&mdash;Eph. 4:8.</li>
			<li><em>Spoil</em> indicates that a war was fought and someone won that war, and the winner got the spoil, the prey, the captives.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Christ won the war and then divided the spoil with the Great and the Strong&mdash;Isa. 53:12a:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li><em>The Great</em> and <em>the Strong</em> refer to God; in the whole universe only God is great and only God is strong.</li>
			<li>As the Great, God received the honor from Christ&rsquo;s ascension, and as the Strong, He gained the victory.</li>
			<li>God the Father was the Great and the Strong, and God the Son was the Fighter:
				<ol class="none">
				<li>1) Christ fought the battle on the cross and in His resurrection, and by winning the battle He captured all Satan&rsquo;s captives as the spoil&mdash;Col. 2:15; Acts 2:24; Rev. 1:18.</li>
				<li>2) In His ascension Christ, the Fighter, and God, the Great and the Strong, shared the spoil with each other.</li>
				</ol></li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>Ephesians 4:8-12 reveals that when Christ ascended to the heavens, He led a procession of captives, who were originally the captives of Satan, bringing them to the heavens and presenting them to the Father.</li>
		</ol></li>
	<li>Christ&rsquo;s ascension consummates in the accomplishment of the work of God for His new creation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17; Gal. 6:15; Rev. 21:2:
		<ol class="decimal">
		<li>God is producing His new creation out of His old creation&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17:
			<ol class="lower-alpha">
			<li>The new creation is the old creation transformed by the divine life, and thus it has God within it as its life, nature, constitution, appearance, and expression&mdash;Gal. 6:15; 2 Cor. 3:18; Rev. 4:2-3; 21:2, 9-11.</li>
			<li>The new creation is created altogether in Christ, by Christ, through Christ, and with Christ&mdash;2 Cor. 5:17; Eph. 3:17.</li>
			<li>The continuing work of constituting the new creation is being carried out in the heavens in Christ&rsquo;s heavenly ministry&mdash;Heb. 8:1-2.</li>
			</ol></li>
		<li>The work of God for His new creation is to complete the constitution of the New Jerusalem to be God&rsquo;s corporate expression and the saints&rsquo; blessing for eternity&mdash;Rev. 21:2, 9-11; 22:3-5, 14, 17.</li>
		</ol></li>
