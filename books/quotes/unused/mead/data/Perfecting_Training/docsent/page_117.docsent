   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>PRACTICING TO BE IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the same principle, the way to be in the spirit is to set your mind on the spirit, making your mind one with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Then you are in the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When you are in the spirit, you are spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When you are in the flesh, you are fleshly, or even fleshy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>How can the minding of the spirit become the setting the mind on the spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>To use our illustration once more, how can the light green become dark green?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When we call on the Lord s name, when we pray-read the Word, when we fellowship with the saints, when we attend the meetings, when we read the ministry, we get more color added to us.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we sing and praise more green is added to us to make us dark green.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We have to do these things again and again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I have been very much impressed and helped by watching the young ones practicing on the piano.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>It is very difficult for my fingers to touch all those keys.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is really an activity, a doing, to me.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But after someone practices a number of years it becomes not a matter of activity but a principle of law.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is the same in typing.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In my English college, I learned to type in 1925.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In order to graduate from that typing lesson, we had to type 60 words per minute.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But for many years I have not practiced typing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Occasionally, I type an envelope, or a short note.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Because of the lack of practice, my fingers work mostly by activity.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Sometimes, of course, they work by law.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In my memory I cannot remember where the keys are, but when I put my fingers on the keys, my unknowledgeable fingers right away become knowledgeable because fifty-six years ago I practiced a lot.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The point is this: you get used to a certain thing by practicing it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Then the activity becomes a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You have to begin with minding and keep minding by these few practices of calling on the Lord s name, of pray-reading the Word, of fellowshipping with the saints, of attending the meetings, of singing the praises, and of reading the life-study messages.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>These are good practices.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>These may be considered like the keyboard of a piano.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>You need to practice playing on these keyboards.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>You need to get used to playing on these keyboards until something is built up in your being.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Then that practice of the minding will become the setting of the mind.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>That practice of minding makes your mind one with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If you consider the illustration of playing a piano or typing on a typewriter, you will realize this is altogether possible.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If you will practice, you will make it.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When your mind is set on the spirit, making your mind one with the spirit, then the spirit becomes the spirit of your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>There would be no distinction between the mind and the spirit; there would be no separation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The two would become one.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Your mind would be the spirit, and your spirit would be the mind, because your mind would be on the spirit, and your spirit would be saturating your mind.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When this is the case, the law of the Spirit of life functions, not by activity, but by principle.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>THE INTERCEDING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We will leave the two major things found in verses 7 and 8 until another time, and instead we will read Romans 8:26-27 concerning the interceding Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>And in like manner the Spirit also joins in to help us in our weakness; for we do not know for what we should pray as is fitting, but the Spirit Himself intercedes for us with groanings which cannot be uttered; but He Who searches the hearts knows what is the mind of the Spirit, because He intercedes for the saints according to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Here the mind is mentioned once again, but it is the mind of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Ephesians 4:23 speaks of the spirit of the mind, but Romans 8 speaks of the mind of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The spirit of the mind is for renewing and the mind of the Spirit is for interceding.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In Ephesians 4:23 the spirit becomes the spirit of the mind, and in Romans 8 the mind of the Spirit is for interceding.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The mind becomes the mind of the Spirit.</S>
