   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Verse 31:"But when the Son of Man comes in His glory and all the angels with Him, at that time He will sit on the throne of His glory."</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The names of the Lord in chapter twenty-five are all meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Bridegroom is in relation to the virgins, the Lord is in relation to His slaves, and the Son of Man is in relation to the Gentiles; all of these describe a relationship with man.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Strictly, verses 31-46 cannot be regarded as a parable, since the phrase "like unto" is not used here.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>These verses are real facts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>For this reason "the Son of Man" is used.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This name has the meaning of judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In John 5:25 and 27 the Son of God gives resurrection, indicating a relationship with the church, but the Son of Man executes judgment, indicating a relationship with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Son of Man is also related to the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In Daniel 7:13-14, when the Lord comes to establish the kingdom, He must first judge the world.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who pass the judgment will be the citizens in the kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are to be kings, we must have citizens.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Without citizens, there can be no kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>"Comes in His glory and all the angels with Him."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The glory of the Lord includes the glory of His divine person, the glory of His morality, the glory of His humanity, and the glory that was given to Him by God Phil 2:6-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Here the glory refers to the exaltation given to Him by man.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This glory was attained by the Lord in His obedience unto death.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The kingdom is a reward from God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The glory here is not the eternal glory, which every Christian has.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The glory of the kingdom is attained only by those who have gone through suffering Heb 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The scene described here is the same as that mentioned in Matthew 24:30.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, the judgment here should follow immediately that in Matthew 24:30.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>"All the angels with Him" is for the gathering of all peoples.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>These Gentiles have not followed Antichrist, for those who followed him will have been slaughtered by the Lord with the sword of His mouth already.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are not believers in the Lord, nor are they followers of Antichrist cf.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Matt 13:41 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"The throne of His glory."</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Today there is the throne of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Before this throne of grace we can receive timely help Heb 4:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In that day it will be a throne of glory, of holiness, and of immediate judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Glory leads to holiness, holiness leads to righteousness, and righteousness leads to judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The throne is on the earth, even in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The throne of God is in heaven Matt 5:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Today the Son is sitting on the Father's throne Rev 3:21 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>That the throne is in Jerusalem is evident from Luke 1:32-33.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The throne of David is in Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The throne of the Lord is simply the throne of David.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The throne of the Lord's glory is described in Matthew 19:28.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In verse 31 the first "glory" is initial at the time of His coming, whereas the second "glory" is perpetual.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Verse 32:"And all the nations will be gathered before Him, and He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>"All the nations" refers to all Gentile people.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"Gathered" should be rendered "summoned."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Who are these Gentile people?</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>There will be two judgments for all the Gentiles who will be alive.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The first will be for the group who follow Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They will be slaughtered at Jerusalem by the sword in the Lord's mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those referred to here have not followed Antichrist.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>They constitute the majority.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The judgment for the Gentiles who follow Antichrist is seen in Micah 4:11-13; Zephaniah 3:8; Zechariah 12:9; Revelation 16:14, 19; and Joel 3:12.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>They will be instigated by Antichrist to destroy Israel, and in turn will be destroyed by the Lord at His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>"He will separate them from one another, just as the shepherd separates the sheep from the goats."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This is a small parable within this passage in verses 31-46.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In the Scriptures there are three kinds of sheep: 1 the believers in the church John 10:1-18 , 2 the Jews Psa 80:1; Jer 23:1-4; 31:10 , and 3 the Gentiles Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>34:11-16 refers to the Jews; vv.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>17-19, to the Gentiles; vv.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>20-22, to the Gentiles again.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>In Psalm 100:1-3 "all ye lands" refers to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Furthermore, we have the parable of the lost sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Hence, sheep do not necessarily refer to Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It will not be possible for any separation to occur in heaven or in hell.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Separation is needed only on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>First there is separation; then comes the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The verdict is first announced, and then the judgment executed.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This judgment is not based on works as is the case of the white throne , but is based on nature.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Sheep are by nature sheep, and goats are by nature goats.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verse 33:"And He will set the sheep on His right hand and the goats on the left."</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The "right hand" refers to a position of glory.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>After the Lord was glorified, He ascended to the right hand of the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The second section: the dialogue with the sheep.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Verse 34:"Then the King will say to those on His right hand, Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The Lord is the King of the Gentiles, and the Head and the Bridegroom to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But the Lord is also the King of the Gentiles and of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This implies that He will exercise the Jewish authority in dealing with the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When the Lord becomes the King of the Gentiles, the age of the Gentiles will be over.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Today, the Jews are lowly among the nations; but a time will come when the Jews will be raised up and the Gentiles will be subdued by them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>"You who are blessed of My Father."</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Here it says, "My Father" and not "our Father."</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The Scripture seldom uses the term "our Father."</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>John 20 is an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>"My Father" implies that they, having no relationship with the Lord, are not Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Obviously, the Lord cannot speak of "our Father," because these people do not know the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>"Blessed."</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is the blessing on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The blessing for the church is heavenly.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Hence, verse 31 does not have the expression "the kingdom of the heavens is like" because this takes place on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>The future kingdom of the heavens has three different realms: 1 The earthly kingdom; this is simply the original blessing given to Adam for ruling over all things the earth then worked for men to replenish and multiply.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>After man's fall, such a blessing was lost.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>For this reason the Lord said, "From the foundation of the world."</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Today we are afraid of being hurt by animals, but in that day there will be no need for such fear.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>2 The kingdom of the Jews; its sphere is the land of Canaan, which extends from the Nile to the river Euphrates Gen 17:6-8 .</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Although the sphere is in the land of Canaan, the sovereignty extends beyond the kingdom cf.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Gen 17:16, a mother of nations, kings plural of people shall be of her; Isa 60:12; and Deut 15:6, the Gentile nations shall be subdued by the Jews .</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>3 The heavenly kingdom 1 Cor 15:50-52 ; all will be changed to inherit the kingdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>This implies that this is a kingdom in the spiritual realm.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>Both the heirs of God in Romans 8:17 and the kingdom in Matthew 25:34 refer to the first kind.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>In that kingdom, the snake and the lion hurt no more.</S>
