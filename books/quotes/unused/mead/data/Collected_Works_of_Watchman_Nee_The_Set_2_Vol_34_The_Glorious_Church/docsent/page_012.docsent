   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Some people were very frank before they believed in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After they were saved, they used their frankness to serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They considered their natural frankness to be quite useful; they were proud of it.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But from what source does their frankness come?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Is it from Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Has it been dealt with by the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Oh, if it is not out of Christ, if it has never been dealt with by the cross, it is of no use to the church!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Eve was constituted only of that which came out of Adam, and the church, likewise, is constituted only of that which is out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Whatever is of man himself is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Some people were very eloquent before they believed.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It was so easy for them to narrate and describe something to others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After they are saved, they just change the subject matter and begin to preach.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But we should not consider it sufficient that such people can preach well.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Rather, we should ask, "From what source does their eloquence come?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Has it been dealt with by the cross?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If their eloquence is that which they originally had and has never been dealt with by the cross, then it is entirely from their own nature.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The eloquence which they bring into the church will be something of the earthly Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The church will actually be pulled down by these people.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Only that which comes out of Christ is the church; nothing which comes out of human nature is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We may also meet some people who are very clever.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Their minds are exceptionally keen.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Before they were saved, they used their mind to study philosophy, science, and literature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>After they are saved, they simply use their mind to study God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But we must ask, "From where does this keen mind come?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Has it been dealt with by the cross?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Is it under the control of the Holy Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Or is it just that mind which they had originally?"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If this is so, it is simply something out of the earthly Adam, out of the man himself, the human nature; it is something of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Although these people have changed the subject, their mind is still the same old mind!</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>And when they use this mind to study the Bible, instead of helping the church, they will cause the church to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Only that which is out of Christ can be the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whatever is of man is not the church.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>God must deal with us to such a degree that everything from our human nature will be brought under control.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Our natural strength must be dealt with by the cross and subjected to the rule of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Only then will we not cause the church to suffer loss.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Everything which issues from the natural, Adamic life within us is made of earth and not wanted by God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Only that which was made of Adam's rib was Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The bone refers to the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When the Lord was on the cross, not one of His bones was broken.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only that which is formed from the resurrection life of Christ is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Eve must be made of the bone of Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Without the bone from Adam, there would have been no Eve.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Adam's help meet is also Adam's body, since the source of Eve's life was his very bone.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Adam was the basis of her existence.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>She could exist only because a part of Adam was in her.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It is the same with the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We need to continually declare to the Lord, "We owe everything to You.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Without You we have no life, no existence, nothing!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We come out of You!"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The vital issue of our new birth is just this: Repentance does not make us a part of the church; neither does our confession of sins nor our faith.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Only the life which Christ has imparted to us makes us a part of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The basis of our being a part of the church is our new birth, since it is then that Christ imparts Himself to us.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Therefore, there is a need for us to live, behave, and act according to this life, the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God cannot do anything more for us than to impart His Son into us that we may share the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Even though we are just earthen vessels, there is a great treasure within us.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What then can shake us?</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, if we act according to ourselves, we are outside the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Anything other than the portion of Christ in us is not the church; it is simply our own selves.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we work according to ourselves, we are not doing the Lord's work.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>We must ask ourselves upon what basis and from what source we are serving the Lord, doing His work, pursuing spiritual things, and leading a spiritual walk.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Is everything we do based upon Christ or based upon ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>If we do everything by Christ, we can accomplish God's purpose, but if we do anything by ourselves, even though something is accomplished, it can only be of an earthly nature and cannot accomplish God's eternal will.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>God's eternal purpose is to gain a man.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This man is a corporate man coming out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The church is not a matter of several Christians being put together with several other Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is not so many "men"; it is a life.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>The church is the church only because there are many people who all share the same life, the same Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You have a portion of Christ, and he has a portion of Christ; each one of us has a portion of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>When all of these portions of Christ are put together, there is the church.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We must be clear that God does not want individuals.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>God created man, male and female.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The male is singular, and the female is also singular.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Christ is singular, and the church is also singular.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>In the sight of God there is only one Christ and only one church.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>In the future we will see that there is only one man in Hades and only one man in the heavens; there is no third man.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>In God's eyes, He only sees two men in the whole world.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>First Corinthians 15 reveals that Adam is the first man and Christ is the last man.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There are no others.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>The Body of Christ, just as Eve, is one not many!</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Therefore, even though we have God's life within us, we still need God to work upon us to break our individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>God must break down the thought that I myself am enough.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We need to be one with all the rest of God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>There is only one Eve; likewise, there is only one Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>All of God's children, all who share the life of Christ, are not many individual men and women; they are all one man.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God must break our individualism.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>He must crush us day after day until we come to know the life of the Body.</S>
