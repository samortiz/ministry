   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>When a worker contacts a man, the first and most basic thing for him to do is to learn what this person's real need is before God.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sometimes even the person's own answer is unreliable.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When he says that he has a headache, does he really mean that only his head hurts?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Perhaps the headache is merely a symptom; his sickness may not be in the head.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Or he may say that he feels feverish, but this does not necessarily mean that he has a temperature.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He can say many things, but the things he says may not be that reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Very few patients really know what is wrong with them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They do not know the kind of sickness they have.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>They need us to diagnose them and tell them of their need.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we want them to tell us what is wrong with them, they may not be able to tell us the right thing.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Only those who have studied medicine, that is, those who are trained in discerning spiritual problems, can tell them what they need.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When we are making a diagnosis, we must know what we are speaking of.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We cannot impose a diagnosis upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>A subjective person will insist that others are sick with what he imagines the illness is; he will impose an illness upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When a person is sick or in difficulty, he cannot identify his problem.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to point it out to him.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Yet we should not insist on our diagnosis in a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether or not we can render help to the brothers and sisters depends on whether we can identify their problems and give them the right prescription.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If our diagnosis is correct, we will help them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Sometimes we may find out that their problem is beyond our ability, but at least a course of action is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Some spiritual conditions are within our ability to help, while others are beyond our ability to help.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We should not be so foolish as to assume that we can do everything and can help everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some people are within our ability to help, and we should give our whole being to help them.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Some people are beyond our ability to help, and we should tell the Lord: "This is beyond my power.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I cannot deal with this sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>I have never been trained in this matter, and I cannot deal with this problem.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Lord, be merciful to him!"</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Perhaps the specific function of some members of the Body will come to our mind, and we may realize that this is something that that brother or sister can do.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We then can refer the matter to him or her.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We know our own limitations, and we know that this is all we can do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should not think that we can take every kind of spiritual work upon ourselves; we cannot monopolize everything.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We have to see our limitations.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>At the same time, we have to know the supply in the other members.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We should be able to look to them and say, "This is something beyond my ability.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is your business."</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the principle of co-working together, the principle of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We can never move independently.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every worker of the Lord and servant of God has to learn to know men.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Those who do not know others' spiritual conditions are not qualified to work.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>It is unfortunate that the spiritual well-being of many people is ruined in the hands of inexperienced brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>These brothers cannot render others any help.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>They can only impose their subjective views on them; they cannot meet the objective needs.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is our most serious problem.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Others are not sick in a certain way just because we think that is their sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whatever their spiritual condition may be, they are what they are.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Our responsibility is to learn their spiritual condition.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are not properly calibrated, we will not be able to render help to other children of God.</S>
