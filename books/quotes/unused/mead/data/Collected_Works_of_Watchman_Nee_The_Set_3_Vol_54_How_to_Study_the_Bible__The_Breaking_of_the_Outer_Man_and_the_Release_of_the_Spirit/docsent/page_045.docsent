   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>XII.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE LORD'S TEACHINGS ON EARTH</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We can study all the teachings that the Lord taught, including Matthew 5, 6, 7, 13, 24, 25.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The Gospels of Luke and John also contain many of the Lord's teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>John 14, 15, and 16 are also important chapters on the Lord's teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When we read them we have to pay attention to where the Lord was speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Did He teach them in the land of Judea or in Galilee?</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Was He speaking to the disciples or to the crowd?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Was He speaking to both groups or only to the disciples and not to the crowd?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If we study the teachings this way, we will grasp the central messages.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we want to work for the Lord, at least we have to study His parables, miracles, and teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Otherwise, we will have no material to work on.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Our hands will be too empty, and we will not be able to meet the needs.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>XIII.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>COMPARING THE FOUR GOSPELS</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is also an important way to study the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why did the Spirit not write one complete gospel, but instead chose to write four different Gospels?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Why are the records in the four Gospels seemingly different at times and the sequence of events rearranged?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Sometimes the numbers even do not agree.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If we do not study them carefully, we will not realize the wonder behind the Spirit's inspiration.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In reading the four Gospels, the first thing we have to do is subdivide them into sections.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The subdivision must be detailed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can set aside a bigger notebook and write down all the events of the four Gospels in it under four columns.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>For example, in recording the genealogy of the Lord, we can put Matthew 1:1-17 in the first column and Luke 3:23-38 in the third column.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Mark and John do not have a genealogy, so we can leave the second and fourth columns empty.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Some events are recorded in only one Gospel, while others are recorded in all four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>After we finish this work, we can turn to our notebook and everything will become clear.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we further compare all the entries in the columns, we will find the similarities and differences between these records.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Such comparative reading will reveal many places that differ, and these differences will reveal to us the sovereign arrangements of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The genealogy in Matthew is divided into three groups of fourteen generations: From Abraham to David, from David to the captivity into Babylon, and from the captivity to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The genealogy in Luke traces backward.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Matthew goes from Abraham to David, while Luke goes from David to Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Matthew goes from David to the captivity in Babylon, while Luke goes from Salathiel back to David.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Matthew goes from Abraham to his descendants, while Luke goes from Abraham back to Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, if Matthew's genealogy is in three sections, Luke's genealogy should be in four sections.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Luke's genealogy begins with Mary, and Matthew's genealogy ends with Joseph.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>These subdivisions must be clearly marked before we can extract the meaning from them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Someone once linked the four living creatures in Revelation 4 to the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The four living creatures are the lion the king of the beasts, the ox the diligent servant, the face of a man, and the eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In the Old Testament God said that He bore the children of Israel on His wings like an eagle Exo 19:4; Deut 32:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Matthew portrays the Lord Jesus as the King, Mark portrays Him as the Servant, Luke portrays Him as a man, and John portrays Him as God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The four living creatures exactly match the description of the Lord in the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Matthew shows us the Lord Jesus as the King.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Hence, in his genealogy, he specifically points out that He is the descendant of King David.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Luke shows the Lord Jesus as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is the reason his genealogy goes all the way back to man's first ancestor Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Mark shows us the Lord Jesus as a servant, and John shows Him as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is the reason neither of these two books has a genealogy.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>When we consider the four books this way, we indeed find Matthew speaking of the Lord as the King, Mark as the Servant, Luke as a man, and John as the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All four Gospels speak of the coming of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>But the descriptions of His coming differ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Matthew says, "Behold, your King is coming to you" 21:5 , Mark says that the Son of Man came to serve 10:45 , Luke says that the Son of Man came to seek 19:10 , and John says that the Lord came to give us life 10:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We can find many such comparisons in the Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we spend time to study them, we will find that each Gospel has its own characteristics.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The endings of the four Gospels are very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Matthew covers the resurrection 28:6 , Mark covers the ascension 16:19 , Luke covers the promise of the coming of the Holy Spirit 24:49 , and John covers the Lord's coming again 21:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After the Lord Jesus resurrected, He ascended to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After the ascension, there was the coming of the Holy Spirit at Pentecost.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>In the future the Lord Jesus will come again.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The wonderful arrangement of the four Gospels matches the order of sequence of these four events.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Matthew does not say anything about the ascension of the Lord Jesus, because it speaks of the Lord being with the disciples until the completion of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Mark speaks of the Lord's ascension, saying, He "sat at the right hand of God" 16:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>This is because He took the form of a slave and was obedient unto death for the accomplishment of His work.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Therefore, God exalted Him to the highest.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Luke records the Lord's ascension as well.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God was mindful of this man, who was a little lower than the angels, in order that He would be crowned with glory and honor.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The Lord Jesus ascended in the position of a man, which means that He will lead many sons into glory.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>John does not say anything about the Lord's ascension because it speaks of Him being our life and living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Matthew's record is arranged according to dispensational truth, not according to chronology.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Luke "carefully investigated all things from the first"; therefore, his record is "in an orderly fashion" 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Some parts are according to chronological order, while others are according to the order of subjects.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Mark and John were both written according to the order of the events themselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We can buy a large-size copy of the four Gospels and divide Matthew into five or ten sections.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Then we can study each section carefully and consider what the other three Gospels have to say about the things recorded in each section.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Similar passages should be grouped together, while dissimilar ones should be clearly marked.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>The dissimilar passages should have broader subdivisions, while the similar passages should have finer subdivisions.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>For example, the parable of the sower in Matthew 13 is also in Luke.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We have to make a finer subdivision before we can identify the finer differences between the various records.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>We have to subdivide them in such a way that we can tell the similarities and the differences at a glance.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This requires much time.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It takes at least two years to go through the four Gospels.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The actual copying and note-taking may only take about three months.</S>
