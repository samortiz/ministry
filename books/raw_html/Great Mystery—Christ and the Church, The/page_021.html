        <h2 class="head1">THE CHURCH BEING THE COUNTERPART OF CHRIST</h2>
<p>We also need to consider Ephesians 5. On the surface chapter 5 is on ethics and morality, including matters between husbands and wives, such as wives being subject to their husbands and husbands loving their wives (vv. 22, 25). Paul, however, uses this subject to further expound on the deep mystery of Christ and the church. In Ephesians Paul presents many crucial points concerning the church. In chapter 1 he speaks of the church as the Body of Christ, the fullness of Christ (vv. 22b-23). In chapter 2 he speaks of the church as God&rsquo;s masterpiece, God&rsquo;s household, God&rsquo;s kingdom, and God&rsquo;s dwelling place (vv. 10, 19-22). In chapter 3 he speaks of the church as God&rsquo;s fullness (v. 19). In chapter 4 he speaks of the church as the new man and of Christ as the person of the new man (v. 24). In chapter 5 he speaks of the church as the counterpart of Christ (v. 25). The church is not only the Body of Christ and the new man but also the counterpart of Christ.</p>
<p>To understand the meaning of being a counterpart, we must look at the first couple in the Bible&mdash;Adam and Eve. Eve came out of Adam. When God created mankind, He created only a man, Adam (Gen. 2:7). Then God caused a deep sleep to fall upon Adam, and He took a rib from Adam&rsquo;s opened side and built the rib into a woman (vv. 21-22). Thus, Eve came out of Adam. This means that the two had the same life and same nature. When God gave Eve to Adam, the two became one flesh. A man can be considered as only one half of one person; a woman represents the other half. A couple is two halves becoming one.</p>
<p>Ephesians 5 shows that the church came out of Christ, just as Eve came out of Adam. When Christ was put to &ldquo;sleep,&rdquo; to death, on the cross, His side was pierced, and blood and water came out to produce the church (John 19:34)&mdash;blood for redemption and water for life. Hence, the church has the same life and nature as Christ, and the church is one spirit with Christ (Eph. 4:4).</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE LORD MAKING THE CHURCH<br />
HIS HOLY AND GLORIOUS COUNTERPART<br />
WITHOUT BLEMISH</h2>
<p>Chapter 5 further shows how this counterpart becomes a glorious counterpart, a beautiful wife. The Bible uses phrases such as <em>glorious, holy,</em> and <em>without blemish</em> to describe the church (v. 27), indicating that Christ would like to gain a beautiful church. A blemish is not related to filth. A precious stone, such as fine jade or a diamond, can be clean and free of filth but still be blemished if it is slightly spotted, chipped, or mixed in color. We can wash our face to be free of filth but still have spots and wrinkles. Christ wants His church to be glorious and holy, without any spot, wrinkle, or blemish. Today the Lord Jesus is removing the church&rsquo;s spots and wrinkles so that the church may be holy and without blemish.</p>
<p>The Lord can produce such a church because He loves the church and gave Himself up for her (v. 25). The Lord Jesus died on the cross not only to shed His blood to redeem us but also to release the divine life. When He died, blood and water came out of His pierced side (John 19:34). The blood redeemed us from sin, and water signifies God&rsquo;s life. The water that came out of His pierced side is like the water that came out of the smitten rock in the Old Testament (Exo. 17:6). Furthermore, in John 4:13-14 the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;Everyone who drinks of this water shall thirst again, but whoever drinks of the water that I will give him shall by no means thirst forever; but the water that I will give him will become in him a fountain of water springing up into eternal life,&rdquo; and in 7:38 He said, &ldquo;He who believes into Me, as the Scripture said, out of his innermost being shall flow rivers of living water.&rdquo; Revelation 22:1 speaks of a &ldquo;river of water of life, bright as crystal, proceeding out of the throne of God and of the Lamb in the middle of its street.&rdquo; The water in these verses is the water of life, which refers to the flowing life of God. The Lord Jesus died on the cross to release this life.</p>
<p>The Lord is also making the church holy and without blemish through the washing of the water in the word (Eph. 5:26). The water of life is in the word. Christ loves the church and gave Himself up for her to release His life and make her holy. Christ not only cleansed the church from sin by His blood, He also is washing away every spot and wrinkle by His life. This life was released on the cross and is embodied in the words of the Bible. Secular books can give people only knowledge; these books cannot give life, because there is no life in them. But God&rsquo;s life is conveyed through the Bible; it is living and able to supply life. People who read the Bible can all testify that this is the difference between the Bible and other books.</p>
<p>The Bible is the word of God, and in the word of God there is life (John 6:63). Without Jesus&rsquo; death on the cross, which released His life, the Bible would be empty today. However, He died and released God&rsquo;s life. This life is not only in the Holy Spirit but also in God&rsquo;s word. Whenever we read God&rsquo;s word, life flows in the word to supply us. This life supplies us within like a stream and flows throughout our being, washing us with its water.</p>
<p>Our body functions according to a metabolic law. We receive food into our being, and the nutrients in the food circulate throughout our bloodstream. The metabolic function in our body supplies our body with necessary nutrients on the one hand, and it removes waste from our body on the other hand. Such a washing clears away all the waste in our body.</p>
<p>When we read the Bible with prayer and our spirit, the life in the words of the Bible washes away the old things within us and takes away our spots and wrinkles &ldquo;metabolically.&rdquo; We should never read the Bible without prayer. When we read Ephesians 5:25, which says, &ldquo;Husbands, love your wives even as Christ also loved the church and gave Himself up for her,&rdquo; we can pray, &ldquo;O Lord, husbands. Oh, husbands. Lord, I need this word. Love your wives. Love; oh, love. Lord, thank You for giving me a life of love, an ability to love, and a desire to love. Even as Christ also loved the church. O Lord, You loved the church. This love is in me so that I can love my wife even as You loved the church.&rdquo; As we pray-read in this way, life will circulate in our being, and in just a few minutes, we will not only be taught in our mind but also supplied in our spirit. This circulating life will stir up a love for our wife within us and wash away every &ldquo;spot&rdquo; of displeasure toward our wife.</p>
<p>Furthermore, the Lord is making the church holy and without blemish by nourishing and cherishing her (v. 29). In Greek, <em>to nourish</em> means &ldquo;to nurture, to feed.&rdquo; To cherish is to foster like a mother bird who cares for her chicks by covering them under her wings and warming and caring for their needs. A mother who holds and nurses her child in her bosom is cherishing and nourishing. Through this, the child is supplied with food and is kept warm and comfortable. Such a satisfied child lacks nothing. This is the meaning of cherishing and nourishing.</p>
<p>Christ not only died for us and imparted His life into us so that we might be sanctified; He also put life in His word through the Spirit. When we contact His word by pray-reading, the water in the word circulates within us, taking away the spots, wrinkles, and blemishes in us and causing us to be renewed and transformed. He also cherishes and nourishes us, holding the church in His bosom to give us security, comfort, supply, and everything that we need. As a result, the church becomes glorious, being holy and without blemish. Christ will gain such a holy and glorious church without blemish and will present her to Himself as His beautiful counterpart.</p>
<p>For Christ to accomplish such a work, there is a need for death, resurrection, life, the word, and the Spirit, and there is a need for us to open to Him and be willing to dive into His bosom by pray-reading His Word and living in fellowship with Him. In this way we will enjoy His life and receive the washing of the water in His word. At the same time, we will be cherished and cared for and nourished and fed through His word and the Spirit. When we enjoy Him as everything, we will become holy and glorious, a church that can be presented to Himself having no spots, wrinkles, or blemishes. This is the reason that we cannot merely preach the gospel or teach the Bible according to its surface revelation. We must release the mystery deep in the Bible so that people may become the Body of Christ, be transformed and renewed into the universal new man, and be the beloved and glorious counterpart of Christ, a counterpart that is holy and without blemish.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
