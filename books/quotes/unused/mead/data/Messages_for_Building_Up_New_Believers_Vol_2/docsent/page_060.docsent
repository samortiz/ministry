   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PRINCIPLE OF OCCUPATIONS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>From these God-approved occupations in the Bible, we can see a basic principle: Man must receive or take from nature, or he must earn his wages in exchange for his time and labor.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These are the principles of occupation outlined in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>A. Receiving from Nature</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Increasing Abundance</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The sower sows a grain of wheat into the ground.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>After some time it bears many grains, a hundredfold, sixtyfold, or thirtyfold Matt 13:3, 8 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>One grain becomes a hundred, sixty, or thirty grains.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>One seed is sown into the ground, but it grows and bears many grains.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is to receive from nature.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Nature is rich in its supply, and anyone can extract from it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God causes His sun to rise on the evil and the good and sends rain on the just and the unjust 5:45 .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This clearly hints that God sends these things for the purpose of farming.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God intends for man to obtain his supply from nature.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The same principle applies to livestock farming.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>One raises sheep which give milk or bear many lambs.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is an increase of production.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It is something supplied by nature, not something acquired by other means.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the New Testament we see fishing as an occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Fishing takes something from the rivers and seas.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This again is to receive from nature.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We do not make anyone poorer by fishing from the rivers and the seas.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We can become rich by taking something from the rivers, and these riches will not make anyone poor.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When my sheep bears six lambs or my cow bears two calves, no family becomes poorer because of this.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When I till the ground, no one is hungry or suffers loss because my field has brought forth grain a hundredfold.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The basic principle of a God-approved occupation is to gain without incurring loss to anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the kind of noble occupation that God ordains.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>B. Manufacturing Adding Value</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The same principle applies to Paul s tentmaking.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>He did not receive directly from nature.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fishing, raising livestock, and farming receive from nature directly.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But Paul manufactured something by adding value to his raw material.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This increases the value of goods.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A piece of fabric may cost one dollar.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When I cut it, sew it, and make a tent out of it, it costs two dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Its value has increased, and my wage is the increased value of the good.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>I do not make anyone poorer by receiving money from the increased value.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>No one became poorer or suffered loss through Paul s tentmaking.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When I increase the value of a piece of fabric, it is only proper that I receive my wages because I have put in time and skill.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Therefore, another principle of a God-approved occupation is that it increases the value of goods.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>C. Working for Wages</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Another principle can be found in hired laborers, craftsmen, and medical doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In such cases one earns his money and wages through his own labor.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>This neither takes from nature nor adds value to raw materials, but one puts in his labor, pays a price, and provides a service to receive his income.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The reward that comes as a result of one s labor is also acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>D. What the Bible Disapproves of Trading</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is one occupation of which the Bible particularly disapproves.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Please pay special attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If a new believer has the ability to choose his profession, I hope that he will not take trading as his occupation.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Why?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should consider this matter from a broader perspective.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Perhaps that will give us a clearer picture.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Suppose there are one hundred persons here and each one has a million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>If we put them all together, we will have a hundred million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Suppose I begin to trade as one of them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Naturally, I would want to make money.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I would like my one million dollars to become two million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Forget for a moment how I handle my business, whether it is done righteously or unrighteously.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>After a month I have two million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>This means that someone must have less money.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This must be the case because there are only one hundred persons, each of whom had only one million dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Even if I conducted my business in the most righteous way, I would still have caused someone to lose money when I increased my money to two million.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>I am a Christian, and let us say that you are a Christian also.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>You are my brother.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Does it look good for me to make money and become richer by making you poorer?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Certainly not.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Even if you are a Gentile and a heathen, I am a Christian.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>I am a child of God, and I have my standing and status as a child of God.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>God s children should not cause an unbeliever to become poorer by increasing their own money.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I would feel bad even if I employed righteous means to gain other believers money.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>I would feel equally bad if I used righteous means to gain an unbeliever s money.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is what it is like to engage in trade.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>You cannot take money from another s pocket and put it into your own pocket.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It does not matter how you do it.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>As long as you turn the money in another s pocket into your money, you are causing a loss to others.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>This is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Of course, the basic God-approved occupations in the Bible pose no such problem.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Suppose I am a tiller of the ground, and I have harvested a hundred loads of rice.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This will not cause another brother s possession to be reduced from ten loads down to nine loads.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>I cannot cause him to have any reduction.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>My hundred loads of rice will not reduce anything from anyone or cause anyone to become poorer.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>This is not making money; this is increasing the abundance of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>We must completely differentiate between the two: Making money and increasing the abundance are two different things altogether.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God does not want His children to make money just for the sake of making money.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God wants our occupation to increase the abundance.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>This basic principle is quite clear.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>A new believer should not have his mind occupied with money day and night.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Do not try to constantly consider how you can make money.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Please remember that as long as you have made some money, others have lost money.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The principle of trade is that when one s money increases, the money of others decreases.</S>
