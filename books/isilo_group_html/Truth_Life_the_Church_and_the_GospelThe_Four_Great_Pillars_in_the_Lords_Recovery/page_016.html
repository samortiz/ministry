<h1 class="title">EXPERIENCING AND MINISTERING CHRIST</h1>
<p>Concerning the truth, we need to understand and explain it. Concerning Christ, we need to experience Him and minister to others what we have experienced. The Christ we are referring to here is not the objective Christ who is sitting in the heavens but the subjective Christ who is our life. Hence, to experience Christ is to experience life, and to minister Christ is to minister life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LEARNING TO CUT STRAIGHT AND TO SPEAK<br />
THE WORD OF THE TRUTH</h2>
<p>Today among Christians there is a lack related to both the truth and to Christ. Most preachers can cover many topics in their sermons, but it is difficult for them to definitely present a particular truth to people. For example, most preachers cannot give people a precise definition of incarnation. In addition, even when a clear and precise definition of incarnation is presented, most people still forget what they have heard right away. For this reason we have to study the truth again and again and practice speaking it until we are so familiar with it that we can speak it accurately even in our dreams. For instance, when we speak about God&rsquo;s attributes, the sequence should be love, light, holiness, and righteousness; we should never reverse the order. This is clearly explained in detail in the life-studies and the footnotes of the Recovery Version of the New Testament. Note 3 of 1 John 1:5 says that love is the nature of God&rsquo;s essence, and light is the nature of God&rsquo;s expression. In other words, love is the essence and light is the expression. Love is first and light is second, because love is God&rsquo;s essence and light is His expression. Holiness is related to God&rsquo;s nature, and righteousness is related to God&rsquo;s move. God&rsquo;s nature is holy whereas His move, His actions, are righteous. Therefore, holiness is before righteousness.</p>
<p>This requires us to learn and study the truth in a serious way. We must learn to differentiate between love and light and between holiness and righteousness, and we must also speak these things accurately. For example, suppose you go to a restaurant and order a meal that costs twenty dollars. After ordering, you pay the cashier one hundred dollars, and he gives you back ninety dollars. Suppose that after receiving the ninety dollars, you take it as if nothing had happened, eat and drink your meal as usual, and then go home and boast of what happened and show off to your family. This kind of behavior would not be related to holiness but to righteousness. If you take something that costs twenty dollars, but you pay only ten dollars, this is the same as stealing ten dollars. This kind of act is unrighteous. Let us use another example. Suppose you go to a restaurant and buy some food. In addition, you also buy some cigarettes and wine. Then you eat, smoke, and drink to your heart&rsquo;s content. Although this is not something unrighteous, it is unholy. God would never approve of drinking and smoking, because He is holy, and He would never take advantage of people, because He is righteous. Hence, we speak first of His holiness and then of His righteousness.</p>
<p>Love, light, holiness, and righteousness are virtues to man. To God, however, they are attributes. In His human living, the Lord Jesus expressed love, light, holiness, and righteousness as His human virtues. In His divinity He also had love, light, holiness, and righteousness, but they were not expressed outwardly. Rather, they were hidden inwardly as His divine attributes, the rich content of His virtues. For instance, both a glove and a hand have five fingers, but the five fingers of the hand are the inner enriching content, while the fingers of the glove are the expression. The five fingers of the glove are for the outward expression, for a nice appearance. Thus, they are like the human virtues. The five fingers of the hand are hidden in the glove; they are not for a nice appearance but for the rich content. Hence, they are like the divine attributes. The five fingers of the hand, as the attributes, are hidden in the five fingers of the glove to enrich and strengthen the glove. Hence, what is seen outwardly are virtues, and what is hidden inwardly are attributes.</p>
<p>The ancient Chinese sage Confucius also talked about morality and virtues, but the virtues that he taught were not enriched and strengthened with the divine attributes. In the end they were like a glove without a hand inside, having five empty fingers. The virtues referred to in the Bible have the divine attributes as their content and are thus enriched, strengthened, and excelling. This is similar to a glove with a hand inside it. The Lord Jesus was God yet man. He was God, and He was man, so He was a God-man. He was a man with humanity, and He was God with divinity. In His humanity were virtues, and in His divinity were attributes. His human virtues contained His divine attributes, and His divine attributes enriched His human virtues. Because of the strengthening of His divine attributes, His human virtues were enriched. This is the highest standard of morality&mdash;the morality of the God-man. The Lord Jesus had such a living on the earth&mdash;the God-man living.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_015.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_017.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Truth, Life, the Church, and the Gospel-The Four Great Pillars in the Lord's Recovery &nbsp; pg 16</div><br></body></html>
