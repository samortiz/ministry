<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Desolation of the Church</H2><P>However, when the church became desolate, conditions changed. At the time of Paul, the church was already falling into desolation. Paul said in the book of Philippians that "all seek their own things, not the things of Christ Jesus" (Phil. 2:21). In 2 Timothy he said that all who were in Asia had turned away from him and his ministry (1:15). The descriptions in Peter's epistles are no exception; they all mention the desolation of the church toward the end of the apostles' time. On the one hand, Peter speaks in his first epistle of the church as a spiritual house, or a spiritual temple (1 Pet. 2:5). On the other hand, Peter also spoke of the condition of degradation. John's Epistles also speak of the coming of antichrist and of apostasy in teachings (1 John 2:18; 4:3; 2 John 7). These are the conditions of the end times. In Revelation 2 and 3, we see that the churches had become so desolate that the Lord could no longer write to the churches; He could only write to the messengers of the churches. The letter to Ephesus in Revelation 2 can be considered "The Second Epistle to the Ephesians." There the church had forsaken its original condition and had drifted farther and farther away.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>God's Eyes upon the Spiritual Reality<br>of the Church in the Age of Its Desolation</H2><P>What we see today is merely a collection of human methods, doctrines, opinions, criticisms, and quibbles. Amidst the desolation of the church, we need to learn to exercise judgment. It is true that among all the denominations in Christianity, there are God's people who are still performing worship to God. You have to admit that there are still sacrifices. But the ark is not there any longer. There is no more testimony. The only thing that is left is an outward tabernacle. When God's tabernacle has become desolate, His eyes are turned to the temple. Today, we who are learning to follow the Lord have to make our choice between the tabernacle and the temple. Some like to follow what is on hand, what is visible, and what is available everywhere. Yet those who want to follow God have to choose the ark and to go on with it.</P><P>The position that we should take should be one of spiritual reality, that is, the position typified by the temple. Today the church is the habitation of the Holy Spirit. In this church, there is God's authority and the desire of God's heart. There is also the authority of the kingdom of the heavens. The Lord has given to the church the authority of the kingdom of the heavens. As such is the case, we can enjoy the power of the coming age in the church today. In the Old Testament, the temple and the kingdom are linked together; the temple is the most crucial element in the kingdom. In the same way, the church as the temple is linked to the power of the coming kingdom. This is where our way lies today. On the one hand, we have to leave the outward tabernacle. On the other hand, we have to seek after God's testimony. God has pronounced very clear judgment on the outward failures already. His judgment is His removal of the ark. Before God, to be without the ark is a shame. On the one hand, we have to leave the tabernacle. On the other hand, we have to seek after God's testimony.</P><P>What is God's testimony? In the Old Testament, God ordered Moses to make two tables of stones, which He called the tables of the law. On these stones were engraved the ten commandments. The tables of the law were also called the tables of testimony (Exo. 34:29). The ark that God commanded Moses to make was a type of Christ. Above the ark was the mercy seat. Within the ark was the law. However, God did not call the ark the ark of the law, but the ark of testimony (Exo. 25:22). Hence, the law is God's testimony.</P><P>The law is God's demand on man's conduct. How then can it be God's testimony? We have to realize that, on the one hand, God's testimony is the response of God's demand on man. On the other hand, God's demand is simply God's testimony. Where there are the divine demands, there is the divine testimony. Whatever demands God puts on man today, these demands are there to attest to God and to testify God. They testify God's glory, His holiness, and all that He is. The law declares God's demands, and the mercy seat bestows God's grace to man. The testimony is from man to God, and grace is from God to man. When God's glory is satisfied, there is the mercy seat. We have to know that the ten commandments do not refer to the dead laws, but to God's demand on man. This demand is itself a testimony, in which God testifies to Himself. The law maintains God's testimony, and it testifies for God. God has to explain to man His demands, and this explanation is God's testimony. Psalm 119 describes God's law as His testimony many times. When a man keeps God's law, he is keeping God's testimony. Every time the word testimony is mentioned in that psalm, it refers to the law.</P><P>Today the outward church has become weakened and has failed. It has lost the testimony of God and is not able to meet God's demand. For this reason, there are the disunity, divisions, denominations, and sects. God demands that man submit. But man cannot meet this demand. As a result, the testimony is lost, and division is produced. Although every revivalist comes along and builds a tabernacle, there is no ark of testimony in it. Even when there is a mercy seat, there is no ark. A man can go to different places to conduct conferences. What he is doing is merely moving the tabernacle from one place to another. What he is maintaining is merely a mercy seat without an ark. Although the ark is not there, the mercy seat is nevertheless put up. This is what men are doing today&#151;replacing God's testimony with man's need. Whenever man's need replaces God's testimony, degradation begins, and problems arise. What then is the way for our work today?</P>
