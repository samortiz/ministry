GOD&rsquo;S CREATION AND GOD BEING LIFE</h1>

<h2 class="head1">TEACHING IN DIFFERENT LEVELS OF DEPTH ACCORDING TO AGE</h2>
<p>In leading the young people we should follow a line related to spiritual knowledge and a line related to spiritual life. Both of these lines are important. Although we cannot take care of both lines in every meeting simultaneously, we can cover them alternately, focusing on spiritual knowledge one week and on spiritual life the next week. Since the young people are at various levels of human growth, our leading should vary as well. We can speak something simple to junior high students, something deeper to high school students, and something still deeper to college students. When we apply this principle, we need to be flexible and avoid making hard and fast rules. We should determine the level of depth according to the actual situation.</p>
<p>In leading the young people, we should avoid the way of giving a message; rather, we should give a main point and several verses. When we come to something that they do not understand, we should stop and speak again, and we should ask them to write down the main point and study what they have learned when they go home. The next time we meet, we should ask them to repeat the points by speaking in a way of testing. Although they may think that this is too difficult, it will be profitable to them. In every meeting we should use the first half for testing and the second half for a new lesson. This will give them a deep impression of the truth, and the content of the truth will be deeply rooted in them. Whenever someone is being tested, everyone will receive help. This is the best way to train the mind of the young ones and to help them.</p>
<h2 class="head1">STIRRING UP PEOPLE&rsquo;S INTEREST<br />
WITH AN OPENING WORD OF THE MEETING</h2>
<p>When we speak to the young people concerning the matter of life, we should say something that will stir up their interest, but it does not have to be too long. For example, we can say, &ldquo;Life gives meaning to the entire universe, and life makes the universe interesting. Just imagine if all the organisms in the universe were removed, the universe would have no meaning and would be void of anything of interest. The universe is interesting because of life, and life causes people to have a sense of wonder and meaning. If there were no plant life or animal life, the universe would be desolate and entirely void of meaning. Hence, life is the central focus of God&rsquo;s creation. In the universe life is the central thought and concept. In a garden there are flowers, grass, and trees, including fruit trees, all of which are full of the beauty of life. Without life, a garden would be a boring and desolate place.&rdquo;</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING THE BIBLE AS A BOOK OF LIFE</h2>
<p>After we cover the matter of creation, we can speak about the Bible. The Bible is a book on life. There are billions of books in the world, but only the Bible is crucially focused on life. If we removed life from the Bible, it would be the same as removing life from the universe. Without life, the universe is desolate, boring, and meaningless; likewise, without life, the Bible is empty. The Bible speaks of the tree of life at the beginning (Gen. 2:9), and it speaks of the tree of life at the end (Rev. 22:2). Moreover, there is a river of water of life flowing at both the beginning and the end of the Bible (Gen. 2:10; Rev. 22:1). This shows that the focus of the Bible is on life. Life is mentioned repeatedly in the New Testament. For example, the Gospel of John is filled with the matter of life. In the Old Testament Psalms also mentions life (36:9). The Bible is a book on life, and all the knowledge in it is for the purpose of imparting life.</p>
<h2 class="head1">KNOWING GOD&rsquo;S CREATION</h2>
<h2 class="head2">God&rsquo;s Creation Taking Life as Its Goal</h2>
<p>We should present the matter of creation according to the first two chapters of Genesis. There is an innumerable variety of things in the universe, but even if there were a record of every item in the Bible, it would not exhaustively explain the work of God&rsquo;s creation. Nevertheless, God uses only two chapters in the Bible to record the items of His creation, because His emphasis is on life. Genesis 1:1-4 says, &ldquo;In the beginning God created the heavens and the earth. But the earth became waste and emptiness, and darkness was on the surface of the deep, and the Spirit of God was brooding upon the surface of the waters. And God said, Let there be light; and there was light. And God saw that the light was good, and God separated the light from the darkness.&rdquo; For the earth to become waste and emptiness and for darkness to be on the surface of the deep indicate a situation of death, which is in contrast to life. When there was no life, darkness was on the surface of the deep. Therefore, God said, &ldquo;Let there be light&rdquo; (v. 3). When light came in, there was a separation from the darkness. Then God said, &ldquo;Let there be an expanse in the midst of the waters, and let it separate the waters from the waters&rdquo; (v. 6). God created the expanse and separated the waters under the expanse from the waters above the expanse (v. 7). When the waters were separated, an expanse was produced. Then God said, &ldquo;Let the waters under the heavens be gathered together into one place, and let the dry land appear&rdquo; (v. 9). &ldquo;God called the dry land Earth, and the gathering together of the waters He called Seas; and God saw that it was good&rdquo; (v. 10). This step caused the waters to gather together, and it separated the waters from the land. There was a separation of light from darkness, a separation of what is above from what is below, and a separation of the waters from the land because God desired to create an environment for life to grow. After these steps, the earth produced grass and all kinds of plants (vv. 11-12), and one by one different kinds of life appeared (vv. 20-25). This shows that life is the goal of God&rsquo;s creation.</p>
