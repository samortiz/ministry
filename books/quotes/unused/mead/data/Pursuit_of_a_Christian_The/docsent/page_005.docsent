   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO FOUR THINGS THAT A CHRISTIAN POSSESSES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After a Christian has been saved, he should at least have some knowledge concerning several fundamental matters: first, Christ; second, the Bible; third, the church; and fourth, Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Besides knowing Christ, the Bible, and the church, a good Christian should also have a clear understanding of what a Christian is, how to be a Christian, and what kind of living a Christian should have.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Therefore, we may say that Christ, the Bible, the church, and fellow Christians are four things in a Christian's possession.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>All these four items are indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>A Christian possesses these things not just in his mind; rather, he has these four things because he has the Lord Jesus living in him.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many are not clear about this point and thus do not know what a Christian is.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>A Christian is man plus God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Christians have not only the human element; their element is man plus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Only those who have God added into them are called Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The fundamental difference between Christians and non-Christians lies only in the elements within them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>A non-Christian is merely human; he is purely a human being.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>A Christian, however, is not just a human but has Christ, the incarnated One, within him.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We all know that the church as the Body of Christ is the enlargement of the principle of Christ and that Christians are the constituents of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Every Christian is a member of the Body, and the Body is the sum total of all the members.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Thus, in terms of the Body, its element is the enlargement of Christ; in terms of the members, their element is also Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The element of the church is the enlargement of the principle of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The principle of Christ is God being added into man.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, Christians are those who have Christ within them.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If a person calls himself a Christian yet does not have Christ as an element in him, then he is a Christian in name but not in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>A CHRISTIAN BEING A PERSON WHO HAS CHRIST WITHIN</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A Christian is one who has Christ in him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Greek word for Christian is Christianos, a word formed from Latin.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The ending ianos, denoting an adherent of someone, was applied to slaves belonging to the great families in the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Later, some began to call the followers of Christ Christianoi Christians , adherents of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Strictly speaking, Christians are simply "Christ-men" those who belong to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Most people think that to be a Christian is to be a disciple of Christ, just as to be a Confucianist is to be a disciple of Confucius and to be a Socratic is to be a disciple of Socrates.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Actually, being a disciple of Confucius or Socrates is different from being a disciple of Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>All those who desire to follow Christ and be His disciples must have Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only those who have Christ can be disciples of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we do not have the life of Christ, there is no way to learn Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>If we have His life, then we can be His disciples and learn from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Disciples of Christ are those who have Christ within them as their life, their power, their preferences, and their everything.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Such people are the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, a Christian is one who contains Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If a cup does not contain tea, we cannot call it a teacup, and it would be deceiving to call it as such.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>A Christian is a Christ-man, a man with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>During the war, I met a French brother who could speak a little Mandarin.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>On the day we met, the person who introduced us said to me, "This is a French brother."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The brother from France replied immediately, "I am not a Frenchman but a heavenly-kingdom-man."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Of course, a saved person is a person of the heavenly kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, this is merely an objective knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We must know that we are just like teacups and we have Christ as the tea in us.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When others see us, we are just "cups" outwardly, without any flavor, yet after a few sips of us, they have drunk of Christ as the "tea."</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Anyone who does not have Christ is not a Christ-man.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If someone claims that he is a Christ-man yet does not have Christ in him, then he is the greatest deceiver in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is just like a person who is penniless yet exclaims, "I am a wealthy man!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>I am very rich!"</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Today, the same thing also happens in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many do not have Christ in them yet claim they are Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then how should a person who has Christ within conduct himself, and how should he live?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The answer is very simple.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In all things he should inquire of the Lord and have fellowship with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In particular, the new believers should have such a practice.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In your daily contact with others, whether with your spouse or the brothers and sisters in the church, you should often ask, "Lord, are You happy with what I am going to do?</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Are You pleased with what I am about to say?"</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These words are simple yet precious.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Since we have been saved and have become Christ-men, we should ask ourselves often in our daily living, "When I say this word, does it please the Christ who is within me?</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When I do this thing, does it make Christ, who is in me, happy?"</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Before two people are married, they are independent of each other.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Each one can decide according to his or her preference when to wake up, when to go to bed, what to eat, and when to come home.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>They are free from each other's control.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Once they are married, however, they have to take care of each other's feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The wife has to consider whether her husband will be unhappy about her coming home so late and about the clothes she wears; likewise, the husband has to take his wife into consideration in the same matters.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>If the marital relationship is such, how much more should our walk and living be, since the Lord has entered into us and become united with us.</S>
