GOD SANCTIFIES US<br />THAT WE MAY HAVE HIS HOLY NATURE</h2><p>God sanctifies us that we may have His holy nature; this is the establishing of God&rsquo;s organic salvation (Rom. 6:19, 22; 15:16; 2 Pet. 1:4).</p><h2 class="head2">A. That We May Be Established<br />in God&rsquo;s Holy Nature</h2><p>God sanctifies us that we may be established in God&rsquo;s holy nature. God&rsquo;s sanctifying us is a very important and particular item in God&rsquo;s organic salvation. Not only is God Himself holy, but He also wants to make us holy. Eventually, He wants to make us the holy city, New Jerusalem. In the universe God is holiness; whenever people touch God, they touch holiness (cf. Isa. 6:2-3; Rev. 4:8). Hence, in His organic salvation God&rsquo;s intention is to constitute us with His holy nature that we may become the Body of Christ and ultimately be manifested as an established, holy city, New Jerusalem.</p><h2 class="head3">1. In His Complete Salvation<br />God Sanctifies Us in Our Position Judicially<br />and in Our Disposition Organically</h2><p>We were created by God for Himself, but due to our fall and separation from God we were lost and became common in our position and disposition. Hence, in His complete salvation God sanctifies us in our position judicially and in our disposition organically.</p><p>The judicial, positional sanctification is accomplished through the redeeming blood of Christ (Heb. 13:12; 10:29; 1 Cor. 1:2; Rom. 1:7; cf. Matt. 23:17). The organic, dispositional sanctification is carried out by the Holy Spirit with the holy nature of God (Rom. 15:16; 6:19, 22; 2 Pet. 1:4).</p><h2 class="head3">2. This Causes Us to Be Established in God&rsquo;s<br />Holy Nature and Thereby Be Made Holy unto God</h2><p>God&rsquo;s sanctification is of two aspects: the judicial aspect and the organic aspect. This causes us to be established in God&rsquo;s holy nature and thereby be made holy unto God (Eph. 1:4). To thus be made holy unto God is to become the New Jerusalem, the holy city, which is absolutely sanctified unto God.</p><h2 class="head2">B. That We May Be Established<br />in God&rsquo;s Organic Salvation</h2><p>God not only regenerates and renews us but also sanctifies us that we may be established in His organic salvation.</p><h2 class="head3">1. With the Element of Christ&rsquo;s Resurrection Life</h2><p>The sanctification in God&rsquo;s organic salvation is carried out by the Holy Spirit with the element of Christ&rsquo;s resurrection life to sanctify us in our disposition (Rom. 15:16) that our natural disposition, which is crooked, perverted, and full of peculiarities, may be sanctified by God&rsquo;s holy nature (2 Pet. 1:4).</p><h2 class="head3">2. For Our Entire Being to Be Wholly Sanctified</h2><p>Such a dispositional sanctification is from our spirit, through our soul, and unto our body, so that our entire being can be wholly sanctified (1 Thes. 5:23). This is not a partial sanctification. We human beings are of three parts: spirit, soul, and body. God sanctifies us, first, by taking possession of our spirit through regeneration; second, by spreading Himself as the life-giving Spirit from our spirit into our soul to saturate and transform our soul; and, last, by enlivening our mortal body through our soul and transfiguring our body by His life power, conforming it to the body of Christ&rsquo;s glory. Thus, our entire being, including our spirit, soul, and body, is wholly sanctified.</p><h2 class="head3">3. To Become as Holy<br />as the Holy City, New Jerusalem</h2><p>Such a sanctification causes us to be established in God&rsquo;s organic salvation so that we ultimately become as holy as the holy city, New Jerusalem (Rev. 21:2, 10; 22:19).</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_007.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_009.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Experience of God's Organic Salvation Equaling Reigning in Christ's Life &nbsp; pg 8</div><br></body></html>
