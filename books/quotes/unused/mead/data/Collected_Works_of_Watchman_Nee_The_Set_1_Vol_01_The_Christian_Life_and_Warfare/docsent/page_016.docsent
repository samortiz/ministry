   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>"The old man" is the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Sin is the chief motivating power of the flesh, because sin is in the flesh Rom 7:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the Bible, sin in the singular always refers to the original sin or the nature of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First John 1:8 says, "If we say that we do not have sin..."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Then verse 10 says, "If we say that we have not sinned..."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"Sin" is the nature and root of sin within us, and to have "sinned" is what "sin" has done as an act.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The old man must be crucified, and sin has to be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not crucify the old man with our own strength.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Rather, we trust in God for the fact that He has accomplished for us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>God's fact is, "Our old man has been crucified with Him in order that the body of sin might be annulled, that we should no longer serve sin as slaves" Rom 6:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We are those "who have died to sin" v. 2 and "have been baptized into His death" v. 3 . The cross of Christ is the cross of the sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>His cross has become the sinner's cross.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The human race under old Adam is fallen and is beyond reparation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>It is full of Satan's serpentine poison.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God cannot improve, modify, or reform this corrupted human race.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>His unique way is to crucify this old human race so that it can become a new race under Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This work was accomplished by the Lord Jesus on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>There is now no need for us to crucify ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All we have to do is to believe that our old man has been crucified with Him on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We should accept God's word and reckon it as true.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Apart from believing, there is no other way for the old man to be crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Believers should claim God's grace by faith in a definite way and should apply it in their experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>One should ask himself, "When the Lord Jesus died, we all died with Him; but have I personally died?"</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is where faith is applied.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a person believes that we have all been crucified with the Lord, then, based upon the general expression, "we have all been crucified," he should be able to claim that he personally has been crucified.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is dead, but he must still ask himself, "I am dead to all sins, but have I died to every single, minute sin in my life?"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This again is where faith is applied.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Since we have believed that we have died to all the sins, then, based upon the fact that we have died to all sins, we should have the faith to claim that we have died to every single sin.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have all died with the Lord, and we have died to all sins.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>These are facts in God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We should believe them and should claim them.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Every time the flesh is aroused, we should deal with it by claiming the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>As an illustration, in North America the white people used to keep the black people as slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After the struggle of a great war, the decision was made to emancipate the blacks.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In one place, most of the rich men had black slaves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When the proclamation of emancipation of the black slaves reached that place, the proclamation was not announced to the slaves, because these slaves were considered their properties.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If the proclamation had been announced, the black slaves would have soon been freed, and the owners would have suffered soon also.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When one slave found out about the proclamation, he left his master and walked away free.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Later he told the other slaves about the proclamation.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Those who believed him left their masters and also walked away free.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Man was the slave of sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But the Lord Jesus came and died for men; He won the battle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Now the Word of God proclaims us free men.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those who believe and who trust in the victory of this proclamation are free; they need not "serve sin" anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Those who do not believe may be free legally but are not free experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The black slaves had to believe individually before they could be free one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In the same way, we have to believe individually and item by item before we can no longer be "slaves of sin."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Every time something happens, we have to apply the Lord's comprehensive death and put to death that particular matter.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If we do this for every matter, we will have the experience of victory.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>"So also you, reckon yourselves to be dead to sin, but living to God in Christ Jesus" Rom 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>To "reckon" is an act of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One should reckon himself dead to sin, that is, to be dead to sin in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>To reckon does not mean to see.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If one has to see with his own eyes that he is dead to sin, probably he will not see it in his lifetime.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>To reckon is not the same as to feel.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If one has to feel that he is dead to sin, probably he will not be able to do so before he dies.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>To reckon is to believe.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Reckoning is instantaneous; a man can immediately reckon himself dead to sin, believing that he is already dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>There is no need to touch, to feel, or to see anything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>All one has to do is to believe what he reckons to be true and factual.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we reckon moment by moment and consider ourselves dead to sin moment by moment, sin will indeed be unable to lord it over us.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>On the one hand, one has to reckon himself dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>On the other hand, he has to reckon himself alive to God "in Christ Jesus" Rom 6:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Death is negative, while to be alive is positive.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When one dies, sin has no more dominion.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>When one is alive, there will be the power of God.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>"Reckon yourselves to be dead to sin..in Christ Jesus."</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This means that we are joined to Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>As Christ has died to sin, so also we reckon ourselves dead to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>As Christ is alive to God, in the same way we also reckon ourselves alive to God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This verse does not say that we ourselves are dead.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Rather, it says that we ourselves are alive "to God."</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We are dead to every sin and every fleshly thing, but we are alive to God.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If a believer only reckons himself dead to sin once, without reckoning himself alive again unto God, he will not have the power of life but will instead be very weak.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When the temptation of the flesh comes, he will fail through the lack of the power of life in his spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, if he remains on the standing of his resurrection with the Lord, his spirit will be full of the resurrection life.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Although he will face temptations in his Christian life, he "by the Spirit" will be able to "put to death the practices of the body" Rom 8:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>If this is not the case, even after reckoning himself dead to sin once, he may often return to the standing of the flesh, being unable to put to death the practices of the body.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>After a believer has once reckoned himself dead to sin, he must unceasingly remain on the standing of having been crucified with the Lord and must put to death the practices of the flesh, through his spirit which is joined to the Lord Rom 8:13 .</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Only then will he go on gradually to submit to the Holy Spirit and be a spiritual person.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Although at present, believers are not yet free from the body and still "walk in flesh" 2 Cor 10:3 , they should not walk according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Although they still "live in the flesh" Gal 2:20 , it only means that they are in their bodies; it does not mean that they are walking according to the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The believers' walk should not be "according to flesh"; they should not be entangled by the passions and the lusts of the flesh, but should walk according to the leading of the Holy Spirit in their spirit Rom 8:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Holy Spirit abiding in the spirit of the believers will work until, in experience, the body of sin is annulled, just as the Lord in the likeness of the flesh of sin was put to death on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This does not mean that henceforth we will no longer obey the lust of the flesh or walk according to flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It merely means that if we maintain the attitude of not allowing sin to reign in our mortal body Rom 6:12 while walking according to the Holy Spirit, the flesh will not have any ground, and we will not "fulfill the lust of the flesh" Gal 5:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>By this we will be kept from becoming fleshly.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God's commandment to this kind of Christian is, "Put on the Lord Jesus Christ, and make no provision for the flesh to fulfill its lusts" Rom 13:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>When at times one is unfortunately defiled by the flesh, he should "cleanse" himself 2 Cor 7:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>"Beloved, I entreat you as strangers and sojourners to abstain from fleshly lusts" 1 Pet 2:11 .</S>
