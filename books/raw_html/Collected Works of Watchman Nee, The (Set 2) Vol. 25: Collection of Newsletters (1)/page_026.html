<H1 CLASS=TITLE>ISSUE NO. 4</H1><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>April 1934</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>NEWS FROM THE THIRD OVERCOMER CONFERENCE</H2><P>The goal of writing the news of the conference is to give a brief report, by the grace of God, of the conference itself so that the brothers and sisters in every locality, who could not come to the conference, can give glory and thanks together with us to the blessed God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Prayer before the Conference</H2><P>Two months before the conference, it was announced in the prayer meeting in the church in Shanghai that there would be a third Overcomer Conference, and the brothers and sisters were asked to pray much for this matter. From that time forward, the brothers and sisters in Shanghai prayed for this conference in the prayer meetings and in their individual prayer. They prayed and petitioned at all times and in many ways for all the various aspects of the preparations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Announcements before the Conference</H2><P>More than a month before the conference, announcements concerning these meetings were mailed out and also printed in Issue No. 32 of The Present Testimony.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Registration of the Attendants<br>at the Conference</H2><P>After the announcements were sent out, the brothers and sisters who intended to come to the conference began to send in their registrations from each locality. More than one hundred brothers and more than fifty sisters registered.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Preparations before the Conference</H2><P>As the time for the conference drew near, the brothers in Shanghai discussed these matters in their brothers meeting: how to go to the train station and steamer docks to meet the brothers and sisters arriving from other localities for the conference; how to serve them in the matter of hospitality; and how to keep the order of the conference.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Greeting of those Coming for the Conference</H2><P>All the brothers and sisters coming from other localities, who had written or sent telegrams that they needed to be picked up, were met at the train station or steamer docks by brothers from Shanghai who carried a white flag. </P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>Those Attending the Conference<br>from Other Localities</H2><P>There were over one hundred twenty brothers and over forty sisters attending the conference from other localities. These brothers and sisters came from Kirin, Hopei, Shantung, Anhwei, Honan, Hupei, Kiangsu, Chekiang, Fukien, and Kwantung provinces. Those who came the farthest from the north were from Ch'ang-ch'un in Kirin province. Those who came the farthest from the south were from Tai Shan in Kwantung province.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>The Condition of the Hospitality</H2><P>Before the conference, we rented a boys' school close to Hardoon Road as a brothers' dormitory. We also borrowed a girls' school close to Hardoon Road as a dormitory for the sisters (the conference was during school vacation). All the brothers and sisters from other localities slept and ate in these two dormitories, with the exception of a few brothers who were physically weak and took hospitality elsewhere.</P><P>(1) Food. The brothers from northern Kiangsu were responsible for this matter. The food they prepared nourished the brothers' and sisters' bodies, and their patient suffering and service edified the brothers' and sisters' hearts and spirits. May the Lord remember and bless them.</P><P>(2) Service. A few responsible brothers and sisters from Shanghai were responsible for this matter. They stayed in the dormitories with the brothers and sisters from other localities. Their humbleness, diligence, and service were an example to the other brothers and sisters. May glory be given to God and blessings to them!</P><P>(3) Prayer. Every morning and evening there was prayer and a meeting in both the brothers' and sisters' dormitories. Our hope was to fill the dormitories with prayer to resist the attacks of the enemy and to bind the activities of the flesh.</P><P>(4) Fellowship. The dormitories truly provided the best opportunity on earth for the brothers to fellowship and communicate with each other. What a rare opportunity it is for all the visiting brothers to live and eat in the same place. When the brothers met each other, there was a spontaneous outflow of love and desire toward one another. Although they spoke with different accents, their speaking was the same. Although their appearance was different, their heart was one; they vied to serve one another, communicated with one another, and spoke with, exhorted, and helped one another. "Behold, how good and how pleasant it is/For brothers to dwell in unity!.../For there Jehovah commanded the blessing:/Life forever" (Psa. 133:1, 3). They did not just have personal fellowship; there was even a free mingling of news between churches and works in the various regions as a result of the brothers' fellowship.</P>
