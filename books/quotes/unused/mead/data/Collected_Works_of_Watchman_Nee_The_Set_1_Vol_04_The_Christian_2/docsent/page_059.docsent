   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In conclusion, the Bible teaches us that believers are saved forever.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>But the Bible also teaches us that believers will be punished for their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We believe and know that the Bible does not contradict itself, and God's work does not contradict itself.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The eternal salvation of the believers and their punishment are two simultaneously existing doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After reading the second group of Scriptures, we can see that other than the "outer darkness" which has no part in the cloud of glory in the air, there is mentioned the Gehenna of fire, Gehenna itself, and the hurt of the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In addition, fire is mentioned many times.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>These Scriptures lead us to believe that there is the possibility for believers to go to Gehenna.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Gehenna is the place of punishment for the saints' sins.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In the future, believers will be divided into at least three classes, those who will be rewarded, those who will receive no reward, and those who will be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The sinning ones will suffer punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But does this mean that a Christian will perish forever?</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>No, this is not the teaching of the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If we combine the first group of Scriptures with the second, we will see that since salvation is eternal for the saints, things such as Gehenna cannot be applied to them forever.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>They will experience these things in a different way than the sinners will.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Hence, we can logically conclude that after a sinning believer is judged at the judgment seat, he will go temporarily to Gehenna to be punished but will eventually be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is not the purgatory that the Roman Catholic Church speaks of.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Gehenna is for punishment rather than for the cultivation of the believers' spirituality, as purgatory claims to be.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Neither is this the so-called "restoration theology," a heresy which asserts that all sinners will be saved after they have suffered punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here we are only talking about a group of saved believers.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The words "shall by no means perish forever" in John 10:28 will solve the problem of all those who do not believe in eternal salvation for believers.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the same words serve to prove our assertion.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the original language, the words do not mean, as some versions have put them, "shall never perish."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Rather, they mean "shall by no means perish forever."</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This clearly shows us our position.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>According to the Bible, the millennium is a special age.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This age will usher in God's eternal kingdom, which is an age when righteousness reigns.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hence, everything related to the millennium is in the principle of righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A sinning believer will suffer punishment during this one thousand years.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This can be seen from Luke 18.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The Gospel of John, from its beginning to its end, tells us that eternal life comes by faith.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>However, the Lord Jesus tells us in the Gospel of Luke that if a man leaves behind everything, he shall receive "in the coming age, eternal life" Luke 18:30 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This word is so different from the words in John!</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here it does not say that one will receive as soon as he believes.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Rather, it says that one has to leave behind everything and to give up his love for the world before he can receive eternal life in the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Otherwise, he will not receive it.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Therefore, we have to realize that there is a difference between "the coming age," the future, and now.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Our present age is the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The coming age is the age of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The future is not settled yet.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Hence, there is no contradiction between John's word and Luke's word.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>John speaks of the common condition for eternal life, which is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Luke speaks of the eternal life in the age of righteousness in the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Those believers who love the world will not receive the eternal life then.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Instead they will be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When we see such a sober teaching, we will become careful.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God's grace is sufficient for us.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>God has no intention for us to suffer punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>However, sins that are committed and unconfessed will prevent the Lord's grace, which is brought in through the cross, from coming to us.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>As a result, we will suffer punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>How dreadful is Gehenna!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>How evil is sin!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>What a fearful thing it is that believers are liable to the Gehenna of fire!</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We should trust in the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The things we are speaking of here are God's best warnings to keep the saints watchful and careful.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If God's word suffers any loss through man's utterance, may the Lord forgive us!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Let us come back to Revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>How pitiful it is for believers to be overcome by the enemy through loving their life!</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Although those who faithfully serve the Lord will lose their lives, beyond the first death they will no longer be hurt by the second death.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What a promise this is!</S>
