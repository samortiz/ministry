<H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The Pillar and Base of the Truth</H2><P>The church as the house of God is also the pillar and base of the truth. As the pillar, the church supports the truth, and as the base, the church holds the truth. The truth is the Triune God with Christ as the embodiment, as the center, and as the image to produce the church to be the organism as Christ's Body, as God's home, and as God's kingdom. Anything else is not the truth, and to teach anything else is to teach differently. Doctrines such as head covering, foot washing, and methods of baptism are doctrines, but not the truth which we need to teach. The truth is just one thing&#151;the Triune God, having Christ as the center, the embodiment, the image, and the expression, to produce the church as the Body of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God. We are one in this truth. We are not one in the different small points in the Bible.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Manifestation of God in the Flesh&#151;<br>the Great Mystery of Godliness</H2><P>The church as the pillar and base of the truth is the manifestation of God in the flesh, and this is the great mystery of godliness (1 Tim. 3:15-16). The church is the continuation of Christ as the manifestation of God in the flesh.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Kingdom of God</H2><P>The church is also the kingdom of God (Matt. 16:18-19; Rom. 14:17). The kingdom of God is for the divine administration to express the divine authority (Heb. 1:8). We should be people under authority, and among us there should be the divine administration. Romans 14:17 says that today the church life is the kingdom of God.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>D. Consummating in the Holy City,<br>the New Jerusalem</H2><P>Eventually, the church as the Body of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God will consummate in the holy city, the New Jerusalem (Rev. 21&#151;22). Revelation 21:2 says that the holy city, New Jerusalem, will come down out of heaven from God. First, the New Jerusalem will be in the heavens in the thousand-year kingdom. The overcomers will be there as the co-kings of Christ in the heavenly part of the manifestation of the kingdom of the heavens. After the thousand-year kingdom, all the saints will be matured and will be included in the New Jerusalem. Then the New Jerusalem will come down out of heaven. Our dwelling place for eternity will be the New Jerusalem on the new earth. We are in the church as the Body of Christ, the house of God, and the kingdom of God, and we are on our way to becoming the new city, the New Jerusalem.</P>
