   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE RINGS AND THE BARS</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the difference between the sealing of the Holy Spirit and the keeping of the unity of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To receive the sealing of the Holy Spirit is easy.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Once we believe, we have it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>But to keep the unity of the Spirit is not as easy.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>After having it, we need to keep it.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If I were to ask if you have the sealing of the Holy Spirit, you would answer, "Amen."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But are you keeping the unity of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>That is another matter.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There may be three brothers who all believe in the Lord Jesus; therefore, they are sealed with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But since they live together in the same house, they are fighting all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Do you think they are keeping the unity of the Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Apostle Paul wrote Ephesians 1:13 in the past tense: "In Whom also believing, you were sealed."</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This has already been accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>But in chapter four, he says, "Being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>They have something, yet they lack something.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>They have been sealed with the Holy Spirit, but they are short of being diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Thus we see that the sealing of the Holy Spirit is an initial experience, but keeping the oneness of the Spirit is something of further growth and improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We all have the sealing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This occurs at the beginning of our Christian life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is without condition or terms, for it is an accomplished fact.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But keeping the oneness of the Spirit depends upon certain conditions.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You may have it, and I may not have it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>I may have it now, but I may not have it later.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>You may have it today, but you may not have it tomorrow.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Keeping the oneness of the Spirit is a great improvement from the sealing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is still one Spirit, but in two stages.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the first stage of our Christian life, the Holy Spirit is the sealing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But we must go on from the first stage to the second in order to experience the Spirit of the uniting bars.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In the first stage, the Holy Spirit is just a ring.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In ancient times, a ring was used as a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Even today some still use a ring as a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Every item of the tabernacle in Exodus has a spiritual meaning.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The golden rings on the boards are a type of the sealing Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Holy Spirit is the golden ring that seals us.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>After we were saved, we were sealed with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This can be seen in the return of the prodigal son in Luke 15.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>"The father said to his servants, Bring forth the best robe, and put it on him; and put a ring on his hand" v. 22 . The father put a robe on his son, which signifies Christ as his righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But this is not all.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He also put a ring on his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This is the sealing of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Holy Spirit was given as a seal.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>All the boards of the tabernacle had rings, but that alone could not unite them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>They needed the uniting bars.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Two brothers may be saved and have the sealing of the Holy Spirit, but they may still argue and always act independently of one another.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>They need lowliness and meekness, longsuffering, and forbearing of one another in love Eph 4:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This cannot come from their humanity; it requires another kind of humanity.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>One version says "making allowances" in place of "forbearing one another."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is why it is necessary to be diligent to keep the oneness of the Spirit in the uniting bond of peace.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>If these two brothers go on from the first stage of the Spirit to the second, there will be some improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Not only will they have experienced the Holy Spirit as the golden rings, but they will also experience Him as the uniting bars.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>In the first stage, the Holy Spirit was just a ring, purely of gold; there was no wood.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But in the second stage, something is added.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There is not only gold, but also acacia wood.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Instead of one element, there are now two.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hence, to keep the unity, we need the humanity of Jesus.</S>
