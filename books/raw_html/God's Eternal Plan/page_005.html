 <h2 class="head3">&ldquo;Your Kingdom Come&rdquo;</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s goal is to rule over the universe. His desire is to have a kingdom. &ldquo;Your kingdom come&rdquo; shows God&rsquo;s goal and desire. God wants to see His kingdom come soon. Once His kingdom comes, Satan will be overturned (Matt. 12:28). In the age of the kingdom, the overcomers will share Christ&rsquo;s glory, and Satan will be cast into the abyss and suffer shame. This is God&rsquo;s goal and desire. God wants man to pray according to this goal and desire. The Lord wants men to pray for God&rsquo;s kingdom to come to earth, which means for God&rsquo;s rule to come to earth and for God to gain His kingdom on earth.</p>
<h2 class="head3">&ldquo;Your Will Be Done, as in Heaven,<br />
so Also on Earth&rdquo;</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s will is never hindered in heaven. His will is frustrated from being executed on earth because the earth has been corrupted by Satan. It has been usurped by God&rsquo;s enemy. However, when the kingdom comes, the earth will be completely recovered, and God&rsquo;s will and desire will be executed on the earth as it is in heaven. Satan will be bound in the abyss (Rev. 20:3; cf. Luke 8:31, Dan. 10:13) and will no longer be able to frustrate God&rsquo;s will. Today the Lord wants men to pray for this and to hasten the manifestation of His will.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Section Two</h2>
<p>When a man stands on God&rsquo;s side to contend for His name, His kingdom, and His will, the enemy will attack him constantly. Everyone who makes a stand for God will come under the enemy&rsquo;s attack. This is why there is the need for protection. If there is no protection from God, we would fail. God protects us in four areas.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Food</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Give us today our daily bread.&rdquo; Without food, man cannot survive, and he cannot live for God&rsquo;s will. Man cannot give up ground to the enemy through the matter of food. It says, &ldquo;<em>Our</em> daily bread.&rdquo; An individual may not be lacking in anything, but God wants the corporate &ldquo;us&rdquo; to be without want.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Forgiving Debt</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Forgive us our debts, as we also have forgiven our debtors.&rdquo; &ldquo;Debts&rdquo; here does not refer directly to the offenses we have committed against others. Our sins are forgiven through the Lord&rsquo;s blood, yet our debts are forgiven through our forgiving our debtors.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Not Brought into Temptation</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Do not bring us into temptation.&rdquo; We should not anticipate temptation; rather, we should ask God to not bring us into temptation.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Deliverance from the Evil One</h2>
<p>&ldquo;Deliver us from the evil one.&rdquo; This is an opposing prayer that deals with Satan.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Section Three</h2>
<p>&ldquo;For Yours is the kingdom and the power and the glory forever. Amen.&rdquo; This section mentions three things that are God&rsquo;s: the kingdom, the power, and the glory. All three things belong to God forever. Satan will eventually be removed. The word &ldquo;forever&rdquo; signifies that Satan can never prevail. &ldquo;Amen&rdquo; means &ldquo;yes.&rdquo; It is like signing a signature; everything is sealed.</p>
<h2 class="head1">GOD NEEDS MAN&rsquo;S PRAYER</h2>
<p>God&rsquo;s Word repeatedly shows us that He wants man to pray. Isaiah 45:11 says, &ldquo;Thus says Jehovah, / The Holy One of Israel and the One who formed him, / Ask Me about the things to come concerning My sons, / And concerning the work of My hands, command Me.&rdquo; Jeremiah 29:12 says, &ldquo;Then you will call upon Me and come and pray to Me, and I will listen to you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Many people do not want to pray. God even wonders why men do not intercede. Isaiah 59:16 says, &ldquo;And He saw that there was no man, / And He was appalled that there was no intercessor. / Therefore His arm brought salvation to Him, / And His righteousness sustained Him.&rdquo;</p>
