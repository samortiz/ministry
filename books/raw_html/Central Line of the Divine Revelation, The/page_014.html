<P>In Exodus 30 the compound ointment is a wonderful type of the compound Spirit. Oil is a single element, but an ointment is a compounded entity. The compound ointment has the olive oil as a base, and this olive oil is compounded with four kinds of spices: myrrh, cinnamon, calamus, and cassia. This compounding produces an ointment. The priests and the tabernacle with everything related to it were anointed with this ointment. In the New Testament, 1 John 2 speaks of the divine anointing (vv. 20, 27), and this divine anointing is the anointing Spirit, the compound Spirit.</P><P>After Christ's resurrection the Spirit of God was consummated in His process. Today the Spirit indwelling us is the processed Spirit who can give life. Without being processed, without being consummated, He could never give life. Before the resurrection of Christ, He was not called the life-giving Spirit. But now after the resurrection, He has become the life-giving Spirit, and the life-giving Spirit is a compound Spirit.</P><P>The Bible calls Him the Spirit. In the last chapter of the Bible, Revelation 22, verse 17 refers to the Spirit and the bride. The Spirit is the processed Triune God, and the bride is the transformed tripartite man. The processed Triune God and the transformed tripartite man are married to be one universal couple&#151;the Spirit and the bride. Man and God, God and man, are fully blended, mingled. Through His terminating death and in His germinating resurrection, we are the new creation, which is a blending of humanity with divinity and a mingling of divinity with humanity. His death terminated the old creation and germinated, through His resurrection, the new creation. As the new creation, we have become one with the Spirit (1 Cor. 6:17).</P><P>Through the process of Christ's death and resurrection, the Holy Spirit of God has become the processed Spirit as the consummation of the Triune God (Matt. 28:19) to be the life-giving and indwelling Spirit (2 Cor. 3:6b; Rom. 8:11). We need to realize that we have the Spirit indwelling us, and the indwelling Spirit is the consummated Triune God. He is the life-giving and indwelling Spirit to seal the believers of the Son (Eph. 1:13), that is, to impart and dispense the riches of God's being as the unsearchable riches of Christ into the believers as the members of Christ for the constituting and building up of the organic Body of Christ (Eph. 3:8, 10; 4:16). The indwelling, life-giving Spirit is the sealing Spirit. The sealing ink of a seal saturates the sealed material. We are the sealed material, and we have the Spirit as the sealing ink saturating us. This saturating, this sealing, mingles us with God.</P><P>This sealing is a kind of transfusing and saturating, which is what we call the dispensing. God today, who is the life-giving Spirit indwelling us, is always sealing, saturating, transfusing, and dispensing Christ's unsearchable riches into our being to make our being blended, mingled, with the processed God. This sealing is going on to transfuse and saturate us with the processed Triune God and to impart His unsearchable riches into our being. This is the divine dispensing for the building up of the organic Body of Christ.</P><P>We are being sealed with the compound Spirit, who is God the Spirit, as the basic element, compounded with Christ's humanity, with His death and its effectiveness, and with His resurrection and its power, as typified by the compound ointment in Exodus 30:23-25. Such a Spirit is both essential in us for life and economical upon us for work (Acts 2:4; 4:31). The life-giving Spirit today is the divine essence dispensed into our being to be our very life element within us. The Spirit is also the Spirit of power upon us for us to carry out the work to accomplish God's economy.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Spirit</H2><P>As we have seen, the Spirit (John 7:39; Rev. 22:17) is the consummation of the Triune God for the mingling of the processed Triune God with the transformed tripartite man.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>IV. THE DIVINE REVELATION IN THE SCRIPTURES<br>CONCERNING THE UNIQUE AND TRIUNE GOD</H2><P>The divine revelation in the Scriptures concerning the unique and triune God is progressive, beginning from God in Genesis (1:1) and culminating in the all-inclusive Christ in Revelation (1:1; 11:15; 20:6). The progressive, divine revelation begins from God and goes higher and higher to reach Christ in Revelation as the culmination, the highest point. The sixty-six books of the Bible reveal that the highest point of the divine revelation of the person of God is Christ. This Christ today is the life-giving and indwelling Spirit, and this Spirit is the consummated Triune God. When we have this Spirit, we have the three of the Triune God. We have everything related to the processed Triune God: His all-inclusive death, His powerful resurrection, and the unsearchable riches of His being. All these are here to be our portion. Day by day this life-giving, indwelling Spirit is dispensing Himself into our being to constitute us and build us up as the organic Body of Christ.</P>
