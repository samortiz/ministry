   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Christ as the threefold seed touches the essence of the divine revelation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The revelation of the Bible is mainly an unveiling of Christ as the threefold seed: the seed of the woman Gen 3:15; Isa 7:14 , the seed of Abraham Gen 17:8; Gal 3:16 , and the seed of David 2 Sam 7:12-14; Matt 1:1, 6; 22:42-45; Rom 1:3; Rev 22:16 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The promise of the seed of the woman was given nearly six thousand years ago.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The promise concerning the seed of Abraham was given two thousand years after the first promise, and the fulfillment of that promise came two thousand years later.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The entire revelation of the Scriptures is wrapped up with the seed of the woman, the seed of Abraham, and the seed of David.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This threefold seed links Christ as God to man and Christ as man to God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, this seed makes Christ the mingling, the blending, of God and man.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As we pointed out in the previous message, the Bible tells us that Christ is the seed of only three persons: the woman Mary ; Abraham, the forefather of God's chosen people; and David, the one who founded the kingdom of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>These three are mentioned in a particular way in the genealogy of Christ in Matthew 1.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In verse 1 Christ was introduced as the son of David and the son of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This indicates that Christ is the seed of David and the seed of Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then at the end of the genealogy, Matthew records that Christ was born of Mary v. 16 . Mary's husband was Joseph, but Christ was not born of Joseph; He was born of Mary.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This indicates that Christ is her seed, the seed of the woman.</S>
