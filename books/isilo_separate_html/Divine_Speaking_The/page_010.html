<h1 class="title">THE DIVINE SPEAKING<br />
WITH THE WORD OF CHRIST</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Col. 3:16-17; 1 Tim. 6:3; 1 Thes. 1:8; Heb. 1:2</h1>
<p>In prior chapters we have seen the divine speaking in God&rsquo;s old creation and in His new creation; the divine speaking in our daily life, ministry, and meetings; and the divine speaking in the Holy Spirit and by the spirit of faith. In this chapter we come to the divine speaking with the word of Christ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">LIVING ORGANS TO SPEAK CHRIST</h2>
<p>To speak we surely need the word. I often have pondered on the wonderful fact that God created man with vocal chords for speaking. It is really foolish to say that there is no God. If there were no God, how could we have vocal chords? If there were no God, how could we have two lips and a tongue? We all know that these three members are not only for eating, they are also for speaking. Even teeth are not only for biting but also for speaking. We have vocal chords with a tongue, two lips, and many teeth for speaking. Furthermore, we not only make sounds, but we speak meaningfully, with denotation.</p>
<p>God created us with vocal chords, a tongue, lips, and teeth that we may be filled with Christ who is the Word of God. When we are filled with Christ as the Word of God, we speak. We speak Christ in a language such as Chinese, English, Greek, or Hebrew, not in nonsensical utterances. We speak Christ in our mother tongue. We speak Christ in our borrowed tongue. All the denotations of our speaking concentrate on one Person, Christ.</p>
<p>The Bible, which is called in history, the Book, concentrates on Christ. Christ is the center. Christ is the denotation. Christ is the meaning. Christ is the reality. Christ is the centrality and universality of the Book of books. &ldquo;In the beginning was the Word...and the Word became flesh&rdquo; (John 1:1, 14). This Word who was in the beginning is God. The Word is God. Our God is just the Word. The word is for speaking, speaking is for understanding, understanding is for believing, and believing is for receiving the Triune God as the speakable word. When we receive Christ, we receive the Triune God as the word for us to speak. This word is Spirit and is life. The word is God, God is the Word, this Word is the Spirit, and this Spirit is life. All these are equivalent. The Word, God, Spirit, and life are equivalent. All are one matter. The word is good for us to speak, to understand, to receive, and to believe. Faith comes from hearing, and hearing comes from preaching, from speaking (Rom. 10:14-17). Not only is our God the speaking God, but we are the speaking beings. The wonderful thing is that today our God speaks to us and we speak to Him. We not only speak to Him, we speak Him to others. We speak Him forth, we speak for Him, and we foretell and predict concerning Him. Saints, do not forget that you have been created by God to be His speaking organ. Therefore exercise to be such a living organ.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE WORD OF CHRIST, THE HEALTHY WORDS,<br />
AND THE WORDS OF THE LORD</h2>
<p>In Colossians 3:16 Paul says, &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you richly.&rdquo; The word <em>dwell</em> is a strong word meaning to make home, to make His home in you. Can anything which is lifeless dwell? We do not use such a predicate for a lifeless thing. <em>Dwell</em> is a predicate used for something living. We do not say that a bed or a nightstand dwells in our bedroom. We do not even say that our dog dwells in our bedroom. We only say a person dwells&mdash;my father dwells there, I dwell there, my wife dwells there, or my little boy dwells there. We use the word <em>dwell</em> only for a life with the highest person. &ldquo;Let the word of Christ dwell in you&rdquo; indicates that the word of Christ is a personified word that dwells as a person. Do you not believe that all the words of Christ are personified, since Christ is the Word? He is the Word of God. Phrases in the Bible such as <em>the life of God, the light of God, the love of God,</em> and <em>the word of God</em> always denote an apposition. <em>The life of God</em> means that life and God are one thing. <em>God</em> is in apposition to <em>life.</em> In the phrase <em>the love of God, love</em> is in apposition to <em>God.</em> God is love and love is God. In the same way, the word of God means that God is the Word and the Word is God. In John 6:63 the Lord Jesus says, &ldquo;The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.&rdquo; The word, the Spirit, and the life are all one thing.</p>
<p>Therefore, dear saints, to have the divine speaking is not a small matter. To have the divine speaking is to speak God. When you speak His word, you speak God. When you speak the gospel, you speak God. When you speak the glad tidings, you speak God. When you speak grace, you speak God. This is why I use this term, the divine speaking. This is not a natural human speaking but a speaking constituted with the element of God, hence, a divine speaking. For a young boy to say that a man is made by God as His vessel to contain Him, is a divine speaking. For him to say, &ldquo;You have to realize that you need Jesus; only Christ could satisfy you&rdquo; is not a human speaking but a divine speaking, fully constituted with the divine elements.</p>
<p>In 1 Timothy 6:3 Paul speaks of some foolish ones who were not consenting to &ldquo;healthy words, those of our Lord Jesus Christ.&rdquo; Some words in this universe are healthy, and these healthy words are of the Lord Jesus Christ. These healthy words heal, enliven, and raise people from the dead. In 1 Thessalonians 1:8 Paul says, &ldquo;from you the word of the Lord has sounded out, not only in Macedonia and Achaia, but in every place your faith toward God has gone out.&rdquo; In these verses we have the word of Christ, the healthy words of the Lord Jesus Christ, and the word of the Lord.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_009.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_011.html">Next</a> </body></html>
