   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHRIST OUR LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>About 25 years ago a brother asked me if I had experienced the baptism of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I said, "Please excuse me if I do not answer your question until I've asked you one!</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Do you understand the resurrection of Christ?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He replied, "I know that after the Lord died and was buried for three days, He was raised up."</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I said, "Brother, do you know that this resurrection has something to do with you?"</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He said, "Oh yes, I know!</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If the Lord had not been resurrected, He could never be my Savior!</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He would never have gone to heaven as my High Priest to pray for me!"</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I said, "That's true, but that's only the objective aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Can you tell me something subjective about the resurrection?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>He replied that he did not know what I meant by the word "subjective," so I changed my question.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>"Brother, do you have a spiritual life?"</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>He said, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Then I asked, "What is the spiritual life you have?"</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He said, "Oh, my spiritual life is the life of God in the Holy Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then I asked, "What is this life of God in the Spirit?"</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you ask such questions in detail, most Christians cannot answer satisfactorily.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today I hope you will understand that our spiritual life is nothing other than the resurrected Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Christ resurrected is our life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To this very moment, Christ is still the resurrected Lord as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We usually speak of the life of Christ, but in the Scripture you cannot find such a term.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is not the life of Christ; it is Christ as life.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1944, in China, I said to a group of believers, "Suppose you took only the Gospel of John to Mongolia and did not tell the people anything else; you only preached to them according to that Gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Then after a time, you asked the believers, Friends, where is Jesus Christ today?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Has He ascended to the heavens or not?'"</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This would not be an easy question to answer.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If they were to say, "No," I would say, "Yes."</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If they were to say, "Yes," I would say, "No."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Luke and Mark tell us clearly that certain days after the resurrection, the Lord ascended to the heavens, but not so the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It seems that the Gospel of John does not mention Christ's ascension to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But, be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On the day of resurrection, early in the morning, He did ascend to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>But He came down again on the same day.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the morning He ascended, but in the evening He came to the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And from then on He has never left His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Read the Scriptures again!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In chapter 20, in the morning, Mary of Magdalene tried to touch Him, and the Lord said, "Touch me not; for I am not yet ascended to my Father: but go to my brethren, and say unto them, I ascend unto my Father, and your Father" vv.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>16-17 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then, on that very day, in the evening, He came into the room where the disciples were John 20:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>After one week, He did the same thing and said to Thomas: "Reach hither thy hand, and thrust it into my side" John 20:26-27 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The Lord invited Thomas to touch Him, but Mary was forbidden, because He had not yet ascended to His Father.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Surely this means that in the interval the Lord had gone to His Father in heaven, but that He did not stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>It seems He went there secretly and came back secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Suppose you saw me in Los Angeles in the morning and again in the afternoon.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>You would assume I had been there all the time, for you would not have known that I had flown to San Francisco!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>I went there secretly, and I flew back secretly.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>This is what the Gospel of John portrays.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After the Lord came to the disciples in the evening of that resurrection day, there is not a word that He left them again.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He came and according to the Gospel of John, He never left them.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He had told them, I will not leave you orphans.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I will leave you for a little while, but I will come back to you John 14:18-19 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Lord left them when He died, and He returned after the resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was gone not more than seventy-two hours.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Before His death the Lord was in a physical body; He could only be among His disciples, never in them.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But after the resurrection when the Lord came back to His disciples, He could enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>How could that be?</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>While He was in the body, He could not be in them; He would have to be transfigured.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Therefore, by death and resurrection He was transfigured from the body into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>That night when the disciples were gathered together, the doors were closed; yet the Lord came in!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>And He breathed on them, saying, "Receive ye the Holy Spirit" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Thenceforth, the Lord never left them, for He was in them.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>First, the Lord was incarnated to be a man, limited by a human body.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Then, by His death and resurrection, He was transfigured from the body into the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>First, He was with us, but now He is in us!</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Now the Lord in the Spirit is always with us, living in us John 14:16-17; Rom 8:9-10 .</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>He is our resurrection life.</S>
