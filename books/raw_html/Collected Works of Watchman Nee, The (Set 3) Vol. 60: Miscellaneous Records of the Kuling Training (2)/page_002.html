<h1 class="title">PREFACE</h1><p>Volume 60 of The Collected Works is a continuation of Volume 59, comprising various messages given by Watchman Nee in two trainings with his co-workers in Kuling between 1948 and 1949. Chapters twenty-four through forty-four were given in the first training in 1948. The remaining messages were given in the second training in 1949. No specific dates are available for these later messages.</p><p>Chapters twenty-four through twenty-nine are records of question and answer sessions. Chapters thirty through thirty-eight are trainings on ways to preach the gospel. Chapters thirty-nine through forty-four are instructions for workers concerning the nature of the work.</p><p>Chapters forty-five through fifty-six are additional subjects for the new believers. They belong to the same series as Messages for Building Up New Believers (see Vol. Nos. 48 through 50). These records were only lately discovered in notes from Brother Weigh Kwang-hsi and were not included in the earlier volumes of this work.</p><p>Chapter fifty-seven is a fellowship with the workers concerning the work. It forms the final chapter of these two volumes of The Collected Works on the training at Kuling.</p>
