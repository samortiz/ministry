   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Setting Up a High Standard,</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>but in Lowliness Loving the Weaker Ones</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>First, we should never set up a high standard for others.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>To not set up a standard is the real practice of lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Because by the Lord s sovereignty I was born and raised in organized, formal, and fundamental Christianity, I have contacted many different schools, sects, and denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Although some are good, it is difficult to find any that do not raise up a high standard.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Some claim the cross as their standard, and others say that holiness, the inner life, or spirituality is their standard.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>I met a small group of persons who even claimed that their standard is the fullness of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even the fullness of Christ can be a high standard that we set up.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As long as we take something other than Christ as our standard, we do not have lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we put forth a high standard, we are not lowly in our mind and attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Neither the subjective experience of the cross, the resurrection life of Christ, the gift of speaking in tongues, healing, or mission work is our standard.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To have a mission work is not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Likewise, to speak in tongues, to have healing, to preach the cross, to have the resurrection life, and to practice holiness are not wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>What is wrong is to make these a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Regardless of how good, heavenly, or spiritual something is, as long as it is something other than Christ Himself, it will cause division.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>That is why today there is a holiness church, for example.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Even if a group does not denominate itself based on a standard, in principle it is still a division.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not even claim that Christ is our standard in a divisive way.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Claiming a spiritual standard has caused much damage in the past among all the Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The more spiritual Christians are, the more they kill others spiritually, because once someone becomes spiritual to a certain extent, he sets up that spirituality as a standard for others.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In this way, his spirituality becomes a killing to others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Those who set up a standard often say that certain persons do not come up to their standard.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is a killing.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Regardless of what kind of person one is, we should treat him or her as we treat everyone else.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Many times it is easy for us to treat spiritual people in a good way, but it is not easy to treat weak ones, young ones, and wandering ones properly.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This kind of different treatment damages the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>In the church and among Christians we need to treat everyone in the same way, regardless of his or her spirituality.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether or not someone is spiritual and whether or not he loves the Lord much, we must treat him as we do others.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>By the Lord s mercy we should treat those who do not love the Lord even better than we treat those who do.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If there is a backslider and a spiritual leading one before us, whom will we love more?</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This puts us on the test.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We probably would love the spiritual person more, but this is not right.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We all should love the backslider more.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The other brother is spiritual already, so he does not need our love and care as much.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The poor backslider, however, certainly needs our care.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we were to love him, he may no longer be a backslider.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He will be brought back by our love.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many times it is simply our cold attitude that makes someone more of a backslider.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>He may not come back to the church simply because he cannot bear the cold faces.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The weaker ones, the younger ones, and the backsliders need more love.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>From my past experience I have learned that in the church we should not overly appreciate the spiritual ones.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Rather, to love the weaker ones, the fleshly and soulish ones, and the ones with problems will solve most of their problems.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Otherwise, we will set up a high standard out of pride and not lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we do not set up a standard, we will have true lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We will be lowly minded, not highly minded.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>We will love the weaker ones, the younger ones, and the backsliding ones because the Lord loves them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>According to the four Gospels, when the Lord was on this earth, He showed more love to the sinners and tax gatherers than He did to the good ones.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This was true lowliness and humility.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>To have real humility is to set up no standard among us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is the practical way to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The church life is very spiritual, but there are also many backsliders in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The church is a family, not a college.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In a college almost everyone is in the same age bracket, from about eighteen to twenty-three, but in a family there are also younger ones, weaker ones, and even babyish ones.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The family life is a picture of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Twenty years ago I stressed our standard of spirituality more than I do today.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Today I can stand before you and say that in the church we should never set up a high spiritual standard for others.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Rather, we must love everyone, even the worst ones.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is to practice genuine lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Sacrificing Ourselves to Be Meek in Our Attitude</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Verse 2 next mentions meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>To not have a high standard is a test of our motive concerning lowliness.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Our motive must be to love everyone in lowliness regardless of a standard.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Meekness, however, is a matter of attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Our attitude must be one of meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The Greek word for meekness implies mildness, gentleness, and unselfishness.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Our attitude in the church must be mild and meek.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Therefore, we have no excuse; we all need to be broken.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>If we are selfish, we can never be genuinely meek.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Rather, our meekness will be false.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Only unselfish people have genuine meekness.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>In order to be meek, we must sacrifice ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The more we sacrifice ourselves, the meeker we will be.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If someone takes our Bible and does not return it, for example, it will be difficult to be meek in our attitude toward him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>However, if we have a sacrificing spirit, we will be willing to sacrifice a Bible for our brother.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We will say, Never mind.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Praise the Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Please use it.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>This is to be meek in our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In this message I am not expounding Ephesians 4:1-3 in the way of mere Bible teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Rather, I am speaking according to my experience.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If two brothers sit next to each other, one may be careless and kick the other one.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Similarly, if two sisters sit together on a small bench, one may take up too much room, and the other will struggle to get back her half of the bench.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>These are tests in small matters, but they involve a big principle.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>We must be willing to sacrifice ourselves regardless of how we are treated.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>If we are willing to sacrifice and be unselfish, we will be mild and meek.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Only selfish people are hard and harsh.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>Our attitude comes out of what we are.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>If we are selfish, we will have a hard, harsh attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>If we are unselfish, we will always be mild, meek, and gentle in a genuine way, not in a false way.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>In the church life we need this attitude, not a harsh, hard, or cruel attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Once in a certain restaurant a waiter spilled a cup of soup on my back.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>If I had loved my jacket, I would have said harshly, What are you doing?</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Instead, by the Lord s mercy I was able to be meek.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>I told the ones with me, Be at peace.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Do not be bothered.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Unselfishness produces meekness, mildness, and gentleness.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>In order to have the proper attitude, we must not be selfish.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>We must learn to have the proper attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>We should not claim that our heart is sincere and our motive is right.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>That is not good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Only the Lord knows our motive.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>We are not the Lord; we are human, and we cannot see someone s motive.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>We can only see his face and attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>It is not possible to speak harshly to a brother while claiming to have a good heart and motive.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Therefore, in order to keep the proper church life, we must all learn to be adjusted in our attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>In this matter we need true brokenness.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>In many local churches the problems come mostly from wrong, careless, cold, and harsh attitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>To have a right attitude is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>Satan, the subtle one, will utilize even a little carelessness in the way one brother greets another.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>He will fire a flaming dart into the brother s mind 6:16 , and when the brother is in bed that night, he will have troubled thoughts about the other brother s attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>This will create a certain amount of trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>The next day that brother will be harsh to the other one, causing the other brother to have a further reaction.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Eventually, the one careless greeting will cause a chain reaction; there will be a schism between the two brothers, and many misunderstandings will result.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>I am not speaking this in a speculative way.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>I have seen problems in the past due simply to this kind of reaction, which was due to nothing less than a little carelessness.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>In order to have the church life, we need to learn that it is something very fine, not rough.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>According to the type, the church is a cake made of fine flour Lev 2:1-5; 1 Cor 10:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Anything coarse or rough does not fit the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>I do not mean that we need to be nice in a worldly or religious way.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Rather, we must have a fine expression toward the brothers and the sisters, behaving and conducting ourselves in a fine way.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Our attitude is the most important item.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>If we would trust in the Lord for a proper attitude, we will be saved, delivered, and kept away from many misunderstandings.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Almost all the misunderstandings come out of careless attitudes.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>Satan always utilizes careless attitudes to attack the church.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>This is why we must be careful with others, not for their sake only but even more because of the subtle one.</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>The subtle one is here among us, so we need to be careful.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>We must not have carelessness in our attitude that can be taken advantage of and used for an attack by the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>Meekness is a matter of an unselfish attitude that is mild and gentle, never argues for oneself, and never makes an excuse for oneself.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Again I say, I am not presenting Ephesians 4:1-3 according to mere Bible teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>I am speaking something from my past experience concerning the practicality of the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>I suffered much due to carelessness in my attitude in the early years of my ministry, although the Lord can testify that my motive was pure.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>My motive was good, but people could not see my motive; they could see only my attitude.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>Therefore, we must be careful in our attitude and always be meek, mild, gentle, nice, and without excuses.</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Otherwise, we will have a wrong attitude, and this wrong attitude will be an advantage taken by the enemy in order to attack us.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>This is not a small matter.</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>It is very serious.</S>
