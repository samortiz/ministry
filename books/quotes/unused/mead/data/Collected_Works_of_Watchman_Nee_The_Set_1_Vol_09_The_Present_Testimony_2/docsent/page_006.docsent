   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A certain believer asked a Jew whether or not he wanted to be saved, and he said no.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The believer then compelled him to kneel down and pray that God would let him know himself.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>He realized how very filthy he was when the light of God shined.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>He saw his sins and wished that the floor would open up to swallow him.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This shows us that a sinner needs the light of God to know that he is a sinner.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is very hard for many sinners to confess that they are sinners before they are saved.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Although many sinners are truly sinners in the view of others, they themselves do not feel like sinners.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They will know how sinful and how wicked they are only when the light of God comes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The self-reproof produced by the light of God will cause them to feel that there is no hiding place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Many sinners know that they have sins.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>They feel this in their hearts and confess this with their mouths.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>To others, these people seem to have the wisdom of self-knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But when the Holy Spirit sheds forth God's light, they realize that the sins which they have confessed are only superficial and that they do not hate sins the same way as God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After this enlightenment they will utterly feel that their sins are deplorable and that they need to seek deliverance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Let me add a word here: those of us who labor in the work of God must not convince others of their sins by our arguments; rather, we can only ask the Holy Spirit to do the work of reproving people of their sins.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All kinds of self-examinations are equally shallow, inadequate, and erroneous.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Only the light of God can cause man to see the picture of his true self as God sees him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>As Christians, day by day we know ourselves not through self-examination but through the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the light of God shines upon us, we will realize that we are corrupt to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Perhaps we express much love to others.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>But when the light of God shines, we see that we have not loved others enough.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We see that we are still short in many ways toward others.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We gain many people and consider our work to be successful.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But when the light of God shines, we realize that our works are nothing but the works of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They are vain and unprofitable.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We begin to know that our works have not been done by God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Many times we think that we are doing the will of God wholeheartedly and that we are not seeking after anything for ourselves; but, when the light of God shines, we realize that we are not obeying the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I once asked Miss Barber concerning her experience in obeying the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>She said, "Every time that God delays telling me His will, then I reckon that within me there is still a heart unwilling to obey the will of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Within me there must still be an improper aim.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I realized this from many experiences."</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When we seek the will of God and do not find an answer, we should ask God to search us to see if there is any unwillingness within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When the light of God shines, we will see the inward situation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We think that we do not have any unwillingness within to obey God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>But we are cheated by our own selves.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we wash our face, do we examine ourselves to see if there is white powder, black spots, or dirty mud on our faces, or do we look into the mirror to find out?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>If we want to know ourselves, we should not think about how we are, but ask for the shining of God's light.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Only then will we know our condition.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Many times we think that our intention is not wrong, but when God's light shines upon us, we realize how much selfishness, self provision, and even unrighteousness is within us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Without God's shining, we think our living is still acceptable.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>But when it is shined upon by God, we realize that we have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In the light of God, we can then see light.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The difference between a deep Christian and a shallow Christian hinges upon how much of the light of God they have received and whether it is permanent or temporary.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Under the light of God, one sees black as black and white as white.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The shallow Christian sees his shortages on a certain point only when he is exposed by God at a particular time.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The deep Christian is constantly under God's shining, and he knows himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Some of us here may have the following experience: we see a young Christian talking about his love for the Lord and how he has consecrated everything to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But we feel that he does not know what he is talking about.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>He still does not know how difficult it is to be consecrated to God and what the result of that consecration will be in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He only speaks according to his feeling at that moment.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>This is like the Lord Jesus' response to James and John when they asked the Lord Jesus: "Grant to us to sit, one on Your right and one on Your left, in Your glory.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But Jesus said to them, You do not know what you are asking.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Are you able to drink the cup which I drink, or to be baptized with the baptism with which I am baptized?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>And they said to Him, We are able" Mark 10:37-39 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They did not know how deep and far-reaching were the things included in these two sentences.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>They hastily replied, "We are able."</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>When we do not have the light of God, we are like these two disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We do not know how weak we are, and we do not know the extent of God's requirement upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We think we are able in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When the light of God shines, then we know that in many matters of spiritual truth, all we are saying are just words.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We do not understand the meaning of them at all.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Not only will our goodness be manifested under God's light to not be good, but even what we normally consider as not good will be brought under God's light to a point where we further realize the extent of its not being good.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Oftentimes we know very well that we are weak in certain points.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We feel so.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We tell others of the same, and we tell God this in our prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>However, concerning our weakness, we do not have a deep enough feeling; we do not feel that it is so despicable.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Moreover, although we know of this weakness, we still carelessly pass the days away.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When the light of God comes, we will realize our weakness to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Only then will we desperately feel the pain of this weakness and only then will we have a heart that deplores this weakness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Furthermore, we will feel that if we are not delivered from this, we cannot live on any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The difference in depth between the self-knowledge derived from our examination and the self-knowledge received from the light of God is too great to be measured.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Therefore, friends, even if you know yourself, without the light of God you do not truly know yourself yet.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Self-knowledge derived from examination merely demonstrates what you say about yourself.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Self-knowledge received from the light of God demonstrates how God sees you.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The judgment we have concerning ourselves can never be as accurate as the judgment of God concerning us.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Here we see the difference between the light of God and knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Knowledge is what we know; it is understood in our mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>The light of God is what God knows, and it is revealed to us through His Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Many make a mistake in thinking that the light spoken of in the Bible means knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>For this reason we often hear people say that someone has much light, but his life is very poor.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This cannot be so.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Light is not knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The Bible says that knowledge puffs up.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But when the light of God shines into a man's heart, it does not puff him up.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Rather, it causes him to reprove himself, repent of the past, hate the flesh, and beg in ashes for God to deliver him from his filthiness.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>It is possible for one to be full of biblical knowledge, yet at the same time, void of any of the light of God in his heart.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>If one has backslidden, he can still tell people about the Bible from his previous understanding, but he does not have the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>God's light is knowledge which is found in the power of the Holy Spirit, and knowledge is that light of God that is retained by man in his mentality.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Knowledge has its place both in the Bible and in spiritual experiences, but knowledge apart from the power of the Holy Spirit is dead.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Scofield said, "There is nothing more dangerous than when truth is divorced from power."</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Even though we may know much truth and receive much knowledge, we have no light and are not able to know our true condition or walk on the path ahead if these are not in the power of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>If we have received light from God, we must then guard what we have received through the Holy Spirit who gave us the light, and we must make it the lasting light to our path, not letting it lose its power.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Oftentimes God gives us light and grants us true perception to a certain matter.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>During that time we seem to discern the deepest and the innermost part of the matter.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>It seems that everything is laid out before us and manifest in a naked way before our eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>After a while, even though we still remember the experience and retain the knowledge, our feeling toward the matter seems to be not as deep, as if what we now see is not as clear as before.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>At this moment, the light of God is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>What remains is nothing but knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>Note: At the very least we must walk according to the knowledge we have.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This does not mean, however, that it is enough just to have knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>We also need light.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Light can cause man to have the deepest feeling; knowledge cannot.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>Therefore, if we want to walk in the path, the shining of God is indispensable.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>Our own feelings will either completely fool us or reduce the conviction of our sin.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>We will be following a blind guide if we are to pursue holiness through our feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>There needs to be the light of God.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>Only then will the real condition of a matter be manifested.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Light means how God sees our condition and what God says.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>When God says it is wrong, it is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>When God says it is one hundred per cent wrong, it is one hundred per cent wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>Before the light comes, it is merely what you think and is not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>It is not what you say your life is, but what God says your life is.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>When Miss Barber died, she left a Bible to me.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Written in it were the words, "O God, grant me a thorough and unlimited revelation of myself."</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>How deep is this!</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>We often think that as long as we do not see anything wrong that this is good enough.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>Little do we realize that God has another kind of view regarding us.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>We will just be fooling ourselves if we do not receive the sight of God.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>We must have the boldness to be shined upon by God with His light so that He can reveal to us the real picture of ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>We have no way to know our own selves unless there is the shining of God.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Our own evaluation of ourselves is not trustworthy.</S>
