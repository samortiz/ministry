[1]  CONTENTS Not a Movement in Work but an Activity in Life Not Laboring Alone but Laboring Together with God Learning to Use the Spirit The Spirit of Christ and the Reality of Resurrection Feeding the Lord's Lambs and Shepherding the Lord's Sheep
[2]  The following five messages were given by Brother Witness Lee to the full-time trainees in Taipei between October and November of 1988 in preparation for the spread of the gospel to the whole island of Taiwan.
[3]  CHAPTER ONE NOT A MOVEMENT IN WORK BUT AN ACTIVITY IN LIFE Scripture Reading: John 15:16; 1 Cor 4:15
[4]  The main burden for this term of the training is to prepare for the spread of the gospel to the countryside that will start in January of next year.
[5]  THE LORD HAVING CHOSEN US TO GO FORTH AND BEAR FRUIT
[6]  The first one is in John 15:16: "You did not choose Me, but I chose you, and I appointed you that you should go forth and bear fruit."
[7]  If you have an inexplicable sensation within that you have been touched by the Lord, it is a proof that the Lord has chosen you.
[8]  FRUIT-BEARING REQUIRING THE MATURITY AND FRESHNESS IN LIFE
[9]  When we receive the dealings, we are receiving the breaking by the cross.
[10]  At the same time the cross breaks us, it brings in the Spirit who is life 2 Cor 4:11 .
[11]  Not only do you have to study the Bible, study the Life-study Messages, and pursue life; you must also continually consecrate yourself, pray, and receive dealings so that you will receive the Spirit through the breaking of the cross.
[12]  Only when you allow the Spirit to have the ground in you will your reading of the Lord's Word, through the mingling together of your spirit with it, give true benefits to you.
[13]  CHAPTER TWO NOT LABORING ALONE BUT LABORING TOGETHER WITH GOD Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 3:6, 9; 2 Cor 5:20; John 15:4-5 GOD'S RELATIONSHIP WITH MAN BEING A MATTER OF MINGLING
[14]  John 15:4 says, "Abide in Me and I in you."
[15]  There it says, "In this we know that we abide in Him and He in us, that He has given us of His Spirit" v. 13 . The Spirit given by God who abides in us is the witness in our spirit, testifying that we abide in God and that God abides in us.
[16]  A VISION OF THE MINGLING BEING THE CAPITAL AND THE BOLDNESS IN OUR WORK
[17]  Perhaps you are well-blended with the brothers and sisters.
[18]  But no matter how well you get along with them, your togetherness is not a mingling.
[19]  When you are mingled with God in a normal way, you are also mingled with all the brothers and sisters.
[20]  CLAIMING OUR ENJOYMENT ON THE GROUND OF OUR CO-WORKING WITH GOD
[21]  Paul said in 2 Corinthians 5:20 that we are ambassadors sent by God to beseech and to entreat others on behalf of God to repent to Him, to be reconciled to Him, and to be one with Him.
[22]  Although this work was not conducted by God Himself directly but was entrusted to Paul who carried it out as His ambassador, Paul wanted the Corinthians to know that his work was actually God's work.
[23]  In the same way, for you to work together with God and for Him to be with you, you cannot do just as you please.
[24]  If your relationship with the Lord is good, if He and you get along with each other well, and if there is no problem between you and Him, you will have no problem in coordinating with the other brothers and sisters.
[25]  If you are not properly mingled with the Lord, by the time you go to the villages for the gospel spread, you will have no interest or taste for whatever you do.
[26]  CHAPTER THREE LEARNING TO USE THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: Rom 1:9a; John 6:63; 2 Tim 1:7; Luke 9:55 CHRIST BEING THE SPHERE AND ELEMENT OF OUR SERVICE
[27]  Contacting sinners and bringing them to the Lord is not a matter apart from man; however, neither is it a matter in man's body nor a matter in man's soul.
[28]  The Chinese Union Version of the Bible confuses the heart with the spirit in John 4:24.
[29]  Most Christians not only confuse the heart with the spirit, but also make no distinction between the spirit and the soul.
[30]  If you do not use your spirit regularly, you will not be able to use your spirit when you speak to people concerning the gospel.
[31]  Therefore, you must know not only that God is the Spirit, but also that this Spirit dwells in your spirit and is one spirit with you in your spirit.
[32]  GOSPEL PREACHING BEING A MATTER NOT OF TECHNIQUES BUT OF THE SPIRIT
[33]  Superficially speaking, you have come to the training to learn some very useful techniques for home visitation.
[34]  If you always exercise to speak with your spirit, when you go for the outreach in the villages, whether people come to visit you or you go to visit them, the gospel will flow out the moment you open your mouth.
[35]  If you are a man of prayer, your word will come out of your spirit when you go out to contact people.
[36]  In 2 Timothy 1, Paul said to Timothy, "Fan into flame the gift of God which is in you through the laying on of my hands" v. 6 . Fanning into flame the gift of God has much to do with our regenerated spirit.
[37]  If you are a person following the spirit, the Scriptures you use for your gospel preaching and the songs you select will all be full of the Spirit.
[38]  CHAPTER FOUR THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST AND THE REALITY OF RESURRECTION Scripture Reading: Rom 1:3-4; 8:9-11; Phil 3:9-11
[39]  Lord, grant us the word, the expression, and the utterance that You may freely speak what You want to speak and that we may touch Your will in a real way, that we could be those who are in Your heart in this age and who take this way of resurrection in spirit.
[40]  LEARNING TO EXERCISE THE SPIRIT AND TO WALK ACCORDING TO THE SPIRIT
[41]  If someone were to say to you that you should not be suppressed by others, that you should be autonomous, and that you should not come under the restriction of coordination, the words will become very appealing to you and will suit your appetite very well.
[42]  NOT BEING IN THE NATURAL REALM BUT IN THE REALM OF RESURRECTION
[43]  I would like to mention to you in passing that some Brethren teachers say that only those who have seen the Lord Jesus can be considered as the apostles.
[44]  THE SPIRIT OF CHRIST BEING THE REALITY OF RESURRECTION
[45]  If you would practice this, it will become a habit to you, and you will not want to speak, move, or say anything apart from the spirit.
[46]  The processes that the processed Triune God went through are the putting on of humanity, the entering into death, and the coming out in resurrection.
[47]  Once He came into resurrection, the Triune God who bore humanity with Him, became the life-giving Spirit in resurrection.
[48]  CHAPTER FIVE FEEDING THE LORD'S LAMBS AND SHEPHERDING THE LORD'S SHEEP Scripture Reading: John 21:15-17
[49]  In John 21 the Lord asked Simon Peter three times if he loved Him.
[50]  Since 1943 when I saw the light concerning the tree of life, my messages and writings have never departed from the matters of life and spirit.
[51]  However, we have to know that the spirit of a man must come in contact with God the Spirit before he can be genuinely saved.
[52]  Now we are setting aside all difficulties to carry out the new way.
[53]  I feel that sooner or later we have to do this.
