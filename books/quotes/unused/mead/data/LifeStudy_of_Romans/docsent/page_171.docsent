   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REBORN SPIRIT KEEPING US</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>First John 5:4 says, For whatsoever is born of God overcometh the world.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This verse does not say whosoever, referring to a person; it says whatsoever, referring to a thing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In contrast to 1 John 3:9, which speaks of whosoever, or every one who is born of God, 1 John 5:4 speaks of whatsoever, or every thing that is born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If we understand 1 John 5:4 in the light of John 3:6, we shall realize that what is born of God is the human spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>John 3:6 says, That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Hence, 1 John 5:4 refers to our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is the reborn spirit that does not sin, and it is the reborn spirit that overcomes the world.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>First John 5:18 says, We know that whosoever is born of God sinneth not; but he that is begotten of God keepeth him, and the evil one toucheth him not Gk.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>. Who is the he that is begotten of God, and who is the him who is kept?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This verse is saying that he who is born of God keeps me.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is something within me born of God that is keeping me.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All believers have something within them that has been born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the same principle, all of us have something evil within us born of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>After Adam fell, he became one with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>But praise the Lord that we can now proclaim with confidence that we also have something within us born of God!</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>OUR PROTECTION FROM THE EVIL ONE</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This verse also says, The evil one toucheth him not.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>As long as we are kept by that which is born of God, the evil one does not touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We are protected.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Our protection from the evil one is that part within us which is born of God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>As we have pointed out, it is our human spirit that has been born of God, born of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, our regenerated spirit is our protection.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Because we have the Son, we have life 1 John 5:11-12 .</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do you know where the Son of God is within you?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He is in your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, your spirit is a place of protection, a high tower.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The very life in which and with which we overcome Satan is now in our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As long as we remain in our regenerated spirit, Satan, the evil one, cannot touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>This is the way to overcome Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we get out of the spirit and stay in the flesh, we shall keep company with Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Whenever we are in the flesh, we have Satan as our companion.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But when we are in the spirit, Christ is our companion.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Satan as sin is in our flesh, but Christ as the Spirit is in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, we should choose to stay in our spirit with Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Romans 8:4 says that if we walk according to spirit, not according to flesh, the righteous requirement of the law will be fulfilled in us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>As we walk according to spirit, we have Christ as our companion, the companion who is truly life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When we stay with Him in our spirit, we are protected within a high tower, and the evil one cannot touch us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We are either in the spirit or in the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>There is no third place for us to be.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Whenever we are out of the spirit, we are spontaneously in our flesh, where Satan dwells as sin.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>OVERCOMING SATAN BY ABIDING IN CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Do not try in yourself to overcome Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The writings of Mrs. Penn-Lewis regarding the warfare with Satan were not wrong, but they placed too much emphasis on the negative aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Mrs. Penn-Lewis said that the way to overcome Satan is by seeing that we have been crucified with Christ on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>According to the New Testament, it is a fact that through the cross Christ has destroyed the Devil Heb 2:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Nevertheless, the more we try to cross out our flesh, the more active and living our flesh becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>What Mrs. Penn-Lewis saw was mainly on the negative side the matter of reckoning ourselves dead.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>She saw very little, if any, on the positive side.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Overcoming Satan is not a matter of making up our mind to put our flesh on the cross; it is a matter of seeing that the very Christ who is life to us is now in our spirit and then of seeing that we must abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Since Christ is in our spirit, we must remain in the spirit if we would abide in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>If we stay in our spirit, we have the reality of being crucified with Christ, and we have Christ as our reigning life.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In ourselves we cannot reign over Satan, but in Christ as the reigning life we can reign over him.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Do not try to defeat Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>He is too strong, too powerful, for you.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The more you try to defeat him, the more you will be defeated by him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>None of us is an exception.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>The only way to overcome Satan is to stay in the high tower of our regenerated spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When we are in this tower, we can laugh at Satan and say, Satan, don t you know that I am here in the high tower of my spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What can you do to me?</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Very shortly, you will be crushed under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>BUILT UP IN THE BODY</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Furthermore, when we stay in the spirit, we are built up in the Body in a practical way.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>But if we stay in our minds, we shall be divided.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is true not only in the church life, but also in married life.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>If I remain in my mind and my wife remains in her mind, it will be impossible for us to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I have learned to have a healthy fear of staying in my mind.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Oh, I want to be in my spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Whenever I am in the spirit, there is no problem with oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Both in the church life and in our family life we must be afraid of our minds that are so easily set on the flesh, afraid of the division caused by our dissenting thoughts and opinions see Romans 8:6 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When we find ourselves thinking critically of others, we need to turn immediately to the Lord in our spirit and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We all must learn the lesson of turning to the spirit and staying there.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the spirit we experience not only Christ as life, but also the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In the spirit Christ is both our life personally and the life of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Therefore, in the spirit with the divine life and with the Body of Christ, Satan is overcome and even crushed under our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>He is defeated not by individuals, but by the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Never neglect your regenerated spirit, the high tower within you where you may hide from Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Whenever you are tempted to argue with your wife or husband, you should run into this tower.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Arguments in married life come from the mind assisted by the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Whenever a brother has negative thoughts about his wife, the flesh will try to provoke him to argue with her.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This indicates that the flesh is always ready to help the mind in a negative way.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>What should we do about this?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>We should escape into the high tower of our reborn spirit, the place where Satan cannot touch us, the place where we enjoy Christ as our life and experience the reality of the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>When we are in such a place, Satan can do nothing to us.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is not difficult to get into the high tower of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>We simply need to call on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>As long as we stay in our spirit, we have victory over Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>He is subdued and even crushed under our feet, and we reign over him in Christ as our life.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>May we all practice staying in the high tower of our reborn spirit.</S>
