   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER THREE CONTACTING THE LORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>BY PRAYING IN THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this chapter I have the burden to fellowship about how to contact the all-inclusive and subjective Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the preceding chapters we have seen clearly not only what Christ is in Himself but also what Christ is to us.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He is the center, He is the Head, He is the life, and He is the hope.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He is so subjective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He is more subjective than objective to us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have to know and experience Him as the subjective Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>All our experiences of Christ are based on our real knowledge of Christ as the subjective One.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our urgent need today is to know Him in a subjective way.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>If we desire to have a genuine church life, we must realize that all the life matters depend on our real experience of the subjective Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have such a Christ who is central, universal, all-inclusive, and subjective, but what is the proper way for us to contact such a Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is something clearly revealed in the Scriptures, and it is also clear to many experienced Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>However, Christians in general are not clear about this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Many Christians today do not know how to contact Christ in a practical and living way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>CHRIST BEING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>First of all, we have to know that if we are going to contact Christ, the living Christ, the subjective Christ, we have to realize what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>I do not say who He is, but what He is.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>What He is, is different from who He is.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Here we have a stand.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This stand is something of wood; it is a wooden stand.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>What is Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We need to realize what He is, and then we will know how to contact Him.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Let us read 1 Corinthians 15:45: "So also it is written, 'The first man, Adam, became a living soul'; the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This verse speaks of two Adams, the first Adam and the last Adam.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The first Adam became a living soul, and the last Adam, Christ, became a life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Greek word for life-giving is the verb form of the noun life.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Christ is the Spirit who gives life or the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>This is very important.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I was in Christianity for many years under some good teachers.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I was taught that Christ is God, the Lord, the Head, the Master, and many things, but I was never taught that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I was taught that in the Godhead there is the Holy Spirit, but I was never taught that Christ is the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have other verses to confirm the fact that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Second Corinthians 3:17 says, "The Lord is the Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>According to the context of this verse, the Lord here refers to Christ the Lord 2:12, 14-15, 17; 3:3-4, 14, 16; 4:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This then is a strong word in the Bible, telling us emphatically that Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Then Romans 8:9 says, "But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Yet if anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ, he is not of Him."</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>First it says, "The Spirit of God dwells in you," and then it says, "If anyone does not have the Spirit of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>First it mentions "the Spirit of God" and then it changes to "the Spirit of Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This proves that the Spirit of Christ is the Spirit of God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We should not consider them as two Spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Then verse 10 says, "But if Christ is in you."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>First it is "the Spirit of God"; then it is "the Spirit of Christ"; and then it is "Christ" Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Are these three or are these one?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Of course, if we read the context of this passage, we will realize that these three are one.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Spirit of God is the Spirit of Christ, and the Spirit of Christ is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>So by these verses we can clearly know that Christ today is the Spirit, the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Then we have to read John 6:63: "It is the Spirit who gives life."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Who is this Spirit?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In 1 Corinthians 15:45 we get the answer "the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When I was a young Christian, I always had the wrong concept that Christ and the Holy Spirit were separate persons.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We have to realize that Christ Himself is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If you have the Spirit, you have Christ because the Spirit is Christ Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Spirit is the reality of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Outside of the Holy Spirit, you cannot find Christ or meet Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Outside of the Holy Spirit, there is no Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Christ is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If we want to contact Christ, we must know that He is the Spirit.</S>
