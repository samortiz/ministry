You are our God and our Lord, and yet You became the life-giving Spirit to dwell in us as our life and everything. Lord, we are a group of people who can testify that we receive Your grace daily and enjoy Your presence. You speak to us every day from within, and You live in us as the strength of our practical living. Lord, we thank You all the more that You lead us in our daily living to take the pathway ahead. We beseech You to draw more people to hear Your gospel and receive You as life. We truly long for more people to be saved and to know You as the true and living God as well as the Lord who gives life that they may receive You as life.<p>Lord, we also ask that You cleanse us with Your precious blood that we may be well pleasing to You, have the anointing and the light of life, and be full of the comfort and encouragement of life within. Lord, we look to You to give us grace that we may live You and experience You daily to become one spirit with You, so that whenever we come together, we will be full of the experiences of You to be Your living testimony. May You receive our worship and exaltation. We give You all the glory and adoration. Amen.<h2 class=head1>ALL THINGS IN THE UNIVERSE AND THE EXPERIENCE OF MAN PROVING THE EXISTENCE OF GOD</h2><p>In Colossians 2:2b we see that the mystery of God is Christ. Because Christ is the explanation, manifestation, and expression of God, Christ is God&#8217;s mystery. We also see in verse 9 that all the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Christ bodily. The Godhead is just God Himself, the very Creator whom we worship. The Godhead of this One dwells in Christ bodily. Therefore, Christ is the embodiment of God.<p>God is mysterious, but He is also very real. We can prove His existence from the principles of science, physics, physiology, and all things in the universe. Tens of thousands of  Christians can also prove the existence of God from the experiences they have in their daily living. Although God is mysterious and invisible, man cannot say that there is no God just because he does not see Him. This is because invisible things are not necessarily nonexistent. Take electricity as an example. No one has seen electricity, and even those who specialize in electricity cannot pinpoint exactly where electricity is. What is seen are simply some manifestations of electricity. However, the existence of electricity is undeniable because everyone has used electricity. The specialists also tell us that there are electrical waves in the air. The term electrical waves indicates that there is energy in the air that is transmitted by the phenomenon of waves. Although electrical experts know that it is so, they do not know why it is so. Even though we do not understand it, if we tune a radio to the right frequency, the waves in the air will transmit the music to us.<p>Another example is our physical life, which is also abstract. Even the best biologists and the most brilliant doctors today have no way of showing us life. Although man&#8217;s physical life is invisible, it truly exists. Furthermore, we may say that a certain person has an evil heart. This heart is not the biological heart referred to in medicine, but the psychological heart referred to in psychology. The Bible also says that the heart of men is deceitful above all things, wicked to the uttermost, and even incurable (Jer. 17:9). The heart here also refers to the psychological heart. We all know that the physical, biological heart in man is our human heart, but no one knows where the psychological heart is located. These examples prove that we cannot say that something does not exist just because we do not see it. As a mystery, God is invisible to our physical eyes; however, through all things in the universe and our experience, we know that God exists.<br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_005.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_007.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Subjective Experience of the Indwelling Christ &nbsp; pg 6</div><br></body></html>
