 <h1 class="msg">CHAPTER NINE</h1>
<h1 class="title">BY LOVE AND BY PROPHECY</h1>
<p>In the entire New Testament, 1 Corinthians is almost the only book that deals with the matter of Christian meetings. There is nothing mentioned regarding Christian meetings in the book of Romans, and in all the other Epistles there is barely a mention of it. In 1 Corinthians there are sixteen chapters, out of which we have one portion or section which deals with the matter of meetings. This matter is very much related to the exercise of gifts, for when Christians meet together it is time for them to function by using their gifts. Thus, in this section of 1 Corinthians, which is composed of chapters twelve, thirteen and fourteen, Christian meetings are related to the exercise of the gifts.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE MANIFESTATION OF THE SPIRIT</h2>
<p>Chapter twelve mentions many things concerning spiritual matters. You may say &ldquo;spiritual gifts,&rdquo; but whatever you say, it means spiritual things. This word &ldquo;spiritual&rdquo; is not used first in chapter twelve; its first use in this book is in chapter two. In this chapter we read that the spiritual man, not the soulish man, understands the things of the Spirit (vv. 14-15). Then in chapter three, Paul says that he cannot consider the Corinthians as spiritual men (vv. 1-4). &ldquo;You are not spiritual,&rdquo; he said, &ldquo;you are still carnal [fleshly].&rdquo; We have already pointed out that to be spiritual means to be in the spirit. Likewise, to be carnal means to be in the flesh. When you act in the flesh, you are fleshly, but when you walk and act in the spirit, you are spiritual. A spiritual person is one who lives, works and acts in the spirit. Undoubtedly, when we are in the spirit, there will be a certain kind of manifestation upon us&mdash;the manifestation of the Spirit.</p>
<p>Some Christians say that the manifestation of the Holy Spirit is only ninefold. But if you read through chapter twelve of 1 Corinthians carefully and through the remainder of the New Testament, you will discover that the manifestation of the Spirit is much more than nine. I would ask you to read verse 28 of chapter twelve. In this verse we have helps and governments. But these two items are not included in the manifestation of the Spirit listed in verses 7 through 10. God has set these helps and governments in the church; are they not a further manifestation of the Spirit? Then in Acts chapter two we have the matter of dreams. It says there that the young men shall see visions, and the old men shall dream dreams (v. 17). Are these not also the manifestation of the Spirit? You see, the nine items listed in 12:7-10 are not the only manifestation of the Spirit. People also say the fruit of the Spirit, as listed in Galatians 5:22, 23, is only ninefold. But do you really believe that the fruit of the Holy Spirit is only nine? In Galatians 5:22 there is no humility, no holiness, and no righteousness mentioned. But are these not also the fruit of the Spirit? Yes. Besides these, there are also many more aspects of the fruit of the Spirit.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE GREATER GIFT AND THE EXCELLENT WAY</h2>
<p>Now let us come back to chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen. At the conclusion of chapter twelve the Apostle says that we should desire earnestly &ldquo;the best gifts.&rdquo; This indicates that some of the gifts mentioned in this chapter are good, but they are not the best. The King James Version does not render this word quite accurately. It should not be &ldquo;covet earnestly the best gifts,&rdquo; but &ldquo;covet earnestly the greater gifts.&rdquo; So we have gifts and greater gifts. Paul said that we should desire the greater gifts.</p>
<p>I believe that many of you have read these three chapters and are familiar with them. Let me ask you: Is healing a greater gift? Is speaking in tongues a greater gift? I believe that fairly speaking you will have to answer, &ldquo;No.&rdquo; Then, comparatively speaking, which gift is greater? The answer is, the gift that builds up the church. So Paul says, &ldquo;I had rather speak five words with my understanding...than ten thousand words in an unknown tongue&rdquo; that the church may be built up. The greater gift is not speaking in tongues nor healing, but prophesying, for it is prophesying that builds up the church.</p>
<p>Paul told us that we should covet earnestly the greater gifts, yet he said that he would show us an excellent way. So we not only need the gifts, but also the way. You may have the gifts, but you may not have the way. You may be so great in the gifts, but so poor in the way. On one hand Paul said, &ldquo;I encourage you to desire the greater gifts,&rdquo; but on the other hand, &ldquo;I show you now an excellent way.&rdquo; What is the excellent way? Love! &ldquo;Though I speak with the tongues of men and of angels, and have not love, I am become as sounding brass, or a tinkling cymbal&rdquo; (13:1). What are sounding brass and tinkling cymbal? They are sounds without life. If I speak without love, I am a tinkling cymbal; there is the sound, but no life. Then the Apostle goes on to say that prophecy shall fail, tongues shall cease, and knowledge shall vanish away, but love never faileth (13:8), love is the greatest. And in chapter fourteen, verse 1, he gives the conclusion: &ldquo;Pursue love.&rdquo; The King James Version says, &ldquo;Follow after charity,&rdquo; but the better translation is, &ldquo;Pursue love.&rdquo; &ldquo;Pursue love and desire the spiritual gifts, but rather that ye may prophesy.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Then in chapter fourteen, verse 5, the Apostle says, &ldquo;I would that ye all spake with tongues.&rdquo; This proves that not all the Corinthian believers spoke in tongues; otherwise, there would be no need for the Apostle Paul to say such a thing. He says, &ldquo;I would that ye all spake with tongues, but rather that ye prophesied.&rdquo; To prophesy is a greater gift than to speak in tongues; the Apostle was encouraging them to prophesy. In verse 31 he says, &ldquo;For ye can [Greek] all prophesy one by one.&rdquo; If you take the initiative with your spirit to prophesy, then the Holy Spirit, who is one with your spirit, will cooperate with you. &ldquo;The spirits of the prophets are subject to the prophets&rdquo; (v. 32). You can give your spirit the order to prophesy; your spirit is subject to you. Then, finally, in verse 39 the Apostle says, &ldquo;Wherefore, brethren, covet to prophesy, and forbid not to speak with tongues.&rdquo; The Apostle is so balanced: to speak with tongues is not so great, it is not so important as prophesying, yet we should not forbid it.</p>
<p>Now we have gone rapidly through these three chapters, chapters twelve, thirteen, and fourteen. The main impression we get from them is that there are two outstanding things we must seek&mdash;love and prophecy. We need to pursue love, and we must seek to prophesy. Forgive me to say a word to you at this time. Forget the impressions you have received in the past. Let us come to the pure Word and read these three chapters again and again. I have read through these three chapters many times, especially in recent days, with the purpose of getting more deeply into them. I have read them with the help of all kinds of versions and translations, with the concordance and with the Greek. Out of it all has come this&mdash;the summary and main thought of the writer in these three chapters is that we must pursue love as the excellent way and seek prophecy as the greater gift. This is all the church needs today. The church needs the love and the prophecy.</p>
<p>Brothers and sisters, have you realized that both love and prophecy are things of the Spirit and that these are the very things that build up the church? If you read 1 Corinthians, you will see that in this one book there are only two things that build up: the first is love (8:1) and the second is prophecy (14:5). How can the church be built up? By love and by prophecy. What is love? Love is Christ as life in my spirit for my living in my daily walk. In other words, my living is Christ as life expressed in the form of love. And what is prophecy? Prophecy is also Christ in my spirit as a kind of ministry for function in the meetings. In my daily walk I have Christ as life expressed in the form of love, and in the meetings I have Christ as my ministry for my function. We need love for our living and prophecy for our function in the meetings.</p>
