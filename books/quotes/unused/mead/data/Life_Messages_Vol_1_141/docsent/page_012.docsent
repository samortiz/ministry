   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CONCERNED ABOUT HOW TO MEET</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>There is talk among us about how to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Are we for a good meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Are we for a piano or a guitar?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Are we for a certain style meeting?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>No!</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When you come to the meeting, you must come with Christ and in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You must come into Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If you say our meeting is too legal, that there is too much ministry, that you prefer an informal, family-style meeting, you are far from the center lane.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I want to say a word here for the whole recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We have no particular way to meet.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Nearly all our meetings are open to everyone.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If you have Christ, you are free to share Christ with the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>If you say our meetings are too formal, I say I do not know of anything on earth which does not have a form.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Without a form nothing can exist.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A family-style meeting is a form.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In fact, it is more formal, because you insist on it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If we insist on any way to meet, that way is a form.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This is not of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It causes division.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>TWO ASPECTS OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Now let us come back to a further point regarding God's economy.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We have seen that it is not something religious or ethical, but Christ wrought into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Now we need to consider who Christ is.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Gospel of John reveals this One as the Word 1:1 and also as the Spirit 14:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Hallelujah!</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>God has given us two precious treasures, the Spirit within and the Word without.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In one aspect the Lord Jesus is the Word; in the other aspect, He is the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Why are there these two aspects?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>It is that God cares about our experience of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE LORD JESUS AS THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without the Spirit we cannot experience Him.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>How could we be in Him and He in us?</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>All by the Spirit!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Are you not in the air?</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Is not the air in you?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The Lord Jesus today is the life-giving Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The Greek word pneuma means both spirit and air.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The Lord Jesus is the heavenly, spiritual air.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are now in this Pneuma and this Pneuma is in us.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Because He is the Spirit, I have the full assurance that I am in the Spirit and the Spirit is in me.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why after His resurrection He came back to His disciples, breathed into them, and told them, "Receive the Holy Pneuma" John 20:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today we are all in the Holy Pneuma, and the Holy Pneuma is in all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>THE LORD JESUS AS THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If God had given us only the Spirit without the Word, we could easily be misled, because the Spirit is not tangible.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>In contrast, the Word is so solid, so touchable.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever we have a particular experience of the Spirit, we must check the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This is our safeguard.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>THE BALANCE BETWEEN THE WORD AND THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If you care only for the Word and disregard the Spirit, you may be accurate in your beliefs, but you will be dead within.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Word is our safeguard, the Spirit our livingness.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>These two extremes are apparent in Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The fundamentalists stress the written Word; the Pentecostalists, a kind of "Spirit."</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The Lord's desire is to balance us between the Spirit and the Word, the Word and the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If you regard only the Spirit and neglect the Word, your spiritual life will peter out.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>After not too long a time you will have the sense that your spirit is extinguished and that you have no way to kindle it again.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>You may try prayer, but you will find that no words come to your lips.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Many of us have experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>When you run out in the spirit and have no words on your lips to pray, there is a prayer book you can turn to, the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Just open the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Disregard your feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Do not try to compose a prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Suppose you open to John 1:1.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Just read it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Even without any feeling, sometimes as you read, something within is kindled and prayer spontaneously rises, not in your own words, but from the written Word.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>"Lord, I thank You.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>You were in the beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>You are the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>O Lord, You are just God.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>How I thank You that in You is life."</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>The Word is spontaneously kindling your spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is how the wonderful Lord who is both the Word and the Spirit will be your experience.</S>
