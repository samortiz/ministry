   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR THE PROPER ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>IN THE CHURCH Scripture Reading: Eph 4:4-6; Matt 18:19; Acts 1:14; Phil 1:27; 1 Cor 1:10; Rev 1:4a, 11-12, 20; 2:1, 8, 12, 18; 3:1, 7, 14; 2:7, 11, 17, 29; 3:6, 13, 22; 1 Cor 4:17; 7:17; Col 4:16; 1 Cor 11:16; 14:33-34; Acts 15:1-31; 1 Thes 2:14; 1 Cor 1:11-13; Phil 1:15, 17 THE ONE ACCORD</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>BEING THE PRACTICE OF THE ONENESS</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I have put the genuine oneness first and the proper one accord second.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Strictly speaking, the genuine oneness is not of the church but of the Body; it is the Body's own organic oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In Ephesians 4:4, after telling us to keep the oneness of the Spirit, Paul did not say, "One church and one Spirit..."; rather, he said, "One Body and one Spirit..."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The church may be plural as the churches in different localities, but the Body could never be plural.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Whether it is viewed locally or universally, the Body is one.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In contrast, the church is universally one but locally many.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>In the Body we need oneness; in the churches and among the churches, we need the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The one accord is for our practice; the oneness is primarily for the actuality, for the fact.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In John 17 the Lord Jesus prayed for such a fact, and on the day of Pentecost, by pouring out Himself as the consummated Spirit, He accomplished His prayer.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>That was the actuality of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After the accomplishment of the actuality of the oneness, there is the need for the practice of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When the oneness is practiced, it becomes the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The one accord is the practice of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we have only the oneness as an actuality, and do not have the present, practical one accord, the oneness that we have will be objective and abstract; it will not be real to us.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If we would apply the oneness accomplished by the outpouring of the Spirit, we must practice the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If among us there is no one accord, how could we say that there is oneness?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If in a prayer meeting we each pray in our own way, without any accord among us, how could we say that we are practicing the oneness?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>As long as we have differences existing among us, the oneness is not applied.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>We must have the one accord to swallow up all the differences; then oneness will be present.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The practice of the proper one accord in the church is the application of the oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although oneness and one accord seem to be synonymous, there is a difference between them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The Lord did not teach us concerning oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In John 17 He prayed for oneness, but in Matthew 18 He led us to practice the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In Matthew 18:19 the Lord spoke of two praying together on earth in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>That was His leading, His training, and His directing us to pray in one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>As a test of whether we are practicing the oneness or not, we may check to see whether there is one accord in our prayer meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>When certain ones pray, we may shake our head as an indication of our displeasure, and when others pray, we may nod our head as an expression of our agreement.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a shaking and nodding of our head is strong evidence that we do no practice oneness, because we do not have the one accord.</S>
