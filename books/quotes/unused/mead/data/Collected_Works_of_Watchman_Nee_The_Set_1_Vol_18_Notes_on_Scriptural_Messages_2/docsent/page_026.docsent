   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>COMING TO SHANGHAI THE FIRST TIME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In 1922 I came to Shanghai.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>At that time, I only gave a little testimony at the Shou-jin Chapel on North Szechuan Road.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I did not "establish a congregation" or "propagate my teaching," nor was I "not well received by the Shanghai community."</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>PUBLISHING THE PRESENT TESTIMONY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>By the end of 1922 I had a burden to publish a magazine, because a number had been saved in Foochow, and the number was increasing.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At that time, Brother Leland Wang was away in the Yangtze region doing evangelistic work.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Only his wife and children were at home.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>He asked me to move into his house to help take care of the family.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Daily, Sister Wang and I prayed for the magazine.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>I was at that time extremely pressed financially.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>After praying for more than a month, there was not a single dollar on hand.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>One morning I arose and said, "There is no need to pray that would be a lack of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What I must do is start writing.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>God need not put the money into our hands before we begin to write!</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Henceforth, I will no longer pray for this matter, but will proceed with the preparation of drafts."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When everything was ready and the last word had been written, I said, "Now the money will come."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Eventually, I knelt down to pray again, saying, "O God, the draft is ready for printing, but there is still no money."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After praying thus, I felt wonderfully confident that God would certainly give the money.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We began to praise God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The amazing thing was that we had no more risen to our feet than there was a knock at the door.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>I thought someone was coming with the money.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That house being Sister Wang's, I let her answer the door.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>To my surprise, the one who came was a wealthy yet stingy sister.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>"Oh, since it is she," I thought, "there could be no money."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But she said to me, "I have something extremely important to see you about."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>"Please tell me," I replied.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then she asked, "How should a Christian donate?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I replied that we should not adopt the Old Testament way of paying tithes, but follow the word in 2 Corinthians 9:7, which says that each person should give according to the order of God.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He may donate a half, a third, a tenth, or a twentieth of his income.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>She then asked, "Where should the donation be made?"</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>I answered, "Do not give it to a church which opposes the Lord, nor to those who do not believe the Bible or the redemption of the Lord's shed blood.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If no one contributes to them, they will not be able to carry on their preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Pray before each donation; then give it either to the poor or to some work, but never to any improper organization."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>She said, "The Lord has been speaking to me for many days concerning my excessive devotion to money.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>At first I could not reconcile myself to this, but now I can do so.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When I was praying this morning, the Lord said to me, There is no need for you to pray anymore.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Just start giving away your money.'</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I was rather disconcerted, but now I am here with thirty dollars for you to use for the Lord's work."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This money was just sufficient for the printing of fourteen hundred copies of The Present Testimony.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Later, another person gave an additional thirty dollars, which was sufficient for the postage and incidental expenses.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is how the first issue of The Present Testimony was published.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE BEGINNING OF REVIVAL</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Later Brother Wang Lian-chun joined us.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At that time, there were about twenty people; some had left the denominations and some had been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Brother Leland Wang had the intention to invite Sister Ruth Lee to come to Foochow to conduct meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>At the beginning, I thought it was too much trouble to invite her to come from such a faraway place.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Later, she was invited anyway by Mrs. Wang and by my mother.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>In January 1923, Miss Lee came to Foochow, and we prepared ourselves for the meetings and gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Before that, we were meeting in Brother Wang's sitting room.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now that we needed to hold special meetings, there was no meeting place and no chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Moreover, we were afraid that no one would come.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>As a result, we decided to meet in the pavilion of Brother Wang's house.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Stools were collected from various places when needed, and we went about the neighborhood inviting people to come and listen.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Because the Lord had started something, it was easy for many people to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Originally, we considered doing some work at the beginning of the Chinese New Year.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But Miss Lee had some other engagements in Nanking and had to leave Foochow.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We could only send her away.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>We also considered asking Miss M.E. Barber from Ma-kiang to come and help us.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But she declined on the ground that she did not know what kind of meeting we had.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I discussed with Brother Wang about whether or not to continue with our meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>At that time, Brother Wang had a cold, and I had already sent letters to Brothers Faithful Luke and Simon Meek, who had gone home for vacation, to come back right away.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We had no other way but to continue with the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Our method of inviting people was very effective: each brother wore a white vest bearing words like "You shall die" in the front and "Believe in Jesus to be saved" at the back.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>There were other similar slogans.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>With banners in our hands, we paraded everywhere, singing as we marched along the way.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Those who saw us marveled.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>In this way, many people were brought to the meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>We marched this way every day, and every day people came to listen to the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>They filled the sitting room, kitchen, and outside pavilion.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>We had rented some stools for the meeting, but the rental period expired after two weeks.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>When the time was up, we had no money.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>The stools had to be returned to the owner.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Must the meetings be suspended?</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>I announced that anybody who wished to attend the meeting in the future would have to bring his own stool.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>That afternoon, the whole hill, Tsang Chien Hill, was the scene of people, old and young, boys and girls, carrying stools.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even the police were amazed at the sight.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>After every meeting, we announced that those who wanted to leave their stools behind could do so and that we would try our best to take care of them.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I also mentioned that if there were any loss, we would not be responsible for them, and that those who wanted to carry them back should do so.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>In this way, we conducted meetings three times a day, and every time, people brought their own chairs.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Thank the Lord, through His special blessing, a few hundred people were saved.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>On that occasion the foundation of salvation was clearly laid down.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Until this time, many believers in China were not clear about salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>But seven or eight years since, through those meetings and the preaching of our brothers in various places, many have now come to understand it.</S>
