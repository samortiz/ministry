   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HOLY SPIRIT BEING WITH OUR SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After the enlivening and renewing of our spirit, the Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit and lives in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The Holy Spirit is now mingled with our spirit, which is one spirit 1 Cor 6:17 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Romans 8:16 says, The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This indicates that the Holy Spirit dwells in our spirit and also is mingled with our spirit as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, not only is our spirit, including the conscience, made alive and renewed, but the life and nature of God Himself dwells within our spirit, which is mingled with the Holy Spirit as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Holy Spirit who indwells us is always operating within us and anointing us.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Our spirit is no longer merely a human spirit because something new has been added into it.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For example, grape juice, sugar, and a little fruit syrup can be added to a glass of pure water.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Once these ingredients are added to the water, it becomes a delicious drink.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Likewise, there are new ingredients in the spirit of a believer.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The spirit that is frequently referred to in the New Testament Epistles, such as the spirit according to which we should walk in Romans 8:4, is a spirit with these new ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Chinese Union Version of the Bible, small dots are often placed beside the word Holy when the words Holy Spirit are used in the Epistles.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This indicates that the word Holy is not in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The word spirit in many of these places refers not only to the Holy Spirit of God but also to the mingled spirit the Holy Spirit mingled with our spirit as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Ephesians 6:18 speaks of praying at every time in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In this verse the Chinese Union Version translates spirit as Holy Spirit, even though the word Holy is not in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Spirit in this verse actually refers to our mingled spirit with its new ingredients.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The apostle exhorted us to pray in such a spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Romans 8:4-6 says, That the righteous requirement of the law might be fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to the flesh but according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>For those who are according to the flesh mind the things of the flesh; but those who are according to the spirit, the things of the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>For the mind set on the flesh is death, but the mind set on the spirit is life and peace.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In these verses, the Chinese Union Version again translates the word spirit as Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>There are small dots beside the word Holy, indicating that the original text does not have this word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Therefore, the spirit in these three verses is not simply the Holy Spirit but the spirit that is mingled with the Spirit as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Our spirit which is mingled with the Spirit is versus the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As Christians, we should not walk according to the flesh but walk according to the spirit, that is, the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Romans 8:2 speaks of the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Chinese Union Version translates this as the law of the Holy Spirit who gives life.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>However, the words Holy and gives are not in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Hence, the literal translation is simply the law of the Spirit of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Spirit of life is also the spirit that is the mingling of the Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Galatians 5:16 says, Walk by the Spirit and you shall by no means fulfill the lust of the flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Verse 25 says, If we live by the Spirit, let us also walk by the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The Chinese Union Version uses Holy Spirit in both verses, but it should simply be the Spirit, which is the mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the Bible there are many such examples.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Walking according to the Spirit is to walk according to our enlivened and renewed spirit, which is the issue of the mingling of the Spirit with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>THE SENSE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Since our spirit has been enlivened and renewed, the function of our conscience has been restored, the life of God, even God Himself, is moving in us, and the Spirit of God is anointing us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Therefore, our spirit is full of feelings.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Our human spirit has been made alive and is fresh, our conscience has been enlightened, the life of God, even God Himself, is moving within us, and the Holy Spirit is anointing us within.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>It is difficult to comprehend just how living and how full of feelings we are within!</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>WALKING ACCORDING TO THE SENSE OF THE SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>To walk according to the spirit is to walk according to the sense of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Whether we should speak, how we should speak, how much we should speak, to whom we should speak, and where we should speak should all be according to the sense in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Whether we should do a certain thing, go to a certain place, or contact a certain person should all be according to the sense in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Whether we should use a certain thing, buy a certain thing, speak a certain message, or pray for a certain matter should be according to the sense in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Whenever we walk according to the sense in the spirit, we are following the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>If someone asks us whether he can go to a movie or wear certain clothing, we should direct him to his sense within.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should not ask others whether we should do something; we should check the sense in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Our living and walk as Christians are not according to the teachings we hear in sermons or the opinions and suggestions of other people.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>We should reject not only our flesh and lust but also the common, traditional teachings and general concepts of Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We should put aside all of man s views, ideas, and opinions and turn to our deepest part to walk according to the sense of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Whenever we follow our flesh, indulge our lust, or live according to our preference, we are defeated Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Whenever we follow our concepts and walk according to our opinions, we are natural Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Neither of these walks is acceptable to God.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God desires Christians who are simple, direct, and single, caring only for the sense of the spirit and walking according to the sense of the spirit before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This is to walk according to the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After a person is saved and is genuinely open before the Lord, having consecrated himself to the Lord, the Holy Spirit within him has the ground to operate and anoint him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>As a result, there is much feeling in his spirit, and he will have a sense concerning all matters.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When he is about to speak, a sense within may tell him not to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When he wants to say something additional, the sense in his spirit may tell him that enough has been said.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>When he wants to criticize someone, his spirit will feel uneasy.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The sense in his spirit even guides him in the things that he buys.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>When he wants to contact his friends, the sense in his spirit will indicate whether it is appropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>All these senses come from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Sometimes it is from the conscience, but most of the time it is from the intuition, a sense that comes directly from the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When I was young and newly saved, my heart was burning for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>At the time, the Chinese New Year was coming, but I had not thought much about it.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Early in the morning, on the day of the New Year, I knelt down to pray and read the Bible and was full of the Lord s presence.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>I had no thought or feeling in regard to the Chinese New Year.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>After praying, I saw my mother, and she said, Son, have you forgotten the Chinese New Year?</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>You have not put on your new clothes.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>She then took out a new robe, which I put on.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After finishing breakfast, I went back to my room to pray.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>However, my spirit was uneasy, and I could not touch the Lord in my prayers.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>When I asked the Lord about this, I only had a sense that the problem was related to the New Year robe.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>I immediately took off the robe, changed back to my old clothes, and knelt down to pray again.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>Immediately, the spirit within was alive.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This shows the intuition of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>It was my first clear experience of the sense of the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>This shows that being a Christian is not a matter of following numerous regulations involving what we should and should not do.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Within Christians is a wonderful mingled spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>From the day of our salvation, the Holy Spirit lives in our spirit and is mingled with our spirit as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>This Holy Spirit is constantly operating in our spirit and anointing us.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>He gives us feelings in everything so that we may know how to conduct ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The sense given to us in the operation of the Holy Spirit often seems like it is our feeling, because this function comes out of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This feeling of the Holy Spirit is the feeling of the Spirit that is mingled with our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Many Christians expect the Holy Spirit to knock them over like a violent wind when they pray, causing them to be greatly moved and to repent in tears.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Although I dare not say that this is not good, I can say that this is not very precious.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The most precious thing about being a Christian is that in our spirit there is a constant speaking, a constant sense; it is a sense and a speaking at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Often we think a reaction is simply a thought, but actually it is the feeling of our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>This kind of feeling continues unceasingly even though it is gentle and does not compel.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>We should treasure, focus on, and take care of this feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We should immediately obey this feeling; we do not need a strong wind to blow upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Waiting for the Holy Spirit to blow upon us as a strong wind is not normal.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>A powerful moving of the Holy Spirit can be Satan in disguise and thus not reliable.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>The most reliable and proper feeling is often a gentle sense that does not compel.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>It is like a voice but not a voice; it is a sense that prompts but does not compel.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This most precious sense is the operating and anointing of the Holy Spirit within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>When the Bible speaks of the work of the Holy Spirit within the human spirit, it speaks of operation and anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Although this operation and anointing is powerful, it is not violent.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>It can be compared to applying ointment to one s skin.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>No one violently applies ointment to his skin, as if he were beating his skin.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>The applying of ointment is always gentle, tender, and full of feeling.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>The operation of the Holy Spirit within our spirit is also gentle and tender.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The Holy Spirit is not like a tiger; rather, He is like a dove.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>He is not rough but gentle.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>When we are rough, a dove will often fly away.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>The operation of the Holy Spirit within us is tender yet powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>He never stops operating within us, even when we reject Him.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>If we ignore the sense He gives us in the morning, He will still operate during the night.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If we ignore His operation during the night, He will still anoint us in the morning, because He continually operates within us.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>This is the work of the Holy Spirit within our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>We should not think that this moving of the Holy Spirit is something extraordinary.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>Some people have an inaccurate concept regarding the moving of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When they pray, they anticipate something extraordinary, thinking that the moving of the Holy Spirit will rush upon them.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>They prepare themselves for a powerful move of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>But the moving of the Holy Spirit is not like this.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>From the day we were saved, the Holy Spirit lives in us and mingles with our spirit as one spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Like an ointment, He operates and anoints us within.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>It is impossible to distinguish between the feeling of our spirit and the feeling of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>We should not even try.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>Whenever there is a sense in our deepest part, in principle, we should pay attention to it and take care of it.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>We should walk before God according to the sense in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>This is to walk according to the spirit.</S>
