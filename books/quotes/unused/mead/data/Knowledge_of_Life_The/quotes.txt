[1]  Although we know that God s desire and intention is to gain a corporate man, having His image, manifesting His glory, and possessing His authority to deal with His enemy that He Himself may gain eternal rest, yet very few know that this great desire and intention of God can only be attained through His own life.
[2]  In order to know life, we must know what life is.
[3]  This shows us that in the eyes of God, only His life is life; besides that, no other life can be counted as life.
[4]  However, not only is being divine a characteristic of God s life, but it is even more the essence of His life, whereas being eternal is only a characteristic of the life of God.
[5]  Because the life of God is the unique life, whenever the New Testament in the original Greek speaks of this life, it always uses the word zoe, which refers to the highest life John 1:4; 1 John 1:2, 5:12; etc. . Beside this, the original text of the New Testament also uses 1 bios to speak of the life of the flesh Luke 8:43; 21:4; etc. and 2 psuche to speak of the soul life or the natural life of man Matt 16:25-26; Luke 9:24; etc. .
[6]  Then we must see that life is the flowing out of God.
[7]  Revelation 22:1-2 speaks of a river of water of life flowing out of the throne of God, and in the river of water of life is the tree of life.
[8]  It shows us even more that life is Christ.
[9]  Life was God; then God became flesh, which is Christ.
[10]  We will now ask the second question: What is the experience of life?
[11]  God Himself flowing into us, being received and experienced by us, is life.
[12]  All experience that is not such is not the experience of life, for life is God, and to experience life is to experience God.
[13]  This means that we all, that is, the Body, experience Christ till we are full of the elements and constitution of Christ; thus, we grow and are full of the stature of the fullness of Christ.
[14]  Romans 8:9-11 shows us not only that it is the Holy Spirit who enables us to experience the indwelling of Christ and the resurrection power of God, but also that it is the Holy Spirit abiding in us who causes us to experience that life is Christ, and it is God abiding in us who causes us to experience life.
[15]  Now we come to see the first experience of life, which is regeneration.
[16]  If we desire to seek growth in life, we must understand what regeneration is all about, and we must know what we have gained through regeneration.
[17]  Regeneration affords us a beginning in life, and that which is gained through regeneration affords us the growth in life.
[18]  Hence, if we want to seek growth in life, we should have some knowledge concerning regeneration, and we should know that which is gained through regeneration.
[19]  Since regeneration gives us the life of God, it also gives us the law of life.
[20]  Because the life of God entered into us, the law of life which is contained in this life was brought into us too.
[21]  Thus, when the life of God enters into us, the law of life contained in it also enters into us.
[22]  We have seen in chapter one that in the life of God is contained the nature of God, and in the life of God is hidden the fullness of God; therefore, the law contained in the life of God is compatible with God Himself, with what God is, and with the nature of God; hence, this law is the law of God Himself.
[23]  Likewise, the natural laws contained in the life of God in us are its natural abilities; they enable us to know spontaneously how God would want us to act and behave, how to be pleasing to Him and how we may live out Himself.
[24]  Thus, not only does regeneration cause us to have a new heart; it also causes us to have a new spirit.
[25]  After Ezekiel 36:26 says that God gives us a new heart and puts within us a new spirit, verse 27 goes on to say that God puts His own Spirit within us.
[26]  Therefore, among the things which we gain through regeneration, there is also the Spirit of God.
[27]  Originally, we did not have the Spirit of God.
[28]  And not only did we not have the Spirit of God, but our own spirit was dead toward God.
[29]  When God regenerated us, on one hand He caused His Spirit to put His life into our spirit, thus quickening our dead spirit; and on the other hand, God also put His Spirit into our spirit, which means that He caused His Spirit to dwell in our quickened, new spirit.
[30]  All that God is and all that He in Christ has prepared for us, and all that Christ is and all that He by His death and resurrection has accomplished for us, are revealed and imparted to us as reality by this Spirit of God who dwells in us.
[31]  Romans 8:9-10 shows us that the Spirit of God dwelling in us is the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us; and the Spirit of Christ dwelling in us is Christ dwelling in us.
[32]  This reveals that the Spirit of God in us is the embodiment of Christ.
[33]  Since regeneration causes us to have the Spirit of God within us, it also causes us to have Christ within us.
[34]  Although it is His Spirit who puts His life in us, and although it is His Spirit who enables us to know, experience, and live out His life, yet His life is Christ.
[35]  But when the Bible mentions the Holy Spirit dwelling in us, the emphasis is on His anointing in us 1 John 2:27 ; when it mentions Christ dwelling in us, the emphasis is on His living in us as our life Gal 2:20 ; and when it mentions God dwelling in us, the emphasis is on His working in us Phil 2:13; Heb 13:21; 1 Cor 12:6 .
[36]  We have seen what life is and what the experience of life is.
[37]  We have also seen the first experience of life, which is regeneration, and the various things which are gained through regeneration.
[38]  Now that we have seen these, we can come to the matter of the sense of life.
[39]  Where does the sense of life we are speaking of come from?
[40]  It is produced from the things we have gained through regeneration the life of God, the law of life, the Holy Spirit, Christ, and God.
[41]  The life of God is the strongest life; therefore, when this life is in us it causes us not merely to have feelings, but to have strong feelings.
[42]  In this book we are giving our attention to the matter of life, hoping to accomplish two things: first, to help every brother and sister know whether he or she has the experience of life we mention here or not; second, to lead brothers and sisters to understand the way of life thoroughly, so that later all may go to other places and speak it forth in spirit.
[43]  This book is not for general teaching, but is a special investigation.
[44]  Although it is the life of God which gives us the fellowship of life, yet it is the Holy Spirit of God who causes us to practically enjoy this fellowship of life.
[45]  Now we shall see the seventh main point, namely, the sense of the spirit and knowing the spirit.
[46]  Because every experience of life is in the spirit, knowing the spirit is a basic issue in the experience of life.
[47]  Except for the lowest plant life, every life definitely has a certain consciousness.
[48]  The life of the Spirit of life spoken of here is the life of God Himself, which is the highest life; therefore, it is the richest in consciousness.
[49]  This life within us causes us to be full of spiritual consciousness, enabling us to sense the spirit and the things of the spirit.
[50]  He not only descends upon man, causing man to obtain the power of God outwardly, and He not only moves man, causing man to know his sin, confess, repent, and believe in the Lord; but He further enters into man, so that man may have the life of God inwardly, and He also dwells within man as the Spirit of life.
[51]  If we live in the spirit and walk by minding the spirit, the sense of this life will cause us to feel that we are in touch with God, and that God is in us as our life, our power, and our all; thus, we will be happy, restful, comfortable, and satisfied.
[52]  THE SENSE OF THE LAW OF THE SPIRIT OF LIFE
[53]  This law is the law of the life of God.
[54]  We have seen the sense of the spirit and knowing the spirit; now we shall see the difference between the spirit and the soul.
[55]  Thus, even if we do not sin and have been freed from sin, so that in man s eyes we are not fleshly, this does not mean that we are necessarily spiritual and not soulish; neither does it mean that we can surely understand the things of the Spirit of God, or that we can apprehend, appreciate, and receive the things of God.
[56]  THE SOULISH MAN AND THE SPIRITUAL MAN A. The Soulish Man
[57]  Regardless of whether a man is in the mind, in the emotion, or in the will, he is soulish.
[58]  We have seen that a fallen man, dead as he is in spirit, can only live by the soul.
[59]  Furthermore, God saves us so that we can return to the spirit and live by the spirit.
[60]  God s salvation saves man from the soul to the spirit so that man does not live by the soul but by the spirit.
[61]  We now come to see the ninth main point in the knowledge of life the three lives and four laws.
[62]  This is a truth of extreme importance in the Bible.
[63]  If we want to clearly know the condition of our inner spiritual life, or if we desire to lead an overcoming life free from sins, a thorough understanding of this basic truth is necessary.
[64]  The three lives spoken of here are the three lives that are within every saved one man s life, Satan s life, and God s life.
[65]  This shows that one who believes in the Son of God and is saved has not only his own original human life and the life of Satan obtained through the fall, but also the eternal life of God.
[66]  D. The Nature and Condition of the Three Lives
[67]  Since each of the three different lives which we obtained within us has its own origin and dwells separately in one of the three different parts of our being, then the nature of these three lives and their respective conditions within us must also be different and rather complicated.
[68]  Just as Satan, through his corruption, injected his life into us and caused us to be united with him, gained by him, and possessed of all the evils of his nature; so also God, through His deliverance, puts His life into us and causes us to be united with Him, gained by Him, and possessed of all the divine goodness of His nature.
[69]  Although sometimes it seems that we can be independent and live neither according to the life of Satan nor according to the life of God, but only according to our human life, yet actually we cannot be independent; either we live according to the life of God, or we live according to the life of Satan.
[70]  Each of the three lives within us who are saved has a law.
[71]  Therefore, concerning the origin of these four laws we can say that the law of God, derived from God, is of God; the law of good in the mind, derived from the life of man, is of man; the law of sin in the members, derived from Satan s life, is of Satan; and the law of the Spirit of life, derived from the Spirit of life, is of the spirit.
[72]  D. The Nature and Function of the Four Laws
[73]  What are the nature and functions of these four laws outside and inside of us?
[74]  The law of good in our mind, derived from our created, human life of good, contains the good human nature and exactly fits the nature of the law of God outside of us.
[75]  Especially when the law of God outside of us requires us to be good, this law of good in us gives us the inclination toward doing good.
[76]  Here we have three main points: first, life is the nature of the life of God, whereas good is the nature of the life of man; second, life is good, but good is not necessarily life; third, the tree of life and the tree of good and evil in the Garden of Eden show us that life and good are definitely different; life is neither good nor evil.
[77]  The law of the Spirit of life is derived from the strongest life, the life of God; hence the power of this law is also the strongest; it not only keeps us from obeying the law of sin to commit sin, but also enables us to obey itself and live out the life of God naturally.
[78]  The law in our soul, derived from the created, good human life, is good and gives us the desire to do good; the law in our body, derived from the fallen, evil life of Satan, is evil and causes us to sin; the law in our spirit, derived from the uncreated, divine life of God, is divine and causes us to live out the divine life of God.
[79]  In the last chapter we have seen the three lives and four laws.
[80]  Now we shall especially see the law of life, which is also the law of the Spirit of life mentioned in the last chapter.
[81]  Because of these needs, God s way of deliverance consists of two aspects, the negative and the positive.
[82]  On the negative side, by the Lord Jesus shedding His blood on the cross, redemption was accomplished, and the problem of man s sin was settled.
[83]  On the positive side, by the death of the Lord Jesus, the life of God was released; then by the resurrection of the Lord Jesus, the life of God was put in the Holy Spirit; eventually the Holy Spirit entering into us causes us to obtain God s divine and eternal life.
[84]  Then by the words, He shines upon us and moves us; He causes us to acknowledge our sins, reproach ourselves, repent and believe, thereby accepting the words of God and receiving the life of God.
[85]  If we live by this life and the nature of this life, we can become like God and live out the image of God.
[86]  Then it spreads gradually from our spirit into every part of our soul and makes our thoughts, affections, and decisions gradually become like God s, having the savor of God; even in our anger, there is something of God s likeness, something of the savor of God.
[87]  Hence, when He dwells in our new spirit, He can use His unlimited power to anoint and supply us, to work and move within us; thus, He enables us to answer the unlimited demand of God upon us, thereby allowing the life of God to expand continually from our spirit, through our soul, and into our body.
[88]  If we would know the meaning of the law of life, we must know what a law is.
[89]  A law is not necessarily derived from a life, but a life is definitely accompanied by a law.
[90]  In the first chapter, What Is Life?, we said that only the life of God is life; therefore, the law of life of which we are now speaking refers specifically to the law of the life of God.
[91]  From these two examples we can clearly see that our entire spiritual life before God cannot be accomplished by our own striving; neither can it be achieved by self-improvement with utmost effort; rather, it is the responsibility of the life of God which we have already received into us.
[92]  The life of God accompanied by the law of this life dwells in our spirit; if we live and act according to this law of life in our spirit, this law of life can very naturally regulate out from within us, item by item, all the content within the life of God.
[93]  THE SEAT OF THE LAW OF LIFE A. The Seat of the Working of the Law of Life
[94]  The life from which issues the law of life is the life of God.
[95]  When at our regeneration we first receive this life, this life within us, though it is complete organically, is not grown up and mature in each individual part of our whole being.
[96]  The heart is the entrance and exit of life: the coming in of life and the going out of life both depend on the heart.
[97]  Since we have seen the seat of the law of life, we know that this law of life works in the various inward parts of our whole being.
[98]  Yet in actual practice, if the law of life is to work freely in our various inward parts, we need to fulfill two requirements:
[99]  In this way the veil within us is taken away see 2 Cor 3:16 , and we can see light, receive revelation, and know God and the life of God.
[100]  In this way we allow the law of the life of God to freely work within us and supply every part of our entire being with all the riches of the life of God.
[101]  The function of adding which is in the law of life is derived from the element of the Lord s resurrection contained in the life; therefore, just as the Lord s resurrection brought man into God, enabling man to participate in all of God Himself, so also today, through the working of the law of life, His resurrection is being applied within us.
[102]  Besides the two functions mentioned above, the law of life also has power.
[103]  When Christ is thus gradually formed in us, we are gradually transformed into the image of the Lord 2 Cor 3:18 and have the image of the Son of God Rom 8:29 until eventually we are entirely like him 1 John 3:2 .
[104]  Then, by the shining of the light of the life of God, we recognize our self, we resist our self, and by the Holy Spirit we crucify our self and allow only the life of God to live out from us.
[105]  This shows us that God puts His law of life within us because He wants to be our God in this law of life, and He wants us to be His people in this law of life.
[106]  He wants not only that man take Him as God, but even more that man have His life.
[107]  Only when man has His life and becomes His son can man really know that He is God and really allow Him to be God.
[108]  In the morning of His resurrection, the Lord Jesus told Mary Magdalene, I ascend unto my Father and your Father; and my God and your God John 20:17 .
[109]  We shall now see the eleventh main point concerning life, which is the inward knowledge, or the knowing of God by the inward law of life and the teaching of the anointing.
[110]  If we want to know life so that life may grow, we must examine in detail the inward knowledge.
[111]  Let us pray that God may give us a spirit of wisdom and revelation so that we may really know Him Eph 1:17 and be growing by the full knowledge of God Col 1:10 .
[112]  In the New Testament, there are four places which speak very clearly of the inward knowledge.
[113]  Both of these say that we do not need others to teach us, but that we can know God from within.
[114]  These four passages in the Bible show us that our inward knowledge of God is by two means: one is by the law of life, which comes from the life of God; the other is by the teaching of the anointing, which comes from the Holy Spirit of God.
[115]  Though the law and the prophets of the Old Testament could cause the children of Israel to know God, it was all outward knowledge, not inward.
[116]  Therefore, in New Testament times, God put His Spirit with His life in us, thus enabling us to have an inward knowledge of Him.
[117]  The law of life, which comes from His life, takes the place of the law of the Old Testament and enables us to know His nature from within.
[118]  Therefore, when the law of the life of God in us expresses its function and regulates us, it always reveals to us the nature of God.
[119]  When the law of life is working in us, enabling us to know the nature of God, the result is that it makes the manner, character, and taste of our entire living correspond to the nature of God.
[120]  Though the law of life and the teaching of the anointing have different functions and are not the same, yet they are very closely related.
[121]  The mutual cause and effect of one on the other cannot be separated.
[122]  Therefore, this law is also called the law of the Spirit of life Rom 8:2 , and is also a law of the Holy Spirit.
[123]  The inner sense given to us by the law of life and the teaching of the anointing enables us to know God.
[124]  AND UNDERSTANDING IN THE MIND A. Knowing in the Spirit
[125]  Since the inward knowledge issues from the law of life and from the teaching of God s Spirit as the anointing, and both are in our spirit, this knowledge from within will definitely be made known to us in our spirit.
[126]  Now that we have seen every aspect of the inward knowledge, we must see the way of practice or the way of obtaining the inward knowledge.
[127]  To obtain the inward knowledge, we must exercise the spirit, renew the understanding, and deal with the heart.
[128]  Since the inward knowledge is in the intuition of our spirit, if we want to obtain such knowledge, we must often exercise and use our spirit so that it is lively and strong.
[129]  It is only when the spirit is lively and strong that the intuition of the spirit is conscious and alert, thus enabling us to know God from within.
[130]  The heart is the aggregate of man; therefore, if the heart has problems, all the activities of the spirit and life within us will suffer hindrance and limitation.
[131]  Even though our spirit is alert and our understanding is renewed, if there are problems with our heart, we still cannot obtain the inward knowledge of God.
[132]  In Matthew 11:25, the Lord says that God has hid the spiritual things from the wise and understanding and has revealed them unto babes.
[133]  If our heart is not pure in that we have inclinations and desires other than God, there is within us a veil which hinders us from seeing God clearly.
[134]  If our heart does not submit or is not willing to submit to the working of God within us, God cannot work in us; thus, we cannot receive the consciousness which His working would give us in the knowledge of Himself.
[135]  Therefore, we must 1 exercise and use the spirit until it is strong and alert, 2 have our understanding renewed by the Spirit, and 3 deal with our heart until it is soft and pure, loving God, wanting God, and submissive to God; then we can have the inward knowledge of God.
[136]  When God is in us as life, He causes us to have a law of divine life within, which regulates us from within continuously, causing us to know the nature of His life.
[137]  Now we shall see the twelfth main point concerning the knowledge of life, which is the growth of life.
[138]  If we desire to have further knowledge of life, we must also know what the growth of life is.
[139]  There are many brothers and sisters whose hearts love toward the Lord cannot be said to lack fervency, and the price they have paid also cannot be considered insufficient, yet because they do not know what the real growth of life is, they have many mistaken views and pursuits; thus, the real growth of life in them is quite limited.
[140]  Though the increase of a believer s spiritual knowledge through hearing more messages, knowing more truths, understanding more of the Bible, and comprehending more spiritual terms, etc., is a kind of growth, yet it is not growth of life.
[141]  It is not that the Holy Spirit has given greater revelation within him or that life has gained more ground within him so that he has growth in the real knowledge and experience of Christ as life.
[142]  We can say that when we are regenerated, it is Christ being born again within us to be our life.
[143]  Such a man whose natural life has been broken learns no longer to rely on the power of his natural life or to live by his natural life, but he continually depends on the power of the life of God and lives by the life of God.
[144]  Now we shall see the thirteenth main point concerning the knowledge of life: the outlet of life.
[145]  If we want to know the way of life and pursue after the growth of life, we must be clear about the outlet of life, the way through which life comes out from within us.
[146]  To deal with our heart is to deal with the purity of our heart, that is, to cause our heart to desire God, love God, and incline toward God in simplicity, having no other love or desire beside God.
[147]  When life grows out from within us, the second place through which it passes is the emotion of our heart.
[148]  With the emotion of the heart, it is a question of love.
[149]  When he speaks here of the mercy of God, it is also to move our emotion, to make us love the Lord, want the Lord, seek after the Lord, and consecrate ourselves to the Lord; then we can understand the things of God.
[150]  Fourthly, the growing out of life passes through our will.
[151]  We have seen that the heart needs to be pure, the conscience needs to be without offense, the emotion needs to be loving, and the mind needs to be renewed.
[152]  If we can deal with our heart until it is pure, without offense, loving the Lord, clear and proficient, and pliable, then we have a heart which is useful to the life of God, and we can allow the life of God to have a clear outlet from within us.
[153]  Having seen where life is, the exit of life, and the passage of life, we know that if we want the life of God to have a way to grow out from us, we must deal with our spirit, heart, conscience, emotion, mind, and will until there are no problems in them.
[154]  Now we shall see the last main point concerning the knowledge of life: light and life.
[155]  From both the words of God and our own experiences, we see that light is especially related to life.
[156]  We may say that it is due to our being enlightened that we receive life.
[157]  We have said again and again that God s intention in saving us is not for us to be evil men or good men, but to be life-men or God-men.
[158]  Therefore, after we are saved, we should not merely attain to the standard of morality in our behavior and live out the goodness of man, but we should reach the standard of life in our living and live out the life of God.
[159]  The whole Bible reveals that life comes from the shining of light.
[160]  Since life rests with light, with what then does light rest?
[161]  From the Bible we see that light rests with the Word of God.
[162]  Only when the Holy Spirit in our spirit gives us revelation, opening up the word of the Bible to us, does the word become the living Word of God which can cause us to obtain the light of God.
[163]  If you obey whenever God speaks to you, your experience is quite different: your first obedience to the Word of God produces an opening within through which light can shine in; and when you obey the Word of God again, there is another opening through which more light can shine in. If you continue to thus obey, you will be like the four living creatures, with the body round about full of eyes Rev 4:8 , being so transparent, full of light and full of life.
[164]  Speaking from God s side, enlightening rests absolutely on the mercy of God.
[165]  Since enlightenment rests wholly in the controlling hand of God and depends entirely upon His mercy, should we then be completely passive and indifferent?
[166]  At this stage, whatever kind of guidance we need within, God will give us that kind of guidance; whatever kind of light we need, God will show us that kind of light; and whatever growth our life needs, God will, by the shining of light, cause our life to have that growth.
