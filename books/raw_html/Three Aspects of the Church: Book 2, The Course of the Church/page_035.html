<h1 class="title">THE UNION OF THE CHURCH AND POLITICS</h1>
<h2 class="head1">THE UNION OF<br />
THE CHURCH AND POLITICS<br />
UNDER CONSTANTINE</h2>
<p>The union of the church and politics is the union of the church and human government. Originally the church was apart from the world. Although it was in the world, the church had no relationship with the world. Church history shows that Judaism and Greek culture were brought into the church; this troubled the church.</p>
<p>The transmutation of the church in administration and organization began with the Judaic system, methods, and priesthood, a group of specialists in serving God, being brought into the church. While Greek culture influenced the church, its impact was not as damaging as Judaism. Judaism took root in the church, damaging the life of the church and dealing it a severe blow.</p>
<p>The Roman Empire persecuted the church throughout the first three centuries. In the fourth century the Roman Empire changed its attitude, no longer persecuting the church but welcoming it and giving it a special position. This change in attitude began after Constantine became the emperor of Rome. Although he was not baptized until he was on his deathbed, he welcomed Christianity. He used many methods to encourage the populace to reject pagan religions and embrace Christianity. He did this not for God but to solidify his own political power. The real issue of this history is the effect that the Roman Empire&rsquo;s acceptance of Christianity had on the spiritual condition of the church.</p>
<p>After Constantine died, his sons still favored Christianity. Later, a few emperors opposed Christianity, but most of them accepted and supported it. During Constantine&rsquo;s reign, Christianity was not yet the official state religion. Christianity was not declared the official state religion until the reign of Theodosius I in A.D. 380. At that time all Roman citizens were required to become Christians. Later, Theodosius ordered the destruction of all idol temples in the empire and the abolishment of all pagan religions. Christianity became the official religion of the Roman Empire, and the church was completely united with the Roman government. This was not a small matter.</p>
<p>The transmutation of the organization and administration of the church began with Clement around A.D. 100; it continued from that time, growing worse and worse until A.D. 312, when Constantine united the church with the Roman Empire. The union of the church and the Roman Empire completed the transmutation of the administration and organization of the church. It was about two hundred and eighty years from the day of Pentecost (in approximately A.D. 34) to the church&rsquo;s complete transmutation in administration and organization. The system of bishops was instituted in approximately A.D. 250. At that time, as bishop of Carthage, Cyprian wrote letters teaching and requiring others to accept that the system of bishops should be practiced in the church.</p>
<p>Satan&rsquo;s work to ruin, damage, defile, disturb, and confuse the church did not stop with the system of bishops. When the bishops were introduced, the church was not yet united with the Roman government. The Roman Empire did not fully change its attitude toward the church until A.D. 320. About sixty years later, the Roman Empire formally adopted Christianity as its official religion. This completed the union of the church with the world. While it may seem that the church had gained the victory and that the Roman Empire was under its hand, in reality, the world was united with the church, and the world had come into the church. The mixture of the church with the world caused the church to lose its pure nature. The church and the Roman Empire were united to such an extent that it was almost as if the church was the Roman Empire and the Roman Empire was the church. The Roman emperors even appointed some unbaptized men as bishops. Since then the church has never escaped this mixture with politics; the problem has gotten worse and worse.</p>
<p>According to the Bible, God does not intervene in this age to deal with things that defile the church. For example, with regard to the transmutation of the administration of the church, we think that it would be good if God would intervene to correct the transmuted condition. However, God does not intervene but allows the transmutation to continue and even to worsen. With regard to the union of the church and the world, we might think that God should intervene to stop such a union, but He does not intervene at all; He allows it to happen. From the Middle Ages onward, European history is a matter of the union of politics with religion. The two are completely intertwined. Sometimes the church is the stronger of the two, and sometimes the political power is greater. Moreover, all the corrupt things in the world&mdash;idols, deceitfulness, power struggles, scheming, uncleanness, fame, and lust for position&mdash;can all be found in the church. This fulfills the Lord&rsquo;s word in the epistle to the church in Pergamos in Revelation 2; the church is truly married to the world.</p>
<p>Thus, the church is not only in desolation; it is also corrupted. The world has been brought into the church; this is a great matter in the course of the church. By A.D. 400 the church was thoroughly corrupted; however, not everyone in the church participated in the corruption. There are many examples in church history of ones who loved the Lord and did not take part in the corruption; they did not want a transmuted church, and they did not approve of the union of the church with human government. Although these were few in number, they loved the Lord with a pure heart and followed Him faithfully, never accepting the corrupted and transmuted condition of the church. They stood apart from the corruption and transmutation; thus, they were not part of the unified, catholic church. Rather, they were excommunicated from the catholic church. This line of overcomers has continued unbroken throughout church history.</p>
