   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ADDITIONAL WORD 2</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In the last message on the mystery of Christ, the church, there were two main points that I would like you to pay attention to: the mysterious enjoyment of the unsearchable riches of Christ for the manifestation of the multifarious wisdom of God and the mysterious making home in our heart by Christ unto our being filled with the breadth, length, height, and depth of what Christ is to become all the fullness of God.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>THE NEED FOR REAL EXPERIENCE</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>These two items, the riches of Christ and His making home in our hearts, on the one hand touch our personal experience and on the other hand consummate in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The manifestation of the multifarious wisdom of God as well as becoming all the fullness of God point to the highest plane that the church can attain to, which is to be the ultimate expression of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We can talk about these two items in doctrine, but it is difficult to find out what they involve in experience.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Neither of these two items are mere doctrines.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They require experience.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Although they are mysterious, we should have experience concerning them.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Concerning the riches of Christ, we may say that they refer to all that Christ is, such as light and life.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But we are often not clear as to how to experience them.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Christ's making home in our hearts also includes many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>But how can they be experienced?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We should be very definite concerning these matters.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>According to the revelation of Ephesians 3, these two items, the enjoyment of the riches of Christ and His making home in our hearts, though personal in their experience, have to do with the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Only when we have the experience of these two items can there be the real Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If we want to have the practical church life, we must enjoy the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The reason the church life is weak, low, and empty is our lack of experience concerning the riches of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In addition, Christ must make home in the church before it can be solid, uplifted, and strong.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Only through this will the church become all the fullness of God for the expression of His multifarious wisdom.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is very definite.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is something that every one of us should experience.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Such teachings have been spoken among us frequently.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But it is not easy for them to gain our attention.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>I do not know how many there are who, as a result of listening to or reading these messages that we have released, have paid the price to study what it is to enjoy the riches of Christ and what it is to have Christ making home in our hearts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>There is no need to talk about others.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Do we have some definite pursuit concerning the riches of Christ ourselves?</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Do we have real experiences of Christ making home in our hearts?</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Can someone point out in a concrete way which item of the riches of Christ he has experienced?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Can someone tell us how Christ is making home in his heart?</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>These matters are very crucial, for they have to do with the Body of Christ, the church.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>No wonder Ephesians 3:17-19 says that when Christ makes home in our hearts, we will be able to comprehend with all the saints the breadth, length, height, and depth, as the universal dimensions of Christ, that we may be filled to become all the fullness of God.</S>
