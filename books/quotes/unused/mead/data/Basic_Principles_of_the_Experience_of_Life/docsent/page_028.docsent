   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CARING FOR THE INWARD FLOW</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>To be a Christian is not an outward matter; it is an inward matter.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>While we are doing something, we should check to see if the inward current is still flowing within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Many times I have had a certain thought to do something, and I even have spoken with someone about it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>After a few words, however, I stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Sometimes this surprises people.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They say, "Brother Lee, you started to raise a matter, but after two words you just stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>What happened to you?"</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>I prefer not to explain, but I know I have to stop because the inward flow stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I know that I cannot persist.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We must always keep ourselves in the flow of the inward current.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>There is no need to argue about this.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Argument gets us nowhere.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Even while we are arguing or doing something else against the Lord, we have the inner sense that the flow within us is stopped.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When this happens, we need to stop in order to recover the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We may have many questions, but to care for the inward flow of life is the one answer which is good for all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>There is no need to ask about many things.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We must simply care for whether or not the current within us is stopped or is flowing.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To be a Christian is very simple, but often people do not believe this.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The divine life constantly flows as a current; this is the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>To be a Christian with this flow within is simple, but to be a Christian without the inward flow is very complicated.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Brothers and sisters, we must practice to be inward Christians, not outward ones.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>To do this will save us much trouble, and we will understand many things more deeply because we are in the inward flow, the inward fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must make the Christian life so simple.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We should not check with many persons and talk about many matters.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The more we ask and the more we talk, the more we are complicated and confused.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We simply lose our direction; we do not know what is "north, south, east, or west," and our way is foggy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>However, if we come back to the inward flow, the sky is clear.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We are heavenly clear, eternally clear and transparent.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>All the "smog" is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Try this.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Make the Christian life simple in the flow, the fellowship, of life.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We have life.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Now we need to be in the fellowship of life.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Then we will have the light, we will enjoy the cleansing of the blood, and we will share the anointing.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Then the anointing will bring more fellowship, more light, and more cleansing of the blood in a cycle.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is wonderful!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This is the way of growth, and this is the proper spiritual way to go on with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>I hope we will not take this message lightly or merely as a doctrine or teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>May we take this as a direction for our day-by-day exercise.</S>
