   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Psalms 48:2 also mentions "in the uttermost parts of the north" according to the original text .</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"Beautiful for situation, the joy of the whole earth, / is mount Zion, on the sides of the north, / the city of the great King."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>It seems this Mount Zion, the city of the great King, refers to the earthly Jerusalem because it is "the joy of the whole earth."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But it also implies the heavenly Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The earthly Jerusalem is not in the uttermost parts of the north.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Therefore, this mount should at least imply "Mount Zion...the city of the living God, the heavenly Jerusalem" Heb 12:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This is heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Psalms 75:1 says, "Unto thee, O God, do we give thanks, / unto thee do we give thanks: / for that thy name is near thy wondrous works declare."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is the praise by the psalmist.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Verse 2 continues: "When I shall find the set time, I will judge uprightly" ASV .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>This is spoken by God.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>"When I shall find the set time" is also translated as "when I shall receive the congregation" KJV .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is related to the "mount of assembly" heaven in Isaiah 14.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Psalms 75:3-7 says, "The earth and all the inhabitants thereof are dissolved: / I bear up the pillars of it.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Selah.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>/ I said unto the fools, Deal not foolishly: / and to the wicked, Lift not up the horn: / lift not up your horn on high: / speak not with a stiff neck.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>/ For promotion cometh neither from the east, / nor from the west, nor from the south.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>/ But God is the judge: / he putteth down one, and setteth up another."</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Here, God warns the people not to seek help from the east, nor from the west, nor from the south.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is very meaningful that He does not include north as a direction not to call for help!</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>When we read the expression "For promotion cometh neither from the east, / Nor from the west, nor from the south," naturally we would think that promotion comes from the north.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Following the words "neither from the east, / nor from the west, nor from the south," it says, "But God is the judge."</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We can see that the unmentioned north is intimately related to God's dwelling.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although God did not ask the people to seek help from the north, it is evident that the heaven where God dwells is in that direction.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Where God receives the assembly and executes His justice and judgment is in the north.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>When the prophet Ezekiel saw a vision of God, he beheld a whirlwind that "came out of the north, a great cloud, and a fire infolding itself, and a brightness was about it, and out of the midst thereof as the color of amber, out of the midst of the fire" Ezek.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>1:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The "cloud," "brightness," and "amber" all represent God's glory, which is from the north.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In the book of Ezekiel, this word "north" is mentioned over forty times, and it is quite often amazingly related to God's administration and God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Zechariah 6:6-8 says, "The black horses went forth to the land of the north, and the white horses went forth after them, and the speckled horses went forth to the land of the south.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>And the strong horses went forth and sought to proceed to go to and fro on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>And He said, Proceed to go to and fro on the earth; and they went to and fro on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then He called out to me and spoke to me, saying, See, these who are going forth to the land of the north have given My Spirit rest in the land of the north."</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here the use of the word "north" is also very significant.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The earth's geographic and magnetic poles both point toward the north.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>How wonderful it is!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Who can know the reason why the compass always points towards the north?</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the Constellation of the Swan in the north, there is a place where the surroundings are all stars, yet this space is without any star.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This empty space is known by some astronomers as the "dark nebula" or by others as the "rift of the sky."</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Job 26:7 says, "He God stretcheth out the north over the empty place."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Can this "empty place" not be the same as the "rift"?</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If the uttermost part of the north is in the midst of this, then should heaven not also be in it?</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We will certainly find out one day!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Job 26:7 is another good proof of heaven being in the uttermost part of the north.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>"He stretcheth out the north over the empty place, / and hangeth the earth upon nothing."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Here, "the earth" and "the north" are in opposition.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>"Nothing" refers to the atmospheric air enveloping the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If "nothing" means the atmosphere, then the empty place over which the north is placed cannot be the same atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It must be where heaven is.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Heaven is therefore in the north.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Astronomers tell us that the entire solar system the sun, the planets, and the earth are all traveling toward this "rift" at a velocity of more than twenty miles a second!</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>That is equivalent to almost 72,000 miles per hour!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Why would our Lord allow the inhabited earth to travel toward the north?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Who can say there is no purpose in this phenomenon?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today the theory of heaven being a definite place has been under numerous attacks and mockings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>What we have studied in this book is not of utmost importance.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The important thing is to believe that there is a place called heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Heaven is a place prepared for those who are prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Do you desire this?</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Are you prepared for it?</S>
