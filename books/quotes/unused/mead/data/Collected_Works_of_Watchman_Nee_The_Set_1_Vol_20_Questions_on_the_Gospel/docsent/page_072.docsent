   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>QUESTION FIFTY CONCERNING SANCTIFICATION</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is the meaning of sanctification?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>How are we sanctified?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>ANSWER</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Regarding sanctification, we have to look at the following three points:</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The Meaning of Sanctification</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>From the Old Testament to the New Testament, from Genesis to Revelation, sanctification means to be separated unto something.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It means to be separated out and to belong to someone else.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the biblical meaning of sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>"And the Lord spake unto Moses, saying, Sanctify unto me all the firstborn, whatsoever openeth the womb among the children of Israel, both of man and of beast; it is mine" Exo 13:1-2 .</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the firstborn of Israel were God's. They all needed to be separated, and a declaration needed to be made that they were sanctified and belonged to Jehovah.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Therefore, sanctification means to be separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When man offers anything to God, whatever is offered is separated and sanctified unto Him Lev 27:14; 2 Sam 8:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The Lord Jesus was sanctified by the Father John 10:36 and is the Holy One Luke 1:35 .</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord is different from any other man because He is the only begotten Son who is in the bosom of the Father John 1:18 , and He is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Those who believe in the Lord are called saints Acts 9:13 , which means that they are separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>While the Lord Jesus was on the earth, He asked the Pharisees a question.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the Old Testament times when a man offered a gift, did the gift sanctify the altar, or did the altar sanctify the gift?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Matt 23:19-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is wrong to say that the gift sanctifies the altar.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, the altar sanctifies the gift.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>When a gift is put on the altar it belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Before offering the gift on the altar it belongs to man, but once it is offered on the altar it belongs to God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This does not mean that the thing itself has changed in any way but that it has been absolutely separated unto God; therefore, it becomes holy.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In the Old Testament, after all the things belonging to the tabernacle were anointed, they became holy.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The things themselves did not change, but after they were wholly separated unto God's use, they became holy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The New Testament also shows that the unbelieving husband is sanctified by the believing wife, the unbelieving wife is sanctified by the believing husband, and the unbelieving children are sanctified by the believing parents 1 Cor 7:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The people do not change in themselves, yet they become separated and are sanctified because of their believing husband, wife, or parents.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>God purchased us through the blood of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Therefore, we do not belong to anyone else; we cannot be anyone else's. We belong to God Himself; we are only His.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Position of Sanctification before God</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>When a Christian receives the Lord, not only is he forgiven of his sins and justified; he is also sanctified before God.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>God is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Without holiness man cannot see God, fellowship with God, or pray to God.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Righteousness is the way in which God works; holiness is God's nature.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The forgiveness of sins is according to righteousness.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Without the forgiveness of sins man cannot be saved, and without holiness no one can see God Heb 12:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sanctification does not relate to sins; it relates to being separated unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Every Christian is sanctified in Christ, and he can therefore come to God.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The book of Romans speaks about justification, but the book of Hebrews speaks about sanctification.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Romans deals with righteousness, and Hebrews deals with holiness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Romans speaks of the throne, and Hebrews speaks of the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Romans speaks of the guilt of sin before God, and Hebrews speaks of the defilement of man before God.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Being forgiven and justified is taking away man's sins so that he can stand before God; yet, without holiness man cannot enjoy God's presence and fellowship with God in the Holy of Holies.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Romans tells us that although we are sinners, God has forgiven our sins and justified us through the death of His Son.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Hebrews tells us that although our bodies are unclean, the blood of the Son of God has cleansed us and that by His blood we are able to enter into the Holy of Holies and have fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We can enter boldly into the Holy of Holies through the blood of the Lord Jesus Heb 10:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>How much does sanctification include?</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The gospel of God always draws forth hallelujahs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God is holy.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Holiness is the highest expression of God's glory.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>If we are anything less than holy, we cannot be in God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But we are as holy as Christ is when we are in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We can come before God because God sees us in the same way that He sees Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Thank God, the salvation of Jesus Christ is complete and eternal.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If it were not complete, God's righteousness would not be upon us.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>If it were not eternal, we would not be separated and sanctified unto God eternally.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But the salvation of Jesus Christ is complete and eternal Heb 10:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Therefore, we can obtain eternal forgiveness, be sanctified unto God, and remain forever in God's presence.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>"To the church of God which is in Corinth, to those who have been sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints, with all those who call upon the name of our Lord Jesus Christ in every place, who is theirs and ours" 1 Cor 1:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Paul wrote this letter to those in Corinth who were sanctified in Christ Jesus, the called saints.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We are not going to be saints, because when we were called, we were already saints sanctified unto God.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Once we are called and saved, we are sanctified in Christ and are called saints.</S>
