THE PRACTICAL TRUTHS<br>VERSUS THE DISSENTING ACCUSATIONS</H2><P>In his withdrawal from the eldership of the church in Anaheim on March 19, 1989, Brother John Ingalls charged us with a number of accusations concerning our present situation. Hence, I have the burden to present to the saints in the Lord's recovery some truths that will blow away the cloud that has dimmed the clear vision of the Lord's recovery among us, and will bring back to us a clear sky with a clear view in the recovery. These practical truths are versus some of John's dissenting accusations.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>1.
