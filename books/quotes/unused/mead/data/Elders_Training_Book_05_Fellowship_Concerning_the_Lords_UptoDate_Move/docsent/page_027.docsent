   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE WORKS OF POWER NOT BELONGING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>TO GOD S NEW CREATION</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In the age of God s old creation, God did some creating work and also some restoring work.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This restoring work is the performing of miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The miracles, the works of power, do not belong to God s new creation but to the restoration of God s old creation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In the New Testament times there were also healings such as the resurrection of people who died.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>In the age of the kingdom all people will be healed miraculously.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must be clear, though, that no miracle belongs to God s new creation.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>To say that miracles are the work for the new creation is absolutely wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>If this is right, there would be no martyrdom of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Both Peter and Paul were among the many martyrs throughout the history of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If Peter had had the concept that miracles were something for the new creation he might have told the Lord, Lord, you have used me to raise up the dead.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Why wouldn t you rescue me from the hands of the persecutors?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You once released me from prison.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Why wouldn t you do it again?</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Why wouldn t you keep me on this earth until your second return?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Peter, of course, did not have such a concept.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In fact, Peter, like Paul 2 Tim 4:6 , knew that he would leave the world by martyrdom, and he was ready for it 2 Peter 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>All the people who were physically healed eventually died.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All the miracle performers, even the greatest ones like Peter and Paul, were martyred, killed.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord would not perform miraculous things for His chosen people all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>However, during the age of the new creation, the age of grace, for certain purposes the Lord borrowed the works of power, the miracles, from another age.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The New Testament believers have been enlightened, have tasted of the heavenly gift, have become partakers of the Holy Spirit, have tasted the good word of God, and have also tasted the works of power of the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The first four items are fully destined for us in this age, but the last item, the works of power of the coming age are not destined for us in this age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>One reason why I know that the works of power of the coming age are not destined for us is because of Paul s experience with a thorn in his flesh recorded in 2 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul asked the Lord three times to remove this thorn, but the Lord s reply was, My grace is sufficient for you, for My power is perfected in weakness 2 Cor 12:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The works of power to take away the thorn from your body is a kind of healing.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This healing does not belong to the new creation but to the restoration.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Whether the Lord heals and restores your body, which is part of the old creation, is up to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He may do it and, then again, He may not do it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Wonders and signs are not part of God s central testimony of the incarnated, crucified, resurrected, and ascended Christ, neither are they part of His full salvation; the Lord borrowed the miraculous things from the coming age to show that what the apostles preached and ministered and how they acted were absolutely of God, not of man Acts 2:43; Heb 2:3-4 .</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>God would not perform the miraculous things all the time in the age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even if the thorn in Paul s flesh were taken away, Paul would still die.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God did not desire to take away Paul s thorn in this age of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE LORD S EARTHLY MINISTRY</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In the three and a half years of our Lord s earthly ministry He did two categories of work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>First, He ministered His life to God s chosen people which was His main work John 10:10b .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He died on the cross so that He could release the divine life John 12:24 and He resurrected to become the life-giving Spirit 1 Cor 15:45b that He could impart the divine life through His death into God s chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Second, He performed some auxiliary miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>When the Lord performed miracles, though, these were not the real goal of His ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>John 2:23-25 says, Now when He was in Jerusalem at the Passover, during the feast, many believed in His name, when they saw the signs which He did.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But Jesus Himself did not entrust Himself to them, for He knew all men, and because He did not need anyone to testify concerning man, for He Himself knew what was in man.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many saw the signs which Jesus did and believed in Him, but Jesus would not entrust Himself to them.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>John 3:1 continues by saying, But there was a man of the Pharisees named Nicodemus, a ruler of the Jews.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The word but at the beginning of 3:1 indicates that this case of Nicodemus differs from the cases in the foregoing verses 2:23-25.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>All the cases there are cases of people believing in the Lord because of seeing the miracles He did.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The Lord could not commit Himself to such people.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But this case in chapter three is one of life and regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>This reveals that the book of John is not for miraculous things, but for life.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is why even the miracles done by the Lord are called signs in this book, signifying that the Lord came for life, not for miracles.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The Lord would not commit Himself to those who believed in Him by seeing the signs which He did, but another man came.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This man came, not for signs or miracles, but he came seeking knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nicodemus may have thought he needed some better teachings to improve himself, but the Lord s answer unveiled to him that his need was to be born again.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To be born again is to be regenerated with the divine life, other than the human life received by natural birth.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Hence, Nicodemus real need was not some better teachings to improve himself, but the divine life to remake him.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The Lord presented Himself to Nicodemus not as a miracle performer nor as a rabbi to teach him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>He unveiled to Nicodemus that He was the brass serpent to die for him 3:14-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Regardless of how good Nicodemus might have been outwardly, inwardly he had the serpentine nature of Satan.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As a descendant of Adam, he was poisoned by the old serpent, and the serpent s nature was within him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>He needed the Lord to be in the form of a serpent that his serpentine nature might be dealt with on the cross that he might have eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Nicodemus needed regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>He needed to receive another life, the divine life.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>All the regenerated people will become the Lord s Bride and He will be the Bridegroom.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This Bride will be the new creation by regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>To regenerate Nicodemus is one thing and to have others believe in Him because of seeing the miracles He did is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The signs which the Lord did proved to everyone that He was God s sent One.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>But the Lord would never entrust Himself to those who believed in Him because of seeing the signs.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>He had no confidence in the miracle seekers.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Many thousands of people were either healed by the Lord or directly affected by the miracles He performed in His earthly ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The Lord miraculously fed five thousand people at one time with only five loaves and two fishes John 6:9-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The next day He told the same crowd not to labor for the food which perishes, referring to the food He fed them with the day before, but to labor for the eternal food which is the bread of life John 6:27, 35, 57 .</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He told them to eat Him, that His flesh was good for them to eat and His blood good for them to drink 6:53-54 .</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Then those people who were fed by Him miraculously said, This is a hard word 6:60 and many of them left 6:66 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>Only a few remained with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>The Lord Jesus then asked the twelve if they would leave also.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Peter replied, Lord, to whom shall we go?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>You have words of eternal life 6:68 .</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Peter s attitude was that he and the twelve would never leave the Lord but would stay with Him not to get the physical bread, but to receive the words of eternal life.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>In the other synoptic Gospels, Matthew, Mark, and Luke, this is not pointed out in so much detail.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>John purposely pointed out that the feeding of the five thousand should be taken as a sign, symbolizing that the Lord is imparting Himself as the bread of life into our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Eventually He said, It is the Spirit who gives life and The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life 6:63 .</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>The real bread of life is not physical but absolutely wrapped up with the Spirit and with life.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Where were those five thousand that were fed by the Lord after His resurrection?</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The Lord healed, no doubt, thousands of people.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Where were those healed ones at the beginning of the book of Acts?</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>How many did the Lord really gain at the conclusion of his earthly ministry?</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>1 Corinthians 15:6 even tells us that the Lord appeared to five hundred brothers at one time after His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>After the Lord s labor for three and a half years, however, we can only see one hundred and twenty faithful ones.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>Again, the Lord would not entrust Himself to the miracle seekers.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>The New Testament ministry ministers the central line of God s New Testament economy to produce the new creation, not to bring forth anything like restoration.</S>
