Bruising the Serpent on the Head</h2>
<p>The third crucial point is that the seed of the woman would &ldquo;bruise you on the head.&rdquo; <em>You</em> here refers to Satan. This means that the seed of the woman would bruise Satan on his head. This particularly applies to the Lord Jesus. Through His death on the cross, the Lord destroyed the devil, who has the might of death (Heb. 2:14), putting him to death.</p>
<p>In the promise of God in Genesis 3:15, the central point is the seed of the woman bruising the serpent on his head. This refers to Christ coming to destroy Satan. This is the greatest point in God&rsquo;s judgment upon the serpent, Satan. God&rsquo;s judgment on Satan speaks of Christ becoming a man to destroy Satan and deliver man from Satan. Therefore, this is the most crucial and central promise in the Bible. This is God&rsquo;s first promise concerning Christ and His salvation, and this is also the first prophecy in plain words in the Bible concerning the Lord Jesus and His work.</p>
<h2 class="head3">The Serpent Bruising<br />
the Seed of the Woman on the Heel</h2>
<p>The fourth crucial point is that the serpent would &ldquo;bruise him on the heel.&rdquo; <em>Him</em> refers to the seed of the woman. This means that Satan will bruise the heel of the woman&rsquo;s seed. In the fulfillment of the type <em>him</em> refers to the Lord Jesus. When the Lord Jesus destroyed the devil on the cross, the devil bruised the heel of the Lord. This bruise on the heel occurred when Christ was wounded by His feet being nailed to the cross.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Fulfillment of the Promise</h2>
<p>All the points in this promise are being and will be fulfilled throughout the ages gradually. First, this promise is fulfilled in all those who are of God. Indeed, since the time of this promise, there has been enmity between Satan and those who are of God. This will continue until the Lord comes back (Rev. 12:4, 13-17). Even after the millennial kingdom, Satan will have one last struggle in this matter (20:7-10).</p>
<p>Second, this promise is fulfilled in the overcomers. Starting with Abel, there has been enmity between all those who follow Satan and the strong ones among those who are of God, and it will continue until the end of the age at the rapture of the overcomers (12:5).</p>
<p>Third, this promise was fulfilled in the Lord Jesus. As soon as the Lord Jesus was born, Herod and others who were of Satan had enmity against Him and wanted to kill Him (Matt. 2:13-16). The four Gospels also show that when the Lord Jesus was walking on the earth, those who were of Satan, whether Jews or Gentiles, also had enmity against Him. They persecuted and inflicted harm on Him until they eventually killed Him.</p>
<p>The Lord&rsquo;s crucifixion fulfilled the second half of this promise. On the one hand, through His death He destroyed Satan, bruising the &ldquo;serpent&rdquo; on his head and putting him to death (Heb. 2:14; 1 John 3:8). On the other hand, Satan also bruised the Lord Jesus on the cross, causing Him to suffer the pangs of death (Psa. 22:12-17). All these were related to the fulfillment of God&rsquo;s promise.</p>
<p>God&rsquo;s speaking when He judged the serpent was not only a promise but also a prophecy. Although there are not many words in this promise, its contents are very broad because it speaks of Satan&rsquo;s work throughout the ages, of the enmity between those who follow Satan and those who testify for God, of God&rsquo;s dealing with Satan, and of the Lord Jesus becoming flesh to accomplish His work on the cross. Everything mentioned in the Bible regarding the struggle between God and Satan, from Genesis 3 to the end of Revelation, is related to this promise.</p>
<p>When Adam and Eve heard God&rsquo;s promise, they must have felt much joy, because God&rsquo;s word caused them to realize that God would deal with the serpent, whom they feared and hated, by putting him to death. Therefore, when Adam and Eve heard this word, they had a living hope. When they realized that they had sinned and thought that they would surely die, they were in fear and trembling, awaiting their death. Under these circumstances, however, they heard that Eve would give birth to a seed and that this seed would bruise and put to death the serpent who had damaged them. What a joyful gospel this was to them! They had a living hope. This is God&rsquo;s first promise to man.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_011.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_013.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Revelations in Genesis: Seeing God's Way of Salvation in Man's Fall &nbsp; pg 12</div><br></body></html>
