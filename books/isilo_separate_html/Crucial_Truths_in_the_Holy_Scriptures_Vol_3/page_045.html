<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters according to the flesh with fear and trembling, in singleness of your heart, as to Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:5; see also Col. 3:22-25).</p>
<p>In our households there might be a relationship between master and servants, so the Bible has a specific teaching regarding this matter. When the Bible speaks of the matter of servants and masters, it begins from the bottom and goes up. It speaks of servants first and then masters. Brothers and sisters who are servants should be obedient to their masters with fear and trembling. Their obedience should be in singleness of heart, as to Christ. They should not only serve and honor their master before his face but do everything for their master as to the Lord, as if they are serving the Lord, not man. In this way, they will receive a reward from the Lord.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Slaves under the yoke should regard their own masters as worthy of all honor...Those who have believing masters should not despise them, because they are brothers; but rather they should serve them&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 6:1-2; see also Titus 2:9-10; 1 Pet. 2:18).</p>
<p>A servant should give all honor to his master. If the master is a believer, the servant should not despise him, because he is a brother or a sister. They should not leave the position of a servant but rather should serve them. Servants certainly should not be rude to their masters but be loyal and obedient. They should obey not only kind and gentle masters but even crooked ones.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Masters, do the same things toward them, giving up your threatening&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:9).</p>
<p>When masters deal with their servants, they should not threaten them. We must remember that both masters and servants are slaves of the Lord in the heavens.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Masters, grant to your slaves that which is just and equal&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 4:1).</p>
<p>In their dealings with their servants, masters may not cheat or oppress them. They must be just and equal as the Lord is to us.</p>
<h2 class="head3">Masters and Slaves Being a Symbol<br />
of the Lord and His Slaves</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Masters, grant to your slaves that which is just and equal, knowing that you also have a Master in heaven&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 4:1).</p>
<p>The relationship between a master and a servant manifests the relationship between the Lord and His slaves. When we deal with servants, we should remember that we have a Master in heaven. We symbolize Him as the Master, so we cannot make mistakes with regard to our servants lest we symbolize, or manifest, Him incorrectly.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;Slaves, be obedient to those who are your masters...as to Christ...as slaves of Christ&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:5-6; see also Col. 3:22-24).</p>
<p>Just as masters symbolize Christ as our Master, servants symbolize the believers as the Lord&rsquo;s slaves. Therefore, brothers and sisters who are servants should serve their masters well, as if they are serving the Lord, lest they improperly symbolize, or represent, a slave of the Lord.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Concerning Relatives</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If anyone does not provide for his own, and especially for those of his household, he has denied the faith and is worse than an unbeliever&rdquo;</strong> (1 Tim. 5:8, see also v. 16).</p>
<p>Believers should do their best to care for their relatives. They should care for their relatives&rsquo; lack, especially in the matter of money. We should especially do so for those in our own household. If someone in our household has a lack, we should do our best to attend to it. It is reasonable that we should not burden the church or others.</p>
<h2 class="head1">OCCUPATIONS</h2>
<h2 class="head2">The Principle of Work</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;If anyone does not want to work, neither should he eat&rdquo;</strong> (2 Thes. 3:10, see also vv. 12, 8; 1 Thes. 4:11; Acts 20:34).</p>
<p>A Christian must work, and each must work for himself. He cannot be idle, expecting to eat while being a burden to others. If a Christian does not want to work, neither should he eat. If his hands do not want to move, neither should his mouth.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;But rather should labor&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 4:28; see also Titus 3:14, 8).</p>
<p>When Christians work, they must have a proper job. According to the standard of a saint, Christians should not have any job that is dark, immoral, ill-famed, improper, untrue, unclean, illegal, or harmful.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Occupations</h2>
<p><strong>1. &ldquo;Work the ground&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 3:23; see also 9:20).</p>
<p>It is best if Christians work in nature, producing what is necessary for human living. The first recorded occupation in the Bible that God wants for man is to work the ground. Working the ground is to farm to produce fruit from the earth. It is most beneficial to us and to others.</p>
<p><strong>2. &ldquo;A tender of sheep&rdquo;</strong> (Gen. 4:2; see also 30:31; Exo. 3:1; Amos 1:1).</p>
<p>The second recorded occupation that is pleasing to God in the Bible is the keeping of sheep. Shepherding involves cooperating with nature to produce things from animals that are beneficial to us and others.</p>
<p><strong>3. &ldquo;Fishermen&rdquo;</strong> (Matt. 4:18).</p>
<p>A third occupation recorded in the Bible is fishing. Fishing involves the taking of natural produce from the sea. It also is beneficial to human living.</p>
<p><strong>4. &ldquo;Tentmakers&rdquo;</strong> (Acts 18:3).</p>
<p>A fourth kind of occupation recorded in the Bible is tentmaking. This handcraft combines natural products with labor to produce things that people need.</p>
<p><strong>5. &ldquo;Physician&rdquo;</strong> (Col. 4:14).</p>
<p>According to the Bible, Christians can have additional skills other than producing necessities for human living. The first skilled occupation spoken of in the Bible is that of a physician. Although physicians do not produce necessities for human living, they provide a necessary skill to benefit humans.</p>
<p><strong>6. &ldquo;Slaves&rdquo;</strong> (Eph. 6:5).</p>
<p>Even being a slave is considered as a kind of occupation for Christians in the Bible. It is a kind of skill, and it is beneficial to people.</p>
<p>According to the principle of a skill, occupations involving teaching, nursing, or laboring are beneficial to man. A Christian&rsquo;s job or occupation must be necessary or beneficial to man.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_044.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_046.html">Next</a> </body></html>
