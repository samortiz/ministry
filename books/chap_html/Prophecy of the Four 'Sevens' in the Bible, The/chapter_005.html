The last week of the seventy weeks, the final seven years of this present age, are very crucial, but actually nearly all the crucial matters will be crowded into the last three and a half years. This is why we need to see the events in the last three and a half years of this present age and the great tribulation of the three and a half years.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>I. THE LAST THREE AND A HALF YEARS<br>OF THE PRESENT AGE</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. The Three and a Half Years, Called "a Time and Times, and Half a Time" in Revelation 12:14 as a Quotation from Daniel 7:25 and 12:7,</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2> Equaling Forty-two Months or a Thousand<br>Two Hundred and Sixty Days</H2><P>The three and a half years, called "a time, and times, and half a time" in Revelation 12:14 as a quotation from Daniel 7:25 and 12:7, equals forty-two months (Rev. 11:2; 13:5) or a thousand two hundred and sixty days (Rev. 11:3; 12:6).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. As the Consummation (End) of the Present Age</H2><P>These three and a half years mentioned in Daniel and Revelation will be the consummation (end) of the present age (Matt. 28:20; 13:39, 40, 49; 24:3; Dan. 12:13). The word consummation means that there is a process that will be brought to completion or fulfillment.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. For the Lord, on the Negative Side,<br>to Clear Away All the Negative Persons and Things, Leaving Only the Dead Unbelievers<br>and the Demons to Be Cleared Away<br>through the Judgment<br>at the Great White Throne<br>after the Millennial Kingdom</H2><P>The last three and a half years are for the Lord, on the negative side, to clear away all the negative persons and things, leaving only the dead unbelievers and the demons to be cleared away through the judgment at the great white throne after the millennial kingdom (Rev. 20:11-15). The world is becoming more evil as time goes on. It is full of evil persons and evil things. In the last three and a half years, the Lord will use a "universal broom" to sweep away all the negative things on the earth. Only the dead unbelievers and the demons will be left to be judged after the millennium at the great white throne and to be cast into the lake of fire.</P>
