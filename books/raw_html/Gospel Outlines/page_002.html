 <h1 class="msg">Part I&mdash;Old Testament Subjects</h1>
<h2 class="head3">Subject One</h2>
<h1 class="title">THE ORIGIN OF THE UNIVERSE&mdash;GOD</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture: Gen. 1<br />
<em>Such a subject is best suited for speaking to high school and college students. The first seven subjects form a group, which may be called, &ldquo;The Story of the Universe.&rdquo;</em></h1>
<ol class="upper-romanbd">
<li>Men&rsquo;s presumptions<br />
<span class="normal">Begin with what the world&rsquo;s famous men of all cultures and all ages have had to say about the universe. Include philosophers, sages, and scholars, past and present; Chinese, Egyptian, Babylonian, and Greek. Include also the presumptions of the common people. For this you need to refer to history and literature.</span></li>
<li>The revelation of the Bible<br />
<span class="normal">Every time in preaching the gospel begin with what people in the past have had to say, and then point out what the Bible reveals. This is a principle in gospel preaching. Based on the Bible, refute men&rsquo;s false presumptions.</span>
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>First find some good verses in the Old Testament about the heavens, the earth, and all things that were created by God.</li>
	<li>Then find what Jesus had to say about creation.</li>
	<li>Lastly look at what the Apostles had to say.</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The evidence of all things in the universe
	<ol class="upper-alpha">
	<li>The material evidence: the vastness of the universe, the wonder of the way the earth revolves on its axis, the wonder of the air, of the water, and of the stars all prove that the universe was created by God.</li>
	<li>The circumstantial evidence: great events have occurred in the universe which prove God&rsquo;s existence and His ruling. Examples of such events are: (1) the long day recorded in the book of Joshua, when the sun stood still for twenty-four hours (Josh. 10:12-14), and (2) at the time of Hezekiah, when the sun went backward ten degrees on the sundial (2 Kings 20:8-11).</li>
	</ol></li>
<li>The evidence of laws and principles<br />
<span class="normal">Mention some physical laws and principles of the universe and then point out that not one law or principle can exist by accident. A law is a law, and there must be One in the universe who establishes the law; a principle is a regulation, and there must be One in the universe who regulates.<br />
Points III and IV testify to the revelation of the Bible which declares that God is the origin of the universe.</span></li>
