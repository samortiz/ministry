<H1 CLASS=SERIES>LIFE-STUDY OF ISAIAH</H1><H1 CLASS=MSG>MESSAGE THIRTY-SEVEN</H1><H1 CLASS=TITLE>THE GREAT LIGHT FOR THE SHINING IN DARKNESS<br>AND FOR THE RELEASE FROM BONDAGE</H1><H1 CLASS=SCRIPTURE>Scripture Reading: Isa. 9:1-5; Matt. 4:12-16; John 1:9, 4-5; Acts 26:18; 1 Pet. 2:9b; Col. 1:13; Luke 1:78-79; Isa. 10:26-27; Judg. 7:24-26</H1><P>In the previous messages, we have seen many items of Christ unveiled in the book of Isaiah. He is the Shoot of Jehovah and the Fruit of the earth (4:2-6). He is the Christ in glory (6:1-5). As Immanuel, He was a child born of a human virgin and a son given by the Eternal Father (7:14; 9:6-7). He is also a sanctuary to the positive ones and a stone to strike against, a rock of stumbling, a trap, and a snare to the negative ones (8:14-15). In this message we want to see another aspect of Christ. In Isaiah 9:1-5 we see Him as the great light for the shining in darkness and for the release from bondage.</P><P>Light is crucial for our existence. Where light is, there is life. Where darkness is, there is death. According to the Bible, darkness is a punishment. Darkness equals death, and darkness is a prison. God uses darkness as death and a prison to punish people. Exodus shows that darkness was part of the punishment on Egypt (10:21-23). Revelation shows the judgment of darkness on the kingdom of Antichrist (16:10). Actually, the entire fallen world is under God's judgment of darkness (Eph. 5:8a). In every city and even in every home among fallen mankind, there is darkness. We can testify that before we were saved, we were in darkness. We were in darkness until the genuine gospel came to us, and we saw the light.</P><P>In the entire universe, light is the key to life. Plants, animals, and men all need light in order to live. In the Bible, we Christians are called the sons of God (Gal. 3:26) and the sons of light (John 12:36). As the sons of light, we should live in the light, walk in the light, remain in the light, and be persons altogether in the light. When we are in the light, we are in fellowship with our Triune God (1 John 1:5-7). Then we participate in what He is and enjoy Him.</P>
