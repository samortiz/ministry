<P>In Matthew 12:28 the Lord Jesus said, "But if I by the Spirit of God cast out demons, then the kingdom of God is come upon you." This is not the kingdom of the heavens, but the kingdom of God. Matthew 19:23-24 mentions both of these kinds of kingdoms: "And Jesus said to His disciples, Truly I say to you, it is difficult for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of the heavens. And again I say to you, It is easier for a camel to go through the eye of a needle than for a rich man to enter into the kingdom of God." Matthew 21:43 also mentions the kingdom of God: "Therefore I say to you that the kingdom of God shall be taken from you and shall be given to a nation producing the fruits of it." By reading these verses, we can see that the kingdom of God was there already, but that the kingdom of the heavens had not yet come.</P><P>Matthew 13:41 speaks of the kingdom of the Son of Man: "The Son of Man shall send His angels, and they shall gather out of His kingdom all stumblingblocks and those who do lawlessness." The kingdom of the Son of Man is the third kind of kingdom mentioned in the Scriptures.</P><P>In Matthew 13:43, there is the Father's kingdom: "Then the righteous shall shine forth as the sun in the kingdom of their Father. He who has ears to hear, let him hear."</P><P>Ephesians 5:5 mentions the kingdom of Christ and of God: "For this you know, knowing that every fornicator or unclean person or person of unbridled greedy lust, who is an idolator, has no inheritance in the kingdom of Christ and of God." The kingdom of Christ and of God is the fifth kingdom.</P><P>Second Samuel 7:13 is a promise or a prophecy concerning Christ: "He shall build a house for my name, and I will stablish the throne of his kingdom for ever." Christ will be the Son of David to build up the house of God, and God will set up His throne with His kingdom forever. This is the kingdom of the Son of David or the kingdom of David. The kingdom of the Son of David is also mentioned in Luke 1:32-33: "He shall be great, and shall be called the Son of the Highest; and the Lord God shall give unto him the throne of his father David: And he shall reign over the house of Jacob forever; and of his kingdom there shall be no end." Before the Lord Jesus was born, the angel told His mother that her Son would be the successor to the throne of David. This is the kingdom of David or the kingdom of the Son of David. Acts 15:16 says, "After this I will return, and will build again the tabernacle of David, which is fallen down; and I will build again the ruins thereof, and I will set it up." This verse indicates that the tabernacle of David was ruined, but that the Lord will come back to restore and rebuild it. This is the kingdom of David. The kingdom of the Son of David or the tabernacle of David is the sixth kingdom mentioned in the Scriptures.</P><P>The seventh kingdom is mentioned in Acts 1:6: "When they therefore were come together, they asked of him, saying, Lord, wilt thou at this time restore again the kingdom to Israel?" Here we have the kingdom of Israel. Matthew 25:34 says, "Then the King shall say to those on His right hand, Come, you who are blessed of My Father, inherit the kingdom prepared for you from the foundation of the world." Here is a kingdom prepared, not before the foundation of the world, but from the foundation of the world. This is the eighth kind of kingdom. The ninth kingdom is the millennial kingdom (Rev. 11:15; 20:4-6). Finally, there is the kingdom of Messiah, the messianic kingdom (Dan. 7:14).</P>
