<P>All of these factors have caused us to reconsider the Lord's move in Europe. The Lord's recovery first spread to Europe in 1971. We should not allow Europe to be lost, but neither should we do anything in a quick way according to our natural thought. We have to pray much and consider much. The recovery must spread. There are three factors that run the entire world today: the leadership of the United States, the influence from Europe, and the influence from Asia. The Lord sent His recovery to the United States because this is the leading nation in the world. Because of the English language and the leadership of this nation, the Lord's recovery has spread quickly in the past quarter of a century. However, the world situation has changed, and the Lord's move will probably follow the pattern of this change.</P><P>We must take some practical steps. From now on, we will add French, German, and Russian classes to our full-time training. Moreover, we will encourage saints to give themselves for the Lord's purpose to spread His recovery to the European countries, especially to eastern Germany and Russia. We should go not as individuals; we should go as a team of at least four, including a couple of age thirty or older as the core of the team. This team may go to one of the larger cities in Europe with large universities. We will start the recovery work mainly on the campuses. We hope to rent houses that can be used to take care of weekend guests and can be used as meeting places. If some are ready now to go as such a team, they may go right away. We may first strengthen the ministry in England because eventually England will be crucial for all of Europe.</P><P>What the saints do when they go to Europe depends upon their leading from the Lord. Some may go full-time for the Lord. Others may take a job. Soon there will be more business transactions between the United States and Germany, and more job opportunities will open up. Some may go and enroll in school. However, all should have the purpose of going for the spreading of the Lord's recovery.</P><P>In our full-time training, we will have a class for preparing those who will go to Europe. Then some will go as teams. We will not practice the old things there. We will go to have a new start. All this will be without any official organization. It will be the saints' move according to the Lord's leading. I believe that all the churches will rise up to participate in this matter, especially in the financial support. There is no need to worry about finances. The saints should go by faith. The practical things will be taken care of by the Lord. To support one brother in Russia for the Lord's recovery will not cost very much. If some go to Russia, the churches will easily be able to support them. Some of the co-workers should also be encouraged to go to Europe. We should send not only some "soldiers" but also some co-workers to bear the burden for the Lord's move.</P><P>If we are preparing to go to Europe, we should become acquainted with the way to get sinners saved. If one goes as an English-speaking student, he will be able to associate with the German students there. He will pick up the language very quickly, and within a year he should be able to preach to the students.</P><P>Some need to tell the Lord that they will go to Europe for His recovery. Perhaps soon we will send teams, but we must not treat this lightly. We must receive the Lord's leading with much consideration. We should not say that we cannot go because we are not strong enough. The church in Jerusalem was very young, but the saints there were scattered for the Lord's move. There are many useful brothers in this country who have gained much of the Lord. They need a place to use their capacity and to have it developed. Close to two hundred American saints received training in Taipei, Irving, and Anaheim, but when they returned to their localities, they could not develop their capacity. This does not mean that the churches are opposing the new way. All the churches today welcome the new way, but the situation does not afford much opportunity for the full development of the saints' capacity. Therefore, we must spread by migration. If some remain in the United States, they will not be very useful, but if they go to Europe, they will become useful. Those who are burdened should contact the leading brothers for fellowship.</P>
