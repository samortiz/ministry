<p>The division of the catholic church between the East and the West eventually also developed into two distinct lines. The first was in the West with Rome as its chief city; the churches allied with Rome were called the Latin or the Roman Church. The second was in the East, in the Greek region, with Constantinople as its chief city; the churches allied with Constantinople were called the Greek Church.</p>
<p>Later, the Roman church developed into the Roman Catholic Church, which was very powerful. The Greek church developed into the Eastern Greek Orthodox Church. From a very early time Russia accepted Eastern Greek Orthodoxy as its national religion. Most of northeastern Europe as well as western Asia also adopted the Eastern Greek Orthodox religion. These two major sects of the East and the West have never been rejoined, and they have even attacked each other.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE NESTORIANS</h2>
<p>The Nestorians were an offshoot of the eastern branch of the catholic church. Despite the fact that they were few in number, the Nestorians did have some power. Nestorianism was preached in China, and in Chinese history it is called the Ching Religion. The founder of Nestorianism was Nestorius, a talented, well-educated theologian. He was the patriarch of Constantinople. His theology concerning the Person of the Triune God differed from the theology of the catholic church and from the creeds that are used in most of Christianity today. Today the Roman Catholic Church, the Eastern Greek Orthodox Church, and all the denominations use creeds. The main point of the creeds is as follows: &ldquo;I believe in the Triune God; I believe that Jesus Christ was born of Mary, and that He died on the cross for me.&rdquo; This is the basic faith.</p>
<p>In A.D. 431 at the Council of Ephesus, it was agreed that such a creed was correct. Later, Nestorius taught differently from the creed; his teachings&mdash;especially his teachings concerning the Person of the Lord Jesus&mdash;had the flavor of heresy to other Christians. However, because he was a talented, educated man with much influence, many people followed him. Because his teachings differed from the creeds, a council of the catholic church excommunicated him. He left Constantinople and went to Persia, which is modern-day Iran. It is said that even today there are churches which descended from the Nestorians in Iran.</p>
<p>The Nestorians spread to the East, and during the Tang Dynasty they reached China. At that time, Nestorianism in China, the Ching Religion, was centered in Changan, which is modern-day Xian in the Shaanxi Province. According to Chinese history, the Ching Religion flourished and was received by many of the nobles in the emperor&rsquo;s court. A Nestorian tablet found in Xian refers to the Ching Religion thriving during the Tang Dynasty; there were more than three hundred Ching temples in China. This proves that Nestorianism was very powerful in China during the Tang Dynasty.</p>
<p>However, because the Nestorians relied on scholarship to spread their religion and did not bring many people to know the Lord or receive His life, they fell into outward religious activity without anything of life. Thus, when a new dynasty replaced the Tang dynasty, some of its emperors did not like this foreign religion and issued edicts restricting its spread. This forced many nuns and monks to give up their vocation and return to the world. In a very short time Nestorianism disappeared from China. However, one sect of Nestorians spread to India; thus, the oldest group of Christians in India is the Nestorians.</p>
<p>The organized church by this time was divided into two large sects and one small sect. The two large sects were the Roman Catholic Church in the West and the Greek Orthodox Church in the East. The small sect was the Nestorians. These three sects had nearly identical systems of organization, and their methods of worship were similar. The main difference was that the Nestorians had a different creed; the two large sects had creeds that were according to the truth, and they considered the Nestorians to be heretics.</p>
<p>The seventh and eighth centuries were the golden age of Nestorianism. All of Persia was Nestorian, and east of Persia, all Christians were Nestorian. Thus, Christianity around A.D. 700 was divided into four main groups: the Western church, the Eastern church, the Nestorians, and the believers with pure hearts for the Lord. The pure-hearted believers did not have any organization; they simply met in one accord in each locality and served the Lord. By the end of the fifteenth century, the Nestorians had almost disappeared, but the Roman Catholic and Greek Orthodox churches had become more and more powerful.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_037.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_039.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Three Aspects of the Church: Book 2, The Course of the Church &nbsp; pg 38</div><br></body></html>
