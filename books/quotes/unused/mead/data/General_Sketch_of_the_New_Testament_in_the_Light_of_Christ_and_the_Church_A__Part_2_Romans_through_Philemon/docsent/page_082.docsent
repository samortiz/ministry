   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Not Forcing Others, but Ministering Christ</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Lastly, you may stress certain matters, but do not force them on others.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When people are ready to receive something, take the opportunity to minister something, but if they are not ready, you should not go too fast.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Simply pray and wait.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>You must be strong, but do not be forceful.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Go along with the situation and wait for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If what you do is of the Lord, He will prepare the way.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>When He prepares the proper situation, that is the time to minister something.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Caring for the Unique Expression of the Church in a Locality</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Remember that the expression of the church in a locality must be unique.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Therefore, we all need to keep the oneness, and in order to keep the oneness you must learn not to damage or make trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Rather, always minister something positive of life, something of Christ, and let it work in people to deal with the negative things.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I beg you to keep these few matters in mind.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This will help you and help the local churches wherever you are and wherever you go.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Always learn to be a help to the church and never to create trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Because the local expression of the church is one, you have no other way to take.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>You cannot act independently or outside the local expression.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Whether or not you are happy with a local church, you must go along with it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Learn to submit yourself to the present situation of the local church where you are.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>May the Lord be merciful to us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We all must learn to be wise and humble, and we must do our best to be a real help.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Three Needful Matters for the Church</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In my heart I am truly burdened for the church in three matters.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>First, we must know the inner life, that is, know Christ in a living way.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Second, we must have the proper church life so that Christ may be exalted and expressed.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Third, we need to preach the gospel, to do our best to bring unbelievers to the Lord, to win their souls at any cost, spending ourselves and being willing to sacrifice everything that we have.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We must endeavor by the mercy and grace of the Lord to care equally for these three things.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This is the right way.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>There is no need to care for mere doctrines, teachings, or other matters.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We should care mainly for the above three matters.</S>
