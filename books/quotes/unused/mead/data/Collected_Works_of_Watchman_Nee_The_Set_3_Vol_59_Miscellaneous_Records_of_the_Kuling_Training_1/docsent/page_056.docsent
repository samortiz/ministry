   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>SUBMISSION AND OUR SPEAKING The First Manifestation of Rebellion</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Being One's Speaking</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Today we will cover the relationship between authority and speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The entire Scripture tells us clearly that a very close relationship exists between speaking and submission.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God wants man to submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He also wants man to be submissive in his speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If a man cannot be submissive in his speaking, it is vain to ask him to submit to any authority.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Second Peter 2:10-12 first speaks of the flesh and lust and then of those who despise lordships.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Those who are undisciplined in the flesh and wanton in lust despise lordship; they are not under any authority.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Those who walk soberly and who are under the discipline of the Holy Spirit do not revile dignitaries.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Peter said that some are not submissive, that they despise lordship.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The outward manifestation of this inward state is a reviling in the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When reviling is expressed in words, it becomes an evil speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>The first mark of rebellion is in speaking, that is, in one's evil speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The tongue is the hardest member to tame.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is the smallest of all members, yet it can boast great things and is set on fire by Gehenna James 3:5-6 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The quickest outward sign of defiance of authority is the exercise of the tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the world there are those who are in the position of authority and those who should submit to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who should submit often merely perform perfunctory ceremonies.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>They pay homage and say "yes" to everything, but behind the back, they say evil things.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Suppose you ask a servant to do something.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>He may respond immediately, but as soon as he gets into the kitchen, he complains and murmurs.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is often the case with employees toward employers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The employees nod their heads at their employers' faces but speak evilly behind their backs.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The same is true with soldiers towards officers or nurses towards doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The mouth is the most free to speak.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>On the one hand, the mouth expresses the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>On the other hand, the mouth is free to say anything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In a court of law, judges often conclude cases by saying to the defendants, "If you want to challenge this decision, you have three days to appeal to a higher court."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many condemned ones choose not to appeal because they know that they are guilty.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This does not mean, however, that they yield to the judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They murmur privately and utter many evil words.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Students treat their teachers the same way in school.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They nod their head at their teachers' faces, but speak evilly of them behind their back.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We also find this in a family between children and parents.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is what Paul called "eye-service" Col 3:22 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>It is an obedience performed before one's eyes, not an obedience which issues from the heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>When there is no obedience in the heart, the mouth can only utter words of rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Rebellion is seen everywhere among all systems of secular authorities.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Submission is a yielding of the heart as well as the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>We only need to see whether or not a person is submissive in his speaking in order to know if he is submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>God wants man not only to be submissive before the eyes of others, but also in the heart and in the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Privately, we must always bridle our tongue.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In the world one is considered obedient as long as he yields outwardly, but among God's children, those who are serving Him, there should be submission from the heart and no reviling words out of the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This is true in the family, toward the government, and in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A man can refrain from murmuring against God because he has met God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Those who have never touched God's authority will always have a problem.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Their problem is like a man's temper, which can be held back only for a day or two or for a few months.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Sooner or later, his temper will explode.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Some people are like time-delayed bombs.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>They do not explode immediately, but when the time comes, they explode.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>It is not enough for a man to touch the elders or the workers as persons.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>It is not enough for a wife to touch her husband as a person.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to touch authority.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>I am not here to teach submission.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>I am praying that we will touch God and touch authority.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>I am hoping that we will look for opportunities to submit.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>As soon as we touch God's authority, we will have nothing more to say.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>God has to bring us to the point where we will not murmur in our heart or speak rebellion with our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>How good and liberating such an experience is!</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Second Peter 2:10 says that those who despise lordship "do not tremble while reviling dignities."</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Some people do not tremble while they rebel against authority, but those who know God tremble for them.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>It is a serious thing for a man to not tremble.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is like a little child standing before a tiger and pulling its hair without any fear.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Many sisters speak rebelliously against their husbands, and many brothers and sisters maliciously prate against the responsible brothers in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>They do not tremble, but those who know authority tremble for them.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>If we want to practice submission, first we must bridle our mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The first area we should tackle is our speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Second Peter 2:11 tells us that even though angels are powerful, they do not accuse those in position before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>First learn from the angels!</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>They are powerful and occupy high places, yet they are submissive.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>If we do not submit, we are saying that we are greater than the angels.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As far as their power and authority are concerned, the angels are greater than man.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Yet they would not speak a reviling word.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Who are you?</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Angels dare not speak rashly because they keep their place.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Those who know authority never criticize easily.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The angels have learned to keep their place before God; they are submissive to authority.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Therefore, 1 Corinthians 11:10 says that the woman should have a sign of submission to authority on her head for the sake of angels.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If a Christian does not submit to authority, he loses all of his power.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>There are two reasons that Christians lose their power.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The first is sin, and the second is rebellion.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The greatest sign of rebellion is reviling words that issue from the mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>It is impossible for a spring to gush forth sweet and bitter water together James 3:11 .</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>Once we gush forth bitter water, the sweet water is gone.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The same mouth cannot speak reviling words and words of love at the same time.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>This is particularly true with a minister of God's word.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He cannot revile men with his mouth and then a few minutes later use the same mouth to edify men.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>A great cause of loss of power in a Christian is rebellion against authority through reviling with his mouth.</S>
