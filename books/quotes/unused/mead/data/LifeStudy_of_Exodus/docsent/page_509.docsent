   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE SPIRIT COMPOUNDED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THROUGH CHRIST S SUFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The five elements of the anointing oil the four spices and the olive oil all had to pass through a process that involved either pressure or cutting.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>For instance, if olives are not put into the press, they cannot give forth olive oil.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Likewise, in order to have myrrh and cinnamon, some kind of incision must be made on the bark of a tree.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Someone has said that when a tree flows out the resin of myrrh, this resin has the appearance of tears.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This points to an experience of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The blood and tears that issue from our body also are signs of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When the myrrh tree flows out its resin, we may say that it is shedding tears.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>As we pointed out in a previous message, cinnamon comes from the inner part of the bark of a tree, and cassia comes from the outer part of the bark.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Cinnamon can be used to stimulate the heart, and cassia, to repel insects and snakes.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>All the spices were prepared for use through suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This indicates that the Spirit of God could become the Spirit of Christ as the compound ointment only through Christ s sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually, the compounding is the suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It was through the sufferings of Christ that the spices were blended with the oil to form the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord Jesus suffered death throughout His life, not only during the six hours He was on the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>As soon as He was born, He began to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This suffering is signified by myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In the past we have pointed out that the Lord Jesus lived a crucified life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A crucified life is a life of suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord Jesus was crucified continually.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He was crucified by His mother, by His brothers in the flesh, and by His disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Daily He lived a life of crucifixion.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This is the experience of myrrh dropping as tears from cuts made in the tree.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>After the Lord Jesus was born, the magi expressed their appreciation of Him by offering Him gold, frankincense, and myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At the time of His death, Nicodemus and Joseph of Arimathea also showed their appreciation of the Lord by putting myrrh upon His body when they buried Him.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Therefore, at the beginning of the Lord s life on earth and at the end, at His birth and at His death, there was myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This indicates that the Lord s life from birth to death was a life of suffering, a life of tears.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He lived a crucified life, a life of myrrh.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>THE EXTRACT OF CHRIST S DEATH</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>We need to learn how to apply the myrrh in our experience.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Where is the death of Christ today, and how can we apply it?</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The death of Christ is in the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In our language the word spirit in a particular usage can mean the essence of a substance as extracted in liquid form, especially by distillation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, the extract of a particular substance is the spirit of that substance.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>For example, alcoholic beverages made from extracts of grains are known as spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Likewise, the aloes used with myrrh to anoint the body of the Lord Jesus for burial may also be regarded as a kind of spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>When a plant, a grain, or some other substance is subjected to pressure, we can extract from it the spirit of that substance.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We can apply this principle to the Lord s death and ask this question: What is the extract of the death of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The answer is that the extract of the Lord s death is an element in the Spirit of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The real essence or element of any substance is its spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>For example, when we drink tea, we actually drink the spirit, the extract, of the tea.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The effectiveness of the tea is in this extract or spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>In like manner, the effectiveness of Christ s death is one of the elements of the compound Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>In speaking concerning the subjective experience of the cross of Christ, Jessie Penn-Lewis emphasized the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>In her writings she has much to say about the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>A. B. Simpson also saw something regarding the subjective aspect of the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>However, with respect to the subjective experience of the cross, he did not emphasize the Spirit as much as Jessie Penn-Lewis did.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A. B. Simpson s presentation is good doctrinally, but it is not so helpful experientially.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Concerning our identification with Christ in His death, A. B. Simpson emphasized the matter of reckoning.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He even wrote a hymn on the subject of reckoning.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Brother Watchman Nee pointed out that if we would experience the death of Christ, we need the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>He also said that the fact revealed in Romans 6 that our old man has been crucified with Christ can only be experienced through the Spirit in Romans 8.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words, apart from the Spirit we cannot experience the death of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The fact of our identification with Christ in His death is in Romans 6, but the experience of this is in Romans 8.</S>
