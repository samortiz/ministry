<p>Even though we are Christians, we are degraded in many ways. First, we are fallen by nature, and our spirit is deadened. We were born with a fallen nature, we grew up in a family with a fallen nature, and we live in a society with a fallen nature. We did not know how to use our spirit or how to fellowship with God. We have a fallen nature.</p>
<p>Second, Christianity is deformed and has become a religion without the Spirit and without life. In its practices, regulations, and system, Christianity is void of the Spirit. Whether or not we were in a denomination, we have been influenced by Christianity. Before we were Christians, we did not care for the things of the Lord, but now that we are Christians, we cannot escape the influence of Christianity. Whether consciously or unconsciously, we are influenced by the rituals, regulations, methods, organization, and even the atmosphere in Christianity.</p>
<p>Third, although we cannot say that there is no exercise of the spirit in our meetings, our exercise has decreased. We also lack a full understanding of the truth, even though our understanding of the truth is greater than our exercise of the spirit. Nevertheless, we have also developed methods and traditions.</p>
<p>These three aspects of degradation and oldness make it difficult for us to have a change of concept. If we want to be delivered from degraded concepts, from the influence of Christianity, and from our old situation, we need to be taken up to a &ldquo;high mountain,&rdquo; like the apostle John was, in order to see that God&rsquo;s economy, His redemption, His dealings with us, and His work on us are absolutely a matter of the spirit.</p>
<p>God has no intention to give us regulations and methods, which can only serve a temporary purpose. Circumcision in the Old Testament is a good example. God&rsquo;s focus was not on cutting off a piece of flesh. Circumcision is a picture of the New Testament believers&rsquo; need to deal with the flesh. This temporary matter in the Old Testament expressed a deeper truth in the New Testament. The Sabbath is another example. In the New Testament God is not interested in our keeping a special day. Whether or not we keep the Sabbath makes no difference. For this reason, when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He did not care for the Sabbath. God used the Sabbath to indicate that we must rest in Him. There are many examples in the Old Testament that bear New Testament significance.</p>
<h2 class="head1">CARING FOR THE SPIRIT AND REALITY</h2>
<h2 class="head2">Head Covering</h2>
<p>There are several matters in the New Testament that God is not focused on, such as baptism, breaking bread, head covering, and foot-washing. These items should not be mere practices to us; rather, we should stress the spiritual reality behind them. God does not care whether or not there is a piece of cloth on the head of a sister. He does not care for this practice; rather, He uses it to indicate a spiritual reality. God does not care for ordinances, rituals, ceremonies, or practices. However, this does not mean that an outward practice is wrong. When a sister wears a head covering, she should remember that it is worthless if her head covering is merely outward. She needs to be in the reality of the experience of head covering. By itself, head covering is merely a sign. Let me illustrate. Suppose I am invited to dinner and served a delicious meal with beautiful dishes. The dishes are needed to serve the meal, but I have not been invited to eat the dishes. When I receive an invitation for dinner, I am not concerned about the dishes; I care for the meal. As long as I am fed, I will be happy. Whether the dishes are made of porcelain, gold, or wood does not matter to me, because I cannot eat them. My focus is on the food, which is the reality. In the same way God does not care whether or not a sister wears a head covering. He cares for the reality, which is the Spirit. Without the Spirit there is no reality. God cares only for the Spirit. This is the concept we need.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Baptism</h2>
<p>Baptism is another example. Some saints still regard baptism as a regulation. Their concept is that baptism is a procedure for a person to join the Christian religion or to be admitted into the church. They say that a person who is not baptized has not completed the procedure to join the church. This concept comes from Christianity. It is a pity that God&rsquo;s children have such a concept concerning an item of truth. As a result of this concept, they oppose a person&rsquo;s being baptized a second time in order to bury his oldness, because they think that being baptized a second time is against the truth. Although we cannot find a statement or an example in the Bible of a person being baptized a second time, there is the type of the children of Israel crossing the Red Sea and the river Jordan.</p>
<p>The New Testament ministry is of the Spirit, not of the letter (2 Cor. 3:6). The Old Testament says that we should keep the Sabbath (Exo. 20:8). A person who did not keep the Sabbath was stoned to death (Num. 15:32-36). However, Romans 14:5 and 6 say, &ldquo;One judges one day above another; another judges every day alike...He who regards that day, regards it to the Lord.&rdquo; The principle in the New Testament is that we should not criticize or despise one another.</p>
<p>The New Testament says, &ldquo;Go therefore and disciple all the nations, baptizing them&rdquo; (Matt. 28:19), and &ldquo;He who believes and is baptized shall be saved&rdquo; (Mark 16:16). These are clear statements. The New Testament does not state whether a person should be baptized only one time or several times. However, believers make baptism a regulation because they have the tendency to keep regulations. Needless to say, if baptism is regarded as a ceremony to join the church, it should be conducted only once. How can a believer join the church more than once? Baptism is not a ceremony to join the church. It is not easy for us to break away from this concept.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_026.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_028.html">Next</a> </body></html>
