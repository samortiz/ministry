   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>ABRAHAM BEING TRIED</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After Abraham arrived in Canaan, the Bible shows us that he was tested three times concerning the land of Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Let us consider these three tests one by one.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The First Test Famine</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Soon after Abraham reached Bethel, failure set in. This was God's dealing to show him that his calling was of God's mercy and was not due to his own goodness.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Abraham was not born good; he failed just as everyone else does.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Genesis 12:9 says, "And Abram journeyed, going on still toward the south."</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>This was his failure: God had brought him to the house of God, but he did not stay there for long.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Instead he moved gradually to the south.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Although he did not move immediately into Egypt, he was in the south at the border of Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When he moved to the south, he encountered a famine.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Verse 10 says, "And there was a famine in the land: and Abram went down into Egypt to sojourn there; for the famine was grievous in the land."</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Abraham had reached the border of Egypt, and it was very easy for him to go into Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>After he arrived in Egypt, he began to lie and was rebuked by Pharaoh.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There he suffered great shame vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>11-20 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>After this he returned to Canaan.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This was his first test.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>How did this test start?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>God appeared to Abraham in Shechem and said to him, "Unto thy seed will I give this land."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>God intended to give Canaan to him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Did he want it?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Abraham was not a strong man.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Although God promised to give him this land, Abraham did not maintain his stand.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>What did he do?</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>He kept moving to the south until he reached Egypt.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This was the cause of the first test.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The first trial tested Abraham to see if he wanted this land.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Abraham did not see the preciousness of the land.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In order to establish him in the land, God had to test Abraham.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>After his failure in Egypt, Abraham learned one lesson: He realized the importance of Canaan and knew that it was wrong to lie or deceive.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was a shame for God's people to be rebuked by the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>What did he do?</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Genesis 13:1-3 says, "And Abram went up out of Egypt, he, and his wife, and all that he had, and Lot with him, into the south.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>And Abram was very rich in cattle, in silver, and in gold.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>And he went on his journeys from the south even to Bethel, unto the place where his tent had been at the beginning, between Bethel and Hai."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He returned to his former position.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Now Abraham knew how to treasure the land.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>In this land there was no need to lie, and he did not need to bear the reproach of the Egyptians.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>In this land he could glorify God.</S>
