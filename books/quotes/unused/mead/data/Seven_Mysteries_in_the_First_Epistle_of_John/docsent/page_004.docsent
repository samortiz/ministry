   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>FELLOWSHIP</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The purpose of this declaration is not that its hearers may have life, as is the case with the Gospel of John John 10:10 ; rather, it is that they may have fellowship with the apostles, whose fellowship "is with the Father, and with his Son Jesus Christ."</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In this message we are considering the mystery of life.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>But in 1 John 1:3 we have another mystery, the mystery of fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What does the term fellowship mean?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is not easy to come up with a satisfactory definition.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Fellowship is the flowing of the life we have received.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Life is a Person, the Son of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>When we receive this life, it begins to flow within us.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Like the blood flowing in our veins, it is never at a standstill.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>All the time we are going about our daily living, the blood keeps circulating.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Physical exercise keeps us healthy by further stimulating our circulation.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>If our circulation stops, we are finished.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Fellowship is the scriptural term for circulation.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our eyes are in the "fellowship," as are our shoulders and our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>All the members of our body are in the fellowship; the blood circulates to all of them.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Fellowship is also like the current of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When electricity is in motion, it is called a current.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If you check your electrical meter when your appliances are operating, you will see that the current moves when you use the electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>If you do not use any electricity, there is no flow of the current.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The meter has nothing to register.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When the appliances are switched on, however, they receive the current of electricity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>That current is the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If you are not "switched on" and partaking of the flow of "electricity," you are not in the fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Like an appliance, your functioning results from your participating in the current.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The Lord Jesus as the divine Person is life to us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When we receive Him, He comes into us and we are put into Him.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>This life then circulates as fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The life received issues in fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The apostles declared life "that ye also may have fellowship."</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Many Christians do not realize that once they are saved, they are in a fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Fellowship is simply the flowing of the divine life within us.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>When life stands still, it is life; when it flows, it is fellowship.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>GRACE AND LOVE</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the Gospel of John we are told that the incarnated Word dwelt among us, "full of grace and reality" 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>When we receive this Word who became flesh, we receive grace and truth reality .</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>"For of His fullness we all received, and grace upon grace" v. 16 .</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the First Epistle of John, however, the words grace and truth are replaced.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Instead of grace, we are told that God is love 4:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Instead of truth, we are told that God is light 1:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Suppose we have a pair of chopsticks.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>One is called grace at the tip and love at the other tip.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The other chopstick is called truth at the tip and light at the other tip.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>When we pick up the chopsticks and look at the tips from which we eat, we see grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If we look at the other end, however, we shall see love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Grace is at one end, the one facing us, and love is at the other end, facing God.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>The other chopstick has truth on the end facing us, while light is the tip pointed toward God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>When God came to us in the Person of the Son, He brought grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After we receive these, we return to God in the Son and find love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Gospel of John presents us with the issue, grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>His Epistle brings us to the source, where the Father is, and there we find love and light.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>When we receive the Son, we receive life and enjoy grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This life flows in us as fellowship, bringing us back to the Father, where we enjoy love and light, the source of grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>We enjoy grace and find it most sweet.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But we must go on to love, which is deeper and more hidden.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Grace is the expression; its source is love.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>These two are one.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If we enjoy love, grace is included.</S>
