   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>a Through Christ's Going and Coming Death and Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The believers have been brought forth as a new child through Christ's going and coming, that is, through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>When the disciples heard about the Lord's going, they understood it in a natural way.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>They thought that the Lord's going meant that He would leave them and stay away from them forever.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, according to the Gospel of John, the Lord's going was to die an all-inclusive death to take away sin, terminate the old creation, judge the world, destroy Satan, abolish the law of commandments and ordinances, release the divine life, and prepare a place for the believers to enter into God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Many readers of the Gospel of John think that the Lord's coming in John 14 refers to His second advent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>But by the word "coming" the Lord was referring to something that was to happen only a few days later His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The Lord's coming was His resurrection to germinate us in order to have a new creation to produce the church, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Therefore, in John 14, the Son's coming signifies His coming as the Spirit in resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>His going was His death, and His coming was His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Death was a preparatory step for resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Lord Jesus died so that He might enter into resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Actually, His going was His coming for He came by going.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When the disciples heard about the Lord's going, they were disappointed, thinking that they would lose their dear Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>However, He comforted them by indicating that He would go through death in order to come to them in resurrection and enter into them.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Lord said to them, "I am coming to you" John 14:18 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then He went on to say, "In that day you shall know that I am in My Father, and you in Me, and I in you" 14:20 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>That day was the day of the Lord's resurrection John 20:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>On the day of His resurrection the Lord came back to the disciples to breathe Himself into them as the Spirit of the divine realities.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>This means that the One who entered into them was the Lord Himself as the pneumatic Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>That was His coming back to enter into the disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Therefore, through Christ's going and coming, through His death and resurrection, the new child was born. b As the Aggregate of All the Children Sons of God Brought Forth with Christ in His Resurrection</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The new child is the aggregate of all the children John 1:12 or sons of God brought forth with Christ in His resurrection Acts 13:33; 1 Pet 1:3 as His many brothers Rom 8:29 .</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>This new child consists of Christ as the firstborn Son of God with all His brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the believers, therefore, are parts, members, of this new child.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The new child as the aggregate of all the children of God was brought forth in Christ's resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>According to 1 Peter 1:3, God regenerated us through the resurrection of Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Christ was resurrected, we were regenerated to be children of God.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The new child is the aggregate of all the children of God regenerated by God through the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, the Lord's resurrection was a universal delivery, the delivery not of a single child but of a corporate child including Christ as the Head and His many brothers as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>This was the birth of a new corporate child comprising Christ and the believers. c To Be the New Man as the Body of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The new child brought forth with Christ in His resurrection is the new man as the Body of Christ Eph 2:15; Col 3:10-11 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The birth of the new child was actually the birth of the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The old man was created by God in Genesis 1 and 2, but the new man was born through the resurrection of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We were born into the old man, but we were regenerated into the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This new man includes Christ as the Head and all the believers as the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The Head is the firstborn Son of God, and the Body is a composition of all the many sons of God, the many brothers of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This new man, this child, was brought forth through Christ's death and resurrection.</S>
