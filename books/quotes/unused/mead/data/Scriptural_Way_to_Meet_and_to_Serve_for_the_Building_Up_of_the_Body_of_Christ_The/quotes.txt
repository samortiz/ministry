[1]  The Scriptural Way to Meet and to Serve for the Building Up of the Body of Christ CONTENTS
[2]  The God-ordained Way to Meet and to Serve as Revealed in the Holy Word
[3]  For the Heading Up of All Things in Christ
[4]  God s New Testament economy is for the heading up of all things in Christ through the church as the Body of Christ Eph 1:10 .
[5]  As we meet we are taking step after step to lead all the created things toward one direction, that is, to be headed up in Christ.
[6]  While we are singing, praising, and testifying, we declare that we are taking the lead as the firstfruit of His creatures James 1:18 to lead all the creatures to the point of everything being headed up in Christ.
[7]  The church was redeemed by the death of Christ, the church was produced in the resurrection of Christ, and now Christ meets with His brothers in the church Heb 2:11-12 .
[8]  Do we have a full realization that when we come to a meeting, Christ is meeting with us?
[9]  They knew God as their Creator, and they knew Jehovah as their Lord, but they did not know that this very Jehovah God in the resurrected Christ had become their Father and that they were the sons of this begetting Father.
[10]  THE GOVERNING PRINCIPLE OF THE CHURCH MEETINGS Christ Meeting with the Believers
[11]  Now we want to see the governing principle of the church meetings.
[12]  The number one principle is that Christ meets with the believers.
[13]  If we do not have Christ meeting with us, this is not a real Christian meeting.
[14]  To have a real Christian meeting, we must have Christ meeting with us.
[15]  We must also have our meetings in the reality of Christ s resurrection in the Spirit and life of the resurrected Christ.
[16]  The best way to know this matter is to realize the following principle: as long as we pray or speak in our natural life, in ourselves, we are neither in the Spirit nor in the life of the resurrected Christ.
[17]  When we realize that we are not speaking in the Spirit and life of Christ, we have to drop this kind of speaking.
[18]  FOR THE CHURCH MEETINGS Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:26; Eph 5:18-21; Acts 10:46; 1 Cor 14:22, 5, 13; Acts 13:52; Rom 8:4; Col 3:16; Acts 8:4 TO MEET AS ORDAINED BY THE APOSTLE
[19]  All of us should learn how to have something to minister to others.
[20]  A saint may also have a teaching to minister Christ and the things related to God for the edification of the believers and the building up of the Body of Christ.
[21]  The saints come to the church meetings to learn to know, enjoy, and receive Christ and the things related to God.
[22]  To teach in the way of ministering Christ is for the edification of the saints and the building up of the Body of Christ.
[23]  When we come to the meetings, we may also have a revelation to unveil the economy of God concerning Christ and the church as the Body of Christ for the corporate expression of the Triune God.
[24]  We should learn to speak God, speak Christ, speak the word of the Lord, speak salvation, and speak the life supply to the young believers.
[25]  Another requirement on the believers for their meetings is that they must live and walk according to the spirit to live a victorious life Rom 8:4 .
[26]  After making a thorough confession, we have to begin a new life.
[27]  In this chapter we will consider the characteristics of the believers meetings.
[28]  The first characteristic of a Christian meeting is that the believers are gathered into the name of the Lord.
[29]  Hebrews 10:25 says, Not forsaking the assembling of ourselves together, as the custom with some is, but exhorting one another, and so much the more as you see the day drawing near.
[30]  The Christian meetings should be full of mutuality in speaking Eph 5:19 .
[31]  To fill the Christian meetings with mutuality is not very easy, but to have the mutuality is wonderful!
[32]  In John 4, the Samaritan woman brought up the subject of worship, and the Lord told her that the proper worship is the exercise of our spirit to contact God the Spirit v. 24 . To contact God the Spirit with our spirit is to drink of the living water vv.
[33]  When I attended my mother s church service in her denomination, I never prepared myself because I realized that I did not need to do anything and that nearly everything would be done by our pastor.
[34]  Paul s thought in 1 Corinthians 12 is that the dumb, voiceless idols make their worshippers dumb and voiceless v. 2; Psa 115:4-8 , but the living God causes His worshippers to speak in His Spirit v. 3 . Paul said in 12:2 that when we were of the nations, we were led away to dumb idols.
[35]  The traditional way to meet and to serve fits man s natural and fallen condition.
[36]  The natural way of meeting and serving is also religious.
[37]  TO MEET AND TO SERVE 2 Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 12:6; Eph 4:12b, 15-16
[38]  In the last chapter we considered several points concerning the traditional way to meet and serve.
[39]  These points include the following: the traditional way adopts the way of human society for religion in the customs of the nations 2 Kings 17:8, NASB ; the traditional way is natural, fitting man s natural and fallen condition; the traditional way does not require man to be living and in the spirit; and the traditional way is religious.
[40]  Another aspect of the traditional way to meet and to serve, which looks very good but is not so encouraging, is the preaching of the gospel.
[41]  The preaching of the gospel in the Christianity way is not prevailing.
[42]  Where are the saints experiencing the all-inclusive Christ and growing with Him, having the freedom and opportunity for their spiritual, organic function to be developed, and being built up together in the spirit so that not only a local church but also the whole Body of Christ can be built up as the full expression of God?
[43]  The traditional way has not only bound and annulled the spiritual function of the members of Christ but also has choked and even killed the living members of Christ for all the time in the past history of the church.
[44]  On the one hand, the traditional way feeds people, but on the other hand, because of the clerical class, in many aspects it frustrates the believers from growing in life and even chokes them to death.
[45]  Although we have left organized Christianity, its traditional way to meet and to serve still influences us to quite an extent, and we are even under its bondage, without any awareness of its damage to the Body of Christ, which we are endeavoring to build up by all its members functioning in each one s measure Eph 4:16 .
[46]  According to Ephesians 4:11-12, Christ, the Head, has given us the gifted persons, such as the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints unto the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ.
[47]  Verses 15 and 16 say, But holding to truth in love, we may grow up into Him in all things, who is the Head, Christ, out from whom all the Body, fitted and knit together through every joint of the supply, according to the operation in measure of each one part, causes the growth of the Body unto the building up of itself in love.
[48]  Although we are in the Lord s recovery, we must admit that we have not realized very much of the building up of the Body of Christ.
[49]  TO MEET AND TO SERVE 1 Scripture Reading: Acts 13:52; Gal 5:16; Rom 8:4 SPIRITUAL,
[50]  In chapter four we saw that the traditional way to meet and to serve is natural, fitting man s natural and fallen condition, not requiring man to be living and in the spirit, religious, and adopting the way of human society for religion.
[51]  When we were deadened, this way of meeting fit our condition, but once we were made alive, became living, and sought to live a life of seeking after Christ, this way of meeting began to offend us.
[52]  Since the scriptural way to meet and to serve is opposite to the traditional way in which we have been for quite some time, to take the scriptural way we need to have some changes in our meeting and service.
[53]  Early in the morning after rising, we should call on the name of the Lord and feed on two or three verses, not only reading and pray-reading them but dwelling upon them to enjoy the Lord.
[54]  The foregoing statistics prove that the way of preaching the gospel by knocking on people s doors is prevailing.
[55]  However, our success depends on whether or not the saints in the Lord s recovery would sacrifice and pay the price.
[56]  There is nothing in this traditional way but the annulling of the organic functions of the living members of the Body of Christ and the binding and killing of the living members of the Body of Christ.
[57]  The scriptural way to meet and to serve is also able to nourish man in his spirit Eph 5:29 .
[58]  If we endeavor to have the proper meeting according to the New Testament way, every meeting will be not only nourishing but also cherishing.
[59]  In the proper way according to God s eternal economy, all of the believers are growing in the divine life, meeting in the Spirit, and coming together to speak something from their experience of Christ as the life supply by exercising their spirit.
[60]  The scriptural way to meet and to serve is able to develop the organic function and ability of the members of Christ and is able to build up the Body of Christ Eph 4:12, 16 .
[61]  Ephesians 4:12 tells us that the gifted persons do their work to perfect the saints that the saints may carry out the work of the ministry for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[62]  ACCORDING TO THE SCRIPTURAL WAY Scripture Reading: Acts 2:42; 1 Cor 14:26; Heb 10:25; Col 3:16; 1 Cor 14:4b; 1 Tim 1:3-4, 7; Col 2:2b; Eph 3:4 SPEAKING ACCORDING TO
[63]  First, the contents of our meetings according to the God-ordained way must always be according to the teaching of the apostles.
[64]  Our speaking in the apostles teaching according to the practice at Paul s time can be by a psalm, a teaching, a revelation 1 Cor 14:26 , an exhortation Heb 10:25 , or an admonition Col 3:16 .
[65]  We may also speak in the meetings according to the apostles teaching by presenting a teaching.
[66]  Teaching covers a broad field, but we should not go beyond the limit of the teaching of the apostles.
[67]  In order to practice the scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ, we need a clear vision of God s New Testament economy.
[68]  Christ is the mystery of God, and the mystery of God as God s very expression has been completed by Christ s being incarnated.
[69]  Before the New Testament times, it would not have been possible to talk to Abraham or David about the mystery of God.
[70]  God s New Testament economy is to have Himself embodied in Christ to dispense the riches of Christ into God s chosen people for the producing of the Body of Christ Eph 1:23 and for the completion of the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4 , which is the church as Christ s fullness and expression.
[71]  This completing word is to announce Christ, to warn every man by Christ in all wisdom, and to teach every man with Christ in all wisdom that we may present every man full-grown in Christ v. 28 . We grow into Christ, and Christ is constituted into our very being to make us real Christ-men.
[72]  CHAPTER TEN THE MINISTRY OF THE RICHES OF CHRIST Scripture Reading: 2 Cor 3:7-9; Eph 3:8; Rom 12:5; Eph 1:23; 3:3
[73]  This chapter may be considered as the conclusion of all the foregoing chapters.
[74]  The ministry of the New Testament is the ministry of the riches of Christ; this ministry ministers the riches of Christ.
[75]  Strictly speaking, throughout all the dispensations in the Bible, God has had only two ministries, the Old Testament ministry and the New Testament ministry.
[76]  When we minister the riches of Christ to God s chosen people in the meeting, we minister, or dispense, the very Triune God to them.
[77]  Many years ago I studied the book of Ephesians very much.
[78]  However, I did not pay attention to the phrase, the riches of Christ.
[79]  The first major item of the riches of Christ is the embodiment of the fullness of the complete Godhead Col 2:9 , not only the fullness of the Godhead of the Father, the Godhead of the Son, or the Godhead of the Spirit alone, but the fullness of the Godhead of the complete Triune God.
[80]  FOR THE CHURCH MEETINGS Scripture Reading: John 3:15-16; 6:48; Eph 3:8; 1 Cor 15:45b; Phil 1:19; John 6:57; Eph 6:17-18; John 6:63; Rev 2:7, 4-5, 17, 15; 3:20, 15, 18
[81]  In the previous chapters of this book we have seen much concerning the riches of Christ as the embodiment of the processed Triune God.
[82]  The purpose for seeing these things is that we may enjoy Christ.
[83]  The best way to eat Christ is to pray-read His Word Jer 15:16 .
[84]  Although we did not have this term among us until 1966, some of the saints in the past centuries at various times did practice the reading of the holy Word in the same way as what we call pray-reading.
[85]  Today the new way to meet and to serve is to minister Christ to people, which is to dispense the processed Triune God into His chosen people to enlarge the Body of Christ, that is, to make the Body of Christ bigger and bigger.
[86]  The riches of Christ are not for theological study; the riches of Christ are for our enjoyment.
[87]  When we study the Bible with our mind alone, the unsearchable riches of Christ are just words printed in black and white.
[88]  But when we exercise our spirit to enjoy what is mentioned in the Bible, the riches of Christ get into us.
[89]  In the beginning, it is simply the printed word, but when we exercise our spirit to pray-read this word, taking and receiving it by means of all prayer in our spirit Eph 6:17-18 , it immediately becomes the life-giving Spirit.
[90]  If we do not know that we have a spirit, or we do not know how to exercise our spirit properly, we may simply exercise our mind to pray without touching our spirit at all.
[91]  We may lose our first love toward the Lord, but by eating Jesus we recover our first love toward Him Rev 2:4 .
[92]  The more we eat Him, the more we will appreciate Him, the more we will love Him, and the more we will say, Lord Jesus, You are one with me and I am one with You.
[93]  If the saints in a locality do not know how to enjoy Christ, to eat Christ daily, sooner or later the lampstand, the testimony of the Lord, will be removed from that locality.
[94]  To Produce the White Stone for God s Building
[95]  Revelation 2:17 says, I will give him a white stone, and on the stone a new name written, which no one knows but he who receives it.
[96]  If we eat Jesus in a hidden way as the hidden manna, we will grow and be transformed into a white stone.
[97]  A stone in the Bible signifies material for God s building Matt 16:18; 1 Pet 2:5; 1 Cor 3:12 .
[98]  Because we have received the divine life with its divine nature through regeneration, we can be transformed into stones, even precious stones, by enjoying Christ as our life supply 2 Cor 3:18 .
[99]  If we do not follow the worldly church, but enjoy the Lord in the proper church life, we will be transformed into stones for the building of God.
[100]  God s building, the building of the church, depends upon our transformation, and our transformation issues from the enjoyment of Christ as our life supply.
[101]  The Lord s word to the church in Laodicea in Revelation 3:18 is to buy from Him gold refined by fire that you may be rich, and white garments that you may be clothed and that the shame of your nakedness may not be manifested, and eyesalve to anoint your eyes that you may see.
[102]  As we experience Christ in such a way, we recover our faith in Christ signified by the gold, the Lord Himself is our approved conduct signified by the white garments, and we receive our sight to see the deep things of God and the spiritual things concerning Christ indicated by the eyesalve.
[103]  In this chapter we want to see the availability of Christ.
[104]  Christ is so available and ready for us to enjoy Him at any time and in any place.
[105]  The processed Triune God is a new expression that we use to describe or unveil what we have seen and what we have experienced of our God.
[106]  The all-inclusive Christ is realized in His Spirit Rom 8:9 .
[107]  The Spirit, as the realization of the all-inclusive Christ, consisting of the unsearchable riches of Christ Eph 3:8 with the bountiful supply for the believers life and work Phil 1:19 , indwells the believers spirits Rom 8:11, 16 .
[108]  When we experience the all-inclusive Christ as the Spirit and speak Him in the meeting, that meeting is according to God s economy in His fatherhood.
[109]  The Triune God is embodied in Christ, Christ is realized in and as the Spirit, and the Spirit is embodied in the living word of Christ.
[110]  The processed Triune God, the all-inclusive Christ, and the Spirit are invisible, but the Word is visible and can be pray-read by us.
[111]  When we pray-read the Word, we are pray-reading the processed Triune God, we are pray-reading Christ, and we are pray-reading the all-inclusive, bountiful, life-giving Spirit.
[112]  IN GOD S NEW TESTAMENT ECONOMY Scripture Reading: John 3:3, 5-6; Acts 13:52; Eph 3:19b; 5:18; Acts 4:8, 31; 2:17-18; Luke 24:49
[113]  According to my study of the Bible and my Christian experiences, I realized that in my Christian life the things that I experience of Christ, of the Triune God, of the Spirit, and of the divine life with the divine nature, are altogether normal to me.
[114]  At the beginning of my Christian life, I read the writings of some inner-life teachers who taught that all these spiritual and divine things were great miracles that were not easy to attain.
[115]  Some inner life teachers said that it was not so easy to be regenerated, and they called regeneration the first blessing.
[116]  He said that regeneration was to receive God s divine life in addition to our human life.
[117]  To be regenerated is to be born of the Spirit in our spirit John 3:3, 5-6 , thus obtaining God s divine life to become the sons of God John 1:12-13 .
[118]  Then we can lead this one to the water of baptism, and when we are baptizing him, we can pray, Lord, we baptize this one into the Triune God.
[119]  It is difficult to determine when Peter and the other disciples who followed the Lord in His earthly ministry were regenerated.
[120]  These three items regeneration, being filled with the Spirit essentially, and being filled with the Spirit economically cover the entire Christian life.
[121]  The authority of the Lord, the position in the ascended Christ, the clothing of the Spirit of power as the uniform for ministry, the miraculous gifts such as speaking in tongues and healing, and all the activities of power are included in the outpouring of the Spirit upon us.
[122]  We need to be clear about the difference between the infilling of the essential Spirit and the outpouring of the economical Spirit see God s New Testament Economy, chapters seven through ten .
[123]  First Corinthians 12 shows us that speaking the word of wisdom and of knowledge and the prophetic word are the result and the manifestation of the infilling Spirit 1 Cor 12:7-8, 10 and notes 8 1 and 10 2 in the Recovery Version .
[124]  The word of knowledge helps the saints to know the heavenly, spiritual, and divine things, and is mainly concerning Christ as the mystery of God Col 2:2 and the church as the mystery of Christ Eph 3:4 .
[125]  One exposition of 1 Corinthians written among the Brethren points out that this book deals with eleven major problems in the church in Corinth, but it does not speak much concerning Christ and Christ crucified 1 Cor 2:2 and the Body, the church.
[126]  Bearing the fruit of the Spirit is also a result and manifestation of the infilling of the Spirit Gal 5:22-23 .
[127]  As we have seen, prophesying in the sense of speaking Christ and speaking forth Christ is related to the inward filling of the Spirit.
[128]  CHAPTER FIFTEEN THE EXERCISE OF THE REGENERATED SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 3:5-6; Rom 8:16; 1 Cor 6:17; 2 Tim 1:7; Eph 6:18; Acts 6:10; Rom 8:4
[129]  The exercise of our regenerated spirit is a crucial matter in our experience.
[130]  When a baby is born, he first exercises his body.
[131]  When we confessed and called on the name of the Lord, the Spirit, who is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God, entered into our spirit to enliven it and to dwell in it, to unite and mingle Himself with our spirit to form a mingled entity composed of the divine God and a human man.
[132]  Today the Spirit is not far away in the third heavens; He is right here in our spirit.
[133]  When we know how to exercise our spirit, the very Spirit in our spirit works together with us.
[134]  This Spirit is Christ 2 Cor 3:17; 1 Cor 15:45b , and Christ is the processed Triune God.
[135]  But if I speak by exercising my spirit, and the very Triune God says, Amen within me, I am encouraged and have the peace, joy, and confidence that I am one with the Triune God.
[136]  If we all experience this, our meetings will be in the third heavens, full of the Triune God, full of Christ, and full of the riches of Christ.
[137]  THE WORD OF THE LORD WITH THE SPIRIT Scripture Reading: John 1:1, 14; 6:63; 7:38-39; Rom 10:8; Eph 5:18-19; Col 3:16
[138]  For us to meet and to serve in the scriptural way, we must exercise to speak the word of the Lord with the Spirit.
[139]  Our speaking of the living word of the Lord will issue in the building up of the Body of Christ.
[140]  In chapter one of the Gospel of John, we are told that the Word was God Himself embodied to be Jesus.
[141]  The Lord Jesus said in John 6:63, The words which I have spoken unto you are spirit and are life.
[142]  The living word, the embodiment of the Spirit, is in our mouth and in our heart according to Romans 10:8.
[143]  This word is Christ, and this word is the Spirit, the processed Triune God.
[144]  In order to practice the scriptural way to meet and to serve for the building up of the Body of Christ, we have to build up a habit of speaking the word of the Lord.
[145]  For us to be saints who meet properly according to the holy Word, we need to build up a habit of speaking the word of the Lord in our daily life and in our daily affairs.
[146]  To speak the word of the Lord regularly in daily affairs is to apply certain verses from the Bible to your affairs.
[147]  TO SPEAK THE WORD OF THE LORD Scripture Reading: Heb 5:13; 2 Tim 3:15-17; Col 3:16; Eph 5:19; 1 Thes 5:20; 1 Tim 6:3; Acts 2:42
[148]  In chapter sixteen, we saw that we need to be those who exercise to speak the word of the Lord with the Spirit.
[149]  We do not have the habit of teaching others to speak the word of the Lord.
[150]  Because we do not adequately practice speaking the Lord s word, we do not have the habit of teaching others to do so.
[151]  If we desire to teach others to speak the word of the Lord, we must do one basic thing, that is, we must increase our knowledge and experience of the word.
[152]  To increase our knowledge and experience of the word, we also need to study and use the proper hymns Eph 5:19; Col 3:16b .
[153]  Any writing that we use apart from the holy Scriptures must be based upon the Scriptures.
[154]  When we have the increase of the knowledge and experience of the word, we are qualified to teach others.
[155]  In this chapter we will see some of the practical steps to raise the new believers.
[156]  We must learn the steps of how to raise up the new believers in the growth in life.
[157]  If we are going to raise the new believers, we must learn how to lead them to call on the name of the Lord Rom 10:12-13; 2 Tim 2:22 .
[158]  The Lord s Person Being the Lord the Spirit
[159]  A unique way to enjoy Him as all these aspects, to enjoy His presence, is to call on His name.
[160]  Then when we visit the new believers in their home meetings, we will bring not only this practice into their homes but also an atmosphere, spirit, attitude, and impression into the new believers themselves.
[161]  After leading the new ones to call on the name of the Lord, we should immediately lead them to be filled with the essential Spirit.
[162]  After someone is saved, we should lead him immediately into speaking the Lord as the gospel, preaching the gospel in the boldness received by faith in the outpouring of the Spirit.
[163]  According to the revelation of the Bible, we should pray, confess, stand on the word of God, exercise our spirit and our faith, and speak in boldness.
[164]  CHAPTER TWENTY THE INCLUSIVENESS OF THE SCRIPTURAL WAY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 2:2; Col 2:2; 2 Cor 3:8; John 1:4; Eph 1:23; 3:4; 5:32; Matt 22:9-14; Luke 14:23; Acts 2:46; 5:42; 12:12; 1 Cor 14:26; Heb 10:25; Acts 9:31; Eph 4:12, 16
[165]  In October of 1984, I was burdened that we in the Lord s recovery could have a new start.
[166]  I told the saints in Taipei that what I meant by a new start was that we needed to change our present practice.
[167]  I was fully aware of all the complications that would be raised up when we attempted to change our practice so that it could fully conform to the scriptural way.
[168]  I knew that some would feel very positive about this change, but I was also aware that a small number of the dear saints who have been meeting with us for many years and who have been so faithful to the Lord s recovery and to the church life might not be so happy about this change.
[169]  In the objective aspect of the truth there are four main factors: Christ 1 Cor 2:2; Col 2:2 , the Spirit 2 Cor 3:8 , life John 1:4 , and the church Eph 1:22b-23; 3:4; 5:32 .
[170]  Preaching the gospel for others salvation is a means to accomplish the purpose that can fulfill God s economy concerning Christ and the Spirit through the divine life for the church.
[171]  The subjective way of practice also includes building up home meetings Acts 2:46; 5:42 and group meetings Acts 12:12 .
[172]  Many people do not like to come to a big meeting, but we can send the meeting to their homes.
[173]  It is not so easy to set up home meetings in a prevailing way and it is even more difficult to group them together to bring them fully into the church life, not in the old way but in the biblical, God-ordained way.
[174]  CHAPTER TWENTY-ONE THE PRACTICAL WAY Scripture Reading: Luke 10:5-6; Acts 2:46; 5:42; 1 Cor 14:26, 4, 12 BUILDING UP THE PRACTICE
[175]  In this chapter we will consider the practical way in the Lord s recovery to carry out the new way.
[176]  From the time we first began to speak on this matter, we have not expected all the saints in the recovery to go out to visit people by knocking on their doors.
[177]  THE NEED TO BE POOR IN SPIRIT TO BE TRAINED
[178]  To learn to go out in this way we must first be empty in our spirit.
[179]  Regardless of how old we are and how experienced we have been, we must learn to be poor in spirit.
[180]  The way to practically carry out God s ordained way is to build up a practice of the proper preaching of the gospel, build up home meetings and group meetings, build up the meetings to be full of mutuality, and build up the local churches for the building of the universal Body of Christ.
[181]  We may have seen something of the new way, but to carry out what we have seen is not an easy thing.
[182]  This is true even with all the churches in the Lord s recovery.
[183]  ACCORDING TO THE GOD-ORDAINED WAY Scripture Reading: 2 Kings 17:8; Eph 4:12-16
[184]  In this chapter we want to see the characteristics of the meetings according to the God-ordained way.
[185]  God s ordained way, His new way, has its own inward, intrinsic, and divine essence, substance, and nature.
[186]  The third characteristic of the proper Christian meeting is that it fits the living believers taste.
[187]  He wanted to remain in Christ all the time, doing things in Christ, acting in Christ, and living in Christ.
[188]  In other words, he wanted to be one with Christ that people might see him in Christ, find him in Christ, and meet him in Christ.
[189]  In 1 Timothy 2, Paul exhorts us to pray on behalf of all men v. 1 because God our Savior desires all men to be saved v. 4 . God s desire requires our prayer for it to be carried out.
[190]  We must have the assurance and the confidence that we are going out to visit people for the gospel s sake with Christ and that Christ is going with us.
[191]  You could say, I have come to bring the good news to you ; I have come with Christ to visit you ; I have come with God to see you ; or Sir, I had a burden to come here to read the Bible with you.
[192]  We may tell this one that we have come with Christ to visit him, and we may go to a portion in The Mystery of Human Life to show him that he is a vessel to contain Christ and that this very Christ is God Himself as the Spirit.
[193]  We must baptize others with much assurance and confidence that we are not merely putting them into the water but that we are putting them into the Triune God.
[194]  According to Matthew 28:19, to baptize people into the name of the Father, and of the Son, and of the Spirit means to put them into the organic union with the Triune God see notes 19 4 and 19 5 on this verse in the Recovery Version .
[195]  CHAPTER TWENTY-FOUR LIFE AND FRUIT-BEARING Scripture Reading: John 15:1-8, 16; 12:24, 28
[196]  We need to be brought into a full realization that today we all are the branches of the divine, true vine v. 5 . In order to see the intention of the Lord s speaking in John 15, we have to realize that the section from John 12:12 through John 17 is one section on the multiplication of Christ.
[197]  Some teach that the fruit borne by the branches is ethical virtues such as love, longsuffering, kindness, etc., as mentioned in Galatians 5:22-23.
[198]  When we are in the divine fellowship, enjoying the divine exposing, and we cooperate with this divine exposing by our confessing, we are receiving the very Christ as the embodiment of the Triune God and as the instant word.
[199]  In this chapter, we want to see the growth in life for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[200]  If we do not pray, receive the exposing from the Father s light, cooperate with the Father s shining, and make a thorough confession of all our failures, we will be at a standstill in our growth in life.
[201]  Ephesians 4:12-16 speaks of the growth in life for the building up of the Body of Christ.
[202]  We grow in life by fully knowing the Son of God v. 13a . The full knowledge of the Son of God is the realization of the revelation concerning the Son of God for our experience.
[203]  We should endeavor to know Christ as the Son of God by studying the New Testament.
[204]  Our growth in life is for arriving at the measure of the stature of the fullness of Christ v. 13b . We need to understand the relationship of these four nouns in 4:13 the measure, the stature, the fullness, and Christ.
[205]  The fellowship in this chapter is mainly to remind us of what the Lord has spoken in a promising and prophetic way concerning building up the church as the dwelling place of God in Matthew 16:18 and Ephesians 2:20-22 and as the Body of Christ in Ephesians 4:12-16.
[206]  Thus, both Matthew 16 and Ephesians 2 tell us that the building up of the church is based upon a revelation concerning Christ which is the foundation, or rock, for the building up of the church of Christ as the dwelling place of God.
[207]  In these two titles are Christ s person, Christ s very divine essence, and Christ s commission, Christ s ministry, Christ s work, to build up the church with His essence.
[208]  Christ is the commissioned One to do a work for God, which is to build up the church with His very essence, the divine essence of God, as the building material.
[209]  The church is a house to God, and at the same time, it is also a Body to Christ.
[210]  We may know the term the Body of Christ, but we may not be clear in our understanding concerning the real significance of the Body of Christ.
[211]  However, the church being the Body of Christ indicates that the Body is one with Christ in life and in nature.
[212]  CHAPTER TWENTY-SEVEN THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH
[213]  THE BUILDING UP OF THE CHURCH AS AN ORGANISM
[214]  The church as an organism preaches the gospel that people may be regenerated 1 Pet 1:23 .
[215]  The building up of the church as an organism includes ministering Christ as the life-giving Spirit through the word of the Scriptures that the believers may be transformed Rom 12:2; 2 Cor 3:18 .
[216]  The church meeting should be an exhibition of Christ in all His riches and a mutual enjoyment of Christ shared by all the attendants with one another before God and with God for the building up of the saints and the church.
[217]  The church ministers life to the living members of the Body of Christ, helping them to grow in the divine life into Christ, the Head, in all things that the Body of Christ may be built up by itself through the functions of its members Eph 4:15-16 .
[218]  CHAPTER TWENTY-EIGHT TRUTH AND LIFE SUPPLY Scripture Reading: John 14:6; 8:32; Eph 3:8; Phil 1:19; Eph 5:29 TRUTH
[219]  Truth is Christ with God as the reality John 14:6; 8:32 .
[220]  With us Christians, the believers in Christ, it is always possible that we could take something as a truth without the reality.
[221]  Today the divine Spirit is the consummated and consummating Spirit.
[222]  All that the Triune God is, has gone through, has accomplished, and has attained and obtained is consummated in this consummating Spirit.
[223]  God is the reality; therefore, in the New Testament the Spirit is also the reality John 14:17a; 1 John 5:6 .
[224]  If you have the Spirit, you have incarnation, the incarnated God, the processed Triune God.
[225]  If you have this Spirit, you have the very humanity of the Lord with His divinity, and you even have His very human living.
[226]  What I expect and what I would charge you to do is to go to minister the life supply to the hungry ones.
[227]  Do not consider that you are the only one who has been trained, qualified, and equipped with something to supply.
[228]  You must have the assurance that you are really one with the very Lord and that you are living Him.
[229]  If you do have something, you do not need to advertise or promote yourself; you do not need to prove that you have something.
[230]  CHAPTER TWENTY-NINE GRADUALLY AND POSITIVELY Scripture Reading: 1 Cor 14:26; Heb 10:25; Matt 16:18; Eph 4:12-16 THE APPLICATION OF THE BIBLICAL WAY
[231]  Keep in mind that in practicing the biblical way our goal is to arrive at one of the major items in the Lord s recovery.
[232]  What we are dealing with now may be the last item, the concluding item, of the Lord s recovery.
[233]  It seems that we are now very close to the end of this age, the conclusion of the ages, which will bring the Lord back.
[234]  I spent some time in fundamental Christianity and was eventually brought by the Lord into His recovery.
[235]  I realized that to build up the Body of Christ, to prepare the bride for Christ s coming back, and to conclude this age for the Lord s coming back to set up His kingdom on this earth, we must have something absolutely different from the practice of Christianity in the previous nineteen centuries.
