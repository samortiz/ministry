[2]  Volume 51 of The Collected Works contains messages given by Watchman Nee in a training for co-workers and elders at Kuling Mountain in China in 1948.
[3]  The office of the elder is for the purpose of taking care of the church, that is, for administrating the church.
[4]  After you have three, five, seven, or eight such people, you still have to examine them in the aspect of managing practical affairs.
[5]  But the church is a spiritual organization; therefore, you must first take care of the question of spirituality and then look at the ability, at whether or not a particular one can take care of practical affairs.
[6]  You will remember that Paul lived in Ephesus for a period of time and that there were elders there Acts 20 .
[7]  Therefore, when he left, he could say these words to the elders: "Take heed...among whom the Holy Spirit has placed you as overseers'' v. 28 . Paul personally imparted spiritual help to the elders.
[8]  If you read the first Epistle to Timothy and the Epistle to Titus, you will see that it was not merely a matter of appointing elders and then stopping there, but also of helping the elders to serve together along with them.
[9]  In every locality all the responsible brothers those who are elders and overseers should have an overseers' meeting every week.
[10]  I know of a certain church not in China where the responsible brothers decided to meet for a whole day once a week.
[11]  After those brothers leave, tell the elders why you answered in that way, why you said it in those words, what scriptural basis you have, and what feeling you have.
[12]  When you go out, you may lead many to be saved and bring them into service, yet if you cannot produce a few reliable brothers to bear the responsibility of the church, your going out will be a total failure.
[13]  The regular meeting of the responsible brothers is a very important item of their training.
[14]  If you go to a place and live for three months those who travel often for the work need to pay special attention to this , you need to arrange a time to gather all the responsible brothers together, perhaps on Friday or Saturday for an entire day or half a day, to help them take care of the affairs of the church.
[15]  Let the brothers and sisters know that this is the time the responsible brothers are dealing with things before God, and no one should come in. They can knock on the door only if the house is on fire and only when the fire has burned to the floor; even then they still should not come too early.
[16]  Therefore, brothers, when you go out to work, if you cannot reach the last step, the final step of causing all the brothers and sisters to rise up to serve God and bear responsibility in church affairs, you have totally failed, because that is not the church.
[17]  When the responsible brothers in each locality are gradually manifested, or when any locality already has responsible brothers, they should meet together.
[18]  Certain brothers asked: If we appoint some brothers to be the responsible ones of a local church, there is still some question concerning whether or not they are fit to be elders.
[19]  Whether or not we have the assurance, we should tell them, "Come, and I will help you, the more promising brothers, learn how to take care of the affairs of the church.''
[20]  In the future you can do a very profitable thing in a local church which is also the center of the work.
[21]  For example, if you are in Peking and you see that there are three very good brothers in Sui-Yuan and another two very good brothers in T'ai-yuan, you can invite them to come to Peking.
[22]  He should learn to observe how you manage spiritual things before God, how problems are solved, how questions are raised and discussed, how prayers are offered, how to sense before God whether or not a certain thing should be done, and how to make a decision when peace is obtained.
[23]  Then show him how to answer the questions the brothers and sisters bring, how you fellowship with brothers from out of town, how you receive those who ask to participate in the breaking of bread, and how you fellowship with those who want to be baptized.
[24]  In the meeting of the overseers, you need to bring in all solemnity.
[25]  When you come into this meeting, you should say, "We are handling things before God and should not have a loose attitude.''
[26]  If there is any responsible brother who comes to the meeting of the overseers and does not give his opinion in the meeting, but gives it in front of the brothers and sisters, you should rebuke him before the brothers in the next meeting: "You are not qualified to be a responsible brother!''
[27]  If you have a feeling or something to say, you should bring it up in the meeting of the overseers when all the brothers are together.
[28]  We must speak to him in front of all: "If you have anything to bring up, you must bring it up in front of the responsible ones among the co-workers; if you bring it up behind their back to any other person, you damage the oneness of the Body.''
[29]  If this meeting is strong before God, all the other meetings will spontaneously be uplifted.
[30]  You need to continue working until one day all the brothers and sisters respect the meeting of the overseers.
[31]  They will know that this day or this half a day is the time the responsible brothers go before God to take care of things.
[32]  We should first establish the principle that all of God's children are priests who should serve God.
[33]  With this principle in view, let us see how we can lead all the brothers and sisters to be priests in a local church.
[34]  In other words what kind of arrangement should we have in the spiritual work so that all the believers can participate in the spiritual things, both the new believers and those who have known the Lord for many years?
[35]  We need to see which spiritual things in a local church can be taken care of by the brothers and sisters.
[36]  When we compare these two, we see a very important matter, that is, God has established a category of people in the church called evangelists; but to those who are not evangelists, the command of the apostle is that they should do the work of an evangelist.
[37]  Caring for the gospel is something that we should practice before God.
[38]  I hope that all the brothers and sisters can bear the responsibility of caring for sinners in the work of preaching the gospel.
[39]  You need to show the brothers and sisters how great their responsibility is in bringing a person from home, from school, from a hospital, or from an office to the meetings.
[40]  Willing to Be Assigned to Attend to the New Ones
[41]  Those who did not bring anyone should take care of the surplus brought by others.
[42]  During the gospel preaching, all these brothers should sit aside and wait to be assigned by the brother who is responsible for handling the care of new ones that day.
[43]  After the meeting is over, you should stay with them to lead them to pray and to talk with them.
[44]  You should always bring them before the Lord, lead them to pray and receive Him, and then help them record their names.
[45]  However, we should place a few strong brothers to work together with them.
[46]  In caring for problems there is no need for too many brothers to be involved.
[47]  The work of preaching the gospel, caring for the gospel, and caring for the new believers requires the mobilization of almost everyone.
[48]  There are brothers and sisters who have a spiritual measure before the Lord which is weightier than that of others, and it should be quite weighty.
[49]  In the church, when brothers encounter problems, or if some special situations arise, you need to allow these brothers and sisters to make some arrangements concerning these problems among the saints.
[50]  I hope that when there is a brother or a sister who moves away from your locality, there would be a number of brothers who would do two things with them.
[51]  Therefore, on the one hand, there is the need among us for several brothers to correspond with him; on the other hand, some brothers need to be responsible to record the words spoken in the meetings, whether they are words spoken to believers or words of the gospel, and send them to that brother at least once a month.
[52]  My thought is that in the future, regarding the brothers who move away, letters of recommendation can never be the final thing.
[53]  As the church, after one or two months, we should write a letter to the church where the brother is.
[54]  If they have never helped him, you can write letters exhorting them that in the future they need to help the brothers who move from other places and that they should pay attention to this matter.
[55]  We need to preach the gospel, we need to care for the gospel, we need to care for the new believers, we need to care for problems, we need to care for those who are absent from the meetings, and we need to care for those who come from other places.
[56]  THE WAY OF SERVICE Not Preferring a Message on the Lord's Day
[57]  Brothers, I do not know if you have ever thought about this.
[58]  I desire very much to have a heart-to-heart talk with you.
[59]  During the preaching of the gospel, everyone would be there preaching; during the time for taking care of people, everyone would be there taking care of people; during the time of harvest, everyone would be there harvesting; after the harvest, everyone would be there caring for others; when there are matters needing responsibility, there would be brothers there bearing the responsibility.
[60]  If one day there could be a group of brothers or even a whole church in which everyone serves, everyone carries out spiritual matters properly, everyone bears responsibility, and everyone is busy, then that would be the true Body of Christ.
[61]  We do not need to say much concerning the service of the Levites, because it is a very simple matter.
[62]  There are many things that we can consider before the Lord: 1 the cleaning work; 2 the arranging of the hall and the work of ushering; 3 the need for a group of brothers and sisters to take care of the breaking of bread and the baptisms.
[63]  We also need some who are trained to take care of the matters related to baptisms, such as helping those who are being baptized go down and come up out of the water, change their clothes, etc. 4 Giving to the poor among the unbelievers.
[64]  You have to work to such an extent that you bring all the brothers to the same condition that you are in. When all the brothers come and serve together, the church in that locality will have a foundation.
[65]  The Body of Christ is not a doctrine; it is something living.
[66]  We all must learn this one thing: Only when every member functions is there the Body of Christ.
[67]  Today I think that two ways are clearly set before us.
[68]  If the Lord can really break through in our midst, the way we have taken for the past ten, twenty, or thirty years will be completely reversed.
[69]  Today we want to spend some time to see the situation concerning the ministers of the word in the local churches.
[70]  In the co-workers' meeting in Hankow, we saw quite clearly that there was no need for a local church to maintain the Lord's Day message meeting, because this kind of meeting is not a church meeting.
[71]  The Problem with Not Abolishing It The Outward Problem
[72]  The outward reason is that all the nations have a Lord's Day message meeting, and if we do not have one among us, we fear that without a message to listen to many brothers and sisters will go to other places to listen to messages.
[73]  The Way of the Church Working Replacing Listening to Messages
[74]  I believe that the way of the church is as follows: Save and gain a person from outside, and after he is saved, immediately put him into the work so as not to produce the habit of listening to messages on the Lord's Day.
[75]  After you go out, you should completely change the brothers' and sisters' way of thinking.
[76]  Formerly, they thought that there were many workers in the church.
[77]  Today we need to turn this around and say that everyone in the church is a worker.
[78]  If the church does not endeavor until everyone in the church is working and everyone in the church is serving, then there is no church.
[79]  Let us first speak concerning the supply of the word.
[80]  Then we will come back and talk about the way of the church.
[81]  Once many have been saved, there will be more trouble for the church because all kinds of people will come in. All kinds of fish will be pulled into the boat; therefore, we will need to take good care of them, providing the new believers with edification once a week.
[82]  The Supply of the Word in 1 Corinthians 14
[83]  Some may ask how we should supply the older brothers, and many other brothers and sisters among us, with the word.
[84]  If today some feel that the meeting for edifying new believers is not sufficient, please remember that every Saturday night you can let several able ministering brothers take care of a stronger and fresher meeting.
[85]  Therefore, when all those who are apt to teach are gathered together, they should ask whether anyone has a special burden before God that night, whether there is a particular burden even though everyone should be burdened , and whether there is anyone with a special word to say.
[86]  I am amazed that often three to five brothers are ministers of the word before God, but they think that they can open up the Saturday night meetings for other brothers to speak.
[87]  The situation of the church today is altogether not according to the New Testament!
[88]  You will probably ask what the new believers should do in the second year after listening for a year to the fifty-two topics, which neither advance nor change.
[89]  The answer is that you need to send them out in migrations.
[90]  If not, we will definitely have to build a "Solomon's Temple," because there will not be a place that is large enough to meet in.
[91]  I believe that the local church at the center of the work also needs to have these several kinds of meetings.
[92]  Formerly, we preached the gospel once a month; now once a month we preach a message to the brothers, or if there is a strong ministry of the word, perhaps we will select one day out of the week and use it specifically for preaching a message.
[93]  The Need to Rise Up to Build the Temple
[94]  Please remember that Catholicism is the church in captivity in Babylon.
[95]  In the church there are different kinds of meetings.
[96]  The local brothers should find a special time for the gospel preaching meeting, perhaps the Lord's Day morning, to gather together to preach the gospel or to go to various districts to preach the gospel.
[97]  When you have a gospel preaching meeting, as we have already mentioned, you need to bring people with you.
[98]  In the meeting for the edification of the new believers, there is one point that we need to pay attention to.
[99]  I remember that some brothers, when they made up lessons for others, spoke just one sentence: "The message for the new believers today says that we need to read the Bible every day.''
[100]  But when you go to a person's home to make up lessons, if you only speak a sentence such as, "You need to read the Bible every day,'' I think this word is equivalent to not speaking anything, unless the Holy Spirit works in a special way.
[101]  We have to seek out saints who are especially helpful to the brothers and sisters.
[102]  The responsible brothers need to tell them, "We hope that you can speak more.''
[103]  There are many brothers and sisters who possess no judgment of propriety in their speaking; it is rather clear that they have little gift and little grace.
[104]  You need to tell such brothers that if they speak for two minutes, the brothers and sisters will receive help, but that the help is reduced by the third minute and exhausted by the fourth minute.
[105]  Second, we must warn the brothers and sisters that the words of their prayer in the prayer meeting must be honest.
[106]  When you are having your personal time before God, you may stop before a sentence is fully uttered; of course, you would have to continue this sentence in the prayer meeting.
[107]  Sometimes when you are in a prayer meeting, you do not know whether a certain brother is praying for you or for God to hear.
[108]  The bread-breaking meeting is already quite clear among us, but we must always tell the brothers in various localities to take note that the bread-breaking meeting is the real worship service, the real worship.
[109]  In this meeting we need to see that the first section is always toward the Lord and the second section toward God.
[110]  The sisters' meeting is also a meeting to help the church.
[111]  There is the need for this meeting in some places, but perhaps there is not the need in other places.
[112]  If one or two sisters who have received burdens from the Lord come to a certain place, we should arrange a sisters' meeting for them so that they may have the opportunity to exercise their gifts among the sisters.
[113]  CHAPTER SIX THE AFFAIRS OF THE SERVICE OFFICE Scripture Reading:
[114]  "And they sold their properties and possessions and divided them to all, as anyone had need'' Acts 2:45 .
[115]  "For neither was anyone among them in need; for as many as were owners of lands or of houses sold them and brought the proceeds of the things which were sold and placed them at the feet of the apostles; and it was distributed to each, as anyone had need'' Acts 4:34-35 .
[116]  LEARNING IN TWO ASPECTS The Need to Arrange Practical Affairs
[117]  Therefore, today I want the brothers to learn something here, because there is a basic principle.
[118]  There may be brothers among us who misunderstand to the point that they think that practical affairs need no arrangements.
[119]  However, today we cannot go to the other extreme.
[120]  Many people do so, thinking that there is absolutely no method in the church.
[121]  The principle of a record book is here, but as to the way of setting up this record book, you and I need to pray: "Lord, we know that in the early church there was a record book, but we do not know how to set it up.
[122]  THE METHODS THAT WE SEE TODAY The Need for a Service Office
[123]  If there were only seven or eight believers in a local church or if there were only two or three gathered into the name of the Lord, we would not need a business office.
[124]  If there are a good number of saints in a locality, one hundred, several hundred, or more than a thousand, it would be difficult and confusing without a business office.
[125]  THINGS HANDLED IN THE SERVICE OFFICE For Contacting One Another
[126]  In this office the main work is to do two things.
[127]  If a church is in a large city or the number of brothers and sisters is more than several hundred, it is not easy to find someone.
[128]  Otherwise, if some brother or sister comes to that church to look for other brothers and sisters, he would not know where to go to look for them.
[129]  Since there is such a need, there is a place, which we temporarily call the service office.
[130]  Therefore, the service office is the instrument with which the brothers take care of affairs.
[131]  If you invest an extra hour, pay attention to one more person, ask one more person today you ask five brothers, and tomorrow you ask ten brothers, "Have you done your job?", then, I tell you, the service of the church will be raised up one day earlier.
[132]  Question: In a certain locality, not everyone has given up all.
[133]  If I hear a brother in a certain place say, "Today God loves you and you need to come and serve Him,'' as if God will be very happy if this one will just come and serve Him, I have no patience for this at all.
[134]  It is not that you are doing God a favor, that you are doing God an honor, and that even intelligent people like you should also come to serve God!
[135]  If the locality of a church is large and also has many saints, district meetings become a necessary arrangement.
[136]  We do not believe as the Congregationalists do that each congregation is a unit, for that is not the teaching of the Bible.
[137]  Therefore, if the number of brothers and sisters in a locality is quite large, as in the case of Jerusalem, which had tens of thousands of believers, you will realize that it is impossible to meet in one place.
[138]  The Bible does not show us how Jerusalem was divided into districts.
[139]  When we read the book of Acts, we know that there were districts, although they did not use our terminology.
[140]  Let me repeat that the Bible does not give us all the particular detailed items of the affairs of the church, because God is not pleased when everything is structured.
[141]  This causes the church in every generation to learn to seek God and to make arrangements according to the Lord even though the church encounters the same situations again and again.
[142]  Today when you are going to carry them out, you will find that the Holy Spirit has not left you, that the Holy Spirit is still in the church, and that Christ is still the Head of the church through the Holy Spirit.
[143]  In a place like Philippi, for example, you can see that there were elders, deacons, and brothers and sisters in the church.
[144]  The Bible shows us that when the church held a conference to discuss how to handle matters in the church which only happened once in the Bible , they sent out letters saying, "The apostles and the elder brothers...'' in Jerusalem Acts 15:23 .
[145]  If you are elders, you cannot administrate affairs of other local churches.
[146]  You cannot go beyond the sphere of your local church to go to another local church to administrate their affairs.
[147]  If you are an apostle, you should not directly administrate the affairs of a local church.
[148]  If you know God, you must bow your head and worship Him every time you read Acts 13 and 14 because here is a very important matter.
[149]  The Possibility of a Third Region Being Set Up
[150]  But now we know that before God there was not only one center but two centers, not only one region but two regions.
[151]  It is all right for the church not to receive the commands of the apostles directly, but it is not all right for the church not to receive the commands of the elders directly.
[152]  Today I want to show you, as I have spoken in these past few months, that Acts 15 is the only place in the entire Bible which records a meeting in which the church discussed business affairs.
[153]  While there have been many councils in the Catholic Church, there was only one such conference in Jerusalem.
[154]  The Decision Made by the Apostles and the Elders
[155]  Peter stood up to state his personal opinion, relating to them what he had personally experienced, saying, "Men, brothers, you know that from the early days God chose from among you that through my mouth the Gentiles should hear the word of the gospel and believe.
[156]  Simeon has related how God first visited the Gentiles....Therefore I judge these were words of authority that we do not harass those from the Gentiles who are turning to God, but that we write to them to abstain from the contaminations of idols and fornication and what is strangled and blood.
[157]  The most crucial thing in studying the Bible is to touch the spirit of the Bible.
[158]  It is not that when you go out you know how to deal with the situations you encounter; rather, it is that you live before God and thus are able to bring the entire meeting before God.
[159]  CHAPTER TEN THE COORDINATION AMONG THE WORKERS RECOGNIZING AUTHORITY Master Builders in God's Work
[160]  One thing we need to know is that even though there are many persons who are workers in God's work, some are manifested as master builders established by God.
[161]  In 1 Corinthians 3:10 Paul said, "According to the grace of God given to me, as a wise master builder.''
[162]  You need to keep in mind that Paul was an apostle and that Barnabas was also an apostle when he went out with Paul.
[163]  Following this, the gospel was spreading in Jerusalem, Judea, and Samaria, and we see the conversion of Saul.
[164]  Because the brothers in Jerusalem suffered persecution, some went to different places.
[165]  It is not God's intention that we listen to the authority that He has established because this person is perfect.
[166]  Rather, God says that this person's authority is higher than ours; therefore, we need to listen to him.
[167]  We have spent only a little time to see that the matter of who should be the leader and who should obey in the work is spontaneously arranged before God.
[168]  We hope that brothers and sisters can eventually learn that when two are together there will always be one who obeys.
[169]  When two or three brothers or eight or ten brothers live together, we should never allow a confused situation to exist in which they do not know whom they should listen to.
[170]  Many brothers cannot pray with other brothers at all.
[171]  Brothers and sisters, I can tell you this, that one day when you are really clear about the principle of fellowship, you will be amazed at how some Christians whom you consider not so capable can render you such great help.
[172]  For instance, if three, five, or eight brothers in the work are going to Tsingtao and all of them are still individuals, there is no co-working and there is no coordination.
[173]  In the case of the brothers who are going to Wenchow, if each one is still individualistic and his spirit is not open to the others, it will be useless even though they may live together.
[174]  Let us continue with Philippians 2:19: "But I hope in the Lord Jesus to send Timothy to you shortly, that I also may be encouraged by knowing the things concerning you.''
[175]  Verse 25 says, "But I considered it necessary to send to you Epaphroditus.''
[176]  In other words, give Timothy a message that when he comes to you, you need to send him forward, and that he needs to come to me.
[177]  But if I delay, I write that you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.''
[178]  Verse 11 continues, "Take Mark and bring him with you.''
[179]  Finally, we should say more concerning what Paul said to Timothy.
[180]  First Timothy 6:13-14 says, "I charge you before God, who preserves all things in life, and Christ Jesus, who testified the good confession before Pontius Pilate, to keep the commandment spotless.''
[181]  Please remember that the young brothers need to learn what has been entrusted to the older brothers and learn to obey them.
[182]  Today we have two questions which we want to resolve: Who are our co-workers, and who are the apostles?
[183]  However, I want to particularly point out that not only was Paul a tentmaker but Aquila and Priscilla were also tentmakers.
[184]  We see that Paul was sent by the Holy Spirit to go out from Antioch and travel to various places to work.
[185]  In those days, if the brothers in Antioch had some money and material things to give to Paul, they could not go to the post office to remit the money.
[186]  Making Tents so that He Could Be an Apostle
[187]  Therefore, we see here that apostles truly need to leave their own occupations.
[188]  If a brother thinks that he cannot do the work well or that he has financial difficulties, he may go to teach or to fish.
[189]  Today, brothers and sisters, we need to see this basic principle: All who go out to preach the gospel, who have been called by the Lord to serve Him fully in the gospel, who are apostles, whether brothers or sisters, need to throw away their occupation entirely.
[190]  A certain brother asked me if it is good to have a second job.
[191]  At that time I answered that it is good and that it is all right to take up a second job.
[192]  If our purpose of serving God so that He may have a way in China is the same, if you give your all and I also give my all, if you give all your time and I also give my time, if you give all your money and I give all my money, I tell you, we are co-workers.
[193]  Therefore, brothers and sisters, I often feel that if someone is absolutely for the Lord, gives everything he has, does not care for the world, lives on the earth wholly for the Lord, and uses all his means whatever they may be to serve God, regardless of what job he has and regardless of his position, you will feel that he is a person full of light.
[194]  Now we want to talk about what kind of arrangements we should have in our midst in the matter of finances.
[195]  On the one hand, how should we distribute the income of the church?
[196]  More than a month ago, when I was going down the mountain, a few of the sedan-chair bearers told me, "Mr. Nee, I really favor you; I really favor you.'' I said, "What do you mean?'' They said, "Every time that you call us to bear the sedan-chair, we always respond very quickly because we really favor you.'' I hope that in helping the needy ones, we do not do it in the way of favoring them.
[197]  Third, there is another thing that the local church can do.
[198]  If a local responsible brother spends all of his time in the affairs of the church and it causes his own job or business to suffer, the church should give him financial help in a very careful way.
[199]  You are aware that there are many brothers in the local church, especially responsible brothers, who, because of being busy with many church affairs, were unable to continue on with their business and lost their source of income.
[200]  You should not just send money to the brothers who are workers and neglect the responsible brothers.
[201]  THE RELATIONSHIP AMONG CO-WORKERS The Need for Those Taking the Lead
[202]  In China I know two or three brothers who were quite useful in God's hands in the beginning, and yet they cannot be conceived of as leaders among the brothers in the matter of money.
[203]  If you are foolish, you will think that since God gave to you, you are able to serve the church.
[204]  However, if the Lord does not send money, we still have to look to God.
[205]  The Need to Have Two to Handle the Money
[206]  I personally believe that in every region there should be at least two persons to handle the money.
[207]  Question: In the past there were a few localities which wrote to all the other localities when they needed to build meeting halls.
[208]  When you visit churches in different places, if you see elders who labor in a church and are therefore encountering financial need, those who are Timothys need to cause the local brothers to see that such ones should be given double honor.
[209]  CHAPTER THIRTEEN ANSWERS TO QUESTIONS THE MATTER OF THE ELDERS' CHILDREN
[210]  Question: The Bible indicates that the children of the elders should believe in the Lord.
[211]  Among us there are a few elders in the church whose children have not yet believed in the Lord.
[212]  It is not a matter of receiving one authority, nor a matter of receiving ten authorities; it is a matter of receiving authority.
[213]  When the first one came to my house, I charged him saying, "There is a basic requirement for you to be a servant you need to obey.
[214]  When Peter went to Caesarea by himself, he did not go individualistically.
[215]  When you go down from the mountain to work, you may say that you are standing in the position of the Body to learn to serve, yet if five of you are still five persons, and ten of you are still ten persons, you have failed completely before God.
[216]  It is not that I use authority to tell you to go; rather, it is that I fellowship the Lord's desire with you so that you can walk more properly.
