We need to see the vision of the Lord's present recovery and put this vision into our practice.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>THE GIFTS IN THE BODY<br>FOR THE PERFECTING OF THE SAINTS</H2><P>The Bible presents us with a clear picture of God's desire for the church as the Body of Christ (Eph. 1:22-23a), the expression of Christ, who is the embodiment of the Triune God (Col. 2:9). The Lord Jesus told us that He would build His church upon the divine revelation of Himself as the Christ (Matt. 16:18). He does not, however, build up His church directly. In order to build His church, He first accomplished His full redemption from His incarnation through His ascension. In His ascension He poured Himself out upon God's chosen ones to make them His Body (Acts 2:2-4, 16-17a; 10:45; 1 Cor. 12:13), and He constituted some of His members as particular gifts for the building up of this Body (Eph. 4:8). In His ascension He gave some apostles, some prophets, some evangelists, and some shepherds and teachers (4:11). These are the particular gifts which are considered as the joints of the supply in Ephesians 4:16. The article "the" in this verse is emphatic and indicates a particular and rich supply. According to the New Testament revelation, this particular, rich supply is the riches of Christ. The riches of Christ are the rich supply for His Body. These particular riches of the rich Christ are being distributed to His entire Body by the joints.</P><P>We must be clear about these four categories of particular members who are the joints of the Body of Christ: the apostles, prophets, evangelists, and shepherds and teachers. The written record of the New Testament was completed by the end of the first century. In the first century the church did have these four categories of joints. Some have even called the first century the age of the apostles. Those who think this way have a mistaken concept. If we say that the first century was the age of the apostles, this implies strongly that after the first century, there are no more apostles. John Nelson Darby was one who taught that there were no more apostles after the first century. Actually, however, we have to see and admit that there have been these four categories of gifted persons throughout the history of the church.</P><P>There have been evangelists such as C. H. Spurgeon in England and D. L. Moody and Charles Finney in the United States. There have also been many shepherds. A pastor is another term for a shepherd. When the Brethren were raised up by the Lord in the early part of the nineteenth century, many great teachers were produced. They opened up the Bible to a greater extent than it had ever been opened before since the first century. According to church history, there have also been a number of apostles. William Carey went to India and brought the Lord's name, the gospel, and the Bible there. Surely he was an apostle. Hudson Taylor was sent by the Lord to China, and David Livingstone went to Africa. These brothers were also apostles.</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_065.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_067.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Elders' Training, Book 09: The Eldership and the God-Ordained Way (1) &nbsp; pg 66</div><br></body></html>
