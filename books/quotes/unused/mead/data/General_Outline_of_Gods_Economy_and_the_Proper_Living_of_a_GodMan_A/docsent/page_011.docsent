   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST THE GOD-MAN LIVING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>God's salvation is altogether not a matter of religious improvement or a matter of moral and ethical improvement.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>God's salvation is to put us into the death of Christ and then to bring us out of that death.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Christ's being put into death was something done by the Jews together with the Roman soldiers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>However, Christ's resurrection from death was something carried out not by man but by the Spirit of holiness in Him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Today it is the same with us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>When we were baptized, we were immersed into the water by men.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If we did not have the Spirit of God within us, our rising out of the water would be in vain, having no reality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But we have the Spirit in us, so we have the reality of resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is true with all believers.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>When they live in a corporate way, what they live out is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This is absolutely different from the teachings of Confucius and the teachings of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>All the ethical teachings of Confucius and all the doctrines of religion come out of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>God's salvation brings us into death and then brings us out of death.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It not only redeems us but also uplifts us that we may enter into divinity and live in God, that is, in life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We live by and according to this life; we do not walk according to good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is in this way that we have the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Is the Lord's recovery the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It depends on whether or not the believers are living the God-man life.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Therefore, we must see that teaching people merely according to the letter of Scriptures is not the Body of Christ; that is a religious work.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Merely using the words in the Bible to teach people to flee evil and do good is equivalent to the teachings of Confucius; this does not result in the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even we may preach the gospel zealously, but unless our gospel preaching is the issue of a God-man living, it is not the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>What is the Body of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The Body of Christ is a group of God-chosen people who have been redeemed and regenerated through death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They have been united and mingled with God and have been living in this union all the time since their regeneration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>In such a union they are sanctified, renewed, transformed, conformed, and, eventually, glorified.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>If we live such a life, we are the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we do not live such a life, what we have is just something similar to the ethical teachings of Confucius and the superficial activities of religion.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Hence, in our preaching the gospel, expounding the Bible, or visiting the brothers and sisters, we should check whether it is something lived out of a God-man living.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Only that which is lived out of a God-man living is the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Otherwise, it is just a religious activity in society, which is no different from the moral teachings of Confucius; it belongs to the tree of the knowledge of good and evil instead of the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE REALITY OF THE BODY OF CHRIST A LIVING OF BEING CONFORMED TO THE DEATH OF CHRIST THROUGH THE CROSS</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This God-man living is also a living of being conformed to the death of Christ through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This conformation to the death of Christ is through the power of Christ's resurrection Phil 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We must be those who live a crucified life continually by taking Christ's death as the mold of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>It is only by living this kind of life that we can have the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>May the Lord have mercy on us so that we can live a life of being conformed to the death of Christ through the cross.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>May the Lord open our eyes to see this vision.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Only those who have passed through death and resurrection can have their eyes opened; they live and walk by the revelation which they have seen.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Only such a living is the God-man living, and only such a living can live out the reality of the Body of Christ.</S>
