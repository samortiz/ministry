   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. Improper Objects Needing to Be Terminated</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"And a considerable number of those who practiced magic brought their books together and burned them before all; and they counted up the price of them and found it to be fifty thousand pieces of silver" Acts 19:19 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>This is another matter which new believers should deal with and terminate.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is not a command or a teaching; it is the result of the work of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The Holy Spirit moved in such a strong way that the Ephesians brought out all the improper books in their possession.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Here it says the price was "fifty thousand pieces of silver," which is a considerable sum.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>They did not sell their books and give the money to the church.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Instead, the books were burned.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>If Judas had been present, he certainly would not have allowed this.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This was much more than thirty pieces of silver which could have been given to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>But the Lord was pleased to have them burned.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Apart from the kind of objects mentioned above, there are many other questionable objects that need to be dealt with.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Some of them are clearly related to sins.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Gambling instruments and improper books and pictures are some examples.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>These must be burned or destroyed.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>There may be many luxury items and objects of indulgence which cannot be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, they still need to be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Burning, however, is the general principle in dealing with these things.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>After a person believes in the Lord, he should go home and check through his personal belongings.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In an unbeliever's home, there is always something related to sin.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>He may have things which do not befit the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Things related to sin must be burned or destroyed; they cannot be sold.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Luxury items should be converted and altered if possible.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If they cannot be altered, we must sell them.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The garments of the lepers in Leviticus 13 and 14 are a good illustration.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Garments which have become leprous and cannot be washed must be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>However, those which can be washed should be washed for reuse.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If the style of our clothes is unbecoming, we can alter them.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Some garments may be too short, and we can lengthen them; others are odd-looking, and we can make them look more inconspicuous.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Some objects cannot be salvaged; they have the element of sin in them, in which case we have to burn them.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Those that can be sold should be sold, and the money should be given to the poor.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>There should be a termination of improper things.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>If every new believer will go through all his belongings thoroughly, he will have a very good start.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Superstitious objects have to be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Others can be altered or sold after being altered.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once we learn this lesson, we will not forget it for the rest of our lives.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We must realize that being a Christian is a very practical matter; it is not just a matter of going to "church" and listening to some sermons.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>C. Repaying Debts</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"And Zaccheus stood and said to the Lord, Behold, the half of my possessions, Lord, I give to the poor, and if I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much" Luke 19:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Zaccheus did not do this as a result of doctrinal teaching; he did this as a result of the working of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If it had been the result of doctrinal teaching, only the exact amount would have been repaid, no more and no less.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>But since it was the working of the Holy Spirit, the amount could vary; it could be a little more or a little less.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Zaccheus said, "If I have taken anything from anyone by false accusation, I restore four times as much."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Actually, a double compensation would have been more than adequate.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The principle in the book of Leviticus is to add one-fifth to the original amount.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>For one thousand dollars, you would have to repay one thousand two hundred dollars.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>But if one is touched, he can pay as much as the Lord's Spirit directs him to pay.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>He can be moved to repay four times or ten times as much.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>What is spoken of here is only a principle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>In reading the Bible, we must be clear that what is covered is not a mere teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>It is the result of the leading of the Holy Spirit when He operates in man.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Suppose that before you became a believer, you had extorted or defrauded others, stolen from them, or obtained things by improper means.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Now that the Lord is working within, you have to deal with these things in a proper manner.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This has nothing to do with the forgiveness you received from the Lord, but it is very much related to your testimony.</S>
