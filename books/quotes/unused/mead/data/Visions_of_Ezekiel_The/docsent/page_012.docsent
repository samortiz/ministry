   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FACE OF AN OX</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We need not only the face of a man and the face of a lion but also a third face, the face of an ox.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Though you may be always as bold as a lion in your office, that alone will never convince people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>You need to be balanced by having the face of an ox.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>What is an ox?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>An ox is one who is willing to bear the burden, to do the work, and even to sacrifice himself.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We all must have such an appearance, such a reality of serving others, bearing the burden, caring for the responsibility, even sacrificing our life.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If you are working in an office, and are on the one hand a proper man, on the other hand as bold as a lion, and you are also faithful in bearing responsibility, you will leave a good impression upon others.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You must learn to behave yourself not only like a proper man or like a bold lion, but also like a serving, suffering ox.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>When the office is dirty and your colleagues start to clean, you must take the lead to clean.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>You should even clean more than others.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>You must show that you are willing to sacrifice, to help others, and to serve others.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then you will have the reality of the face of an ox.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>You will not only have the appearance of a man or a lion, but also of an ox.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>THE FACE OF AN EAGLE</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Finally, we also need a hidden face.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the back, not easily seen by people, we need the face of an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In the Bible, an eagle always signifies a powerful, transcendent God.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God is transcendent, buoyant, and powerful.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Nothing can suppress Him.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Nothing can oppress or depress Him.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The more you try to suppress Him, the more He flies to the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This is the meaning of the eagle and the eagle's wings.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In Exodus 19, God told His people, "...I bare you on eagles' wings, and brought you unto myself."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>We must be like an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We must not allow anything to suppress us, to hold us, or to depress us.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Whether it be persecution or praise, we would never be overcome.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is more difficult to overcome praise than persecution.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Many of us can overcome persecution, but not peoples' praises.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Nevertheless, whether people persecute us or praise us, we must fly away on the eagle's wings.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When the Lord Jesus fed 5,000 people with five loaves and two fishes, they came and tried to make Him king.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But the Lord Jesus could not be held because He had the power of an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You can never hold Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Neither should a Christian be held by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>One believer may be held by poverty while another is held by riches.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>As a proper Christian, we should not be held by anything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Neither riches nor poverty mean anything.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We should be like Paul, who knew how to be abased and how to abound.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Whether he was rich or he was in want, he did not care.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Everywhere, in everything, he could do all things in Him who empowered him Phil 4:11-13 .</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Paul had the wings of an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He bore the appearance of a man, a lion, an ox, and also an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>EXPRESSING CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>These four faces the face of a man, the face of a lion, the face of an ox, and the face of an eagle simply portray the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The four Gospels are a biography of Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Why are there four Gospels?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It is because one, Luke, shows Him as a man.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Another, Matthew, shows Him as a lion.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Mark shows Him as an ox, and John shows Him as an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This four-fold life is the life of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>All the living creatures are the corporate expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>As Christians, we must be the living creatures who are a corporate entity, expressing Christ exactly as He was on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>While He was on earth, He was living in these four aspects: as a man, a lion, an ox, and an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Today we must be such an expression of Christ.</S>
