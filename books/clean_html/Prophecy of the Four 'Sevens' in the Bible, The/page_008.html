<H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. The Seven Years of the Last Week<br>Being the Last Seven Years of the Present Age</H2><P>The seven years of the last week will be the last seven years of the present age of the mysteries of God, concerning Messiah (Christ), the children of Israel, the believers, and the church.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. The Two Halves of the Last Week</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. The Last Week Being Cut into Two Halves<br>by Antichrist's Breaking of the Seven-year Covenant He Will Make with Israel</H2><P>Now we need to see something concerning the two halves of the last week. The last week of the seventy weeks will be cut into two halves by Antichrist's breaking of the seven-year covenant he will make with Israel (Dan. 9:27).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2. The First Half Being before the Sixth Seal,<br>Which Comprises the Supernatural Calamities<br>on the Earth and Heaven and Which Will Be<br>the Initiation of the Great Tribulation<br>of Three and a Half Years,<br>the Last Half of the Last Week</H2><P>The first half will be before the sixth seal of the supernatural calamities on the earth and heaven (Rev. 6:12-17). During the sixth seal, the earth will become a place that is not suitable for man to live on. The sixth seal will be the initiation of the great tribulation of three and a half years, the last half of the last week.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>3. The Second Half of Three and a Half Years</H2><P>The second half of three and a half years is referred to in Daniel 7:25 and 12:7.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>a. Counted from the Ceasing of the Sacrifice<br>and the Oblation, and the Replacing of These<br>with Abominations, Idols, by Antichrist,<br>at the Time of the Sixth Seal</H2><P>This second half will be counted from the ceasing of the sacrifice and the oblation and the replacing of these with abominations, idols, by Antichrist probably at the time of the sixth seal (Rev. 6:12-17). On the one hand, God will shake the earth and the heaven, making the earth an unsuitable place in which to live. On the other hand, Antichrist will break his covenant with Israel, and he will persecute the Jews and devastate the temple.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD4>b. The Time of the Great Tribulation, Beginning<br>from the Sixth Seal of the Seven Seals and Ending<br>at the Seventh Bowl of the Seven Bowls,<br>Being "the Hour of Trial Which is About to Come<br>on the Whole Inhabited Earth, to Try Them Who<br>Dwell on the Earth" (Revelation 3:10)</H2><P>The second half of the last week, the last three and a half years of this age, will be the time of the great tribulation (Matt. 24:21, 15), beginning from the sixth seal of the seven seals (Rev. 6:12-17) and ending at the seventh bowl of the seven bowls (Rev. 16:17-21), which will be "the hour of trial which is about to come on the whole inhabited earth, to try them who dwell on the earth" (Rev. 3:10). The first five seals have nothing to do with the great tribulation. The great tribulation will be initiated by the sixth seal. The seven bowls will be the last woe of the great tribulation, and this tribulation is referred to as "the hour of trial."</P>
