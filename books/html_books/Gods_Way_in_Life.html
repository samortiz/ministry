Our hearts rejoice and our spirits leap. We treasure You deep within, and we are willing to follow You. Through Your rich mercy and sovereign grace, You have gathered us here for this New Year&#8217;s conference. We are so happy we can meet each other and gather together in Your name. Lord, we look to You to grace us and guide us again, through Your all-pervading and life-giving Spirit. We want to be fully open to You to receive more of You, to take in Your riches, and to enjoy Your fullness. O Lord Jesus, we need You once again to forgive us, cleanse us, and anoint us in a rich way. Operate within us and nourish us abundantly. May we be cared for, healed, comforted, and uplifted. Lord, we would all enjoy grace from You. May You speak a word or two to every one of us that would meet our present need.<p>Lord, what we can do is limited. But when we offer up ourselves to You, what is offered becomes unlimited. Lord, You can feed five thousand with five loaves and two fishes. We believe whatever little we have and can do comes from You. We want to offer it up to You again. Receive it into Your hands, break it, and give it to us, so that it can become our riches, and so that we can be satisfied with an overabundance. O Lord Jesus, we worship You. We believe that You are here now. We are here, and You are here. Actually, You came here first; we came after You were here. Lord, how glorious it is that we are called into Your precious name. We are not in ourselves, but in Your name. We are not in the worldly enjoyment, but in Yourself. Hallelujah! You are the Triune God. You have been processed and have reached an ultimate attainment. Now You are here available for us to enjoy. Release Your word once more. We are happy to hear Your word. Shine out Your light from the word again and manifest Yourself. Touch the deepest part of our being. May every one of us gain something. May honor, glory, and eternal riches be unto You. Amen.<h2 class=head1>GOD DESIRING TO BE JOINED TO MAN AND TO BE MAN&#8217;S LIFE</h2><p>In this New Year&#8217;s conference, we will have four meetings on God&#8217;s way in life. God&#8217;s life is our way. The Bible shows us clearly that God is life. God is the source of life. When we have God, we have life. This life is our way. On the other hand, without God, there is death. With death, we have no way to go on. Today, we are taking a way of life. This way is simply God Himself. With God there is life, and with life there is the way. Without God, there is no life, and without life, there is no way. Apart from God, everything is death, and death affords no way to go on.<p>The Bible reveals further that this God of life desires to join Himself to man and to be man&#8217;s life. For this reason, the Bible tells us that God loves the world. The love God has for the world is like the love a man has for a woman. It is not a general kind of love. Rather, it is a romantic love. God is in love with man in a romantic way. Perhaps some find it hard to compare God&#8217;s love to the love between a man and a woman. But according to the Bible, the love between a man and a woman is holy; it is ordained by God. The Bible compares God to a man and compares mankind to a woman. God loves us. He is loving us not only in a merciful way, but in a romantic way. God loves us in this way because He desires to join Himself to us. A man and a woman love each other with the purpose of being joined together. When two love each other very much, they are joined as one. Marriage is such a union. This is the way God loves us. He desires to be one with us and to be our life.<p>For this reason, God created man according to His image. It is wonderful that God did not create a pair of human beings; He created only one man, Adam. After Adam was created, though all the living creatures were brought before him, he did not find his match. He was a lonely man. Hence, the Bible says that &#8220;it is not good that the man should be alone&#8217;&#8217; (Gen. 2:18). This signifies that it is not good for God to be alone. He does not want to dwell alone. Instead, He wants to join Himself to the man He created in His image. When God created man, He created only one man, Adam. Before God prepared a counterpart for Adam, He brought all the created beasts of the field and fowls of the air before him, and Adam gave names to each one of them. But he did not find his counterpart. He was still a lonely bachelor. God then caused Adam to go into a deep sleep, and He opened his side and took out a rib. From that rib God built a woman. Hence, man was created by God, whereas woman was built by God.<p>God brought the woman He had built unto Adam. When Adam saw her, he said, &#8220;This is now bone of my bones, and flesh of my flesh.&#8217;&#8217; As a result, the two were joined as one flesh (Gen. 2:23-24). From that day on, Adam became Eve&#8217;s life, and Eve became Adam&#8217;s living. In human society, whether in the East or in the West, the female takes her name from the male; never does the male take his name from the female. This means that once a man and a woman are married, the man becomes the woman&#8217;s life, and the woman has the man as her living. After a girl is married, she can no longer live her maiden life. Instead, she must live her husband&#8217;s living. The wife has to take the husband as her life and her living.<h2 class=head1>GOD AS LIFE TO MAN THAT MAN MAY TAKE GOD AS HIS LIVING</h2><p>First, God created Adam. Then He completed Adam&#8217;s marriage. Eve came out of Adam and had Adam for her life. Eve was also for Adam and had Adam as her living. This is a type. It signifies that God desires to be joined to the created man, to be man&#8217;s life, so that man can be His living. Brothers and sisters, from this we can see what kind of a living we Christians should have. We should have God&#8217;s living. We are human beings; yet we can have God&#8217;s living. For this reason, God came to be our life. This life is our way in everything. Do you want to submit to your husband? The way is to take God as your life. Do you want to love your wife? The way also is to take God as your life. Today, many are not living in a proper way. If we want to live as a proper man, there is no way other than through God&#8217;s life. Only when God is life in us can we be a proper man. God&#8217;s life is the way for us to live a proper human life.<p>Hence, God desires not only that we would have His image, but that we would take Him as life. For this reason, after God created man in His image, He put him before the tree of life, which is a symbol of Himself, and said, &#8220;Of every tree of the garden thou mayest freely eat: but of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, thou shalt not eat of it: for in the day that thou eatest thereof thou shalt surely die&#8217;&#8217; (Gen. 2:16-17). This is the beginning of the Bible. By the end of the New Testament, in Revelation the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the paradise of God&#8217;&#8217; (Rev. 2:7b). Finally, in the holy city, the New Jerusalem, we have the tree of life spreading as a vine along the river of water of life for God&#8217;s people to receive and enjoy. This describes the God who loves us, who is joined to us, who has become our life and is giving us life, becoming our eternal and infinite supply of life. We have to receive Him again and again as our life, so that we can live Him as our living.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S LIFE BECOMING THE WAY IN EVERYTHING</h2><h2 class=head2>God in Christ as Our Life Becoming Our Way</h2><p>Unfortunately, Adam failed and became fallen in this respect. For this reason, God humbled Himself to become a man. He took the form of fallen man, but without the corrupted nature of fallen man. This God who became flesh was called Jesus. First, He was conceived in a virgin&#8217;s womb; then after nine months He was born out of the womb in accordance with the law of the human life. He lived on earth for thirty-three and a half years. He was a proper and perfect man. From man&#8217;s point of view, He was merely the son of a carpenter and a little Nazarene. But those around Him marveled at His works and words. Who was He? He was indeed the most wonderful person in history. According to the revelation of the Bible, this Jesus is the God-man, the One in whom there is both divinity and humanity. He accomplished an all-inclusive death on the cross, and He solved the problem of man&#8217;s sin before God.<p>Then He resurrected from the dead. In resurrection, He uplifted humanity and brought this uplifted humanity into divinity. Through death and resurrection, He brought the man with whom God desires to have a union back to God, that God and man can be joined as one. Furthermore, in resurrection He changed His form. The first time He changed His form was when He became flesh; He changed from that of the infinite God to that of a visible man. After thirty-three and a half years of human living, He entered resurrection through death. In resurrection, He changed again to another form; now He has changed from a human form to the life-giving Spirit. This Spirit comes from the Spirit of God, that is, from the nature and essence of God. This Spirit is Jesus Christ today. In Romans 8:2, He is also called the Spirit of life. He is our God and our Savior, and He also is the Holy Spirit. This is the One we believe in and preach about. This is also the One we look unto and call upon. What a wonderful One is He!<p>Such a wonderful One has now entered into us, not only as our Savior, but as our life. This life within us is the way that we should take. Every day, we have ways that we must take; they are varied and winding. Parents have their ways to take; children have also their ways to take. Unmarried ones have their ways to take, and married ones also have their ways to take. Men have to work, and women have to care for the family. Everyone has his own way that he has to take. Those who are not married have their problems; those who are married also have theirs. Men have their problems, and women also have their problems. It is difficult to be a human being! Everywhere and on all sides, there are problems. Sometimes things are so difficult that there is no longer any way to escape. The only way is Jesus. Jesus is the way to be a husband; Jesus is the way to be a wife. He is the way to be a parent and the way to be a child. Hence, everyone needs Jesus. Without Jesus, there is no way. Without Him, nothing can be done smoothly or satisfactorily. Hence, the Lord Jesus said, &#8220;I am the way&#8217;&#8217; (John 14:6). Do you want to be a proper man? You need Jesus. Only Jesus can be our life within us. Only He is our way in everything.<h2 class=head2>Christ as Our Life Becoming Our Way to Enjoy More of God&#8217;s Salvation</h2><p>How then can we enjoy this Jesus as our life? He is God, and He has been processed to become the life-giving Spirit. When we repent, confess our sins, believe in Him, and call upon His name, this Spirit of life, who is the processed Triune God, comes into us to be our life (John 3:16). This is not a vain doctrine, but a divine reality. Now, this Spirit of life is in our spirit. The two spirits fellowship and mingle with one another, and they have become one spirit. In this way, He has become our life, with the result that we become His living. This is the salvation of God.<p>Romans 5:10 says, &#8220;For if we, being enemies, were reconciled to God through the death of His Son, much more we will be saved in His life, having been reconciled.&#8217;&#8217; We are not only reconciled to God through the Lord&#8217;s death, but we enjoy God&#8217;s salvation through taking Him as our life. In our human life, we often encounter difficulties. Whether in our study or in our work, in the family life or in the church life, the more relationships we build up, the more problems we have. In all these circumstances, it is difficult to be a proper man. For this, we need to be saved every day from worries, temper, disposition, and many other kinds of problems. We need to be saved not only once from God&#8217;s eternal judgment and punishment, but continually through the Lord&#8217;s life.<p>Hence, God&#8217;s salvation causes us to receive Christ as our life, and Christ as our life becomes our way to enjoy more of God&#8217;s salvation. The Lord&#8217;s life is the way for us to live the human life. It is also the way for us to live the church life. How then can we enjoy this salvation? The simplest way is by calling on the Lord. We should touch Him all the time and call on Him all the time. We can never be wrong or suffer loss by calling on His name. Whenever difficulties arise, we should not initiate anything. When our heart feels ill at ease, we should not lose our temper right away; that will only make matters worse. Simply call a few times, &#8220;O Lord Jesus,&#8217;&#8217; and the Lord will operate within us and be our life within. The result will be that temper is gone, and wisdom is here. What could have gone wrong becomes right, and what was improper becomes proper.<p>This wisdom that we receive from the Lord becomes our method, and the method becomes the way. I have often heard people say that there is no way. This means that there is nothing that can be done. To have a way is to be able to do something. This way is the wisdom. First Corinthians 1:30 says, &#8220;But of Him are you in Christ Jesus, who became wisdom to us from God: both righteousness and sanctification and redemption.&#8217;&#8217; The wisdom here is the method, or the way. This way causes us to be justified in the past, to be sanctified in the present, and to be redeemed in the future. This way that meets our past, present, and future needs is Christ. Hence, the Christian living is one that allows Christ to be our life continually, with the result that we enjoy His salvation unceasingly. In this living, Christ becomes our way in everything.<h2 class=head1>THE STREET OF THE HOLY CITY HAVING THE FLOW OF LIFE AS THE WAY</h2><p>At the end of the Bible we see a picture, which is the New Jerusalem. In this holy city, the New Jerusalem, there is one street, in the midst of which flows the river of the water of life from the throne of God and of the Lamb (Rev. 22:1). This means that the street of the holy city has the flow of life as the way. In other words, the flow of life is the street of the holy city. This typifies the flow of the divine life as the unique way for God&#8217;s people to live their daily life. Wherever there is the flow of the divine life, there is the way by which the people of God walk. We know that the church life today is a miniature of the coming New Jerusalem, and the New Jerusalem is the ultimate consummation of the church life. The principles found in the two are the same. The condition of the holy city then should be the condition of the church life today; that is, the flow of life from the throne of God, as God&#8217;s flowing forth, should become our supply. This flow of life becomes the way for us to enjoy God&#8217;s life in eternity.<p>In the church life today, we walk in this way of life. In order to maintain a proper relationship among the saints and to continue in the Lord&#8217;s fellowship, all of us need to be in God&#8217;s way of life. The church is not a human organization, nor is it a social community. The church is the Body of Christ. This Body is organic, and it is not organizational. It is an organic building produced from all of us taking Christ as our life, and living in this life. This is like my body today: all the members are not organized together; rather, they are constituted as one body through the organic union of the inner life within them. Today, through living by Christ and taking His life as the way for our walk, we can have a church life free from problems and filled continually with the enjoyment of God&#8217;s salvation. By this, we can be joined together and built up together. This kind of church life will be the New Jerusalem to be manifested in the future. In it, God&#8217;s life will be our flow, our nourishment, and our supply. This life also will become the way for us to enjoy God in eternity.<p><p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Anaheim, California, on January 26, 1990)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER TWO</h1><h1 class=msg>GOD&#8217;S SPIRIT OF LIFE BECOMING THE WAY FOR US TO LIVE CHRIST IN OUR SPIRITUAL LIVING</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Col. 2:9; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:2, 4; 15:16; 1 Cor. 6:11; 2 Cor. 3:18; Phil. 1:19-21a; 4:8, 12b, 13</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>The embodiment of God as the Spirit of life becoming our life-Col. 2:9; 1 Cor. 15:45b; Rom. 8:2.</li><li>God&#8217;s Spirit of life becoming the way for our spiritual living:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>For us to fulfill God&#8217;s righteous requirement of the law-Rom. 8:2, 4.</li>	<li>For us to be sanctified positionally and dispositionally-Rom. 15:16; 1 Cor. 6:11.</li>	<li>For us to be transformed to Christ-2 Cor. 3:18.</li>	<li>For us to live out Christ as our virtues-Phil. 1:19-21a; 4:8, 12b, 13.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>Prayer: Lord, we are gathered once again into Your name, the loving, rich, and protecting name. Here we would listen quietly to Your speaking. Speak to us the living word, the word of life. Lord, grace us, and speak into every one of our hearts. May You supply us, tend our wounds, heal us, and lead us on richly in the way that You desire today. Lord, operate here. Operate among and in us, that we can be free and that our spirits can be enlightened. For this, grant us the utterance, that we can explain Your need to all the people.

Lord Jesus, may You glorify the Father&#8217;s name. Bless Your children, build Your church, and shame Your enemy. Amen.<h2 class=head1>THE SPIRITUAL LIVING BEING TO LIVE CHRIST</h2><p>We have come to the second chapter, which is God&#8217;s Spirit of life becoming our way to live Christ in the spiritual living. We often talk about the spiritual living. But what actually is the spiritual living? Here we have a clear explanation: the spiritual living is simply a living that lives Christ. A spiritual living is not for us to be spiritual, but for us to live Christ. A spiritual living is not one where we do good, where we are humble, kind, or forbearing. A spiritual living is one where we live Christ. Whether or not our living is spiritual depends on whether or not we live Christ. In other words, true spirituality is Christ.<p>Who is Christ? He is the embodiment of the Triune God. All the fullness of the Godhead dwells in Him bodily (Col. 2:9). Outwardly speaking, Christ was a man and a Jew, one who lived on earth two thousand years ago. He was indeed a man, a noble and perfect man, but within Him He had God as His content. The fullness of God dwells bodily in Him in full measure. We all have to know that the One we follow, worship, love, and exalt is such a One. This is also the One we preach and supply to others. The name of this One is Jesus Christ.<h2 class=head1>THE EMBODIMENT OF GOD AS THE SPIRIT OF LIFE BECOMING OUR LIFE</h2><p>This wonderful One lived on earth for over thirty-three years. One day, He suddenly told His disciples that He would go to Jerusalem to be crucified on the cross. When the disciples heard this word, they were very disappointed. They did not understand what the Lord meant. They thought that the Lord was going to die-the One whom they loved and followed, the One who calmed the waves, healed the sick, and cast out the demons. To them, everything would be over if the Lord were to die. It seemed that they did not hear the next word that the Lord spoke, that in three days He would rise up again. They knew what death was, but they had never heard of resurrection. Hence, they did not at all understand what the Lord meant. Although the Lord revealed the matter to them three times already (Matt. 16:21-27; 17:22-23; 20:17-19), they still did not grasp it.<p>The Lord Jesus is the Passover Lamb ordained by God (John 1:29; 1 Cor. 5:7). He was indeed crucified for us and died on the Jewish Passover day according to God&#8217;s prophecy and the Old Testament type (Matt. 26:2; 27:15). When He died and was buried, the disciples were greatly disappointed; they returned home in disenchantment. But in a little over thirty hours, the news came that He was resurrected. Those who heard it ran to the tomb and discovered that the stone was rolled away and the Lord&#8217;s body was not there; only the linen cloths and the handkerchief that had been on His head still lay there. This proves that the Lord did not escape, nor was He stolen by anyone. While they marveled, a messenger of the Lord came and told them that the Lord had resurrected.<p>In this resurrection, He changed His form. Formerly, He was God; by becoming flesh, He put on the form of man. Then He was crucified and resurrected to become the Spirit. This is what is written in 1 Corinthians 15, that &#8220;the last Adam became a life-giving Spirit&#8217;&#8217; (v. 45). Through becoming the life-giving Spirit, He is able to dispense Himself into us. The Lord Jesus said: &#8220;I am the life.&#8217;&#8217; He also said: &#8220;I have come that they may have life&#8217;&#8217; (John 14:6; 10:10). How can we receive Him as life, and how can He come into us? When He was resurrected, He became the Spirit of life (Rom. 8:2). By this, He is able to come into us as our life.<p>On the evening of the Lord&#8217;s resurrection, the disciples were gathered together in one place. Although they heard that the Lord had resurrected and they had believed, they did not see Him nor know where He was, and they were therefore very uneasy. The door of the room where they were was closed for fear of the Jews. Suddenly, the Lord appeared in their midst and said to them: &#8220;Peace be to you.&#8217;&#8217; After this, He showed them the marks of the nails in His hands and in His side. By that time, when the disciples saw that it was the Lord, they were glad, and their hearts were put at ease. Then Jesus said, &#8220;As the Father has sent Me, I also send you.&#8217;&#8217; After He spoke this word, He breathed into them and said, &#8220;Receive the Holy Spirit&#8217;&#8217; (John 20:19-22). This Holy Spirit is the Holy Breath, who is also the Lord Himself. This time, the Lord did not come in that flesh that He had before; rather, He came with a resurrected body. This body is real and touchable, and yet it can penetrate through closed doors. This is something that our finite mind can never understand.<p>Through death and resurrection, this Jesus Christ who was the embodiment of God became the life-giving Spirit. As breath, He was breathed into the disciples as life. This Holy Breath is the ultimate consummation of the Triune God. The Triune God has been processed to be consummated as the completed Spirit. This Spirit is the Lord Himself. In this Spirit, there are many rich elements, including God, man, human living, the all-inclusive death, the mysterious resurrection, and the transcending ascension (John 20:17). Now, this Spirit has entered Peter, James, John, and all the believers. Hence, wherever the disciples are sent, He is always with them. As the Father sent the Son and came with Him, in the same way the Lord sends the disciples and goes with them.<p>The disciples were overjoyed at the scene before them. To them it was too good to be true. But suddenly the Lord disappeared again. He did not go away; rather, He remained within the disciples, so that they could become accustomed to His invisible presence. The Lord appeared again to them many times. Those, however, were not His comings, but His appearings. He had never left the disciples, but was with them all the time. Because of their weakness, He would sometimes manifest His presence to strengthen their faith. Not long after this, due to his need for his livelihood, Peter brought a few brothers with him to fish by the sea. Some of them were professional fishermen, and the sea was full of fish. Moreover, nighttime is the best time to catch fish. However, they did not catch anything for the whole night. This was truly a miracle! Surely the Lord had commanded all the fish to stay away from the nets. After this, the Lord appeared to them and gave them guidance. Although that was not the good time to fish, they cast their net according to the Lord&#8217;s word and caught many fish. This is, of course, a miracle too! Surely the Lord had ordered the fish to swim into their net. By this, the Lord recovered Peter back to His calling, and through this he experienced the Lord living in him as his life.<h2 class=head1>CALLING ON THE NAME OF THE LORD TO ENJOY GOD&#8217;S SPIRIT OF LIFE</h2><p>This morning, I want to set clearly before you a way to spiritual living. In simple terms, this way is just Jesus. We have seen that this Jesus is the embodiment of God. He passed through thirty-three and a half years of human living. In the end, He entered death, and He came out of death. In resurrection He became the life-giving Spirit. This is the Lord Jesus today. His Spirit is like the air which fills the earth; it is everywhere. As soon as a person repents, confesses his sins, believes, and calls &#8220;O Lord Jesus,&#8217;&#8217; the Spirit of life enters into him, and he is saved and changed. Every one of us who have truly believed in the Lord experienced this story within. As to how we should live the spiritual living after this, we should do the same thing we did in our experience at the time of salvation; that is, we should call on the Lord and pray to Him.<p>Today, we know a little more than before. The Lord is living in us already. More or less, we have some experience. Particularly when we contact Him and call on Him when we wake up in the morning, we become different inside. We feel peaceful and calm. If we breathe a few more breaths, the breath of life will fill us, and anxiety and temper will be gone. Hence, we must not think that as soon as we are saved, everything is finished. If a saved person does not call on the Lord, he will be just like an unbeliever. Only when we call on the Lord will we have life, and only when there is life will there be the way. Without calling, we cannot have life; there will be death, and we will have no way to go on. I believe every saved person here can testify to the same thing. Nevertheless, I hope that you would take up this matter as a principle and would practice it every day and moment by moment. In this way, we will be able to enjoy God&#8217;s Spirit of life as the way for us to have a spiritual living.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S SPIRIT OF LIFE AS THE WAY FOR US TO HAVE A SPIRITUAL LIVING</h2><h2 class=head2>For Us to Fulfill the Righteous Requirement of God&#8217;s Law</h2><p>God&#8217;s law consists mainly of the Ten Commandments. The first commandment says that we should have no God other than Jehovah. Everything that replaces the Lord is another god, and such a replacement is forbidden. The second commandment says that we must not make graven images for ourselves. Everything apart from God can become an image or idol. Examples of these things are money, education, and career. We can make idols out of these, and we can worship them. The third commandment is that we must not take the name of the Lord in vain. The fourth is that we must keep the Sabbath. For us today in the New Testament, we should keep the Lord&#8217;s Day. This day should be sanctified to the Lord. On this day we should come to His habitation, which is the church, to break the bread, to remember Him, to learn to serve Him, and to speak the Lord&#8217;s word. The fifth commandment is that we should honor our parents.<p>The Ten Commandments are divided into two sections. The first five were engraved on one tablet, whereas the last five were engraved on another. The fifth commandment is put together with the first four that have to do with God. This means that we should treat our parents in the same way that we should treat God, because God is the ultimate source of mankind. Furthermore, we have the sixth commandment, which says that we should not kill. This is to honor human life. The seventh commandment says that we should not commit adultery. This is to honor human morality. The eighth commandment says that we should not steal. This is to honor human rights. The ninth commandment says that we should not bear false witness against our neighbor. This sin is worse than the sin of lying. The tenth commandment says that we should not covet our neighbor&#8217;s wife, his house, or anything he has. This is to deal with the covetousness that is in man.<p>Romans 8:4 says, &#8220;That the righteous requirement of the law might by fulfilled in us, who do not walk according to flesh, but according to spirit.&#8217;&#8217; This spirit is the spirit of life, and to walk according to the spirit is to walk according to the Lord&#8217;s life within us. Within us there is surely another life, which is the Lord&#8217;s Spirit of life. He is the way for us to have a spiritual living. When we call on Him all the time and walk by Him, we will fulfill the righteous requirement of the law.<h2 class=head2>For Us to Be Sanctified Positionally and Dispositionally</h2><p>God&#8217;s Spirit of life is also sanctifying us positionally and dispositionally. Romans 15:16 says that the Gentiles are sanctified and made acceptable in the Holy Spirit. First Corinthians 6:11 also says that we are sanctified in the name of the Lord Jesus Christ and in the Spirit of our God. If we call on the name of the Lord all the time and contact Him, God&#8217;s Spirit of life will not only sanctify us positionally, but dispositionally, so that our words and our walk can be separated unto God.<h2 class=head2>For Us to Be Transformed into Christ</h2><p>Second Corinthians 3:18 says, &#8220;But we all with unveiled face, beholding and reflecting like a mirror the glory of the Lord, are being transformed into the same image from glory to glory, even as from the Lord Spirit.&#8217;&#8217; We begin every day with an unveiled face, looking to the Lord and calling on His name. His Spirit will then operate within us and will mingle God&#8217;s life and nature with us, with the result that we will be transformed into His glorious image.<h2 class=head2>For Us to Live Out Christ as Our Virtues</h2><p>Philippians 1:19 tells us that within us we have the bountiful supply of the Spirit of Jesus Christ. This Spirit is simply Christ Himself as the Spirit of life within us. He is all-inclusive. Within Him is the rich element of divinity, the noble element of humanity, the proper, excellent human living, and the elements of death, resurrection, and ascension. Now, this Spirit is within us. He is the bountiful supply that enables us to be saved under all circumstances. This Spirit of life with the bountiful supply is our way unto salvation. In the end, we will be able to live out Christ as our virtues. These virtues are described in Philippians 4:8 as &#8220;what things are true, what things are dignified, what things are righteous, what things are pure, what things are lovely, what things are well spoken of.&#8217;&#8217; This kind of life is full of virtues and is worthy of praise.<p>Paul learned the secret concerning the attainment of all these things. He said that &#8220;in everything and in all things I have learned the secret&#8217;&#8217; (Phil. 4:12). This secret is what he described in the following verse: &#8220;I am able to do all things in Him who empowers me&#8217;&#8217; (v. 13). He continually allowed Christ to be life in him and to live Himself out in his living. The Lord empowered him and enabled him to do all things. This is to live Christ and to magnify Him. &#8220;Even now Christ will be magnified in my body, whether through life or through death. For to me, to live is Christ&#8217;&#8217; (1:20b-21a).<p>Hence, Christ as the Spirit of life is in us as our life to be our way. By this way, we can live a spiritual living and can have the righteous requirement of the law fulfilled in us, so that we can become sanctified positionally and dispositionally, and we will be transformed into the image of Christ to live out His virtues.<p><p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Anaheim, California, on January 27, 1990)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER THREE</h1><h1 class=msg>GOD&#8217;S SPIRIT OF LIFE BECOMING THE WAY FOR US TO SERVE IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: Eph. 4:4a; 1 Cor. 12:1-11, 13; Rom. 14:17; Eph. 3:16-17, 19</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>God&#8217;s Spirit of life being the essence of the church, the Body-Eph. 4:4a:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>We having been baptized into one Body in this Spirit as the essence-1 Cor. 12:13a.</li>	<li>We being made now to drink of this essential Spirit of God-1 Cor. 12:13b.</li>	</ol></li><li>God&#8217;s Spirit of life being the power in the church life-Rom. 14:17:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>For us to live in the reality of the kingdom.</li>	<li>For us to live out righteousness and peace in joy.</li>	</ol></li><li>God&#8217;s Spirit of life filling the believers to become the church with the full-grown stature as the fullness, the expression of God-Eph. 3:16-17, 19:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Strengthening the believers&#8217; inner man.</li>	<li>That Christ may make home in the believers&#8217; heart.</li>	</ol></li><li>God&#8217;s Spirit of life as the source of all gifts and functions in the service of the church, the Body- 1 Cor. 12:1-11:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>As the Dispenser of all gifts.</li>	<li>As the factor in all coordination.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>Prayer: O Lord Jesus, speak to us again tonight. We are all here listening attentively. Speak into every one of our hearts the words in the depths of Your being, the words concerning Your eternal economy. Lord, we worship You. You are the centrality and the universality of God. You are the Head of all things, and You are also our Savior. May You enlighten us, that we would not only know Your church, but would see Yourself, so that You would make home in our hearts. Lord, we give You all the ground. May You make home in us, be the Head in us, and fill us up, so that we would all be built up to be the fullness of God and His expression in this age. Tonight is the time for You to be glorified, for the enemy to be shamed, and for us to be blessed. Amen.<p>In the last chapter, we have seen how God&#8217;s Spirit of life has become the way for our spiritual living. I have been a Christian for over sixty years. Frankly speaking, during the first thirty years, I did not understand what spiritual living is all about. I knew the term, but I did not understand the reality of it, until one day when the Lord opened up a holy word to me from His Scriptures. This is 1 Corinthians 15:45b, which says that the last Adam became the life-giving Spirit.<h2 class=head1>THE LAST ADAM BECOMING THE LIFE-GIVING SPIRIT</h2><p>That day, when I read this sentence, the words seemed to jump off of the page. I marveled that there is such a word in the Bible as the last Adam becoming the life-giving Spirit. This last Adam is the incarnated Christ ultimately becoming the life-giving Spirit. From that point on, I was completely enlightened. The whole heaven seemed to be opened to me. This burden began to come into me and upon me; I have no other message to give but to speak about the Lord as the Spirit of life. This has become not only the message I preach, but the hymns I have written. In 1961, I spent two months to write eighty-five hymns. They are all on Christ or on the church. The subjective ones are about life, and the deeper and still more subjective ones are about the Spirit.<p>Today, Christ is the Spirit. He is not only the Spirit of God, the Holy Spirit, but He is also the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is the ultimate consummation of the processed Triune God. The first step of the process of the Triune God was in becoming flesh. The self-existing and ever-existing Triune God created the world and mankind. Then after four thousand years, He was conceived of the virgin Mary and was born of her after nine months of pregnancy, according to the law of the human life, to become One who is both God and man, a God-man. His name is Jesus, which means Jehovah as our Savior. He is also called Emmanuel, which means God being with us. He passed through thirty-three and a half years of human living. This was a long period of time. During the first thirty years, He lived in Nazareth in a poor carpenter&#8217;s home. During those years, this God-man must have worked as a carpenter.<p>After this, He appeared before men to fulfill His ministry. At the appointed time, He became the Passover Lamb. On the cross, He was willing to lay down His life. He entered death, passed through death, and had a tour of Hades. This also was a process. On the third day, He rose from the dead and entered into resurrection. He was transformed for the second time to become the life-giving Spirit. By this step, He reached His ultimate consummation.<h2 class=head1>TURNING ON THE SWITCH TO TOUCH THE SPIRIT</h2><p>Hence, within this life-giving Spirit, there is God, man, human living, crucifixion, resurrection, and ascension. He is Jesus, Christ, the Triune God, and the Spirit. This is the One all men need. He is also the One we love to preach about. He is life, and He is also the Savior. He is the true I AM. Whatever we need, He is. He is love, patience, power, authority, and everything we need. His name is Jesus Christ. His person is the Spirit. When we call &#8220;O Lord Jesus!&#8217;&#8217; what comes to us is the Spirit. The Spirit is the Triune God, the Jehovah of the Old Testament and Jesus Christ of the New Testament. He is the Lord, the life, and the Redeemer. Through calling on His name, we receive the Spirit who, as the Spirit of life that gives life, becomes everything we need.<p>This is easy to say, but the fact is not that simple. We can illustrate this with electricity. We know that electricity is in the power station, but through the installation of the electric wires, electricity is joined to our house. In the house there are many electrical appliances, such as the electric fan, the air conditioner, the electric lamp, and the sound system. When we need to use these appliances, all we need to do is to turn on the switch, and the electricity will come; the fan will turn, the air conditioner will work, the lamps will light up, and the sound will come. What I am speaking about here is like the all-purpose electricity; there is light, air, and sound. It supplies whatever we need.<p>In the Chinese characters, the words electricity and Spirit are made of the same root character, which means rain. The two are of the same kind; both come from heaven. The Bible says that the Lord is the Spirit (2 Cor. 3:17). It also says that when the Son of Man comes, He will be like the lightning (Matt. 24:27). Today, we all know that in order to have electricity, we need to turn on the switch. In the same way, in order to apply the all-inclusive Spirit of the Lord, we need to learn to turn on the switch. Today, all the millions of truly regenerated Christians have the heavenly electricity installed into them, but they do not all know where the switch is. They do not even know that there is such a switch. This is the reason, when I came to America twenty-seven years ago, I told people right from the start that the Lord Jesus today is the Spirit. Within us is a spirit, and the Lord as the Spirit desires to enter into our spirit. The spirit within man is made to receive God the Spirit. This is like a radio receiver with a receiving device within it made especially to receive the radio waves in the air. In God&#8217;s creation, there is a part in man that is very peculiar, which is his spirit. It is the organ to receive God.<p>When I first came to America, everywhere I went, I spoke to people about this matter. Many had never heard such words before. They knew of only two kinds of spirits, the Holy Spirit of God and the evil spirit of the devil. They did not know that there is a spirit within man. I often quoted three verses from the Scriptures and read to them. Every one of these three portions speaks of two spirits, the Spirit of God and the human spirit. The first portion is John 3:6, &#8220;That which is born of the Spirit is spirit.&#8217;&#8217; The second is John 4:24, &#8220;God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truth.&#8217;&#8217; The third portion is Romans 8:16, &#8220;The Spirit Himself witnesses with our spirit that we are children of God.&#8217;&#8217; When we are saved, our spirit is regenerated, and God&#8217;s Spirit enters into our spirit, strengthening our spirit and bringing God&#8217;s life into our spirit.<p>I have preached the gospel to some Chinese Confucianists before. They always think that Christianity is a foreign religion: that the Bible is merely a book translated in very good contemporary literary style; that what it talks about is nothing but &#8220;Wo-men, Ne-men, Ta-men, and Amen,&#8217;&#8217; that is, &#8220;We, you, they, and Amen,&#8217;&#8217; and that there is nothing deep or profound about it. When I was young, I was taught briefly under the old Chinese school system, and I learned some classical Chinese works. I knew that the highest teaching of the Confucianists tells men that &#8220;the Way of the Great Learning lies in the development of the bright virtue.&#8217;&#8217; The development of the bright virtue is equivalent to the function of the conscience expounded by Wang Yang-ming, a Chinese philosopher. It is also the same as the conscience that we speak of. The Way of the Great Learning in Confucianism is the enlightening and development of this bright virtue. The Bible, however, clearly tells us that man is composed of three parts: the spirit, the soul, and the body (1 Thes. 5:23). Within the body there is the soul, and within the soul there is the spirit. When we believe in the Lord and call on Him, He as the life-giving Spirit enters into our spirit. The two spirits are added together, joined, and mingled as one spirit. Through this, He brings to us God and the life of God as well, and He enlivens our deadened spirit. Now, within the spirit of the saved believers, there is the Spirit. There is also God and the life of God. This is much greater than the bright virtue. The bright virtue, which is the conscience, is only a part of the spirit. In addition to this part, the spirit also has two other parts: fellowship and intuition.<p>For my whole life, I have been reading mainly this one book, the Bible. Do not say that this is a foreign religion. Although it did come from the West, it is not a product of the West. Its origin is heaven. It is God in heaven who prompted over forty writers to complete this book within a period of fifteen hundred years. The revelations contained in it are too deep and profound. This revelation is what I am speaking this time, that is, the Triune God becoming the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit. This Spirit is simply God Himself entering into us to be our life and all our ways. Do you want to live Christ and serve in coordination? All you need to do is to touch this Spirit and to allow this Spirit to operate within you. The way we touch this Spirit is by turning on the switch, which is to call &#8220;O Lord Jesus!&#8217;&#8217;<p>The wonder in the kernel of the Bible is that the Triune God as Jehovah has passed through all the processes including death and resurrection to become the all-inclusive life-giving Spirit of life. This is the One we preach and testify today. This is also the One we believe in, receive, follow, and worship. He is in heaven, and He is also with us and in us. He is our life, to be our way in everything.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S SPIRIT OF LIFE AS THE WAY TO SERVE IN THE CHURCH LIFE</h2><h2 class=head2>Being the Essence of the Church, the Body</h2><p>Now let us come to this message. The first point says that God&#8217;s Spirit of life is the essence of the church, the Body. The essence and element of the church is the Spirit; it is not you or I. This is like saying that the element of the podium is wood. Ephesians 4 tells us that there is &#8220;one Body and one Spirit.&#8217;&#8217; This means that the Spirit is the essence of the Body. Without the Spirit, there is no Body, in the same way that without wood, there is no podium here. The essence of the church is the Spirit. When we come together, regardless of how long we have been saved, if we are not in the Spirit, we are not the church, but are only a human congregation. Among the descendants of Adam, there are the good ones and the bad ones, the right ones and the wrong ones. But whoever they are, they are all human beings. If it is man that is the person and essence, there will be no church. The essence and person of the church is the Spirit. All the problems and storms in the church arise because of failure to remain in the Spirit. If we are in the Spirit, there will not be any of these things. All gossiping, arguments, and rumors come from man&#8217;s flesh, the natural life, and the self. For this reason, we all have to turn to the spirit and walk according to the spirit, because we are not the essence of the church; only the Spirit within us is the essence of the church. This is like saying that the essence of light is electricity, and not the light bulb or the light tube. Those are but the means for the light to go through. Without electricity, there will be no light. We are all like the light bulbs or the light tubes. We are not the essence of the church. The essence is the spiritual electricity, which is the Spirit.<p>Based on 1 Corinthians 12:13, we the believers of all races, nationalities, and social statuses have been baptized in one Spirit into one Body. This is like the electricity in the many electrical appliances. As far as the appliances are concerned, they are separate. But as far as the electricity is concerned, they are one. All of us have been baptized into one Body in this Spirit of God as the essence. This has been done once for all. But today, we are made to drink together of this essential Spirit of God. This is continuous. Just like breathing, we need this everywhere, every day and every hour. This is why the Bible says that we have to pray unceasingly. It means that we have to drink constantly of God&#8217;s Spirit of life. From this we can see that for us, there are two sides to the Spirit. On the one hand, He is the economical Spirit. This is on the side of function; it baptizes us into one Body. On the other hand, He is the essential Spirit. This is on the side of life; it enables us to drink of Him as our life supply.<h2 class=head2>Being the Power in the Church Life</h2><p>Second, God&#8217;s Spirit of life is the power in the church life. Romans 14:17 says, &#8220;For the kingdom of God is...righteousness and peace and joy in the Holy Spirit.&#8217;&#8217; This shows that the practical church life is the kingdom life. The church is not a place without administration; it is the sphere of God&#8217;s rule. This life is one of righteousness, peace, and joy. Righteousness is towards ourselves; it requires that we be just and strict. Peace is towards others; it requires us to be meek. Joy is to God; we need to sing and praise the Lord. This is the genuine church life, and it is the reality of God&#8217;s kingdom. It must be carried out in the Holy Spirit. Only when we are in the Holy Spirit can we be righteous to ourselves, peaceful to others, and joyful to God. For this, we have to exercise our spirit to be filled with God&#8217;s Spirit of life to be the power in our church life.<h2 class=head2>Filling the Believers to Become the Church with the Full-grown Stature as the Fullness, the Expression of God</h2><p>Third, God&#8217;s Spirit of life is filling the believers to become the church with the full-grown stature as the fullness, the expression of God (Eph. 3:16-17, 19). When there is adequate filling of God&#8217;s Spirit of life, the stature will be full-grown, and there will be the fullness of God, which is His expression. For this reason, all of us have to be filled with the Spirit. Philippians 2:13-14 shows us that when God operates within us, we will not murmur or reason. In the church life, in order not to have any murmurings or reasonings, there is the need for the growth of the stature, and the growth of the stature depends on the filling of God&#8217;s Spirit of life. Hence, Ephesians 3:16 tells us that God will strengthen us into the inner man through His Spirit. Our inner man is our spirit. When we call on the name of the Lord, we will be turned from our human mind and emotion back to our spirit. In this way, Christ will make home in our heart. Our heart, including all the ground in our mind, emotion, will, and conscience, will be given to Him. He will take control and will supply and strengthen all our inward parts. All of this process depends on the working of God&#8217;s Spirit of life.<h2 class=head2>Being the Source of All the Gifts and Functions in the Service of the Church, the Body</h2><p>Fourth, God&#8217;s Spirit of life is the source of all the gifts and functions in the service of the church, the Body (1 Cor. 12:1-11). We have covered our living; here it speaks of our service. The more our living is according to the first three points above, the more our gifts will be manifested, and the more function we will have. The reason our gifts are not manifested and our functions not developed is that our stature is not full-grown and that we have not allowed Christ to make home in our hearts enough. In other words, we have not allowed God&#8217;s Spirit of life to fill us up enough. We have to realize that everything related to the living, the service, and the way of the church depends on God&#8217;s Spirit of life. When this Spirit has the ground in us, Christ will be able to expand and make home in our hearts. In this way, we will have a way to practice the church life, a way to practice the church service, and a way for the church itself. Hence, God&#8217;s Spirit of life as life within us is our way in everything.<p><p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Anaheim, California, on January 27, 1990)<h1 class=msg>CHAPTER FOUR</h1><h1 class=msg>GOD&#8217;S SPIRIT OF LIFE BECOMING THE WAY FOR THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL TO BEGET, NOURISH, TEACH, AND BUILD</h1><h1 class=scripture>Scripture Reading: 1 Pet. 1:2b; John 3:5-6; 1 Cor. 10:3-4; Rom. 15:16; Eph. 4:12; 1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 31; 12:8</h1><h2 class=head1>OUTLINE</h2><ol class="upper-roman"><li>We, by God&#8217;s Spirit of life, causing the sinners to be sanctified and regenerated:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God&#8217;s Spirit of life first sanctifying the sinners-1 Pet. 1:2b.</li>	<li>God&#8217;s Spirit of life next regenerating the sanctified sinners-John 3:5-6.</i>	</ol></li><li>We, with God&#8217;s Spirit of life as food and drink, feeding the regenerated believers and giving them to drink-1 Cor. 10:3-4:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>God&#8217;s Spirit of life as food being the pneumatic Christ as our food.</li>	<li>God&#8217;s Spirit of life as drink being also the pneumatic Christ as our drink.</li>	</ol></li><li>We, through God&#8217;s Spirit of life, sanctifying and perfecting the saints, that they may do the work of the building up of the Body of Christ-Rom. 15:16; Eph. 4:12:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>Teaching and sanctifying.</li>	<li>Unto the perfecting.</li>	</ol></li><li>We, by God&#8217;s Spirit of life, helping the saints to prophesy for the Lord, unto the building up of the church as the Body of Christ-1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 31:	<ol class="upper-alpha">	<li>To prophesy for the Lord, there being the need for the spiritual words.</li>	<li>The spiritual words coming from God&#8217;s Spirit of life-1 Cor. 12:8.</li>	</ol></li></ol><p>We need to review as a whole what we have spoken in the previous few messages. The general subject of this conference is God&#8217;s way in life. Many times, we think that God works by His power and authority. This concept is not spiritual, and it is from man rather than from God. God&#8217;s concept is that He has given us His life in order that this life can become all of our ways. With God there is life, and with life there is the way. Without God there is death, and death affords no way to go on. This is very clear.<h2 class=head1>GOD BEING PROCESSED TO BECOME THE SPIRIT OF LIFE</h2><p>How did God become our life? There is a process involved. First, God created man in His image and made in man a spirit, that man may match Him, and that He may enter into man to become man&#8217;s life and to express Himself through man. For this, God placed the created man before the tree of life, which symbolizes Himself, with the purpose that man would eat and receive Him. He did not ask man to do any work, nor did He give man any teaching. He only would have man to eat of the tree of life and to partake of God&#8217;s life. But man made the wrong choice and ate the fruit of the knowledge of good and evil. He fell, and he failed God&#8217;s original purpose in creating him.<p>Then one day, God Himself became flesh. He entered into a virgin&#8217;s womb, was conceived, and remained there. When the full period of nine months was completed, He was born of this virgin, having both divinity and humanity within Him as a wonderful God-man. His name is Jesus. He lived on the earth for thirty-three and a half years. He lived a living that was God&#8217;s, that is, a living that expressed God. However, this was not merely a living that expressed God Himself, but one where God&#8217;s life was expressed through an excellent humanity.<p>The four Gospels describe a person whose humanity and personality are most wonderful, excellent, and outstanding. One French philosopher once said that if the records of Jesus Christ as described in the four Gospels were fabricated, the person that fabricated the records would have been qualified to be Jesus Christ Himself. In the Gospel of John, Jesus said many things, such as, &#8220;I am the way and the reality and the life&#8217;&#8217; (14:6), and, &#8220;I am the light of the world; he who follows Me shall by no means walk in darkness, but shall have the light of life&#8217;&#8217; (8:12). Although these words are simple, they bear a lofty tone and are mysterious and profound beyond all measure. During the six thousand years of human history, there were many sages and saints, but no one else could speak with such a tone. Furthermore, none of them could do anything about the problem of sin. Confucius could only say that &#8220;there is nowhere to plead when one sins against heaven.&#8217;&#8217; But Christ is different. His forerunner, John the Baptist, spoke of Him, saying, &#8220;Behold, the Lamb of God who takes away the sin of the world!&#8217;&#8217; (John 1:29). Although the sins of the world are numerous and grave, He is able to remove them all. Wonderful words like these are found frequently in the four Gospels. All these prove that He is the true One. He is God and also man. His living is the living of a God-man.<p>In the end, He went to the cross to accomplish the all- inclusive death and to solve all the problems in the universe related to man. The first problem to solve is sin. The second is the lust within man. The third is the world. The fourth is the devil, Satan. The fifth, which is also the greatest, is death itself. All these things have been solved for us through the Lord&#8217;s death. Then, He resurrected from death and was transfigured to become the life-giving Spirit, which is the Spirit of life. This Spirit of life is simply the Triune God. He is Jehovah of the Old Testament; He is also Jesus of the New Testament. He is Christ, and He is our Savior. He is also the life that we have received and that is now in our spirit. As to His greatness, He is so great that He fills the whole universe. As to His smallness, He is so small that He can live inside of us.<h2 class=head1>THE CHRISTIAN LIFE BEING FULLY ONE THAT DEPENDS ON GOD&#8217;S SPIRIT OF LIFE</h2><p>This wonderful Spirit of life, as life within us, is our way in everything. First, in our spiritual living, He is our way to live Christ. The way for us Christians to live a spiritual living is to live out Christ by God&#8217;s Spirit of life. Furthermore, He is also the way for us to serve in the church life. The way for us to live and to serve in the church depends on God&#8217;s Spirit of life. In addition, He is also our way to beget, nourish, teach, and build as priests of the gospel. The main work of God&#8217;s priests of the New Testament is to dispense Christ into the sinners, that they may be saved and may become the sacrifices offered to God. This is to beget. After this, there is the need to nourish and teach them, that they may be enlightened and perfected unto a full-grown man, being able to speak for God. This is the prophesying in the Bible, which is for the building up of the Body of Christ.<p>Concerning prophesying, the Greek word for this has three parts, bearing three meanings. The first is to speak forth, the second is the words, and the third is the person. Hence, it is a person that speaks forth the words. Such a one is not speaking man&#8217;s words, but God&#8217;s words. He is speaking forth the words of God. However, the center of God&#8217;s word is Christ. Hence, to prophesy is to speak Christ, to speak Him forth, and to speak Him into others, that others may receive Christ and the supply of Christ. This kind of prophesying is the building; it builds up the Body of Christ.<p>These are the four major steps of the work of the New Testament priests of the gospel. First, there is the begetting, which is the regenerating of the sinners. Second, there is the nourishing, which is to supply and to feed others with spiritual life. Third, there is the teaching, which is to teach others with the spiritual things for their perfection. Fourth, there is the building, which is to be the prophesying ones, speaking for the Lord unto the building up of the Body of Christ. For this reason, Paul said in Ephesians 4 that the Head, Christ, gave to the Body the apostles, the prophets, the evangelists, and the shepherds and teachers, for the perfecting of the saints, for the work of ministry, unto the building up of the Body of Christ (vv. 11-12). The way to all these is by God&#8217;s Spirit of life.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S SPIRIT OF LIFE BEING OUR WAY IN EVERYTHING</h2><p>Today, God&#8217;s Spirit of life is not the same as it was before; it includes many precious ingredients. It is like lemon tea that I myself like very much. Every time I drink it, I put in some Chinese tea, some lemon juice, some high-grade honey, and a little salt. Including the water, there are altogether five ingredients. At the beginning, it is only a glass of water. But after the tea, lemon, honey, and salt are added, it becomes a very tasty drink. When I am tired and thirsty, a drink of this tea will refresh me; my throat will be cleared, and my nose will no longer bother me. This is marvelous. With God&#8217;s Spirit of life, there is the element of God, the element of man, and the human living, the all-inclusive death, the wonderful resurrection, plus the ascension. At the time we were saved, we received this Spirit with all its ingredients into us. We became different inside; we were changed, and we became the Lord&#8217;s testimony.<p>The Lord is not only outside of us as our pattern. He is also inside of us as our life, in order that we can live Him out. This is like the cultivation of fruit trees. A pear tree may originally bear pears that are small and sour. But after we supplement the tree with some elements, the pears become improved; now they are large and sweet. Another example can be seen from medicine. Some pills have both germ-killing ingredients and nutritious ingredients as well. They heal and nourish at the same time. In the same way, with God&#8217;s Spirit of life there is not only the killing element of the cross, but the elements of resurrection and ascension also. On the one hand, this Spirit deals with the negative things; on the other hand, it brings in the life supply and the ability to transcend all things. This Spirit is the processed Triune God. Now He is in us as our life, to become our way in everything. In our spiritual living, He is our way to live Christ. He is also our way to serve in the church life, and He is our way to beget, nourish, teach, and build as priests of the gospel.<p>Hence, as long as we walk according to this Spirit, we can fulfill the requirement of God&#8217;s law, and we can be sanctified positionally and dispositionally. Gradually, we will be transformed into the image of Christ. Because the bountiful supply of this Spirit always satisfies all our needs, we are able to magnify Christ and to live out His virtues under any circumstances. This is on the side of our individual life, but there is also the side of the corporate life. In God&#8217;s Spirit of life, we have been baptized into one Body and have been made to drink of this same one Spirit. This Spirit enables us to live in the reality of God&#8217;s kingdom and to live out righteousness and peace in joy. This Spirit is also filling us to become the church with the full-grown stature as the fullness, the expression of God. In this way, we will have the Spirit of life to be the source of all the gifts and functions in the service of the church; our gifts will be manifested, and we will be able to coordinate together.<h2 class=head1>GOD&#8217;S SPIRIT OF LIFE AS THE WAY FOR THE PRIESTS OF THE GOSPEL TO BEGET, NOURISH, TEACH, AND BUILD</h2><h2 class=head2>Sanctifying and Regenerating the Sinners</h2><p>Finally, we need to consider the way for the priests of the gospel to beget, nourish, teach, and build. To be a priest of the gospel, in simple terms, is to bring in men and to dispense Christ into them. First, we cause a sinner to be sanctified and regenerated by God&#8217;s Spirit of life. In order to do this, sometimes we have to compel people to come in. In Luke 14:15-24, the Lord Jesus spoke a parable concerning God&#8217;s invitation of man to His feast of salvation. It says that a certain man was making a great dinner and had invited many guests. When all things were ready and the feast was about to begin, there were still many empty seats. The master of the house then told his slaves to go out quickly into the streets and lanes of the city and to compel people to come in and fill up the house. Those who were invited first were not able to taste of the Lord&#8217;s feast. Those who were compelled to come in later were all lowly ones, yet they received salvation. Today, it is not easy for us, the servants of the Lord, to gain a person. If we do not compel others, it is difficult for them to be saved. Even when they are saved, it is difficult for them to pursue after the Lord.<p>As priests of the gospel, what we are doing is bringing people in and offering them up to the Lord. Hence, the Lord Jesus is happy to see us compelling others into salvation and bringing them in to offer them to Him. For this reason, when we preach the gospel, our spirits have to be burning, our faces have to be thick-skinned, and our mouths have to be opened. In addition, we need to have an attitude not to be deterred. We should not be afraid of difficulties or tribulations. As long as we will speak by faith, God&#8217;s Spirit of life will work in men to sanctify them (1 Pet. 1:2b) and to regenerate them (John 3:5-6).<h2 class=head2>Feeding the Newly Regenerated Believers and Giving Them to Drink</h2><p>Following this, we have to feed the newly regenerated believers and to give them to drink with God&#8217;s Spirit of life as food and drink (1 Cor. 10:3-4). In the Old Testament, when God&#8217;s people, the Israelites, came out of Egypt and crossed the Red Sea, in their journey in the wilderness they had the spiritual food and the spiritual drink as their nourishment and supply. After a person is regenerated, the most important thing is for him to eat, drink, and enjoy the pneumatic Christ as his food and water, so that he may grow in life.<h2 class=head2>Sanctifying and Perfecting the Saints</h2><p>After the nourishing, we need the teaching. This teaching is through God&#8217;s Spirit of life sanctifying and perfecting the saints until they become able to do the work of the building up of the Body of Christ (Rom. 15:16; Eph. 4:12).<h2 class=head2>Helping the Saints to Prophesy for the Lord unto the Building Up of the Body of Christ</h2><p>When we nourish and perfect the saints by God&#8217;s Spirit of life in this way, we need to arrive at an ultimate goal, which is to help the saints to prophesy for the Lord and to build up the church as the Body of Christ (1 Cor. 14:1, 3-5, 12, 31). In our meetings, everyone can open his mouth to speak. When every one of us speaks, the riches of the Body of Christ are expressed. When we prophesy for the Lord, we need the spiritual words, and these spiritual words come from God&#8217;s Spirit of life (1 Cor. 12:8). This Spirit will grant us the words, the utterance, and the boldness to prophesy. When we depend on Him, we can prophesy for the Lord unto the building up of the Body of Christ.<p><p>(A message given by Brother Witness Lee in Anaheim, California, on January 28, 1990)</body></html>
