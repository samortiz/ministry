<h2 class=head2>The Function of Our Spirit</h2><h2 class=head3>To Worship and Contact God</h2><p>Now we may see what the function of our regenerated spirit is. To worship and contact God is a matter of the spirit. John 4:24 says, “God is Spirit, and those who worship Him must worship in spirit and truthfulness.” In the entire Bible is there a verse telling us to worship God in the soul? By this we can see that there is a difference between the spirit and the soul. This is not a small matter. We cannot see with our ears, and we cannot speak by using our eyes. This is to use the wrong organs. To contact God and to worship God is something in the spirit.<h2 class=head3>To Serve God</h2><p>Romans 1:9a says, “For God is my witness, whom I serve in my spirit.” To love God is a matter of the heart, but to serve God is a matter in the spirit. Verse 6 of chapter seven says, “But now we have been discharged from the law, having died to that in which we were held, so that we serve in newness of spirit and not in oldness of letter.” This verse does not tell us that we serve in newness of the heart, mind, soul, or body. We can serve God only in the spirit, with newness of spirit. To worship God is something in the spirit, and to serve God is also in the spirit.<h2 class=head3>To Pray</h2><p>We also pray in the spirit. Ephesians 6:18 says, “Praying at every time in spirit.” There is no article here in the Greek text, so spirit should be rendered in the lower case.<h2 class=head3>To Live and to Walk</h2><p>We also live and walk according to the spirit (Rom. 8:4-5).<h2 class=head3>To Know the Spiritual Things</h2><p>In addition, 1 Corinthians 2:11 says that the spirit of man knows. To know the things of God is a matter in the spirit. The function of our spirit is to worship, to serve, to pray, to live, and to know the things of God.<h2 class=head3>To Work for the Lord</h2><p>Galatians 6:1 says, “Brothers, even if a man is overtaken in some offense, you who are spiritual restore such a one in a spirit of meekness, looking to yourself lest you also be tempted.” To restore a brother is to help a brother. In principle, this is an example of our work for the Lord. We need to work for the Lord in the spirit.
