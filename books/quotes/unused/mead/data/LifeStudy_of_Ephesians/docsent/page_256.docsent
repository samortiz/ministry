   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE-STUDY OF EPHESIANS MESSAGE EIGHTY-EIGHT UNIVERSAL BUILDING AND LOCAL BUILDING Scripture Reading: Eph 2:21-22</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Chapter two of Ephesians concludes with the matter of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In verse 21 we see the universal building, and in verse 22, the local building.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Verse 21 says, In Whom all the building, being fitted together, is growing into a holy temple in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The phrase all the building denotes the universal building, the church throughout the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The words in Whom you also in verse 22 denote the local building, the building among those in the city to which this Epistle was sent.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The building, therefore, has a universal aspect and a local aspect.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is significant that this chapter of Ephesians concludes with the building of the church in these two aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>For centuries, this matter of the building has been neglected.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Very few servants of the Lord have given it adequate attention.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Beginning in 1938, among us the Lord began to emphasize the importance of the building.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Message after message has been given on this crucial subject.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Among them are the messages printed in The Vision of God s Building .</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The messages in that book cover God s building as revealed from the beginning of the Bible to the end.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>FORSAKING ALL ORDINANCES</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we would be built up universally and locally, we must forsake all ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To hold to certain ordinances is to build without a proper foundation, that is, without Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many Christians are not clear about Christ as the unique foundation, and they do not know God s building.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Therefore, they have spent years wandering from one denomination or Christian group to another.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Such believers may be stones for God s building, but they have not yet been built in. Some church-traveling Christians may claim that the reason for their wandering from group to group is a sense of dissatisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, the underlying reason is ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Ordinances may be related to our natural disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Some have a quiet disposition and prefer Christian meetings where the believers worship in silence.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>They wander from group to group in quest of a meeting to match their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>They may think that a particular group suits their taste, only to learn that certain practices there do not match their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Such Christians are not satisfied with any group.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>They cannot find a group that is fully in accord with their disposition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we have seen a clear vision of God s economy and know what the recovery is, we shall be willing to forget our disposition, to deny our taste, and to care only for the Lord s recovery.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The recovery is not based on any practice; it is based on Christ who is our peace, our foundation, our cornerstone, and our everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The vision of God s economy must control us, direct us, and restrict us.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Such a vision will surely cause us to stand on Christ as the unique foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then instead of being wandering stars Jude 13 , we shall be those who can be built up with others.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We shall be eternally settled in God s economy.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Those who have seen this vision and are governed by it can be built up with others on the unique foundation of the all-inclusive Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>They will not allow any ordinances to become their foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Once again I wish to use pray-reading as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We thank the Lord for pray-reading.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Although we have not made pray-reading an ordinance, some have left the church life simply because they did not care for this practice.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Do you think that someone who leaves the church for such a reason has truly seen what the church is?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>I do not think so.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>One who has seen the vision of the church will never leave.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Some Christians have criticized us not only for the practice of pray-reading, but also for praising the Lord loudly, for calling on the name of the Lord Jesus, and for allowing believers to be baptized again, that is, to be buried.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Others have criticized us for emphasizing the fact that Christ is versus religion.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If we in the local churches have something related to idols, immorality, division, or the denial of the deity of Christ, we should be criticized.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>However, it is wrong to criticize us for such things as pray-reading the Word or calling on the name of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If believers are helped spiritually by these practices, what right have others to criticize them?</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Those who do not follow these practices should nevertheless be one with those who receive benefit by following them.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Suppose a certain brother is convicted of his oldness and deadness and is led of the Lord to bury himself in the waters of baptism.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>After his burial, he is refreshed, renewed, and living.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He may even praise the Lord in a loud, excited way.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Should he be condemned because he was baptized a second time or because he praises the Lord with a loud voice?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Certainly not!</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Nevertheless, some believers may criticize such a one because they still have ordinances related to baptism or to loud praises.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Many years ago there was a certain Presbyterian pastor who was the top theologian in China.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>As a Presbyterian, in his teaching he should have opposed the practice of immersion and favored sprinkling.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>However, as he was praying one day on a mountain, he experienced the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>As he was running down the mountainside, he saw a pool of water and threw himself into it.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After that experience, he became a different person, very living in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Those who hold to ordinances may criticize him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But the Lord does not honor ordinances.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>In Christ neither circumcision nor uncircumcision avails anything, only a new creation Gal 6:15 .</S>
