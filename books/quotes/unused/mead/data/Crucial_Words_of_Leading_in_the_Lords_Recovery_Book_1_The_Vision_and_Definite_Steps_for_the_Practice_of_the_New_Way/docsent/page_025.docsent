   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FOUR SOME DEFINITE STEPS TO CARRY OUT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE PRESENT PRACTICE</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>IN THE LORD S RECOVERY</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In the previous three chapters, we saw clearly the vision in the Lord s recovery, the vision in the New Testament, the ultimate consummation of the visions, and the vision that matches the age.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today we are taking the same way, doing the same work, entering the same flow, and speaking the same thing in this ultimate, consummate, and up-to-date vision.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This can never be accomplished without the proper vision.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>ONE ACCORD FOR THE PRACTICE OF THE NEW WAY</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Needless to say, in mainland China, with its vast differences between the north and the south, it was difficult to practice the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Even in the little island of Taiwan we have many differences.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There are the locals, the southern Fukienese, and the Hakka people.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There is no way for us to be one.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Yet as children of God, we know that God s desire is that we be one.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Ephesians 4 tells us that we have seven ones as our base.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>There is one Body, one Spirit, one hope, one Lord, one faith, one baptism, and one God and Father of all.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Gospels the Lord did not speak much about the matter of the one accord.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In Acts after the Lord resurrected and ascended, He left the disciples on earth to continue His ministry and to carry out His commission.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>It is at that juncture, at the beginning of Acts, that the crucial matter of the one accord is mentioned 1:14 .</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The first of the Epistles is Romans.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>In that book, after writing concerning many important truths, Paul says in 15:5 and 6, Now the God of endurance and encouragement grant you to be of the same mind toward one another according to Christ Jesus, that with one accord you may with one mouth glorify the God and Father of our Lord Jesus Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In the original language, the phrase one accord means having the same mind, will, and goal.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This means that as our whole inward being is one, our outward speaking also becomes one.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>When we are in one accord, we speak the same thing with one mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Following Romans we have 1 Corinthians.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In 1:10 Paul says, Now I beseech you, brothers, through the name of our Lord Jesus Christ, that you all speak the same thing and that there be no divisions among you, but that you be attuned in the same mind and in the same opinion.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The reason Paul said this was that some in the church in Corinth said that they were of Paul, because Paul had brought them to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Others said that they were of Apollos, because Apollos was powerful in expounding the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Still others said that they were of Cephas, because he was the most prominent apostle.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then there were those who claimed that they were more superior than others; they said that they were of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>These four groups of people appreciated different things, and they all argued with one another.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is because there were these four schools that Paul exhorted them to speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Unless these four groups of people saw the same vision, it would be impossible for them to speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is the reason that Proverbs 29:18 says, Where there is no vision, the people cast off restraint.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>A vision controls men and heads them up.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Ephesians 1 says that God s eternal economy in the fullness of the times is to head up not merely the believers but all things v. 10 . In the millennium there will be a miniature heading up.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When the new heaven and new earth come, God will head up all things, including all men, under Christ the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Today is the time of preparation.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>In eternity we will taste the true oneness.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Not only will we speak the same thing; all creation will speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Isaiah 11:6-9a says, The wolf will dwell with the lamb; / And the leopard will lie down with the kid, / And the calf and the young lion and the fatling together; / And a young boy will lead them about.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>/ The cow and the bear will graze; / Their young will lie down together; / And the lion will eat straw like the ox.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>/ The nursing child will play by the cobra s hole, / And upon the viper s den / The weaned child will stretch his hand.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>/ They will not harm nor destroy / In all My holy mountain.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is a picture of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Today the cobra preys on the mouse, and the lion preys on the cow, but in the millennium neither the cobra nor the lion will harm or destroy anyone.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When the new heaven and new earth come, the same will be true to a greater extent.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>One day God will restore everything to this state.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>As God s children, we can have a foretaste of this today.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By God s grace we are qualified and can be saved to the extent that we speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>No matter what nationality and race we belong to, and no matter what language we speak, we can speak the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This oneness comes from the one vision we hold in common.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The reason Christianity is divided is that it has different teachings.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The different teachings come from different visions.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Every denomination has its own beliefs, which become its own tenets of faith.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The source of these tenets can be traced to the founders of the different denominations.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>They saw a certain portion of the truth in the Bible, and this truth became their vision.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Based on these visions, they devised a set of tenets of faith, and based on these tenets, a denomination was founded.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The result is that many grounds are claimed by many different kinds of Christians, and the end is a multitude of divisions.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>In looking back over the history of the Lord s recovery during the past sixty years, we can see some who came but later were troubled and left.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>The reason they were troubled is that there was a difference between their vision and ours.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Thank the Lord that the co-workers, the elders, and the young full-time workers among us here today have all seen the ultimate and consummate vision.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>There is no difference of visions.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>However, we cannot stop here.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We also must be the same in our footsteps and our tone.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Not only must we speak the same thing, but we must do the same work, which is to preach the gospel, build up the small groups, and teach the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It is not an easy task to accomplish these three things, and there is a real need for us to be in one accord.</S>
