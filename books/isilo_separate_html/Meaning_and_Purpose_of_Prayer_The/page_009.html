BEING THE BASIS OF GOD&rsquo;S WORK</h2>
<p>The above examples in the Bible show that the opening of God&rsquo;s work on earth depends on our prayer. God&rsquo;s work matches our prayer, and His work is as extensive as our prayer. God wants to do many things, but He cannot do anything if we do not pray. A person who knew God said once that God&rsquo;s work is like a train, and our prayers are like tracks; wherever the tracks have been laid, there the train can go. Hence, our prayers pave the way for God&rsquo;s work. Strictly speaking, however, our prayers not only pave the way for God but are also a part of God&rsquo;s work. Our prayers are our coordination with God&rsquo;s work. If we do not pray, God has no co-worker to coordinate with Him, and thus, He can do nothing.</p>
<p>The basic principle in God&rsquo;s work is that man must be mingled with God. Man cannot do the work of God by himself, nor can God work by Himself. God must be mingled with man in order to work through man. In God&rsquo;s work, man prays and God fulfills. Without man&rsquo;s prayer, God has no way to fulfill, and without God fulfilling, man prays in vain. When our prayer and God&rsquo;s fulfilling coordinate as one, God&rsquo;s work is accomplished on earth. For example, we believe that in Hong Kong God will save many souls and will raise up many to take the way of the cross, be overcomers, and maintain His testimony. He will also raise up some for His work and some as elders to lead His church and to shepherd His flock. The workers and elders will be rich in life, clear concerning the truth, broad in their view, and skilled. They will be weighty in spiritual matters, and they will be wise and competent in handling practical affairs. Indeed, God wants to raise up such ones to administrate the church in Hong Kong. But He must wait until someone rises up and prays for these matters before He can do them.</p>
<p>Hong Kong is the best place to preach the gospel because a concentrated population of two to three million people resides here. The instability in the world situation makes people restless and ready for the gospel. Transportation and the social facilities in Hong Kong are convenient. Hence, it is easy to preach the gospel. Furthermore, now is the best time to preach the gospel. We should not be surprised if two thousand are saved in a year. When I came to Hong Kong several years ago, the brothers showed me a piece of land that was a vegetable farm. At that time there were a few cottages around the land. There are now five-story buildings surrounding the land. Just as Hong Kong has changed physically, the church in Hong Kong can have a spiritual change. I believe that God wants the church in Hong Kong to have such a change, but the question is whether someone will rise up and pray for this change. The change that we desire is to see thousands saved instead of ten, and this change is possible. This is also what God desires. The question is whether someone will rise up and pray for this. Is there anyone who would go to God and remind Him concerning this?</p>
<p>God wants the church in Hong Kong to be strong, full of His presence and His light, and transparent like the New Jerusalem. God also wants to raise up strong elders and deacons in the church in Hong Kong whose speaking from the Bible would be full of light and transparency. This is the condition that God desires for the church in Hong Kong. However, the question still remains: is there anyone who would rise up and pray for this matter so that God&rsquo;s intention would be fulfilled?</p>
<p>If some saints in the church in Hong Kong would touch and contact God, absorb Him, live in Him, let Him be expressed from within them, and pray at set times daily, God would fulfill their prayer. If they would pray, &ldquo;God, we want many to be saved in the gospel this year,&rdquo; God would fulfill that. If they would pray, &ldquo;God, we want the church in Hong Kong to be transparent and bright and full of Your presence. We want the testimony and service of the church to be strong,&rdquo; God would do such a work. However, this coordination cannot be gained through sloppy prayers. We must first touch God, absorb Him, and let Him be expressed from within us. Then our prayer will be able to bring in God&rsquo;s work.</p>
<p>The ones whom such saints bring up in prayer will not escape God&rsquo;s hand. The saints may feel that a young brother should spend his whole being and his life for God&rsquo;s work. Although they will not say much to the brother, they will mention his name in their prayer, and as a result, he will not escape God&rsquo;s hand. Day after day God&rsquo;s hand will be like the cords of a man and bands of love on that young brother, leading him to consecrate himself on the altar to God and to be gained by God (cf. Hosea 11:4). Then the brother will gradually become a strong oracle, a good minister of the word for God, and a pillar to uphold the testimony and service of the church. This is the result of the prayer of a group of saints.</p>
<p>A good number of saints pray often on my behalf. I deeply believe that the fruit of the work is the result of their prayer; God fulfills and answers their prayers. I also believe that as a result of their prayer, God&rsquo;s hand has been upholding and supporting me and has prevented me from being overcome by weakness or going astray. The varied mercy and grace of God that are manifested in me are the result of the prayers of the saints.</p>
<p>Those who love God must see that the purpose of prayer is to touch God, coordinate with Him, and be His co-worker. We become God&rsquo;s co-workers who coordinate with Him by touching Him, absorbing Him, and letting Him be expressed. Then God will take notice of whatever we bring up, He will provide what we request, and the extent of our prayer will be the extent of His work. This applies to God&rsquo;s work in the church, on the people around us, and in the saints.</p>
<p>If we do not pray for our condition, God will not work in us. For example, a sister may be full of the flesh, but if she does not pray concerning this, God will not do anything. It is not until she draws near to God in fellowship and absorbs God, and He touches her in order to manifest her flesh through her environment that she will pray concerning being fleshly. Then God can begin to work in her. From then on He will deal with her flesh and deliver her. Thus, we need to see that we are God&rsquo;s co-workers to coordinate with Him in matters concerning others and ourselves. In such matters God will work according to our prayer.</p>
<p>As those who are learning to pray, we must exercise until we can touch God, express Him, and coordinate with Him as His co-workers. Then our prayers will become prophecies that He will fulfill. God will fulfill whatever we ask, and He will work according to our prayers. How glorious to be such persons on earth, that is, to be persons who command God! Such persons are glorious and dignified.</p>
<p>God has put us in such a high position through His union with us. If we will learn to pray in such a way, we will be filled inwardly with God. We will be persons who contact God and have fellowship with Him. We will touch God, let Him gain us, and let Him be expressed in us. This is what it means to be a person of prayer, one who co-works with God and whose prayers are in coordination with God. This is the purpose of prayer and the position that prayer brings us into.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_008.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_010.html">Next</a> </body></html>
