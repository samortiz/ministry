   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>The second section requires an introduction.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Before we read verse 4, let me first tell you about this introduction.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Before the apostle wrote verse 4, he anticipated that these ones would ask, "If you say that we should not lay again the foundation, what then should we do if we sin again?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>If a person has failed, backslidden, and sinned, does he not have to lay again the foundation?"</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Here the apostle said something in anticipation of their question.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>"For it is impossible for those who have once been enlightened and have tasted of the heavenly gift..."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>If you have a Greek New Testament in your hand, you will see that the word once according to the grammar of the original language does not refer only to the first item of the list, but to every item in the list.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It should read, "...those who have once been enlightened, and who have once tasted of the heavenly gift, and have once become partakers of the Holy Spirit, and have once tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come..."</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is very clear in the original text.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Here is a man who has been enlightened, has tasted of the heavenly gift, and has become a partaker of the Holy Spirit, and has tasted the good word of God and the powers of the age to come.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The age to come is the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>This one has tasted the powers of the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In other words, he has seen and tasted miracles, wonders, healings, and the casting out of demons.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If such a one falls away, it is impossible for him to be renewed again to repentance.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>"And yet have fallen away..."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>One British brother who studied Greek and who specialized in the book of Hebrews for his whole lifetime said that the falling away here means to have a slip of the foot.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>When it says that it is impossible to again renew themselves unto repentance, many think that it means perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>But this explanation is not valid.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If there is a man who has once been enlightened, who has once tasted of the heavenly gift, who has once become a partaker of the Holy Spirit, who has once tasted the good word of God and once tasted the powers of the age to come, is it possible that such a one cannot any longer repent once he makes a slip?</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Are there cases of fallen Christians who have risen up again?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Word of God tells us that indeed there have been many, and church history also tells us that indeed there were many.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Many Christians who had once slipped eventually became the best runners of the heavenly kingdom course.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Beginning from Peter, there have been countless Christians who have fallen and have risen up again.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If there were no possibility for these to rise up again, then Peter would have been the first one that could not have risen up.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>He slipped terribly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can say that he had fallen flat on his face.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Peter was not the only one.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Throughout the two thousand years of church history, countless Christians have failed.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>But eventually they became the best testimonies.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>I can enumerate countless proofs of this.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If what was said before was right, then there should not have been a single one; if there is one, the Bible would be wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this passage, there is a word in the original text, palin, which means again.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>There is also another word, anakainizo, right after this word, which means to renew.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Hence, according to the original text, this part should be translated as "once having slipped, it is impossible to again renew to repentance."</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The apostle was telling the Hebrew believers here that the repentance from dead works, the faith in God, the teaching of baptisms and of the laying on of hands, of the resurrection of the dead and of eternal judgment, are all words of the beginning of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>If they have once been enlightened, once tasted of the heavenly gift, once partaken of the Holy Spirit, once tasted the good word of God, and once tasted the powers of the age to come, and have then slipped, they cannot lay again the foundation and cannot again be renewed to repentance.</S>
