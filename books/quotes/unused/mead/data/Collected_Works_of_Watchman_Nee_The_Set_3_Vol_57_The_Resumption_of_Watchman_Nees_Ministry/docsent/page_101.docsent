   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Satan Usurping Man's Worship through Money</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>At the same time, money takes hold of all things.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>On the one end, God produced all things through creation.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>On the other end, Satan converted all things into money, thus unifying all things.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>If a man has money, he can buy anything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>He can buy gold.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He can even buy the whole of Shanghai or the whole of China.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is not one thing that money cannot buy.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Mammon is opposed to God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is the reason the Bible tells us not only that the love of money is a root of all evils 1 Tim 6:10 , but that covetousness and idolatry go together Eph 5:5; Col 3:5 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Covetousness is the only idol.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When one worships money, he is not worshipping money itself, but the created things behind the money.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Because man wants goods, he spends the "common goods,'' that is, the money, to buy the particular goods.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This means that man wants God's things and does not want God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>This is the reason that man either serves God or mammon.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who have a heart for mammon can never love God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The Only Way to Serve God Being</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>to Be Delivered from Mammon</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>God's things come from God; this is grace.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The things that come from God are not for sale.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The sunlight is not metered, and there is no charge for it.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But there is a charge for electric light.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>In order to get anything from Satan, man has to buy it.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even the carob pods of the prodigal son had to be bought.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>If a person truly wants to serve the Lord, he must be delivered from money.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Once a person's thoughts are turned to money, he cannot serve God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>It is wrong for a man to view all things from the side of money; he should view all things from the side of God.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>MINISTRY AND AUTHORITY</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Another thing which we must see is the relationship between ministry and authority.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The eyes have the ministry of the eyes; they control the seeing function.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In order for any member in the body to see, it has to rely on the ministry of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The meaning of coordination is that we give to others what we have, and others give to us what they have.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The first condition to coordination is that we accept our own limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We have to acknowledge that we are only a member, and that we are not the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>If we were capable in everything, then we would be the whole Body, and we would not need coordination any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, as long as we are only a member, we cannot think that we have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>The one-talented ones cannot pretend to be rich.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Even if the eyes are important, they cannot replace the ears.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One can see colors only with the eyes, and one can hear sounds only with the ears.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Perhaps I can only speak, not walk.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>In that case, someone will have to do the walking.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If we see this, we will realize that what one individual can do is actually very limited.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>During these days the Lord has shown us that too few brothers and sisters know what real coordination is.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>A brother said once, "I do not think that this thing should be done this way.''</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I said to him, "Who is asking you to think?''</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If you are an ear, you do not have to say, "I think this matter should be done this way.''</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If the eyes see that something is white, then it is white.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>There is no need for the ear to think about whether it is white.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The sisters cover their heads with respect to the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Christ says that He does not speak from Himself John 12:49 .</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>The word from is ek in the original language.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>It means "out from.''</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>This means that the Son can speak nothing out from Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In other words Christ's head is covered before God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Today the church also has its head covered before Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>The fact of the covering is demonstrated through the sisters' covering of their heads.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Whenever we are in the coordination of the Body, all our heads have to be removed.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>For many to think about what to do and to express the opinions that they have is quite inappropriate.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Someone asked me once, "If I cannot say amen to a certain thing, what should I do?''</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>The Bible never says that a servant of God should do something "when he feels an amen to do it,'' and should not do something "when he does not feel an amen to do it.''</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Man's head needs to be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>When some brothers and sisters talk to me, I have the feeling that my head should be cut off.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Only the unique Head is qualified to think.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Today man's mind is full of the thought of being the head.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>A person has to learn to reject proposals and opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>God has reserved for Himself teachers who can make decisions concerning the interpretation of the Bible and judgments on the Scriptures.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>The reason that there are so many sects and strange doctrines is that everyone wants to be a teacher.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>However, not everyone is a teacher in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>It is useless for the ear to say that something is white.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whether or not a thing is white is not determined by what the ear says, but by what the eyes see.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Today there are many heresies that have developed from the church because of this very reason.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>There is one thing that is very strange in 1 Corinthians 12: Although the eyes and the ears are on the head, they are not the head.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>In the body the controlling organ is the head, whereas the working organs are the members.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>The organ that actually sees is not the eyes, but the optical nerves within the head.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Outwardly speaking, the whole body moves by the seeing of the eyes.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Actually it moves by the head.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Even if you are a great gift or a strong member, you are useless if you are not in coordination, and if you are not the eyes, you surely need coordination all the more.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Today we need to see our own limitation.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>There are many things that do not require our consideration.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Once we see the limitation of the members, the matter of authority will be settled.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we are at odds with the members appointed by God, we are at odds with the Head.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>If we are omnipotent and omniscient, we will not need any coordination.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>In the church we are not afraid of the seemingly foolish ones who know nothing; we are only afraid of those who know everything and who can do everything.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>In coordination we should not be the head.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Rather, we should learn to listen and not have too many of our own thoughts.</S>
