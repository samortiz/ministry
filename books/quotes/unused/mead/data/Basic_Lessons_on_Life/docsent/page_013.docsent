   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>B. The Tree of Knowledge</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The other choice before man was the tree of knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Signifying Satan as Evil to Man</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The tree of knowledge signifies Satan as evil to man.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>This evil is actually an evil life.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Issuing in an Independent Life</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The tree of knowledge issues in a kind of independent life in you.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The more knowledge you give people, the more independent they can become.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Knowledge causes people to be independent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>When you take in the tree of knowledge, you will feel that you do not need to depend upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Instead, you will depend upon your knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>But if you take in the tree of life, this causes you to depend upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Life is a matter of dependence, but knowledge is a matter of independence.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>These critical points are pointed out by Brother Watchman Nee in a booklet entitled Two Principles of Conduct.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These two principles are actually two lives.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>One is the dependent life and the other is the independent life.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>One is the principle of dependence and the other is the principle of independence.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The tree of life issues in a principle of dependence, and the tree of knowledge issues in a principle of independence.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Due to the fact that man took the tree of knowledge, man became altogether independent from God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But whoever repents to God and receives Him as life becomes dependent on God.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Before we were saved, we were altogether independent of God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>But when we repented to God and believed in God, we became dependent.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Whenever we have been independent, that was the time we lived by knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Whenever we lived by our spirit, by life, we were altogether dependent upon God.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Thus, these are two kinds of principles issuing from two kinds of lives.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The divine life makes us dependent, and the satanic life makes us independent.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>To be independent means to be rebellious.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>To rebel means to be independent from God.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>GOD WANTING MAN TO RECEIVE HIM AS LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>BY THE WAY OF EATING</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>God wanted man to receive Him as life by the way of eating.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>A. Eating Being the Unique Way</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>to Receive Nourishment Organically</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Eating is the unique way to receive nourishment organically.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>To receive anything organic, there is no other way except by eating.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>What you eat becomes your organic nourishment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We need to develop this point.</S>
