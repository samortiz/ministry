The Successor of Moses</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>1. Moses Asking Jehovah to Appoint<br>a Man over the Assembly of Israel</H2><P>Moses said to Jehovah, "Let Jehovah, the God of the spirits of all flesh, appoint a man over the assembly, who will go out before them and come in before them, who will lead them out and bring them in; that the assembly of Jehovah may not be as sheep which have no shepherd" (vv. 16-17). Moses' concern was not for himself and for the loss of the right to enter into the land. He was not the kind of person who cared so much for himself and his situation. Although he was very old, he was concerned for God's people, realizing that they would be in need of a shepherd.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>2.
