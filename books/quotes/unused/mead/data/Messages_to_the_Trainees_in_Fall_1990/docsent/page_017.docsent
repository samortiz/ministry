   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER SIX LIVING A MINGLED LIFE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>WITH THE DIVINE TRINITY Scripture Reading: Col 1:19; Phil 2:6-8; John 5:19, 30b; Heb 10:7; John 15:26 THE ONENESS OF THE DIVINE TRINITY</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>In a previous message, we saw that the Son came in the Father's name John 5:43a and that the Son did things in the name of the Father John 10:25 .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>John 14:26 says that the Father sends the Spirit in the Son's name.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The First the Father sends the Third the Spirit in the Second's the Son's name.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Father does not do things by Himself alone.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He does things in the Son's name.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To do things in the name of another one is not only to be one with another person but also to be that other person.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The Father sent the Spirit in the Son's name.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This is like writing a check but signing the name of another person, instead of your own name.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Usually, the person who writes the check signs his own name.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>But if I write a check and sign another brother's name, it indicates, at least in part, that the other brother wrote the check.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Father "wrote the check" by sending the Spirit, but He "signed" the name of the Son by sending the Spirit in the name of the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The Father, as the Son, sent the Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In John 14:26 the Father sends the Spirit in the name of the Son, but in John 15:26, the Son sends the Spirit from the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>When these two portions are put together, you can see that when the Father sends the Spirit, He does so with the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the same manner, the Son sends the Spirit with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Neither the Father nor the Son would do anything without the other.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>When the Father sends the Spirit in the Son's name, He does it as the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>When the Son sends the Spirit from the Father, He does it as one with the Father.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Then when the Spirit comes, He testifies concerning the Son 15:26 .</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This shows the oneness of the wonderful divine Trinity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The Son was made the Firstborn of all creation Col 1:15 and the Firstborn in resurrection v. 18 . In making the Son the Firstborn of the two creations, the Father gave the preeminence, the first place, to the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Colossians 1:19 says, "For in Him all the fullness was pleased to dwell."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The fullness mentioned in this verse is the fullness of the Godhead 2:9 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This means that all the fullness of the Godhead was pleased to dwell in Christ, who is God's embodiment.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The Father, Son, and Spirit were pleased to dwell in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>As the embodiment of the divine Trinity, the Son did not "regard equality with God a thing to be grasped, but emptied Himself, taking the form of a slave, becoming in the likeness of men" Phil 2:6-7 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The Son lowered Himself to be a slave, taking the form of man.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He was happy to obey God, even to the point of death not an ordinary death, but the death of the cross v. 8 . The Son was willing to be lowered and to obey the Father to such an extent.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The Father honored the Son, the Son lowered Himself to obey the Father, and the Spirit, being sent by the Father and the Son, came to testify concerning the Son.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>While He was on earth, the Son did nothing of Himself John 5:19, 30 .</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Rather, He did everything by the Father according to the Father's will.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The three Persons of the Godhead are mingled as one.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The church's oneness should be a duplication of the divine Trinity's oneness.</S>
