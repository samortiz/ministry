   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>However, we should avoid another extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Some Christians are too passive.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>They ask the church about everything, and they want others to make decisions for them.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is against the principle of the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We cannot treat a group of spiritual people in the church as if they were the prophets in the Old Testament, asking them for advice in everything.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>First John 2:27 says, "And as for you, the anointing which you have received from Him abides in you, and you have no need that anyone teach you; but as His anointing teaches you concerning all things..."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>This anointing is the indwelling Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We can never replace the teaching of the anointing with the confirmation of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The confirmation of the church should not be regarded in the same way as one regards the words of the prophets.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Its purpose is to confirm what we see so that we can be more assured of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is a protection rather than a replacement of an individual's pursuit of God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>We should note one other point: This way of seeking God's will should be applied only to important matters.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>As to the trivial affairs of daily life, we do not need to resort to such a method.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We can make judgments according to our common sense.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our God has not eradicated our common sense.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>God wants us to make our own judgments concerning things that we can manage with our common sense.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We need to employ this method only in seeking God's will concerning the more important matters of our life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>In seeking God's will, we must not fall into an abnormal state where the mind is blank and the will is passive.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Hebrews 5:14 speaks of those "who because of practice have their faculties exercised for discriminating between both good and evil."</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We need to exercise our mind and will.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We have to put our will on God's side and co-labor with God.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>It is true that we should put aside our own will.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But it is wrong to annul the function of the mind and the will, allowing them to be passive and void of function.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Many people trust only in their intellect and not in God.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>This is a big mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>But many people think that relying on God means that one does not need to use his mind.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>This is also a big mistake.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>When Luke wrote his gospel, it was "carefully investigated" 1:3 .</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In Romans 12:2 Paul told us to "be transformed by the renewing of the mind that you may prove what the will of God is."</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In seeking God's will, we need to use our mind and our will.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Of course, this mind and will have to be transformed and renewed by the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>We need to briefly touch on the matter of visions and dreams as well.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the Old Testament God revealed His will to man through visions and dreams.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In the New Testament there are also visions and dreams, but God does not use them as an essential means of guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>In the New Testament the Spirit of God dwells in us and speaks to us directly from within.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The chief and common means of guidance are the inward leading.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>God will lead us by dreams and visions only when He has something very important to say and it would not be easy for us to accept this leading under normal circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>In the New Testament visions and dreams are not the usual means of God's leading.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Therefore, even when we have visions and dreams, we should still safeguard ourselves by seeking the inward confirmation and the confirmation in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>For example, Acts 10 shows us that God wanted Peter to preach the gospel to the Gentiles.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Peter, being a Jew, would never go to the Gentiles according to his tradition.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to turn him from this prejudice, God had to show him a vision.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>After Peter saw the vision, Cornelius sent three men to him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This was the confirmation in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>At the same time there was also the speaking of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>These internal and environmental confirmations assured him that he was acting according to God's will.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Of course, there are cases when one has little time to consider or wait.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>At such times one can prove God's will immediately if the vision or dream is clear and obvious and the feeling within approves it; there is no need to wait for the confirmation in the environment.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>For example, Paul was in a trance when he was praying in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>He saw the Lord speaking to him and charging him to leave Jerusalem without delay.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>At first he reasoned with the Lord and tried to refuse.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>But the Lord said to him again, "Go, for I will send you forth far away to the Gentiles" Acts 22:17-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Later, Paul met a heavy storm at sea, and all hope of salvation was gone.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>God sent His angel to stand beside him and speak to him, telling him not to fear 27:23-24 .</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>These were all clear visions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>But they do not occur frequently in the New Testament.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>God revealed things to His children in visions and dreams only when there was a special need.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Some Christians have so many so-called dreams and visions that these are like everyday meals to them.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>This is a kind of spiritual sickness.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It may come from some kind of nervous disorder, attack from Satan, or deception from evil spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Whatever the cause, this situation is abnormal.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>In conclusion, God leads men by many ways.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>Everyone is different in his spiritual condition and needs.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is why God leads us in different ways.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>However, His main means are the arrangement in the environment, the inward leading, and the teachings in the Bible.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We need to point out once again that when these three things are in line with one another, we can have the confidence that we have God's will.</S>
