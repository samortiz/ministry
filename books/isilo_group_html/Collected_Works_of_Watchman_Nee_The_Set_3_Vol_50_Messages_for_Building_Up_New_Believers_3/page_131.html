The Rebellion of the Israelites</h2><h2 class="head3">1. God Choosing Abraham<br />to Be a Pattern of Submission</h2><p>God chose Abraham not only to be the father of faith but also to be a pattern of submission. In the midst of the rebellion of the nations and the confusion of the tower of Babel, God chose Abraham not only for his faith but also for his submission. God demands, expects, and desires to find a man of submission. He desires to find a man who will stand on the ground of submission in the day of rebellion.</p><p>Not only was Abraham a man of submission, even his wife was in submission. Not only were Abraham and Sarah submissive to God, Sarah was submissive to Abraham as well. Sarah submitted to God and accepted His direct authority. She also accepted Abraham as her deputy authority. Both the husband and the wife were submissive to God, and between the husband and wife, that is, between one human being and another human being, there was also submission. They maintained the principle of God's authority on earth. As a result, God's people came out of them. God's people were chosen based upon His authority.</p><h2 class="head3">2. God Establishing Authority<br />among the Israelites</h2><p>God told Abraham that his descendants would become slaves in Egypt, but that He would bring them out by the fourth generation. In the exodus from Egypt, Moses brought the Israelites out. First, God gained one man, Moses, who was submissive. After Moses learned authority, God commissioned him to lead the Israelites out of Egypt. Among the Israelites, God established His direct authority. We see this in Exodus, when God's presence was manifested by the pillar of cloud and the pillar of fire. The Lord also expressed His authority through the commandments. He also appointed Moses and Aaron to be His authority. Moses and Aaron were God's appointed authority, His deputy authority, among the Israelites.</p><h2 class="head3">3. God Not Tolerating<br />Those Who Offend His Authority</h2><p>God would not tolerate men's sinning against Himself, and He would not tolerate men's sinning against His servants. Not only did God forbid men to sin against Himself, but He also forbade men to sin against His priests and prophets. God appointed authority among the children of Israel, and when they offended His authority, judgments and punishments would come upon them. Those who offended His authority were not allowed to enter the land of Canaan.</p><h2 class="head3">4. The Rebellion of the Israelites<br />throughout History</h2><p>After they entered the land of Canaan, the Israelites again flagrantly rebelled against God. They wanted to have a king among them. They did not want God to rule over them; they wanted to follow the way of the world to have a king among them. God said to Samuel, "It is not you whom they have rejected, but they have rejected Me" (1 Sam. 8:7). Saul was chosen, and he was followed by David. God appointed David to be the authority, and through his hands gathered the materials for the building of the temple, a place for His dwelling among His people. At the time of Solomon, the temple was built.</p><p>Immediately after Solomon's death, the Israelites turned to idols. From that day forward, the nation of Israel and the nation of Judah were forsaken. Although God tolerated them for many years and allowed them to keep their kings, it was only His promise to David that kept the nation of Israel, not His desire for keeping it. Nothing offends God more than idolatry. Idolatry usurps the worship of God. From that point forward, the history of Israel became nothing but a history of rebellion.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_130.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_132.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 50: Messages for Building Up New Believers (3) &nbsp; pg 131</div><br></body></html>
