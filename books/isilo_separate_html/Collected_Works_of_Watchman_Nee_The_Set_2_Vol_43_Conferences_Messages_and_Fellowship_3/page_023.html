If God forgives our sins in a loose way, He will violate the law. How can God save us and at the same time not get into trouble Himself? It is not difficult to forgive sins, but it is not easy to have a forgiveness in a way that is righteous and lawful. What can God do? Let me use the earlier illustration. Mr. Tang is a rich man. Not only does he loan me ten thousand dollars, but he also has a great deal of cash. One day he comes to my house. At first he speaks very severely to me, saying, "The contract is definite, and it cannot be changed. You have to repay the money." After he says this, he whispers in my ear, "I also have another ten thousand dollars that I am going to give to you. The money you borrowed was bound by a contract, but this money is yours for free!" Then he leaves without a further word. The next morning I can bring the ten thousand dollars that he gave me and walk into his house with boldness and confidence, saying, "Did I owe you this much?" He will say, "Yes." If I then give the money to him, he will give the contract note back to me.</p><p>This is the way God's law works. God says, "If you observe the law, you will live; otherwise, you will die." If we disobey the law, God cannot treat it lightly. We have to die. God gave us the law. Of course, He cannot disobey His own law. What can God do? God gave us His Son. But this is not the law; rather, it is apart from the law. God's love constrained Him to give us His only begotten Son to shed His blood for us to repay our debt of sin. We can come to God by His blood. This is how God saves us. Now everyone who is in Christ Jesus has his sin-debts forgiven. God cannot seek repayment from us. Our sins were not removed in a light manner; they were judged. We have the proof that Christ Jesus has obtained the forgiveness of sins for us. When I give the money back to Mr. Tang, he will be unrighteous if he does not return the contract note to me. Our Lord has already paid the debt of our sins. Today we can come boldly and confidently before God. By the blood of Christ, God is obligated to save us because this salvation fully satisfies the righteous requirements of God's law. Please remember that the proof of Christ's forgiveness of our sins is God's righteousness (1 John 1:9).</p><p>Brothers and sisters, our sins are not forgiven freely. Because the price of redemption has been paid, our sins can now be forgiven. Please remember that we are cleansed by the Lord's blood (1 John 1:7). When we come before God, we can come boldly and without fear in our conscience because the Lord has paid the debt once for all. God can no longer go after the debt. From now on we can praise God instead.</p><p>Finally, I would like to tell you a story. It is my favorite story. In 1925 I went to speak at a girls' school in Nanking. One day I spoke to the students about God's righteousness, but they could not understand what I was speaking about. After I spoke for a long time, they still had dazed looks on their faces. By chance I spotted a vase on the podium. I asked the principal who was sitting next to me, "What would happen if one of your students broke the vase?" The principal said, "She would have to pay for it." Then I asked, "What if she did not have the money?" He said, "This is a rule of the school. If anyone breaks something, she must pay for it. It matters not whether she has money." I asked again, "Suppose she was your favorite student, the youngest and poorest, who simply could not pay. What would you do?" He said, "Then that would be a different story." How could he forgive her? If he did, I am afraid that there would not be one single vase left in the school within a few days. What could he do? He said, "The only way would be for me to pay for it."</p><p>This is what God has done. God loves us, and this love is very "troublesome." We have sinned and cannot meet all the righteous requirements of God's law. Because God loves us, He has to meet His requirements. God gave His only begotten Son to us to fully pay our sin-debts. In this way the problem is settled. When I spoke this way, all those students understood what I was talking about. The next day was my last meeting with them. When I went in, I noticed that the vase was not there. I asked the principal, "What happened?" He said, "It was broken." I said, "Did you ask her to pay for it?" He said, "Certainly." I said, "Your words carry the aura of Mount Sinai!" God has said that our sins are forgiven by the Lord's blood. Suppose I commit a crime and am arrested by the police, and suppose the judge sentences me to five years in jail. If, after I am released, I encounter the same policeman who arrested me previously, he cannot arrest me again. Even if I mock him, he cannot arrest me again, because the crime has already been punished and the case has been settled. Thank God! In Christ all the debts of sins are repaid. This is God's righteous way to forgive our sins.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
