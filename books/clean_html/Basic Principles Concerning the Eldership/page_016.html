<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;Not a New Convert&rdquo;</h2>
<p>First Timothy 3:6 says, &ldquo;Not a new convert, lest being blinded with pride he fall into the judgment suffered by the devil.&rdquo; This is also related to human relationships, for we cannot be proud if we are alone. When a person is appointed to a special position in a group, the larger the group is, the easier it is for the person to become proud. A new convert should not be an overseer. Although we may not be a new convert, we must see the principle that we must be careful not to become proud when we first become an elder.</p>
<p>In the New Testament there is no indication that there is the need of an apprenticeship for someone to become an elder. However, in the Old Testament there was a five-year apprenticeship for the priesthood. The Levites began learning to be a priest when they were twenty-five years of age (Num. 8:24). Then when they were thirty, they were qualified to serve in the tabernacle (4:3). Based on this principle, when a brother is first appointed as an elder, he should consider himself to be only an apprentice who is learning. In an established church that has a sufficient number of elders, it is good to have two or three apprentices helping the elders and learning from them how to care for the church. Eventually, these apprentices can become proper elders. In a new local church the leading ones should consider themselves only as learning apprentices. This will preserve them.</p>
<p>Pride makes us blind. If an elder becomes proud, he will suffer the same condemnation as the devil. Lucifer was placed in a high position, but he became proud of his position and earned God&rsquo;s condemnation and judgment. When the apostle Paul was writing this portion in 1 Timothy, he probably had in mind Isaiah 14:12-15, which describes Satan&rsquo;s pride and ambition and God&rsquo;s judgment of him (cf. Ezek. 28:14-19; Jude 9). Paul&rsquo;s word is a warning to new elders to be careful not to be proud. If an elder is proud, he will follow Satan as a rebel against God&rsquo;s government and authority and will suffer the same judgment. Those who are taking the lead in the churches must be in fear and trembling, praying that the Lord will preserve them from any kind of pride. We must not consider that we are in a higher position or have a higher rank than others. Especially the younger brothers must learn to be humble in the church, in the meetings, and in contacting others.</p>
<h2 class="head2">&ldquo;A Good Testimony from Those Outside&rdquo;</h2>
<p>First Timothy 3:7 says, &ldquo;He also must have a good testimony from those outside, that he may not fall into reproach and the snare of the devil.&rdquo; Those outside are our neighbors, relatives, and acquaintances who are not in the church. We must have a good testimony from such ones concerning our daily living and walk. This is altogether not a matter of ability but a matter of life; it concerns who we are in our conduct, character, and living among others, even those outside.</p>
<p>If we do not have a good testimony from those outside, we will fall into reproach and the snare of the devil. The apostle Paul indicates that Satan uses the pride of youth and the reproach from the outsiders to damage us. If we do not have a good testimony before the outsiders, Satan will use this reproach as a snare to entangle us. Paul&rsquo;s concept is that we must establish a good example for our family and be careful in our walk before the outsiders. We must not give them any opportunity to say something negative about us so that we will not be ensnared, disappointed, or discouraged, which may damage, spoil, or destroy us for the eldership.</p>
<p>In verses 6 and 7 Paul does not use the word <em>Satan,</em> which means &ldquo;the adversary.&rdquo; Instead, he twice uses the word <em>devil,</em> which means &ldquo;slanderer.&rdquo; Not much slandering will come to a brother who is not an elder, but once he becomes an elder in the church, the devil will try to trap and damage him through slander. The devil being mentioned twice in these few verses indicates strongly that he hates for anyone to be an elder, and he hates that there are proper elders in the church. He tries to damage every elder. In other words, once we become an elder, we become a target of Satan. Satan will try to damage us through our pride or the reproach of others. The reproach of others can greatly disappoint and damage us. If we lose our temper in front of a relative, that one will be utilized by Satan to tell others of our failure. Such a poor testimony will discourage, disappoint, and eventually damage us for the eldership. We must not be proud so that we may not fall into the judgment suffered by the devil, and we must also be careful not to earn the reproach of the outsiders, which is the snare of the devil. In 1 Timothy 3:1-7 Paul&rsquo;s burden concerns not our ability but our life, living, and being. His word clearly indicates that Satan does not damage us in our work or our ability but in our life, living, and conduct.</p>
<p>For past mistakes we need to follow the Lord&rsquo;s leading to make restitution. In order to clear up the situation, we must confess to those whom we offended and even to those who were merely present when we offended someone else. Especially the overseers should do this. If I lose my temper with my wife in the presence of others, I must first confess to my wife, and then go to the others, and in the presence of my wife ask them to forgive me, testifying to them that the Lord has touched my conscience. This will remove a bad impression. For the future we must look to the Lord, realizing that it is by His mercy that we are an elder. We must be careful because Satan will continually seek opportunity to damage us as those who care for God&rsquo;s house, the church. The elders must pray, &ldquo;Lord, deliver me from any temptation, and keep me from the evil one and evil things.&rdquo; Especially the new elders have to pray very much for their eldership. Paul&rsquo;s word reveals that there is a battle regarding the eldership because the devil seeks to ruin every elder.</p>
