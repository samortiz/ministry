   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE FILLING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>And do not be drunk with wine but be filled in spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>5:18</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the spirit occupies the mind, the will, and the emotion, this means that the mind, the will, and the emotion are filled with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Thus, the spirit rules over the entire being and occupies the entire being.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The word spirit here does not have a definite article; it denotes neither the Holy Spirit nor our spirit in a definite way.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Rather, it refers to the spirit formed out of two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We have this spirit in us, but it is still not in our mind, emotion, or will.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This spirit is only in our spirit; it has yet to enter into every part of our being.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Now we need to let this spirit spread into every part of our being so that our entire being is filled with the spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Many people today talk about being filled with the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Actually they are referring merely to the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To have the outpouring is an outward matter, whereas to be filled is an inward matter.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>When we repented and were saved, the Lord came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>At that time our mind was turned, our emotion loved the Lord, and our will decided to receive Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We opened our heart to the Lord, and He came in with rejoicing.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, gradually our mind, our emotion, and our will become closed to the Lord, and we shut Him up in our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Some do it sooner, while others do it later.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Eventually, your spirit becomes a prison.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Lord Jesus has found a prison instead of a dwelling place after He came into us.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Do you know the difference between a prison and a dwelling place?</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You can go in and out freely in a dwelling place but not in a prison.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Brothers and sisters, is the Lord Jesus residing in you or being imprisoned in you?</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Do you give the Lord Jesus freedom?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Do not lock Him up any longer.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Rather, open your heart again; turn your mind, emotion, and will to Him again.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Then He is able to spread outward, and the result of this spreading is that He makes His home in your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Then He occupies your entire being, and every part of your being is filled with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>It would be a wonderful thing if some of us Christians could be occupied by the Lord within five years.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The common situation is that we are constantly struggling with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In the morning we give our whole being to the Lord, but in the evening we take back one half.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Then the next morning we take back another quarter, and in the end only a quarter is left.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The Lord is frustrated within you, but all He can do is to wait patiently.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>After two weeks He comes to draw you again.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Therefore, you repent and confess your sins again.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Your mind is turned to Him and your emotion wants Him.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>You do this in the morning, yet at noon you change your mind again.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Therefore, the Lord has been struggling with us for many years.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>However, brothers and sisters, the Lord will always win.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>You can never win.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>If He cannot subdue you in one year, He will wait for five years.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>If He cannot subdue you in five years, He will wait for ten years.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>If He cannot subdue you in this age, in the coming age He will subdue you.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>But if you let Him get through sooner, you will be happy and He will also be happy.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Otherwise, He will suffer and you also will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>THE FIGHTING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>And receive the sword of the Spirit, which spirit is the word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>6:17</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The sword of the Spirit is obviously for fighting.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Therefore, this Spirit is also the fighting Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>When you are occupied by and filled with the Spirit, you are equipped to fight the spiritual battle for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>THE PRAYING SPIRIT</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Praying at every time in spirit. v. 18</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This spirit does not refer to the Holy Spirit but to the spirit formed out of two spirits.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>We need to pray in this spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Dear brothers and sisters, these eight items are the work of the Spirit of life in us as the seal and pledge.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Through these eight items of work, He coordinates us into the Body and builds us into the church.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>When you turn to your spirit, you have the light and revelation concerning the church, the revelation concerning the mystery of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>You are also one with others.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Since you are one, you are built and your spirit is strengthened.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>When you are strengthened, you are renewed; when you are renewed, you are filled; when you are filled, you are equipped to fight.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is in the fighting spirit that you pray.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>You pray for the spread of God's kingdom and for the revelation of the mystery of God.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>This is the church life and the Body life.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The Body life is in this Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>This is the Spirit in Ephesians.</S>
