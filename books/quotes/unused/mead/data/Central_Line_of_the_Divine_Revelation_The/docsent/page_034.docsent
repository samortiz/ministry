   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>D. The Completion of God's Creation of Man</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>in the View of His Dispensing</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>according to His Economy</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Needing the Entire Bible to Fully Define</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Why does the record of God's creation of the heavens, the earth, the plants, the animals, man, and billions of items occupy only two chapters in the book of Genesis?</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>I do not believe that God wrote these two chapters merely to tell us of the creation.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Actually, these two chapters do not speak mainly of the creation; rather, they unveil to us the divine dispensing according to the divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Although we cannot find the expressions the divine dispensing and the divine economy in these chapters, the fact is there.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The intention of Genesis 1 and 2 is to show us how God made a preparation for His upcoming dispensing according to His divine economy.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Genesis 1 and 2 are a record of how God created man with the intention that He would be man's life and content.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>After His creation of man, God brought man into a garden and placed him in front of two trees.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>One tree, the tree of life, was good for food 2:9 , but the other tree, the tree of the knowledge of good and evil, issued in death v. 17 . God warned man not to eat of the tree of the knowledge of good and evil.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>God Himself was embodied in the tree of life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The tree of life is mentioned again in the book of Revelation 2:7; 22:2 .</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In Revelation 2:7 the Lord Jesus gave a promise to the overcomers, saying, "To him who overcomes, to him I will give to eat of the tree of life, which is in the Paradise of God."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Then in Revelation 22:1-2 a river of water of life proceeds out of the throne of God and of the Lamb.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Along the flow of the river and on the two sides of the river, a vine tree grows.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>The tree bears fruit every month for the supply of all the inhabitants in the New Jerusalem, and the river flows to quench their thirst.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The New Jerusalem itself is constituted of the Triune God as gold, pearl, and precious stones 21:18-21 .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The mentioning of these precious materials, the river, and the tree of life corresponds to the record in Genesis 2.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In Genesis the precious materials are there but are not built up.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>But at the end of the Bible, these materials have all been built into one building, the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The New Jerusalem is the composition of these three materials to be the bride 19:7-8; 21:2; 22:17 , the real Eve, to match the real man, the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>At that time, God will have a counterpart with which to spend His eternity for His rest, joy, and satisfaction.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The entire Bible is a record of the divine dispensing of the processed Triune God into the transformed tripartite man, issuing in an entity that is not only a combination but also a blending, a mingling, of the Triune God with the tripartite man.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This entity satisfies God and makes Him happy, and at the same time, it causes man to rest in God and be satisfied and happy with Him.</S>
