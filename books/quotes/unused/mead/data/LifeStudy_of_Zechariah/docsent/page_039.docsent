   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Concerning the Victory of the Jewish</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Maccabean Heroes over Antiochus Epiphanes</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The prophecy in verses 11 through 17 of Zechariah 9 concerns the victory of the Jewish Maccabean heroes over Antiochus Epiphanes, the king of Syria 175-163 B.C. , the kingdom of the north, prophesied by Daniel in his book in 8:9-14, 23-25 and 11:28-35.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Antiochus Epiphanes was the first type of the coming Antichrist, who will do the evil things prophesied in Daniel 8:10-13, 23-25; 11:30-32a.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God raised up the Maccabean heroes to encounter Antiochus and to defeat him.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Daniel 11:32b says, "The people who know their God will show strength and take action."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>I believe that Maccabeus and his followers knew that this word applied to themselves and that they were encouraged by it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>They showed strength and took action against Antiochus Epiphanes.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Zechariah 9:13 says, "I will bend Judah for Myself, / And I will fill a bow with Ephraim; / And I will stir up your sons, O Zion, / Against your sons, O Javan; / And I will make you like a warrior's sword."</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>The word Javan here refers to Greece and is the key to understanding verses 11 through 17.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The sons of Greece are Antiochus and those with him, and the sons of Zion are the Maccabeans.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Thus, verse 13 is saying that at the time of Antiochus Epiphanes God would stir up His sons, the sons of Zion, against the sons of Greece.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Verses 14 and 15 go on to say, "And Jehovah will appear above them, / And His arrow will go forth like lightning; / And the Lord Jehovah will blow the trumpet, / And He will go in the whirlwinds of the south.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>/ Jehovah of hosts will defend them; / And they will devour and trample the sling stones.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>/ And they will drink; they will be noisy as if with wine; / And they will be filled like a sacrificial basin, / Like the corners of the altar."</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>In these verses them and they refer to the Maccabeans, who were to be defended by God.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Verse 16 continues, "Jehovah their God will save them in that day as the flock of His people, / For they will be like the stones of a crown, sparkling in His land."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"That day" refers to December 25, 161 B.C.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Verse 17 concludes, "For how great is their goodness, and how great their beauty!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>/ Grain will make the young men flourish, / And new wine, the virgins."</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This is a word spoken in congratulations to the Maccabeans for their victory.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The first part of this chapter is concerned with Alexander the Great, and the last part, with Antiochus Epiphanes.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>A word concerning Christ, who is wrapped up with human history, is inserted in verses 9 and 10.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Christ, of course, did not come during the time of the Grecian Empire but during the time of the Roman Empire.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As we will see in a later message, Zechariah also prophesied concerning the Roman Empire.</S>
