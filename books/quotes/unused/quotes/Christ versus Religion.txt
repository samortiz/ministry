God did not send the angel Gabriel to the family of the priests; God did not send Gabriel to someone praying in the temple in Jerusalem
If we look into the record carefully with the light of the Holy Spirit, we see that this was accomplished in a hidden way
He was not found in Jerusalem, He was not found in the temple, neither was He found by any priest or any holy people
We are all familiar with the account of the heavenly star appearing in a pagan country to people with no Bible and no genuine religion
We know also how those heathen wise men exercised their natural mind, concluding that the King of the Jews should be born in Jerusalem
You remember that when they came to Jerusalem, King Herod called the scribes and the Pharisees, those who had the knowledge of the Bible
They all gave Herod the proper and exact quotation, Micah chapter 5, verse 2, telling that Christ would be born in Bethlehem
People talk about the Bible and have the knowledge concerning Christ, but rarely do you find one who really cares for Christ
Matthew chapter 3 relates to us the principle of the introducing of Christ this also is absolutely outside of religion
He was born a priest, but he would not remain in the priesthood, he would not stay in the temple or even in the city of Jerusalem
The blanket was cultured, treated, and made with human hands, but the camel's hair worn by John the Baptist was absolutely raw
John did not teach people about religion he called on them to repent to change their mind to change their concept about religion and culture
Some were fishing in the sea, others were mending their nets they were unlearned people, but they followed Jesus
You see the birth of Christ the finding of Christ the introducing of Christ and the following of Christ were entirely apart from religion
Hallelujah Jesus came He not only came in His birth but He also came of age He came forth to minister He presented Himself to the people
Then came to Him the disciples of John, saying, why do we and the Pharisees fast oft, but thy disciples fast not'?
They saw Him feasting not with the high priests, the Pharisees, or the scribes, but with the sinners, the publicans
Both John's disciples and the Pharisees came to Jesus, and the new-timers in religion took the lead to rebuke Him
The Lord Jesus said nothing according to the teachings according to the Scriptures according to any quotation from the Bible in the old way
Suppose that when He replied to the disciples of John and the Pharisees in such a way John, James, and Peter suddenly shouted, Hallelujah!
We not only have the presence of the Almighty God, but the presence of the Bridegroom, the most pleasant person
The Bible not only tells us that the Lord Jesus is our Bridegroom, but that as such a Person to us we are four kinds of people to Him
In these words of His we see several things: firstly, that He is the Bridegroom, and secondly, that the Bridegroom is with us
To be religious means to have all the scriptural things, all the fundamental things, and yet lack the presence of the Lord
The third implication of these words of the Lord is that He as the Bridegroom is with us that we may enjoy Him
The Lord did not stop here: He went on to amplify His statement by using some parables with much practical implication
All His words are exceedingly simple everyone is familiar with a new cloth, a new garment, new wine, and a new wineskin
You see, to enjoy the Lord's presence we need certain qualifications; we need to be in a certain condition, in a certain situation
The father undoubtedly loved him deeply, but the son's condition was utterly unbefitting to the presence of the father
The father immediately told his servant to take the best robe and put it on him, thus to fit him for his presence
You must remember the context of these verses in Matthew 9: the Lord Jesus was eating with sinners and publicans
When the prodigal son was clothed with the best robe, he could immediately stand in the presence of his honored father
We as sinners and publicans do need to be clothed in a new garment that we may be worthy of the Bridegroom's presence
In order to enjoy Christ in these four ways we need something outwardly to qualify us and something inwardly to satisfy us
Now the Lord Jesus is not only the Bridegroom, but also the new garment to qualify us and the new wine to satisfy us
Christ is not only our new garment and new wine, but, being increased, He is also our new wineskin to contain the wine
He is our outward qualification He is our inward satisfaction and He is in a corporate way the church the Body capable of holding the wine
He is the Bridegroom, the new garment, the new wine, and also the corporate vessel to contain what we enjoy of Him
From His incarnation to His crucifixion there were thirty-three and a half years in which He passed through all the human living
Before His crucifixion, He was a piece of new cloth, but after His resurrection He became a new garment for us to put on
Christ, by being crucified, buried and resurrected, was made a life-giving 'pneuma,' a life-giving breath, the living air
He became incarnated, He lived on this earth, He was crucified and accomplished redemption, and He was resurrected
For in one Spirit were we all baptized into one body whether Jews or Gentiles whether bond or free and were all made to drink of one Spirit
It says firstly that we were all baptized in the Holy Spirit, and secondly that we were all made to drink of the one Spirit
To baptize my finger in this water is one thing: the finger is clothed with the water; the water is put upon the finger
Many Christians today confuse these two aspects, thinking that the baptism in the Spirit is equivalent to drinking of the Spirit
In this finished garment we have redemption, resurrection power, and all the divine elements of the divine Person
Now, by being baptized into Him, Christ becomes our outward qualification, and now, by drinking of Him, He becomes our inward satisfaction
We are clothed with Him as the Spirit of power and we drink of Him as the Spirit of life that we may enjoy Him as our Bridegroom
Christ is in you, Christ is in me, Christ is in him, and Christ is in every one of us we all have Christ within
The Christ in you is one with the Christ in me, and the Christ in us is one with the Christ in all other Christians
Some say that whether we have the church or not, whether we are in the church or not, we can still enjoy Christ
For the first two weeks he did pray and read his Bible, but after that the Bible reading stopped, though he still prayed a little
It is true, some amount of blood is in my little finger, but this little finger is just a part of the entire body
We must also realize that the wineskin is not only the container of the wine, but also the means for us to drink the wine
According to this concept everyone must enter the 'sanctuary' quietly and reverently and seat himself properly and in order
Suppose there are a number of Christians meeting together, everyone dressed nicely, everyone behaving quietly and properly
Many so called Christian churches today are just like that: everyone in them is nicely, properly and beautifully 'buried'
Some indeed have received the new wine, but they have attempted to bring the new wine back and pour it into the old wineskin
Some dear ones have come to appreciate the pray-reading; so they have tried to bring the pray-reading into their old meetings
We need Christ as the new garment, we need Christ as the new wine, and we also need Christ in a corporate way as the new wineskin
They believe that Christ is God, that Christ is our Redeemer, that Christ died on the cross for our sins and was resurrected
They have realized something concerning the inner life; so they take Christ not only as the new garment, but also as the new wine
Neither is the Lord only recovering the inner life this He accomplished through Madame Guyon, Andrew Murray, Jessie Penn-Lewis, etc
We have Christ as our righteousness, we have Christ as our life, and we have Christ in a corporate way as our church life
Following chapter 11, in the first verse of chapter 12, we again encounter the same three words, 'At that time'
Following this passage at the beginning of chapter 12, we come to verse 38, which opens with a little word, 'Then'
Jesus came both eating and drinking, and the religious people said, 'Look, this man seems to know nothing but eating and drinking'
On the other hand, if any rule is made saying that we must eat and drink large amounts of food and liquid, this also becomes a heavy burden
It was 'at that time,' after speaking in this way, that Jesus went with His disciples on the sabbath day through the cornfields
The disciples saw all the ears of corn, and because they were hungry they all began to help themselves and eat
The Pharisees, however, saw it and said, 'Behold, thy disciples do that which it is not lawful to do upon the sabbath'
Consider the situation the Lord Jesus took the hungry ones out of the synagogue perhaps out of something religious and into the cornfield
There was indeed such a regulation in the law, saying that only the priests were allowed to eat the shewbread in the house of God
The Lord Jesus in so speaking was telling the Pharisees, 'I am the real David, and my disciples are the real followers of the real David
Whatever they do, even if it is against the law, it is not actually against the law because they are in the Temple
After the first sabbath was over, the Lord Jesus went into the synagogue on the sabbath day, where there was a man with a withered hand
The religious people then took the opportunity to trouble the Lord Jesus again by asking, 'Is it lawful to heal on the sabbath day'?
Was a case of a man with a withered hand not a case of a whole man, but a case of a member of the body, a hand
On this sabbath the Lord indicated that He would do anything for the healing of His members, for the rescue of His fallen sheep
In the second sabbath the lesson is that the Lord Jesus does not care for anything but His withered members, His fallen sheep
They were all so deeply moved to testify by this act that they were burying all their oldness, and by doing this they became alive
Not only did this occur in Los Angeles, but following this in many places, many dead ones through this kind of burial came alive
Today if you go to the socalled Christian churches in America on Sunday morning it is rather difficult to find many under the age of thirty
Hallelujah, the hungry disciples were fed, and the man with the withered hand found rest, the sheep fallen into the pit was rescued
If today the Lord would perform a miracle in our midst, we would all be excited that is wholly a natural and religious reaction
The Lord said that He would not do any miracle for them; He just referred them to the sign of the prophet Jonah
The natural and religious thought of man is that if we could perform miracles we could certainly build a good church
The only thing that can build us into the church is not a miracle, but resurrected life, the resurrected Christ
Even Paul, near the end of his journey, expressed his longing desire to know Christ and the power of His resurrection , not the miracles
It was at the end of the last century and the beginning of this century that the Pentecostal experience was also recovered
It is difficult to trace its origin: some say it began with the Welsh revival in 1903 and 1904; others say it began earlier than this
What we mean is that the Lord is going on to accomplish a further recovery, a recovery of Christ, the Spirit, and the church life
If today we are only stressing and emphasizing the matter of justification by faith, we are four or five hundred years behind the time
If we are so preoccupied with the age of the Pentecostal movement, we are at least three quarters of a century out of date
Please do not misunderstand and think that we are opposing justification by faith or any other items of the Lord's past recovery
We are just for the church, the all-inclusive church, not the denominations, not the sects founded on particular items
The age of the Lord's recovery today is the age of Christ as life, as the life-giving Spirit, and the church life
If you pray-read these three portions carefully, you will see that they give you three steps of one experience
The second step, therefore, of experiencing something of Christ is further and deeper than revelation it is vision
In those days there was the holy place, the holy temple, the holy city, and the holy land a four-fold holy sphere
Jesus did not bring His disciples into the city of Caesarea Philippi; He was there just in the parts, the area, the district of that place
If you still remain in religion in any of the denominations or socalled Christian churches it is difficult for you to receive any revelation
The Lord Jesus took His disciples out of the priesthood, out of the temple, out of the city, and out of the Holy Land
In all these years since we have seen something of the church, we cannot avoid telling others what we have seen
Some indeed have not only neglected the Body, but even opposed the Body and would stop others from speaking of it
In other words, the Lord Jesus was saying to Peter, 'It is wonderful that you have seen Christ, but you must see something more
Henceforth you are no more an individualistic individual; you are just a stone built into the house, a member built into the Body
You are not qualified; but as a stone in the building, a member in the Body, you are positioned to have the keys of the kingdom of heaven'
It is indeed sad today that in Christianity so many refer to Matthew 16, but they always speak of Christ, not the church
To see something of the Lord, we all need to take advantage of the turn of time; we must not miss the opportunity
The disciples saw the revelation, but they must wait a week, for another turn in time, before they could see something more
It was there, not only apart from the religious circle, but also apart from earthly things, that Jesus became another Jesus
When Jesus was transfigured, while Peter, James and John were beholding Him, two wonderful persons entered upon the scene Moses and Elijah
Peter in the revelation was absolutely right and crystal clear, but now Peter in the vision is utterly frustrated
God was saying, 'Do not say that you will build one tabernacle for Moses and one for Elijah there is only One in My sight
Because Jesus had come, there was no more Moses and no more Elijah as far as what they represented was concerned
What was more serious he forgot two things he forgot Christ and he also forgot the church he forgot the Head and he also forgot the Body
On the mountain, in the vision, Peter behaved in an outrageously individualistic way, forgetting all the other members
Peter forgot the revelation of Christ as the Head, and he also forgot the revelation of the church, including John and James
God is sovereign: He can send some very wonderful persons like Moses and Elijah, and He can also send some troublesome people
In the last portion of these two chapters we read, 'And when they were come to Capernaum, they that received tribute money came to Peter'
The publicans were the tax gatherers for the Roman Empire, for those who invaded Judea, occupied it and put a heavy tax upon it
God's people, the children of Israel, were told in Exodus 30:11-16 that every male among them must pay a half shekel to maintain God's house
God sent Moses and Elijah to appear in their vision, but following the vision, in the application, God sent another kind of person
If you do mean business with the Lord, after you have seen the vision be careful and be ready God will send you some tribute men
All the rest of the disciples were in the house with Jesus, and Peter came out to meet and deal with the tribute men
He forgot the revelation, he forgot the vision; he forgot Christ and the church, and He forgot the Head and the Body
What he said was absolutely against his revelation, absolutely contrary to his vision and the heavenly voice, 'Hear ye Him'
It is not a matter of being scriptural or fundamental, but a matter of Christ, a matter of the living, up-to-date, present Jesus
If you go to the sixty-six books of the Bible, there is not one verse to tell you how long your skirts should be
Do not say yes or no, do not say anything, do not make any decisions until you have come to the Head and also to the Body
Moses could only command; Moses could never afford anything in the way of supply for the people to fulfill his commandments
When He says, 'Go fishing,' then we must go fishing; when He says, 'Cast the hook into the water,' just cast it into the water
We have seen that when Moses and Elijah appeared with the Lord on the mount, God, speaking from heaven, obviated them
Many so-called fundamentalists today just care for reading the Bible; they do not care for the presence of Christ
Brothers and sisters, you must see no man save Jesus only; you must hear Him, not the law nor the prophets, neither Moses nor Elijah
Go along with whatever He predicts, and you will have the ability to keep His commandments and fulfill what He says
Today's recovery is the recovery of the living presence of the living Christ, not the scriptural teachings, nor this or that
May the Lord show us more and more and bring us through not only the revelation and the vision, but also the application
In Matthew chapters 21 and 22 we have the fulfillment of a type in the Old Testament with which many are not familiar
Before the Passover, according to God's commandment, the people of Israel must prepare a lamb at least four days in advance
The first ones to examine Jesus were those with authority in religion and authority in the community the chief priests and the elders
The second examination was made by the Pharisees, the strongest religious party, together with the Herodians, a political party
They did not believe in the Word of God nor in the power of God; they did not believe in resurrection, or in angels or spirit
What they really mean, and sometimes they say it in so many words, is this: 'From what seminary has he graduated?
What they meant was that if they endorsed John, they would have to receive Jesus, because John testified of Him and was His forerunner
Following this answer of the Lord to the chief priests and elders of the people, He proceeded to speak to them in parables
The Lord Jesus told them that in rejecting such a One, they were rejecting the very cornerstone for God's building
We all must feast at the wedding feast of Jesus that we may grow, and as we grow we will become proper material for the building
All the faithful, patriotic Jews in ancient times were against this they would never pay one penny if they could help it
They came to Jesus asking whether or not tribute should be paid to Caesar, but they had Roman money, not Jesus
According to the regulation of Moses law if a man die having no children his brother shall marry his wife and raise up seed unto his brother
Now there were with us seven brethren, and the first married and died, and having no seed left his wife unto his brother
Jesus was saying to them All these people Abraham Isaac and Jacob are dead if they are not resurrected then God would be a God of the dead
You Sadducees know the letter of this title the God of Abraham, the God of Isaac, and the God of Jacob but you do not know the reality in it
One of them, a lawyer, asked Him a question, trying Him: 'Teacher, which is the great commandment in the law'?
The first related to religion, the second to politics, the third to the faith, and the fourth to scriptural interpretation
Now while the Pharisees were gathered together, Jesus asked them a question, saying, What think ye of the Christ?
If so, we must turn ourselves from our mind to the spirit and learn like David to be in spirit to call Him Lord
The ascension of the Lord Jesus is the climax of all that He is, of all that He has done, and of all that He will do
One day He with all He has accomplished and gained will be in eternity as God and the Lamb with the New Jerusalem
As the ascended One, He includes everything from eternity past to His ascension and everything from His ascension to eternity in the future
Forget about all these religious problems, politics, the so-called faith, and even the interpretation of the Bible
You talk so much regarding how to interpret and understand the Bible, but Jesus would ask, 'What think ye of Christ'?
We need to forget our kind of faith the sound, fundamental, scriptural faith if it is a faith without a living touch with the living Christ
Thank the Lord that in these recent years so many have been rescued and delivered to a certain extent from religion
By all these verses we may see that the Lord Jesus has nothing in His mind and heart but Himself and His church
Now, after His ascension, He is here as the Spirit of life and power, moving on this earth to establish His churches
Why is it then that in the local churches we are dealing with the Bible all the time, we are pray-reading the Bible continually?
From the time He came to be baptized by John the Baptist He cared nothing for it nor was He ever careful concerning religious sensibilities
He did it purposely to impress His disciples never to care for anything religious, but only for Christ and His church
It is not a long chapter indeed it is rather short but its entire record is full of the contrast between Christ and religion
We must be clear that the resurrection had occurred already, but before the women went there it was not discovered
In the end of chapter 27 we read that the chief priests and Pharisees sealed the grave with a stone and set a watch
We read that there was a great earthquake and an angel of the Lord descended from heaven and rolled away the stone
Undoubtedly the Lord intended to impress His disciples that everything related to Him is separate from the old religion
Later in the chapter we see that it was not a synagogue to which they were directed in Galilee, but to a mountain in the open air
At that time all the religious people either gathered in the temple at Jerusalem or in the synagogues in the various other cities
Religious people always consider that we are at most the servants of the Lord, or to use a more intimate term, the children of the Lord
Behold, some of the guard came into the city, and told unto the chief priests all the things that were come to pass
To our amazement, instead of a three-week conference, there is a three-verse conference, and it is recorded in Matthew 28:18-20
Regardless of what teaching or message we use, as long as people are put into the triune God, that is quite sufficient
He said to them in effect, 'My authority is better than money, and my presence is better than all kinds of creeds and regulations'
They speak about the second matter: 'We know that you don't have any organization, but you must have some kind of regulations and rules
These two things are in the religious mind all the time how to raise money, and how to formulate a creed in writing
We dont have financial resources and we dont have creeds but we have something much better the Lords authority and the Lords very presence
We must say again that in this new age with the Lord's new move, there is no need of any kind of organization, system, or regulation
Many times they will come to the leading brothers asking for directions and fellowship as to how they must meet
It is really difficult for people to believe that there has ever been such a group of believers meeting in this way on this earth
Christians today believe that the Lord Jesus was resurrected, and they also believe that He ascended to heaven
Whenever we face a difficulty, we need only turn to Him saying, 'O Lord Jesus, this is not our problem, this is Your problem
How much we have been poisoned with religious concepts, and how many religious concepts there are still in our blood!
The record of all four Gospels from the beginning to the end shows how Christ is versus religion and religion is always against Christ
They have two main things against Him: 1) He broke the sabbath, and 2) He made Himself equal to God, to their God
These were not sinful people; neither were they what we think of as worldly people; they were religious, and they were for God
On the first sabbath, Christ took care of Himself as the Head; on the second sabbath, He took care of the withered members of His Body
Jesus said in effect, 'You Jews regard the sabbath so highly, but I, Jesus, am purposely doing something to break it'
When Jesus saw him lying, and knew that he had been now a long time in that case, He saith unto him, wouldst thou be made whole'?
Jesus went on to say, 'As the Father raiseth the dead and giveth them life, even so the Son also giveth life to whom He will'
The way He imparts life to us is not by any religion, forms, doctrines, teachings, or regulations, but by His living Word
The Lord Jesus was saying, 'Ye search and research the scriptures, because ye think that in them ye have eternal life'
It is entirely possible to search and even research the Scriptures, yet never to touch the living Christ as the life-giving Spirit
In John 4, the most precious verse is verse 24: 'God is Spirit: and they that worship Him must worship in spirit and truth'
In these two chapters of John, two spirits are mentioned: one with a capital letter 'S' and the other with a small letter 's'
We know that the one with the capital letter is the Holy Spirit, and the one with the small letter refers to our human spirit
He told them that if they did not believe the written Word of the Bible, how could they believe the living Word out of His mouth?
We are told that it is by the Spirit that we touch Christ, and then we see that it also through the Word that we contact Him
Eventually, the Lord Jesus reveals to us that these two are one: the Word is the Spirit, and the Spirit is the Word
When the Word enters our spirit it becomes the Spirit, and when the Spirit is expressed from our mouth it becomes the Word
When the outer end gets into our spirit it becomes the Spirit, and when the inner end proceeds from our mouth, it becomes the Word
The proper organ for us to use the keys of the Spirit and the Word is not our mentality or our will, but our human spirit
Now, if we would contact this Christ, we need to exercise our spirit to pray-read the Word or simply to call on His name
We must not care so much for the black and white letters that is tantamount to concentrating on the wooden stick of the match
Praise the Lord, we have the keys, we have the organ, and we have the way to contact and enjoy such a wonderful Christ
It is interesting that in the record of Matthew there are two sabbaths, and in the record of John there are another two sabbaths
The Lord Jesus clearly implies in the following chapter of John, chapter 10, that this very man was one who was in the 'fold'
The fold, you know, is the place where the flock is kept at night, in the wintertime, or when a storm is raging
When he receives his sight, he will swiftly leave the fold for the pasture, for the sunshine, for the fresh air
Eventually, hallelujah, the Lord Jesus came and opened our eyes, and we were cast out of the fold by the religious people into the pasture
If you read the Gospel of John carefully, you will see that people frequently came to Jesus with questions requiring a yes or no answer
She said, 'Our fathers worshipped in this mountain: and ye say, that in Jerusalem is the place where men ought to worship'
The Lord Jesus told His disciples, 'Neither did this man sin, nor his parents: but that the works of God should be made manifest in him'
The Lord Jesus in performing this sign acted not in a miraculous way, but in an uncultured, unrefined way, totally contrary to human concept
Who would ever think that the Lord Jesus would use spittle mingled with dirt, of all things, as a kind of ointment to anoint a blind man
We must realize that in that day to be cast out of the Jewish synagogue and religion meant that there was no way to live
He said that all who came before Him were thieves and robbers; He is the only one who came to impart life to the sheep
Many dear saints, when reading that Jesus is the door in John chapter 10, conceive of Jesus as the door to heaven
There are so many denominations, sects, and Christian groups all these in the eyes of the Lord are today's folds
Today we are no more in the pit, no more in the religious porches, no more in the fold, but on the pasture which is Christ Himself
It did not start with Him or from Him, but from the religious people, the disciples of John and of the Pharisees
We are not organized together; we are flocked together by the Lord Jesus as the door, the Shepherd, and the pasture
We are not united by any charters or creeds made by human hands; we are united by the Lord Jesus as the door, the Shepherd, and the pasture
Chapter 10 of the Gospel of John must be put together with chapter 9: these are not two separate records, but one record in two chapters
The Lord Jesus healed him and recovered his sight by emitting something out of His mouth and mingling it with the clay
Without chapter 10, it is rather difficult to understand the significance of the Lord's act in mingling the spittle with the clay
Chapter 10 interprets it by showing that in so doing He imparted life something out from Him entered into the blind man and mingled with him
When we come to chapter 20 of this Gospel, we see how the Lord Jesus after His resurrection came to His disciples and breathed into them
The Lord in the last days of this age is recovering this; He is recovering Christ as life with the proper church life
God the Father can point to the enemy and say Satan look even on this earth in this dark age My Son Jesus Christ could have such a Body
The Lord is doing this, not in a human way, but in a divine way; not in an organized way, but by the transforming Spirit
As a man He might have religious associations and relationships, but as God with us He is absolutely outside of religion
Another matter peculiar to Matthew and John is that neither mentioned anything regarding the ascension of the Lord Jesus
Read the last two chapters of John there is no such thing; the Lord Jesus never made any arrangements or left any schedule
Praise the Lord, though they had no schedule, no arrangements, no appointments, they had the resurrected Christ, the living Lord Jesus
If Peter should call an urgent meeting and gather all the disciples to discuss their problems with Jesus, that would fit our concept
Again there was no prayer, no singing, no Bible reading, no God bless you, no 'I'm standing with you' no such thing
According to our present realization there was no prayer there, no singing of hymns, no Bible reading, no message, and no dismissal
Could you believe that professional fishers fishing all night in a sea which they knew so well could catch nothing?
Whether you are conscious or unconscious of His presence, He is always with you, and whatever you need He knows
Whenever a work is started for the Lord, the natural, religious concept is always to consider the funds on hand
If we have the resurrected Christ with us, we may forget about all religious schedules and also about our living
The responsible ones knew nothing about schedules or budgets and did not calculate what they were going to spend beforehand
In effect, the Lord was saying to Peter, 'A few days ago you said that though all others should deny me, you would not
We must simply love Him with our heart and follow Him by exercising our spirit; then we will be nourished by Him
Don't think that you need to know the Bible, go to seminary or Bible college, and receive a religious education
The degradation of the church began with the loss of this 'I have this against thee, that thou didst leave thy first love'
We love Him with all our heart, and we follow Him by our spirit; then whatever we do is just to feed His lambs
All we need to do is simply to love Him with all our hearts and follow Him by our spirit, thus obtaining the nourishment to feed others
To baptize people into the name of the Father and of the Son and of the Holy Spirit means to baptize them into the reality of the triune God
The Lord Jesus says in effect that since the kingdom of heaven is among us, He will be with us all the days until the completion of this age
Then we have the assurance that this Jesus, this God-man, this Redeemer, this risen One, this all-inclusive Christ, is with us
The Lord commissioned you in Matthew 28, but you couldn't stand the test, you gave up His commission to care for your living
To make a living is all right but as a child of God a disciple of Jesus commissioned with His authority we should not be here for our living
In Matthew on the mountaintop, the disciples were waiting for the Lord, but here on the seashore the Lord Jesus was waiting for them
Whether they were in a building or in the open air whether they were on the mountaintop or at the seashore wherever they were He was there
If you are one who is for the world, you must be concerned for your living, you must put your trust in your employment
On the other hand, we must consider them the lambs, the little ones, the weaker ones in the kingdom, who need feeding
If this matter of feeding is not accomplished in a full way, the increase will be a heavy burden to the church life
Regardless, He met with them to fulfill His purpose, and in both places they enjoyed His presence in a full way
On the seashore He challenged Peter to love Him, charged Him to feed His lambs and sheep, and bade him follow Him to the end of his life
He was fully and thoroughly one with all His disciples to the extent that His disciples just became Jesus Christ
We all must realize that the sufferings, journeys, and speeches of these disciples were absolutely the acts of Jesus
They proceeded fearlessly to preach and to praise Christ, and thus brought upon themselves swift arrest and imprisonment
When the chief priests received this report, we read that they were 'much perplexed concerning them whereunto this would grow'
Eventually, outwardly speaking, they gained the victory because they stoned Stephen to death; but inwardly they lost the case
He went to the chief priest, requesting authority to bind and imprison all those in Damascus who called on this Name
The Lord said to Saul in so many words, 'Saul, regardless of how much you are persecuting Me, you are still under My rule
Suddenly, in a kind of trance, he saw something descend from the heavens which was diametrically opposed to his religious concept
It is quite probable, however, that he was praying for all the Jews to be converted, for all his countrymen to be saved
By reading the context of these verses carefully, we see the probability of every creature in that great sheet being unclean
You have realized by now that we must get rid of religion, but have you realized that to get rid of religion is not so easy?
On the mount of transfiguration he had only two brothers, James and John; but this time he took six brothers with him
Peter was on the alert: he realized that if he went to the Gentiles he would certainly be put on the spot by all his Jewish brothers
The Lord brought only two to the mountaintop with Peter, but now Peter took three times that many with him to visit Cornelius
Peter was outside of religion, but religion was still in him, and not only in him, but in so many Jewish believers
They had seen how the Lord Jesus did everything outside of religion, but there was still an amount of religion within them
I'm still concerned that within so many of us, after seeing so clearly the nature of religion, there is still a certain amount of religion
In so short a time after chapters 2, 3, 4 and 5 of Acts, we see how so many Jewish believers returned to religion
At the conference in Jerusalem, by the mercy of the Lord, the decision was made not to perpetuate such teaching
The situation today is exactly the same: we do have a religious background, and almost every one of us has come out of it
When he had saluted them, he rehearsed one by one the things which God had wrought among the Gentiles through his ministry
Their advice in effect was this We have decided not to ask the Gentile believers to keep the law but we the Jews still need to keep the law
Regardless of how much we try to excuse our brother Paul, the Lord Jesus would not agree, and the Lord would not honor what he did
The Lord couldn't take it any longer; He allowed some people to interfere with the ritual before it was accomplished
Praise the Lord, since that time we can find no record in history of any elders giving the brothers such advice
If today you say that you do not like loud shouting and praising in the meetings, you have no ground in the Bible, not one word
You may say you cannot contact the Gentiles, but the Lord says that He has chosen them before the foundation of the world
The Lord Jesus, when He was on earth, acted so clearly before His disciples, showing them by example His attitude toward religion
We have seen from the record of the Gospels how the Lord Jesus began to be opposed to religion in the matter of fasting
In Acts 10, He broke the law of eating unclean things, and in so doing broke the law of separation from the Gentile world
When the news reached the leading one of that group, an old brother with extensive knowledge of the Bible, he was exceedingly surprised
Today we must serve the living Lord with newness in the spirit, not according to the oldness of the written Bible
Now we serve not according to the oldness of the written code, the written Bible, but according to the newness of the spirit
Today our service, our work, and even our life must be altogether in the spirit, not merely according to the letters of the written Bible
We may have the right quotation from the written code, yet miss Christ, just as the Pharisees and scribes in ancient times
In the first chapter of the letter to the Galatians, Paul gives a little history of his background in religion
When you are strong for tradition, you are strong for religion, and the outcome is that you will persecute the church
Be careful; even as a member of the Body of Christ, if you are religious, you will spontaneously persecute the church
On the ground' means to keep the oneness, and 'in the spirit' simply means that we must do everything in spirit
We believe furthermore that there is one Head and one Body one Shepherd one flock one Christ one Church and one local church for one city
Paul tells us in Galatians 1 how much he was involved in religion and how zealously he persecuted the church of God
If you are just for Christ, be ready to suffer persecution, not from the unbelievers, but from the Christians, the religious people
When the Jewish brothers came down from Jerusalem, Peter separated himself from the Gentiles, pretending not to associate with them
Peter knew that he should not keep that kind of religion, but he feared the Jewish brothers, and not only he, but also Barnabas
You may shout, 'Hallelujah, praise the Lord,' but when you are in the presence of certain brothers, you will not shout
In Jerusalem, in that intense atmosphere of religion, Paul was subdued and went along with the religious situation in order to save trouble
If you ever consider being mild and compromising a bit, be sure that you are about to involve yourself in many difficulties
We must see that all these doctrines or teachings concerning the exact time of the Lord's return have nothing to do with our faith
Now suppose that after being saved one goes to a Presbyterian seminary another to a Methodist college and the third to a Baptist university
You see, while we are being fed with something of Christ, we are growing spontaneously and cannot be divided over doctrine
Paul was so concerned 'that we may be no longer children, tossed to and fro and carried about with every wind of doctrine'
The children are those who are carried about by the doctrines; they are carried away from Christ the Head and the church the Body
When all the doctrines are gone, when all the 'toys' have been dropped, we are brought back to Christ and the church
They may be sound, scriptural, and fundamental, but they are carrying people away from Christ and the church, from the Head and the Body
By the growth of life, praise the Lord, they were brought back to arrive at the unity of the faith and the knowledge of the Son of God
We must drop all the doctrines, give up all the religion, and only hold the reality, which is Christ and the church, His expression
He had high attainments in religion; yet what things were gain to him in religion, those he counted loss for Christ
We must realize that if we hold on to our experiences in the past, however good they may be, they will become today's religion to us
Eventually Paul tells us that in the new man, in the church life, there is no Greek or Jew, no barbarian or Scythian
In the Gospels we see a Christ who is gentle, tender, and mild; but in the Revelation we see a Christ whom we may describe as fierce
In the Gospels, the Apostle could lean upon Christ's breast, but in the Revelation, when John saw Christ, he immediately fell to the earth
The Christ we see in Revelation is One whose eyes are as a flame of fire and whose voice is as the sound of many waters
In this Book of Revelation we have religion, but this religion differs from the religion in the Gospels, the Acts, and the Epistles
In the seven epistles of the second and third chapters of this book we get a clear view of the new religion, Christianity
The first step towards this new religion of Christianity is an abundance of work for Christ without an intimate and personal love to Him
You may never have considered that an abundance of labor for the Lord could be something that would form a religion
What is wrong with going to the mission field, teaching the Bible, helping people to know the Lord and be saved?
You may labor diligently and accomplish much for the Lord without an intimate and personal love for the Lord Himself
We must work, we must labor for the Lord, but we must be careful that our work is balanced with intimate and personal love for our dear Lord
The word translated 'first' in reference to first love is the same as that translated 'best' in reference to the best robe
In other words, without the first and best love, they would be finished as far as the testimony of the Lord Jesus was concerned
It is by loving Him in the first and best way that we have the shining power, the light, the lampstand, and the testimony
If we love the Lord intimately personally and in the first and best way we will have the light and we will have the enjoyment of the life
We must learn not to imitate Jesus, not merely to follow Jesus, but to eat Jesus as the tree of life in the church as the paradise of God
Many of us can testify that we do have such a foretaste today of Christ as the tree of life in the church life as the paradise of God
The first and greatest impression we must give people in the local churches is not how much we work for Christ, but how much we love Him
The danger in Christianity has been and still is that of paying too much attention to the work without the love
In the church, all those who work for the Lord should do so not for money, but out of an intimate and burning love for the Lord Himself
If any of us ever conceive of hiring someone in the church to accomplish some task, we are taking the second step in forming a new religion
It has been developed to such an extent in some places that if any of the laity should pray, he would certainly be condemned
If you come to the meeting and just sit there waiting for others to function, you are still under the influence of the Nicolaitans
All the brothers and sisters must be functioning, praying, testifying, shouting and praising brothers and sisters
If you come to the meeting as a layman, waiting for others to function, you put the Lord Jesus to an open shame
He is fierce against religion, against unreality, against anything that would distract His people from Himself
In Thyatira we see a woman called Jezebel, a woman who has gathered many teachings and calls herself a prophetess
It was she who brought so many pagan teachings and practices into the church and mixed them with the teachings concerning Christ
Idol worship is an insult to the person of God; fornication is a damage to humanity; and division is a mutilation of the Body of Christ
In the church at Thyatira, the woman Jezebel brought in her evil doctrine and caused much idol worship and fornication
If you take the first step, you will take the second and then eventually the third until you topple headlong into Babylon
According to the Word of the Lord it was only a short time after Sardis appeared that she became a kind of dead religion
From church history we see how the church through Martin Luther experienced a certain amount of recovery, but everything soon became dead
If you speak about justification by faith, it is good and right, but if you speak in a dead way, that also is a religion
You will find that with nearly all of them the principle is the same they hold the teachings, but there is no life
Everything we teach everything we minister everything we stand for must be full of life otherwise we are perpetuating the history of Sardis
Even the matter of the church life and the church ground can be held merely as a right doctrine, stripped of life and impact
At the beginning, that was truly the church at Philadelphia, but it did not last long They soon degraded into Laodicea
It is that Laodicea has everything; they are indeed rich yet, in the same principle as Sardis, just in doctrine
They thought they had everything, they thought they had need of nothing, but the Lord Jesus said that they were neither cold nor hot
In the seven epistles of these two chapters of Revelation we see that something of religion has been mixed with something of the Lord
All the religious things will be gathered together and consummated to the full in the great Babylon of chapters 17 and 18
On the other hand, the consummate development of all the Lord's separating work throughout the centuries is the Bride, the New Jerusalem
In the last part of this the twentieth century, the Lord is recovering the local churches as a full separation from the great Babylon
In chapter 18 we hear the Lord's call, 'Come forth, my people, out of her, that ye have no fellowship with her sins'
It is not a small matter to be separated from everything religious and to be in the local churches as a preparation for the Bride
There is nothing religious, nothing old, nothing dead; everything is spoken by the living Spirit in a new and living way
The messages here are quite unlike those of the Old Testament prophets who prophesied, 'Yea, my people, thus saith the Lord
There are no apostles, no prophets, no evangelists, no shepherds or pastors here; neither are there any elders or deacons
The angels are the stars, and the stars are related to the seven Spirits just as the seven churches are also related to the seven Spirits
We must realize that by the time of the Book of Revelation the age has been fully changed from religion to the Spirit
In a certain place recently two young people were much helped by the fellowship of other young people in the meetings of the local church
The following day these two, a boy and a girl, stood together with their mother in the meeting to declare, 'Down with Satan'!
He came to the front and told the whole congregation how grieved he was with such an exclamation, 'Down with Satan'!
If you went to the wilderness and saw John wearing the camel's hair and eating the locusts and wild honey, you would say, 'What is this?
All the religious people were well aware of the prophecies concerning the birth of Christ and were expecting the Messiah to be born
When the Lord Jesus came forth at the age of thirty for His ministry, none of the religious ones recognized Him
Many New Testament saints hold the Bible in their hands today, knowing and proclaiming the second coming of the Lord
It seems easier for the young people to rid themselves of religious blood, but this is just the outward appearance
In the local churches of the Epistles, there are firstly the elders or bishops, and then the deacons and so forth
Paul wrote to the churches as 'an apostle of Christ Jesus' , but John in the Revelation speaks of himself as 'your brother'
Because in the Lord's economy in this book and in this age all these things position, title, qualification are over
It matters not how long you have been in the work of the Lord, but it matters very much whether you are shining or not
Deliver us from the positions, deliver us from the titles, deliver us from the qualifications, and deliver us from the criticisms'
The last book of the Bible is the last word of the Lord, and the last word of any person is the most important
We thank the Lord for all His previous recoveries throughout the past generations without them we could never have reached the present age
The Apostle John in this book is absolutely new, absolutely different from the John in the Gospel and in the three Epistles
Oh, how we need to overcome the old doctrines, the old experiences, and all the things we have seen in the past!
You may say that Los Angeles is Los Angeles and every church must have its own separate and distinct expression
Let us look to the Lord desperately that we all may be fully taken out of religion and religion fully taken out of us
What is observed by our visible perception is the meal; it is more difficult to discern that leaven is hidden within it
We must see that within this meal, hidden to the natural sense, is a certain element called leaven inserted by an evil woman
In the entire Bible, both in the Old Testament and in the New, leaven is set forth as a corrupting, damaging, evil element
In fact, some even of those who are reading this book are taking sides deeply within them with the leavened meal
The one who took the leaven and hid it in the meal in Matthew 13 is the great harlot, the mother of all harlots, in Revelation 17
On the one hand there is the gold, the precious stones, and the pearls these are the things which God is after
On the other hand, there are the blasphemies, the abominations, and the filthiness these are the things God detests
We need a discerning and transparent vision, not just to judge according to appearance, but to see to the core
Apparently in Christendom there is gold, precious stones, and pearls, but actually there are blasphemies, abominations, and filthiness
We may not be involved with her directly, but it is exceedingly easy to be involved with some of her daughters
The wall is built firstly with jasper, which signifies the appearance of God , and then with all manner of precious stones
Some dear Christians are rather simple and think that as long as other Christians are in Babylon it is all right
You must see that there are two sides in the Bible, the mixture side and the pure side, the Babylon side and the New Jerusalem side
You may see the gold, the precious stones, and the pearls in Babylon, but you can never find the flow of the living water there
Eventually and ultimately Christ will be manifested and expressed in the New Jerusalem as everything for eternity
As the presence of God, He is the temple within the Holy City , in which the saints as the priests worship and serve God
He will be magnified there with all His riches to the uttermost as everything in the ultimate manifestation of God's economy
