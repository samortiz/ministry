   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE HEALING OF A BLIND BEGGAR</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>All the disciples, represented by the two sons of thunder, needed the healing of their blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Near Jericho they met a blind beggar, Bartimaeus.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Mark 10:47 says, And hearing that it was Jesus the Nazarene, he began to cry out and to say, Son of David, Jesus, have mercy on me!</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many rebuked him and told him to be quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But he cried out even more, saying, Son of David, have mercy on me! v. 48 .</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Then Jesus stopped and said, Call him.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>In spite of the rebuking of many, the Slave-Savior charged them to call the pitiful blind beggar.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This again expressed His humanity in His pity toward miserable people.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Bartimaeus then threw away his garment, leaped up, and came to Jesus v. 50 .</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The Lord Jesus then said to him, What do you want Me to do for you? v. 51 . What open love toward the needy one! This love expressed the Slave-Savior s humanity to an unimaginable extent.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The blind man said to the Lord, Rabboni, that I may recover my sight!</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord said to him, Go, your faith has healed you v. 52 . Immediately Bartimaeus recovered his sight and followed the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>If we carefully read 10:35-52, we shall see that the two sons of thunder were one with the blind beggar.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Our basis for saying this is that the Lord asked the same question both of James and John and of Bartimaeus: What do you want Me to do for you? vv.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>36, 51 .</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>In the Lord s understanding, the two sons of thunder were the same as the poor beggar.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>However, there was a significant difference: James and John begged in a wrong way, but Bartimaeus begged in a right way.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>James and John asked to sit on the Lord s right and left, but Bartimaeus asked to receive his sight.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We believe that, in spiritual significance, the healing of the blindness of Bartimaeus was also a healing of the blindness of James, John, and the other disciples.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The Lord did not give them a position at His right and left, but He certainly was willing to heal their blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>He knew that He had come to be the light of the world.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Therefore, He was willing to give sight to the blind.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>THROWING AWAY THE GARMENT OF POSITION</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Mark 10:50, speaking of blind Bartimaeus, says, And throwing away his garment, he leaped up and came to Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>A person throwing away his garment signifies that this one does not care for position.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>A garment or uniform signifies position.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>For example, a uniform worn by a policeman or a nurse signifies position.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When a policeman is off duty, he will lay aside his uniform.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Bartimaeus did not care for any position.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>His only desire was to have sight.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Therefore, when he heard that Jesus called him, he immediately cast aside his garment and went to the Lord to receive sight.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In principle, all of us in the church life need to throw away our garments.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you regard the eldership as a position, you need to throw away the garment of the eldership.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Likewise, those who want to be leaders in the service groups should cast away the garment of leadership.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>We should throw away all the garments of position and care only to receive spiritual sight.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Like Bartimaeus, we all need sight.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We may say that the Lord Jesus died so that those who believe in Him may receive their sight.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>By dying with Him we pass out of our blindness and into the Lord s resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Then in resurrection we receive our sight.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>RECEIVING OUR SIGHT IN RESURRECTION</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>The healing at the end of chapter ten is the last miracle of healing recorded in the Gospel of Mark.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The final miracle of healing was the healing of blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>I am very grateful to the Lord that He has fully healed my blindness.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Hallelujah, I have received my sight!</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I do not care for any garment, for any position.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>After the healing of blindness in Mark 10, the Lord s followers were ready to enter into His death.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>By entering with Him into death, they would also be able to enter into His resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>We need to be impressed with the fact that the Lord Jesus was not the only one who would pass through death in order to be in resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All of His followers would go with Him into death in order to enter into His resurrection and ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>In chapter sixteen of Mark we have a glorious scene in which all the Lord s followers enter into His ascension through His death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>By the end of chapter ten, the disciples were qualified and prepared to go through death and resurrection so that they could be with the Lord in His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In your spiritual experience have you come to the end of chapter ten?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Have you received a final healing, the healing of your blindness?</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Praise the Lord that we can say that our blindness has been healed!</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Hallelujah, we have no more blindness, darkness, sin, and death!</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Now we are ready to go with the Slave-Savior into death, through His resurrection, and into His ascension.</S>
