   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Many people move around in the course of their lifetime, but the Lord Jesus lived thirty-three and a half years altogether in the small area of Palestine.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This is very meaningful.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>To live in a place under a certain kind of environment makes you a particular person.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>After living on this earth for thirty-three and a half years, God became very particular.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>He lived with a lot of odd people.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>These odd people were around Him all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>He talked to these odd people and dealt with them.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Peter and the other disciples were odd.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Are we not odd also?</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I believe that all these odd people helped to "remodel" Him.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We cannot deny that after living on earth for thirty-three and a half years, He spontaneously added another element to Himself, the element of human living.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For God to live on earth among the odd people for thirty-three and a half years is a great thing.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>After passing through human living, He entered into death.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Death was a short part of the long tunnel of His process, but He accomplished much in this short part.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He solved our problem of sin Heb 9:26 and sins v. 28 . He terminated our old man Rom 6:6 , our flesh Gal 5:24 , the entire old creation Col 1:20 , Satan Heb 2:14 , the world John 12:31 , and the ordinances Eph 2:15 . There are many ordinances in the human race.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The Japanese, the Chinese, and the Americans all have their particular ordinances, or customs.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>These ordinances are forms or ways of living and worship.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>These customs also include the accent of the language.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even today many dear brothers who are from Texas cannot avoid speaking in a Texan southern accent.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The first time I heard "y'all" was when I made my first visit to Texas.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Moreover, in the United States, people in the South refer to those in the North as Yankees.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>This is an example of the ordinances among people.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Of course, today by the Lord's grace and also by the Lord's sovereignty, we all are here in the United States.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>The United States is famous as a "melting pot."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>But many people have been here for years, and the United States has not been successful in "melting" them.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Thank the Lord that among us in the recovery the feeling of discrimination does not exist that much.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But I dare not to say that this is entirely gone from among us.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>It is a shame for there to be any distinction of culture or race among us.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Paul told us in Colossians 3:10-11 that there is no room for any natural person in the new man, but Christ is all and in all.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>There are no Japanese, Americans, Greeks, Jews, Chinese, etc., in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Paul's word in Colossians 3 means that there is no room for any natural person to exist in the new man.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>But we may still keep some rooms in our thinking for Yankees, for Texans, for Japanese, or for Chinese.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Even today among us we may categorize the brothers.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In our mind there are many rooms for natural persons.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We may think one brother is a Texan, another brother is a Yankee, another brother is from the Midwest, and another brother is from the Northwest.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Other brothers to us are Californians, and in California there are the northern Californians, from the Bay Area, and the southern Californians.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This attitude and feeling to categorize the brothers is wrong.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>According to Ephesians 2:15, Christ has abolished all the ordinances through His death.</S>
