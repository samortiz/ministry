   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>E. Recreation Meeting One's Need</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Fifth, our recreation must meet our need.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We have a certain recreation because we have a certain need.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>We should not have any recreation without having the need for it.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Many brothers are so busy that they think they have no need for recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Other brothers have nothing to do all day long, and they think about recreation all the time.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Those who have a genuine need for diversion do not feel the need for it, while those who do not need diversion think that they have a need for it.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We do not need to tell everyone about the need for diversion.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We do not like to grant license to God's children.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>We do not want to give a blanket endorsement for any kind of recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>What we want to tell God's children is to judge for themselves whether they have such a need.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The principle is always to live for the Lord and to recognize that all our time is His.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Life is measured by time.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Life is not time itself, but it is measured by time.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A man cannot waste his time on everything and then find that he has no more time for God.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>To waste an hour of time is to waste an hour of one's life.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>To waste two hours of time is to waste two hours of one's life.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If you take an hour for recreation, that hour must eventually be of benefit to you in your work.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>If there is not the need for this hour, the recreation is a waste of your time.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>To waste your time is to waste your life.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>If we can spend an hour more for the Lord, we can reap one more hour of results.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we spend an hour on recreation, and this recreation can enhance our work, it is an investment, not a waste.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Hence, diversion is based on need.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It can also be based on the advice of elderly brothers or the instruction of doctors.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Sometimes an elderly brother may advise you to take some diversion because he can sense a buildup of tension within you.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>At other times a doctor may advise you against certain activities and warn you of dire consequences.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Recreation is to take care of need, not for the sake of play.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>I have my own kinds of recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>I participate in recreation not for the sake of recreation, but for the sake of enhancing my work.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>A busy person may need recreation, or he may not need it.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The general rule is that recreation is for those who have the need for it.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Those who do not need it are not obligated to have it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We realize that young people need recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We can see the need for our teen-agers to have recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Some parents do not have such a need, so they think that their children have no such need.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>However, depriving children of recreational activity will drive them down the road to evil.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We have to recognize their need even though we may not be altogether certain of our own need.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The principle is that recreation is for those who need it; those who do not need it can live without it.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>F. Recreation Matching One's Fitness</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Sixth, all recreation must match a person's fitness.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The first consideration in recreation is physical fitness.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Everyone must remember this while engaging in recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>We expect our body to reap profit, not suffer loss through our recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>If our body suffers through our recreation, we are violating the principle of recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>We are here to improve our body.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>If a certain kind of recreation damages our body, something is wrong with that recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Suppose a man is sick with tuberculosis.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>If he wants to have any recreation at all, his recreation must not bring his health down.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A sister who has a heart disease may need some recreation at times, but her recreation must serve to relieve her fatigue rather than to aggravate her heart disease.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When I was young, I had a friend who was a very evil person.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>After he believed in the Lord, he turned and became a wonderful person.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Before his conversion, he loved basketball.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>After he was saved, he felt a little guilty about playing it.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He decided to play it one more time and then quit.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>After that last game, he vomited blood and died.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>This was not recreation.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>It did not match his physical fitness at all.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>He thought that he could preach the gospel after he had enjoyed his game.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>He did not expect that he would die after that game.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>What a waste that was!</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>I hope we will realize that our body is the Lord's. Our diversion is for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Our not having a diversion is also for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We do not do anything for ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we engage in some kind of diversion, we must remember that it is for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Also, if we forfeit diversion, we must remember that we are doing it for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Whether or not one has diversion, the principle is to not do harm to the body.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>It is always unwise to harm the body.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>It is not only wrong to harm our body with improper activities, but also wrong to harm our body with proper activities.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The bodies of God's children do not belong to them.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>In any kind of diversion, we must ask ourselves whether or not it will profit our body.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Do it only if it is profitable.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Do not do it just because you like to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Suppose a sister has a heart disease.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>If she sees a brother playing ball in the field and wants to join him, she may end up with more trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>It is not wrong for the brother to be in the ball game, but it is wrong for the sister who has the heart disease to be in the game.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We hope that God's children will pay attention to this matter.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Everything we do should be done for the service of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>Even if we have a little diversion today, our goal in having it should be to better serve the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>I do not want to see believers dying at a young age.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>I have always hoped that there would be more elderly brothers and sisters in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Please remember that being elderly in the world is different from being elderly in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>In the world, the older one becomes, the more senile he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The younger ones are the more progressive ones.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>However, in the church the older one becomes, the more advanced he becomes.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>In the world the younger ones cannot move forward unless the older ones die first, because the older ones are always a hindrance to the younger ones.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>However, it does not happen this way in the church.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>The older one becomes, the fresher he becomes, and the higher and deeper are the things he touches.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>A church is poor and defeated if it does not have any elderly brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>I do not like to see brothers and sisters in the church passing away at a young age through the neglect of their own body.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Instead of becoming a supply to the church, the lessons that the Lord has given them are wasted.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>The church should not incur such a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>It cannot afford such a loss.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>When we have sports and games, we cannot strive to break records as if we were athletes.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Professional athletes are not motivated by the games themselves but by the desire to break records.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>We must play it as a game and play it to the benefit our body.</S>
