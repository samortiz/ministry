   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>THE NEGATIVE ASPECT</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>OF THE GIVING OF THE LAW</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In bringing the people to the mountain of God, it was not God s intention to give them commandments to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>When God first spoke to the people in chapter nineteen, there was no thunder, darkness, or sound of a trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There at the mountain the atmosphere was pleasant and quiet.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Verse 4 says, Ye have seen what I did unto the Egyptians, and how I bare you on eagles wings, and brought you unto myself.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The people had walked out of Egypt, through the wilderness, and to the mountain of God.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But from God s point of view, He had carried them to Himself on the wings of an eagle.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>After likening Himself to a great eagle, the Lord went on to say that the people would be His personal possession and that they would be unto Him a kingdom of priests, and a holy nation vv.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>5-6, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>. Is this a word of law or a word of grace?</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is a word of grace, not of law.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Actually it is a word of love expressed by grace.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A. To Bring the Children of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>into a Position to Know Themselves</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>If the people had been enlightened concerning God and themselves, they would have said, Lord, we thank You for Your mercy.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>We are not worthy of it.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We don t deserve it.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>All we can do is thank You for it.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>However, when the children of Israel heard the words God spoke to Moses, they answered, All that Jehovah has spoken we will do v. 8, lit.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>. This indicates that the people did not have a heart for God and that they did not know Him.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Even Aaron was at least somewhat ignorant.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Otherwise, how could he have been persuaded to make a golden calf for the people to worship?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The response of the people and Aaron s deed in shaping a calf out of gold prove that the children of Israel did not know God and that they did not truly have a heart for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>B. To Put the Children of Israel</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>to a Test</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Because the people knew neither God nor themselves, God changed His attitude toward them and also caused a change in the atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He told Moses that He would come in a thick cloud v. 9 . He also charged the people to sanctify themselves, to wash their clothes, and to observe the boundary.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Exodus 19:12 says, Take heed to yourselves, that ye go not up into the mount, or touch the border of it: whosoever toucheth the mount shall be surely put to death.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>In verse 16 we see how dreadful and terrifying the atmosphere became: And it came to pass on the third day in the morning, that there were thunders and lightnings, and a thick cloud upon the mount, and the voice of the trumpet exceeding loud; so that all the people that was in the camp trembled.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It was not God s original intention to create such a terrifying atmosphere.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>But only Moses knew what God s intention was.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>He realized that God did not intend to make the people afraid.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This was the reason he said to the people in 20:20, Fear not: for God is come to prove you.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Moses knew that God was proving the people, that He was testing them.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He realized that it was not God s intention to have thunder, darkness, lightning, and the terrifying blast of a trumpet.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Among all the children of Israel, Moses was the only one who knew the desire of God s heart.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>At the word of the Lord, Moses went up to the top of the mountain and stayed there with God for a period of forty days.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Years ago, I thought these forty days were meant to be a trial to the children of Israel.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Yes, these days were a time of testing to them.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>However, these forty days were not primarily intended to be a test of the children of Israel; they were designed to give Moses an opportunity to be infused with God.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>The longer I stayed by that coal stove in my house, the more heat I absorbed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Likewise, the longer Moses stayed with God on the mountaintop, the more he was infused with God.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Concerning most of these forty days, there is no record that either Moses or God did anything.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>It was not until the end of these days that God began to speak to Moses.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>God was happy simply to have one of His people stay with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Would you have been content to stay with God those forty days and not do anything?</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Suppose a brother would invite you to his living room and ask you to sit down with him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Then for twelve hours he simply sits with you and looks at you, not saying a word.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Would you be able to endure this?</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>I do not think anyone, especially one of a quick disposition, could tolerate such a situation.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But Moses stayed on the mountain with God for forty days without eating, drinking, or sleeping.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>There was no indication that any kind of business was transacted between him and God.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The only thing that happened was that Moses received a divine transfusion.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>God s very element was infused into him.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Certain of my small grandchildren are fond of visiting my wife and me.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>One child in particular comes over mainly for the purpose of getting something good to eat.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>However, when she has another source for these things, we do not see very much of her.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But when she has no other source, she comes to see us.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>But she does not stay very long.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>It is not her intention to stay with us; it is to get something from us and then to go her way.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We, on the contrary, enjoy her presence and would like her to stay with us longer.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The behavior of my grandchild is a picture of the way we often relate to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We come to Him not simply to be with Him, but to get something good from Him.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>As soon as we receive it, we go away.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Thus, we may pray to the Lord and even meet with Him in fellowship in order to get something from Him that is a benefit to us.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>God knows how difficult it is for us to stay in His presence without doing anything.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>In sympathy with our weakness, He may tell us to do certain things.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>But it is not His intention to require us to do things.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>It is to keep us with Him that we may be infused with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>But according to our natural concept, we consider that God is placing demands on us and making requirements of us.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>Oh, that we might see that God s intention is to infuse us with what He is and with what He has!</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>In order for this infusion to take place, we need to be with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>After spending forty days on the mountaintop being infused with God, Moses was shining with God s light.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>Notice that God did not ask Moses to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Rather, He transfused Himself into Moses until Moses began to shine with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This was the reason that when Moses came down from the mountain, the skin of his face was shining.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>The highest profession on earth is to spend time being infused with God that we may shine forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>This is far greater than doing anything for God.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>If we would shine forth God, we need to spend time with Him, not to do something but to have Him transfused into our being.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>My burden in this message is to point out that God s intention in bringing the children of Israel out of Egypt was to lead them to His mountain so that He could infuse them with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>He wanted them to be infused with Him even as that burning bush had been infused.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>The bush which burned without being consumed had been fully infused with God.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>God was in the bush and spoke from the midst of it.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>God wanted all His people to be brought to the place where He could infuse them with Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Therefore, He told them that He brought them on eagles wings and that He would make them His personal treasure and a kingdom of priests.</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>When the people heard those words, they should have bowed down and confessed, O God, we cannot make ourselves a treasure for You.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>We are not precious.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>There is no way for us to become Your personal treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>If this had been their attitude, God would have said, I will make you a personal treasure to Me. Stay with Me, and I will infuse you with what I am.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>Eventually, you all will become precious in My sight.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>Imagine what the situation would have been like if all two million Israelites had been infused with God and had begun to shine forth God.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Their glory might have been like the glory of the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>God s people did not understand His intention.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>Their concept was that they should do certain things for God.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>Furthermore, they wanted to do these things and thought they were able to do them.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>They had seen what God had done for them, and now they wanted to do something for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>This concept caused them to fall.</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>Have you ever asked yourself why God gave us such a big book as the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>In the hundreds of chapters in the Bible, there are a great many commandments for us to keep.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>Certain of these commandments are repeated again and again.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>The reason for this repetition is that God s desire is to keep us with Him through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>In order to stay with God, we need to stay in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>However, often when we come to the Bible, we have no consciousness of coming to God.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>Moreover, when we dwell with the Bible, we do not have the sense that we are staying with God.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>How we need a change of concept!</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Whenever we come to the Bible, we should come to God and stay with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>Yes, the Bible shows us many things God wants us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>But all these things are secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>The primary matter is that through the Word we stay with God and are infused with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Unfortunately, we are easily distracted from Him by other things.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>There are not many like Moses who stay with God according to the desire of His heart.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Once again, I wish to point out that during those forty days Moses was with God on the mountaintop, he did not do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>It was not God s intention for Moses to do certain things; it was for him to be infused with God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>In the Bible we can find out what God says to us and what He wants us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>However, the primary matter is that we stay with God through the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>But this is not easy for us to do.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>Our tendency is to come to the Bible simply to find out what it says about different things.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>As we read the Word, we may decide that we shall do whatever the Bible says.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>Little do we realize that in making such a decision we actually set God aside.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Those who come to the Word in this way are not truly blessed by God.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>If we would be blessed by Him through the Word, we need to see that both what God wants us to do and what He says to us are secondary.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>What is primary is that we stay with God to be infused with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='125' RSNT='1' SNO='125'>The reason God speaks to us and tells us to do certain things is that He wants us to be with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='126' RSNT='1' SNO='126'>Why do we need to read the Bible?</S>
   <S PAR='127' RSNT='1' SNO='127'>When I was young, I was told that as a Christian I must read the Bible to find out what God wants me to do.</S>
   <S PAR='128' RSNT='1' SNO='128'>Yes, by reading the Bible we find out a great many things God wants us to do, perhaps hundreds or even thousands of things.</S>
   <S PAR='129' RSNT='1' SNO='129'>The problem is that we are not able to do them.</S>
   <S PAR='130' RSNT='1' SNO='130'>Nevertheless, in our natural concept, we desire to find out what God wants us to do and then set out to do it.</S>
   <S PAR='131' RSNT='1' SNO='131'>Our attitude is that we must do and want to do whatever God speaks.</S>
   <S PAR='132' RSNT='1' SNO='132'>Therefore, we make up our mind to do these things and in practice we set God aside.</S>
   <S PAR='133' RSNT='1' SNO='133'>Instead of making up our mind to do what the Bible says, we should say, Lord, I love You, I love Your word, and I love everything You say to me.</S>
   <S PAR='134' RSNT='1' SNO='134'>If we speak this way to the Lord, He will answer, Very good!</S>
   <S PAR='135' RSNT='1' SNO='135'>Now you need to know that whatever I want you to do, I will do for you and through you.</S>
   <S PAR='136' RSNT='1' SNO='136'>In a song about saying amen to the Word of God, there is a line I appreciate very much:</S>
   <S PAR='137' RSNT='1' SNO='137'>What I never could do God is doing in me.</S>
   <S PAR='138' RSNT='1' SNO='138'>By saying Amen to His Word.</S>
   <S PAR='139' RSNT='1' SNO='139'>Hymns, #1219</S>
   <S PAR='140' RSNT='1' SNO='140'>What we are not able to do ourselves God desires to do in us.</S>
   <S PAR='141' RSNT='1' SNO='141'>For example, a husband should say to the Lord, Lord, You ask me to love my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='142' RSNT='1' SNO='142'>Lord, I love You, but I must tell You that I cannot love my wife.</S>
   <S PAR='143' RSNT='1' SNO='143'>Then the Lord will say, Right, you can t love your wife, but I will love her through you.</S>
   <S PAR='144' RSNT='1' SNO='144'>What you cannot do, I will do in you.</S>
   <S PAR='145' RSNT='1' SNO='145'>Concerning the commandments to love the brothers and to love our neighbor as ourselves, we should also say, Lord, I love You, but I must be honest with You.</S>
   <S PAR='146' RSNT='1' SNO='146'>I cannot love the brothers, and I cannot love others as myself.</S>
   <S PAR='147' RSNT='1' SNO='147'>I have many neighbors and relatives, but I simply am not able to love them.</S>
   <S PAR='148' RSNT='1' SNO='148'>Lord, I love You and I love Your Word, but I simply am not able to love them.</S>
   <S PAR='149' RSNT='1' SNO='149'>Lord, I love You and I love Your Word, but I cannot love other people.</S>
   <S PAR='150' RSNT='1' SNO='150'>Once again the Lord will tell us that what we are not able to do He will do from within us.</S>
   <S PAR='151' RSNT='1' SNO='151'>This is God s economy both in the Old Testament and in the New.</S>
