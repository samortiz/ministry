   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THE RESULTS OF DIFFERENT KINDS OF JUDGMENT Disciplinary Dealing</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We have seen that the results of the different kinds of judgments are not the same.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Certain judgments result in a disciplinary dealing.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This is true of the judgments we experience today.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Persecution, trouble, and illness are God s judgments resulting in a disciplinary dealing in this age.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Dispensational Punishment</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Other judgments result in dispensational punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Dispensational punishment refers to punishment during the thousand years, during the millennial kingdom.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The kingdom will be a dispensation.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Defeated Christians will suffer a punishment during the coming age.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>That will be a dispensational punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>According to the Gospel of Matthew, some believers will suffer during the dispensation of the kingdom in the coming age Matt 24:48-51; 25:24-30 .</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>For them, that period of time will be a time of darkness with the weeping and gnashing of teeth.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Matthew 25 clearly indicates that when the Lord Jesus comes back, the faithful servants will be rewarded and the unfaithful ones will be punished.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Some Bible teachers say that the unfaithful servants in Matthew 25 are false Christians, whereas the faithful ones are genuine Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This understanding is not logical nor correct.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>How could a false Christian be counted as a servant of the Lord?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Furthermore, how could a false Christian be raptured to appear before the judgment seat of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Instead of following the interpretation that the unfaithful servants are false Christians, we believe the pure Word of God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The Bible says that when the Lord Jesus comes back, we shall all stand before His judgment seat.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In 2 Corinthians 5:10 Paul says clearly that we all shall stand before the judgment seat of Christ to receive a reward according to what we have done.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>If we have done a faithful work, the Lord will give us a prize.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But if we have been unfaithful and have failed the Lord, He will give us some kind of punishment.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>That will be a dispensational punishment during the millennium.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Eternal Perdition</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Other judgments will result in eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>As we have seen, the judgment upon men and demons at the white throne will result in eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Therefore, we can see three kinds of results of God s governmental judgment: disciplinary dealing, dispensational punishment, and eternal perdition.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>CHRIST LIVING UNDER GOD S GOVERNMENT</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In 2:23 Peter says concerning Christ, Who being reviled, did not revile in return; suffering, He did not threaten, but kept committing all to Him who judges righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>According to the usage of the verb kept committing in Greek, all needs to be inserted here as its object, referring to all the sufferings of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>He kept committing all His insults and injuries to Him who judges righteously in His government, the righteous God, to whom He submitted Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This indicates that the Lord recognized God s government while He was living a human life on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In no other book of the New Testament are we told that the Lord Jesus lived under God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Peter is the only one who tells us of this.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In 2:23 Peter indicates that when the Lord Jesus was on earth, He was under God s government.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Because the Lord lived under God s government, He committed all His sufferings to God.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Here Peter does not speak of God as the faithful One, but as the One who judges righteously.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>The reason for this is that judging righteously is a matter of God s government.</S>
