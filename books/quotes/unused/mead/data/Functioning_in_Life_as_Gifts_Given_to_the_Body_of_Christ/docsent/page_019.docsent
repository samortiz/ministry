   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BEING TRANSFORMED INTO LIVING STONES</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>This growth by feeding on the Lord causes us to be transformed into living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Originally, we were not living stones; we were merely clay, something made of earth and dust.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>However, here it says we are living stones.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>This is due to transformation.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>God s building throughout all the Scriptures is always with stones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>God s building is never built with bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The city and tower of Babel as well as the two treasure cities of Pharaoh were built with bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>Bricks are formed of the dust, the constituent of our natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Genesis 2:7 says that we were made with dust, and 1 Corinthians 15:47 tells us that the first man, Adam, is out of the earth, earthy.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Second Corinthians 4:7 also tells us that we are the earthen vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Bricks signify something formed of the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Satan builds up his building with the human natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In God s building there are only stones, not bricks.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Therefore, we must be regenerated and have a change in nature to be no longer natural.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Second, we need to be transformed from something earthly into something spiritual.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>All our natural concepts, natural energy, and natural elements must be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>When bricks are made from clay, they are formed but not transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>To produce stones, however, the clay must be not merely formed but transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is by transformation that we have the living stones as the material for the building.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>The way to have this transformation is by feeding on Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>By feeding on Christ we have growth, and this growth causes us to be transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The more we feed on Christ, the more we grow in Him, and the more we grow in Him, the more we are transformed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>We must have neither an American concept nor a Chinese concept.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All our natural concepts must be transformed to be the spiritual, divine, and heavenly concepts.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>The natural life, the muddy life, the life of clay, has to be transformed into stone.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>GROWTH AND TRANSFORMATION</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>BEING NECESSARY FOR THE BUILDING UP</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Without growth and transformation, there is no possibility of building.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In many places I have observed that a sister may be very good, nice, humble, and sweet and have much love in the natural life.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The church may even commit significant responsibilities to her.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>After only a few weeks, however, this sister may be influenced by a number of small matters to stop coming to the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>In the same way, a brother who was so good last year may be in worldly pursuits this year.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>We may compare this goodness to a building of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The clay appears to be very solid, but if water is poured on it, the clay falls apart, and there is a hole in the building.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Anything built of clay cannot stand against water.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>However, if water is poured on a piece of marble, it only cleans the marble.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The more the water is poured on the marble, the more the marble becomes clean.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Are we marble or clay like an adobe house?</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we are marble, any kind of rain that falls on us will only cleanse us and make us more shining.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>However, if we are clay, we will be washed away.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>After only two months we will disappear from the meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>People talk much about the church life, but without growth and transformation there can be no church life.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This is why we must once again stress the need for the inner life and the growth.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Without the inner life and the growth, there is no possibility to have the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Regardless of what we build up, it will be a building of mud, clay, wood, grass, and stubble, not of stones.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>It will not be able to stand any kind of test.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The building comes from transformation and growth.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>A certain spiritual co-worker in China was arrested by the Communists and put into prison.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>The Communists were not able to accuse him of anything, so they simply asked him to say two things: that as a mere human Watchman Nee was not perfect and could be mistaken, and that the church also was not perfect and had shortcomings.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>If the brother would say this little word, he would have been released right away.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>However, he would not say it.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>The Communists then worked on his wife who, as a weaker vessel, was more or less convinced by them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>She then was brought to the prison to speak with her husband to convince him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The brother told his wife, I cannot say anything like this in order to save my life.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>If the Spirit within me leads me to say this, I will say it.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If not, I will not say it simply to save my life.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Then the Communists worked on his son to do the same thing.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>After the son s first talk with him, the brother would not listen to him, and the son was unable to do anything.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>No one could shake the brother or move him.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>Eventually his kidneys degenerated, and he died.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>This brother was strong in his spiritual character, like a piece of marble.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>He was trustworthy, and no one could change him.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>The church can be built up with this kind of material, a strong, transformed character, not one like a piece of clay.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>The real building of the church requires this kind of stone, this kind of material transformed by growth.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>How much responsibility the church can assign to certain brothers or sisters depends on how much transformation they have.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Without transformation, a person is not trustworthy.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We cannot trust in someone if his person is muddy.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Today he may be good, but tomorrow he may be gone.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The building of the church is possible only by transformation through the growth of life.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>This is why in 1 Peter 1 and 2 we have birth, growth, transformation, and the material for the building, in that order.</S>
