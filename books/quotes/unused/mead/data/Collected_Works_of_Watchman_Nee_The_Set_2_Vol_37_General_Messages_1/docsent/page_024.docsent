   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>THREE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>What is poverty?</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Poverty is not just a question of quantity but also a question of quality.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>First Corinthians 3 shows us the distinction between gold, silver, and precious stones, and the wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Second Timothy 2 shows us the distinction between the vessels of honor and the vessels of dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Such distinctions separate the poor ones from the rich ones.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Even when we have something, we still have to ask what it is that we have.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>If all we have is a pile of wood, grass, and stubble, we are still poor.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not enough for us to be a vessel; we still have to ask whether we are a wooden and earthen vessel or a gold and silver vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>It is easy to be proud when we think that we have something.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>As long as we have something, we think that we are marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Little do we know the kind of material that we have.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Poverty also means superficiality, childishness, and immaturity.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>A rich life is a mature life.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>We have to realize that there is a difference between growth and maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>A child grows year by year, but after he becomes an adult, the important matter is no longer growth; rather, it is maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>If one has only a period of growth, his life is not yet rich enough.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>There must be a period of maturity before there can be riches.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Those who take the initial period as the whole period are those who think that they have something; they are Laodiceans, and they are poor ones.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Therefore, initial experiences always spoil us from having further experiences, shallow experiences hinder us from having deep experiences, and shallow knowledge hinders us from acquiring deep knowledge.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>FOUR</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Being rich is not merely a question of having something.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>It is a question of how much one has, what he has, and to what degree he has it.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>It is not the initial experiences.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>It is not a mere understanding of doctrine or something that one claims with his mouth.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>When God opens the eyes of a person, he begins to enter the land of spiritual riches.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>One brother spent a great deal of time to study the Bible during the first year after his salvation.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>He concentrated on one subject: the Lord's second coming.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>He did a clear analysis of the things concerning the Lord's second coming, and he felt quite proud of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>One day he met a sister who was deep in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When she talked to him about the Lord's second coming, she did not analyze; her attention was on how one should prepare himself for His coming.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>On that day, he learned a lesson.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>While he was talking about the Lord's coming, here was a person who was waiting for the Lord's coming.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>The one who only talked about the Lord's coming was poor, while the sister who waited for the Lord's coming was rich.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>All those who have truly seen something before the Lord are not presumptuous and do not think that they have something.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>For example, it may take a person one, two, ten, or even twenty times of revelation before he can really see the truth in Romans 6.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The first time he sees the truth in Romans 6, he may feel that nothing more can top this experience.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He may say that he has seen it.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>But the second time he sees it, he will say, "I did not see this before."</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>This means that when the light comes, it will tear down what one originally had.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>There is a brother who knows the truth about the church very well.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Once a few people gathered together and had some light concerning the church.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>This brother said, "How interesting!</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>I never knew what the church was.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>But thank the Lord that I see it today."</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Others may think that if he did not know the church, then no one else would have known anything about the church.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But the minute he saw the light, he realized that he had nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The shining of the light is also the swallowing of the light; the greater light swallows up the lesser light.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>All light disappears under greater light.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every time a person truly sees something before the Lord, he will feel that he has never seen anything.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>This does not mean that he has actually seen nothing; he may have seen something.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But after he receives the greater light, he will not think much of what he saw before.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>On the contrary, he will realize that he had nothing.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Riches come from enlightenment.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When the light shines, we become rich.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>However, when we are enlightened, we do not have a feeling of increase but one of stripping.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>Once the light comes, all the former things are shattered, and what we originally had is torn down.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>It is true that when we are under the light, we have some increase before God.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>But on our side, we do not feel anything.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>What goes on before the Lord is one thing, and what goes on in our feeling is another thing.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>God may give us something once, twice, or three times.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>If we feel that we have increased, it proves that we have not seen anything.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>If we truly see something, we will feel as if we are newly saved and just starting out on our journey.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>It does not mean that we were not saved before this time; it means that in our feeling, we feel as if we were not saved.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>We feel empty and feel as if we never had a beginning.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>Hence, those who are rich feel that they have nothing under the light.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Our God is a rich God.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He does not wish to see His children being in poverty.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>His works are not works of wood, grass, and stubble.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>The vessels He uses are not vessels of dishonor.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>He is a rich God, and His vessels are rich vessels.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>God's riches are deep and profound; they are such that "there is no room for it" Mal 3:10 .</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>His grace is always such that there is not room enough to receive it!</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>His works in us are always such that there is not room enough to receive them.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>God does not work in a stingy way.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>He is not weak or miserly.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>This rich God can make us rich people.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>He is always giving us more and more.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Every time He gives us something, we feel as if we are receiving it for the first time.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>This may sound strange, yet this is a fact.</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>May the Lord be merciful to us, so that we truly see something before Him and so that we truly have the light.</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>The proud ones are the foolish ones, and they are always poor ones.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>May the Lord empty us so that we can enter into His riches.</S>
