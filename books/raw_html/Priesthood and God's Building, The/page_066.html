        <h2 class="head2">Turning to the Spirit through Prayer</h2>
<p>Prayer is the only way to help a person to turn to the spirit. No one can turn to the spirit without praying. Even when we are doing a small task, we must do it in the spirit. We must pray in order to turn to our spirit. Without praying, it is impossible for us to turn to our spirit. For example, if we are going to visit a brother and fellowship with him, we must turn to our spirit to pray so that we can fellowship with him. The Bible rarely speaks of doing something unceasingly, but it says that we must pray unceasingly (1 Thes. 5:17). The thought of waiting to be led to pray is a wrong concept. There is no ground for waiting if we are to pray without ceasing. Just as we breathe without ceasing, we should pray without ceasing. A saint should not say, &ldquo;I do not have the leading to pray now.&rdquo; We do not have the ground to say that we cannot pray, nor do we have an excuse to say that there is nothing to pray about. Every moment is a moment for prayer; nothing should prevent us from praying.</p>
<p>Some saints say, &ldquo;As we are learning to be priests, we need to pray, but we have run out of topics for prayer, and we often use the same words.&rdquo; Actually, there are many topics of prayer. Paul says, &ldquo;In everything give thanks&rdquo; (v. 18). This means that we should pray and give thanks in everything. If we truly understand the meaning of giving thanks in everything, everything will become a topic for prayer. Everything in our daily living can be a topic for prayer. Wherever we are, whatever we encounter, and whatever we do can be topics of prayer.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Practice of Prayer</h2>
<p>Shortly after I was saved, I was taught that in order to pray, I needed to shut the door to my room and set aside a period of time to be quiet before the Lord. This concept influenced me greatly. For quite a while I believed that I had to dedicate time and be quiet in a room by myself in order to pray. However, this concept restricted my experience of prayer too much. If God arranges our circumstances so that we can set aside some time and shut the door to pray, this is very good. However, prayer does not depend on this kind of arrangement. This is especially true in this day and age. Most of the houses in Taiwan are small, and it may not be possible for a person to find a quiet room in which to pray. Some saints have large families living in about one hundred square feet of space. If they depended upon having a quiet room in order to pray, they would not be able to pray at all.</p>
<p>I have learned many lessons, and I realize that prayer should not be limited to specific times and circumstances. On one hand, if time allows and circumstances permit, we should set aside time and pray in a quiet place, just as the Lord Jesus sometimes went up to the mountain and spent the night in prayer (Luke 6:12). On the other hand, we should also pray even in the midst of our busy schedules. Since we do not have much practice of praying at every time, the exercise of our spirit is limited and weak. If we began to pray during our busy schedules, the exercise of our spirit would be strengthened. We would also not be short of topics, because every point in our daily life can bring out a topic for prayer. For example, when a relative calls and expresses the desire to come and see us, we should look to the Lord and say, &ldquo;Lord, lead me in my speaking to him.&rdquo; Such a prayer will bring us into the exercise of our spirit. I am concerned that even the co-workers are lacking in the exercise of the spirit because they do not have a habit of praying at every time in every place.</p>
<h2 class="head2">Strengthening the Spirit by Exercising to Pray</h2>
<p>My spirit was very strong when I was in the hands of the military police during the Japanese occupation of China; it was even stronger than when I was holding a conference or conducting a training. I was in prison for thirty days, and, other than eating and sleeping, I could only pray. Although I was the primary target, six other brothers were in the prison with me because of their association with me. I was separated from the other Chinese prisoners and put in a cell with a Greek national. At that time my spirit was very strong, because I was praying at every moment, and I experienced the Lord&rsquo;s instant answer to my prayers. Even though the seven of us were not in the same jail cell, we could see one another. When a brother was taken for interrogation, I would pray continually during his interrogation. When we received any news, I would pray. I prayed for every situation that I saw, and my spirit was very strong during this time. I prayed constantly, and my prayers were very spontaneous.</p>
<p>When it was my turn to be interrogated, the interrogation would typically last for three hours, and my experience was fully according to Matthew 10:19, which says, &ldquo;When they deliver you up, do not be anxious about how or what you should speak, for it will be given to you in that hour what you should speak.&rdquo; I could not prepare any answers in advance. I could only look to the Lord and answer according to the Spirit&rsquo;s instant leading. When I was being escorted to the interrogation room, I would pray because I did not know what they would do. One time I was asked about the location of a certain brother, who had moved with the national government to an inland area. I immediately prayed and asked the Lord what I should say. If I claimed ignorance, I would surely be beaten, because they would accuse me of lying, since they already knew that the brother had moved to the inland area. I could only look to the Lord for an answer. The Japanese also knew that we financed his trip; consequently, they also asked where he got the money for the trip. Again I looked to the Lord, but just as I was about to answer, they suddenly changed subjects, dropping the matter of his location and the money. I really worshipped the Lord, seeing His instant answer to my prayer. At that time my spirit was very strong, and I did not have any opinions.</p>
<p>If we use the circumstances in our life as topics for prayer, we will not run out of topics. For example, when we come to a meeting and encounter a brother who is about to give the message, we can pray, &ldquo;O Lord, give the brother the utterance, and strengthen his spirit!&rdquo; When we see the brothers and sisters, we can pray, &ldquo;O Lord, cause every brother and every sister to have an open spirit.&rdquo; If we see a brother who has not been in the meeting for a while, we can utter a prayer, saying, &ldquo;O Lord, speak a word specifically for him tonight so that he can touch You in his spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>When we pray in this way, an answer to our prayers is a secondary matter; the primary matter is to exercise our spirit. Not long ago, I would feel tired after walking for only twenty minutes. I realized that this was because I traveled everywhere by car and would sit down as soon as I reached my destination. It was difficult to walk a long distance, because my legs lacked exercise. Today I try to walk as much as possible. The primary point concerning prayer is the need for our spirit to be exercised so that it becomes living and strong. Some brothers and sisters have not prayed for a long time, and even when they are in a dire situation, they still cannot pray. This can be likened to a person whose legs are weak because he has not exercised them through walking. Our spirit should be strengthened to the extent that we can pray a simple prayer no matter what we encounter, even if the prayer is only to ask the Lord for mercy. Even when we take the bus or cross the street, we can pray for the Lord&rsquo;s covering. In this way, our spirit will be strong, fresh, and living. This is the primary point.</p>

 	<h2>Noise Words</h2>
 	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. The search string, the Spirit &amp; who, would result in an error since who, which stands by itself, is a noise word. The following is a list of noise words:</p>
	<p>$, a, also, an, and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, being, both, but, by, came, can, did, do, each, for, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, me, might, much, my, of, on, or, our, out, over, said, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, to, too, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>

<div id="myModalRanking" class="reveal-modal">
  	<h2>Ranking</h2>
  	<p>Rank is a value from <strong>0</strong> to <strong>1000</strong> indicating how closely a match scored or ranked against the original search string. Rank values are affected by the following factors:</p>
		<ol>
            <li><span>The total number of occurrences of the original search words/phrases in a portion of a book.</span></li>
            <li><span>Content that includes the search words in close proximity to each other are ranked above those that do not. Therefore, a portion of a book that has the search words in close proximity may have a higher ranking than another portion of a book that has a higher hit count but the words are not in close proximity to one another. Therefore, we also include a search word hit count for reference.</span></li>
            <li><span>The rank values are relative to each other. Therefore, it is not possible to interpret the RANK value as a percentage or group the rank values into high/medium/low ranges. Think of rank as a method to order the results for a specific search.</span></li>

<div id="myModalScope" class="reveal-modal">
 	<h2>Search Scope</h2>
 	<h3>Include All Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option breaks out the search string into its individual words and generates all conjugations and declensions for each word in the search phrase. A search on the word, dwell, would search for dwell, dwelling, dwelling's, dwells, dwelt, and dwelled.</p>
	<p>There is no need to use ^ (inflectional search) or * (prefix search) when using the Include all word forms search scope.</p> 
	<h3>Specified Word Forms</h3>
	<p>This option searches for exact matches of the specified words or phrases used in the search string. Use of ^ (inflectional search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all conjugations and declensions for that word will be searched. Similarly, use of * (prefix search) with a particular word in the search string will broaden the search for that given word in that all words with that prefix will be searched as well.</p> 
	<h3>Note</h3>
	<p>Common words, such as "and", "is", "but", and "the", also known as noise words, are bypassed in a search. A list of all noise words is as follows:</p>
	<p>$, about, after, all, also, an,and, another, any, are, as, at, be, because, been, before, being, between, both, but, by, came, can, come, could, did, do, each, for, from, get, got, has, had, he, have, her, here, him, himself, his, how, if, in, into, is, it, like, make, many, me, might, more, most, much, must, my, never, now, of, on, only, or, other, our, out, over, said, same, see, should, since, some, still, such, take, than, that, the, their, them, then, there, these, they, this, those, through, to, too, under, up, very, was, way, we, well, were, what, where, which, while, who, with, would, you, your</p>
