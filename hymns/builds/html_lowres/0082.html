They open their mouth at me, Like a ravening and roaring lion. I am poured out like water, And all my bones are out of joint. My heart is like wax; It is melted within me. My strength is dried up like a shard, And my tongue is stuck to my jaws; You have put me in the dust of death. For dogs surround me; A company of evildoers encloses me; They pierce my hands and feet. I count all my bones; They look, they stare at me. They divide my garments to themselves, And for my clothing they cast lots.<br><b>fn 1 </b>Verses 12-18 depict in vivid detail how Christ passed through His suffering of crucifixion (cf. Mark 15:16-37). While Christ was being crucified on the cross, many fierce men, signified by mighty bulls, encompassed Him (v. 12). They opened their mouth at Him like a ravening and roaring lion (v. 13). Evil men, signified by dogs (cf. Phil. 3:2a), surrounded Him, and a congregation of evildoers enclosed Him (v. 16a-b). They pierced His hands and feet (v. 16c). They divided His garments to themselves, and for His clothing they cast lots (v. 18). They also looked, stared at Him with contempt and hatred (v. 17b). On the cross He was poured out like water (v. 14a; Isa. 53:12). All His bones were out of joint (v. 14b) because He could not hold up the weight of His body as it hung on the cross. This caused Him great agony and pain. Also, He counted all His bones (v. 17a). His heart was like wax melted within Him (v. 14c-d). His strength was dried up like a shard (v. 15a), a piece of broken pottery. His tongue was stuck to His jaws (v. 15b). God had put Him in the dust of death (v. 15c).<br>Lit., my inward parts. See note 4<sup>1</sup>, par. 2, in Exo. 27.<br>Referring to God. On one hand, man crucified the Lord Jesus; on the other hand, God killed Him. If Jesus had been killed only by man, He would have been merely a martyr and not our Redeemer. But God judged Him and put Him into death for our redemption (Isa. 53:10a). All the sin of the world was laid on Christ as the Lamb of God (Isa. 53:6b; 1 Pet. 2:24a; John 1:29). On the cross He died a vicarious death for us (2 Cor. 5:21; 1 Pet. 3:18) to redeem us from our sins, from God's judgment, and from eternal perdition (1 Cor. 15:3; John 3:16-17; 5:24).<br>Following the Septuagint and other ancient versions; the Hebrew text reads, Like a lion, my hands and feet.<br><div style='height:5px'></div>
