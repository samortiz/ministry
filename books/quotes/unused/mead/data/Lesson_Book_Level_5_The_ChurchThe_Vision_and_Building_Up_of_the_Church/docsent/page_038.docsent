   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>The Lord certainly will continue to use them to lead the churches on to maturity.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We should always love the church in our locality.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Never criticize the elders, the serving ones, or the saints.</S>
