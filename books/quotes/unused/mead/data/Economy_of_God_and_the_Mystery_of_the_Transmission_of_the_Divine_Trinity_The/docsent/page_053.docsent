   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the Service</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>In your coordination with the brothers and sisters who work with you, you should also exercise faith and not have your own choice.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>You should not say, "I prefer to coordinate and serve with Brother So-and-so."</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>I can tell you that very often the companion you choose will end up hating you.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today you love him, but he will hate you in the future.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>It is really strange that none of the companions you choose will work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Therefore, in the matter of coordination you need to learn to leave it in the Lord's hand and trust in the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>Take myself as an example.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In these many years of serving the Lord I have not chosen any particular person to be my co-worker, nor have I selected any particular one to receive my training.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I do not make my own choice as to whom I would work with, nor do I make my own choice as to whom I would train.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Throughout all these years the Lord has been arranging everything for me; I just learn to trust in Him and to exercise faith rather than struggling by myself or having my own demands, choices, inclinations, and preferences.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Of course, we should also not have any anxiety or worry, but we should believe that whenever we have a particular need, God knows about it.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>This is faith.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>THE EXERCISE AND LEARNING NEEDED FOR ENDURING SUFFERINGS</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Another thing which all God's serving ones should learn is to exercise to endure sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>This is also a most necessary item of the Christian character.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This does not mean that we should create or seek out sufferings for ourselves; rather, it means that we should learn to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What is a suffering?</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Anything that is not according to our desire is a suffering to us.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>As a northerner, I grew up eating food made from wheat and seldom ate rice.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>In the fall of 1934 I was invited to work in Ping-Yang, Wenchow, where it was impossible to buy authentic northern steamed bread, even with gold.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>At that time I had indigestion due to a serious stomach ulcer.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This kind of illness is very sensitive to the fall weather.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>After I arrived in Ping-Yang, the saints served me rice every day.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The strangest thing was that the rice that the southerners cooked was dry and hard, unlike the rice that the northerners cooked which was sticky.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Even before I ate the rice, I was scared just to look at it, and I wondered how I would be able to digest it.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>During that time I gave messages two or three times a day, in addition to service meetings.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Eventually I had indigestion due to the half-cooked rice, and my body was weakened.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>When the saints saw this, they took extra efforts to find someone to make steamed bread for me.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>At that time I had been eating steamed bread for thirty years, so the first day that I saw the smooth, shining surface of the bread that they brought me, I knew that the inside was still raw and not thoroughly leavened.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>I dared not say anything because it would have been improper to do so.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>When the saints served the bread, I just ate it.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>They said that the bread was the best local bread because it was made by the only person who knew how to make that kind of bread.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>I just had to eat it.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>This is what it means to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Brother Watchman Nee also had a similar story.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He was a southerner.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He began to labor for the Lord in 1921 around the age of twenty.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>One time he was invited to work in Hsuchow, in Anhwei Province, north of the Yangtze River.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The northerners did not have regular beds.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>They slept on brick beds warmed by a fire underneath.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>In order to provide hospitality for Brother Nee, the saints borrowed a bed which had a framework of metal strips without any bedding except a bedsheet.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>They told Brother Nee, "We borrowed this bed especially for you."</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Thus, Brother Nee slept on a bed of metal strips, something he had never before experienced.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>When we go forth to work for the Lord, we have to learn to commit ourselves to the circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>We cannot expect the circumstances to always be accommodating to us and working for us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>This is impossible.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Some of you will go to different towns and villages for propagation.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>You do not know what kind of circumstances you will be in, what kind of things you will encounter, and how much financial support you will receive.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Everything is an unknown.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Therefore, you need to live by faith and learn to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>You should arm yourselves with a mind to suffer so that you can be a good soldier of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Peter also exhorted us to follow the Lord with the mind of Christ, a mind to suffer 1 Pet 4:1 .</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>When a real soldier goes to fight at the frontline, the environment is beyond his control.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Therefore, he has to get ready in ordinary times by exercising to endure sufferings.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>We said earlier that anything that is not according to our desire is a suffering.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>For example, we may be afraid that others will snore, yet it may happen that the one who sleeps on the same bunk bed with us snores terribly.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We should not say that we cannot take it.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Instead, we have to exercise.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>If we have such a mind, it will take us only a week's exercise to be able to fall asleep.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If we do not pay attention to a certain thing, we will not suffer because of it, but once we direct our attention to it, we will suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Hence, to learn to suffer is to learn not to be mindful of anything.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>That time while I was eating the uncooked steamed bread, I was really not able to eat it, but I remembered that the Lord had said, "And into whatever city you enter and they receive you, eat what is set before you" Luke 10:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>So I prayed to the Lord, "Lord, You said that we should eat what is set before us; now they have set before me something raw, so I should eat itraw."</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>Eventually I ate it.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Thank and praise the Lord that my stomach problem was not worsened, although I indeed became thinner.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>A month later Brother Nee had a conference in Hangchow, so I finished my work and rushed to that conference.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>When I arrived there the next day, he was speaking on the podium.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Once he saw me, he said, "Alas!</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Brother Witness is as thin as a stick!"</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Afterward in the next meeting, he shared in the message that co-workers who go out to labor for the Lord should learn to suffer hardships.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>We must learn to endure hardships if we intend to work for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should not forget that as soldiers we must be ready to go to war, not to attend a feast.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>As a result, we need to get ourselves prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>When we go out to spread the gospel, we have to prepare to go to the battlefield to suffer.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We have to pave the way for ourselves in every matter.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>We need to take care of our living quarters and find a way to prepare our meals.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>In dealing with gospel friends or brothers and sisters we must learn to relate to them on their level.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>All these things require us to exercise faith and to learn to suffer.</S>
