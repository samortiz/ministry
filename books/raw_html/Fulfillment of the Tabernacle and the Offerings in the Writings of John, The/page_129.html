<h2 class=head2>The Sign of the Son’s Going and Coming</h2><p>The second sign in chapters fourteen through seventeen is the sign of the Son’s going and coming. The Son’s going signifies a great deal, and His coming signifies even more. According to chapter fourteen, the Son’s going was to die an all-inclusive death to solve the problem of sin, to condemn the world, to destroy Satan, to release the divine life, and to draw all men unto Himself. What a great sign! The Son’s coming is His resurrection to germinate us in order to have a new creation to produce the church, which will consummate in the New Jerusalem. The sign of the Son’s coming and going is great. However, many believers understand the Son’s going to be His going to heaven and His coming to be His second advent.<h2 class=head2>The Sign of the Way, the Reality, and the Life</h2><p>The third sign is the sign of the way, the reality, and the life (14:6). As we shall see, the way is the incarnated God with all that He is and all that He has done. Following the way, we have the reality, which also is the Triune God. Whatever the Triune God has accomplished is the reality, and this reality is the way. What is the life? The life is God the Father, God the Son, and God the Spirit. In other words, life is the Triune God. We share this life in the Son, the life brings in the reality, and the reality is the way.<h2 class=head2>The Sign of the Divine Trinity</h2><p>The fourth sign is the great sign of the divine Trinity, the sign of the Father, of the Son, and of the Spirit. In these chapters there are many matters related to the Father, the Son, and the Spirit.<p>The Father, the Son, and the Spirit are one God, and this entire God is Spirit. We should not say that only God the Spirit is Spirit and that the Father and the Son are not. No, the entire Triune God is Spirit. It is foolish to say that Jesus Christ and the Father are not Spirit.<h2 class=head2>The Sign of Another Paraclete</h2><p>The fifth sign in chapters fourteen through seventeen of John’s Gospel is the sign of another Paraclete. Paraclete is an anglicized form of the Greek word parakletos. These chapters reveal that the Triune God has become a Paraclete, Helper, Advocate, Counsel. We may say that He is our divine Attorney.<h2 class=head2>The Sign of the Abode</h2><p>Another sign in these chapters is the sign of the abode. In 14:2 the Lord Jesus says, “In My Father’s house are many abodes.” In 14:23 He goes on to say, “If anyone loves Me, he will keep My word, and My Father will love him, and We will come to him and make an abode with him.” As we shall see, the abode in John 14 has nothing to do with a so-called heavenly mansion. This word “abode” is a great sign.<h2 class=head2>The Sign of the True Vine</h2><p>The seventh sign we shall consider is that of the true vine. This true vine is the universal organism of the Triune God; it is not an organization. The Son is the vine, the Father is the husbandman, and the Spirit is the testifier. All this is revealed in chapter fifteen. In this chapter we have the Father as the husbandman, the Son as the vine, and the Spirit as the One who testifies concerning the Son. This vine is the organism of the Triune God.
