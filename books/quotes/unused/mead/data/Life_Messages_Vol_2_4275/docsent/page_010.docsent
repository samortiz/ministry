   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>SPENDING TIME IN THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Spend time with this book.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Besides your ten minutes in the morning, take a few more minutes at noon, and a few more in the evening.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>As you open this book, open yourself also.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Read, understand, and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>As you pray, you are drinking the water, eating the food, and breathing the air.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>You will grow.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>The more you take Christ into you in this way, the more Christ you will have growing in you.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>You will become another person.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Do not expect quick results; growth takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It does not come about from a few concentrated days of praying and fasting and then having something fall upon you from the heavens.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Take time to water the little seed of life sown into the soil of your heart.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Not only will you grow; the church will also grow and be built up in this way.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In the church meetings Christ will come forth in the teaching, the preaching, and the testifying.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Such riches in the church life will convince and attract new ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>REGULAR GROWTH</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Do not be concerned about how much you understand of what you read.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>What matters is that you faithfully open the Word, open yourself, and read and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>This is not a once-for-all procedure.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>It is not like being born, but like breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Growth, like breathing, is continual, day by day and even minute by minute.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>You will grow by coming regularly to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Carry a pocket version of the Word with you.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Wherever you are, when you have a few minutes, open it and read a chapter or so, then pray over what you have read.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>There is little need for you to pray about your grades at school, or for your business to be successful, or for guidance when you go shopping.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Simply pray the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In this way you will receive and enjoy God Himself.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>PRAYING THE WORD</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>What do you think makes you healthy and strong?</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>It is by eating, drinking, and breathing.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>When it gets close to meal time you probably feel weak; you need to eat to regain your energy.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The same is true spiritually.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>You are weak if you have not been eating, drinking, and breathing Christ in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>In fact, it is a mercy that you are still here.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Do not try to run the race without food, drink, and air any longer!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Come to the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>Open to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Speak to Him the words you read.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>"The Word became flesh and tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Lord, thank You, You are the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>You became flesh.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Thank You that You tabernacled among us.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Among us!</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Amen.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Full of grace.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Hallelujah, grace!</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Grace and truth.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Amen, grace and truth!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Of His fullness we all received.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We all received.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We have received, Lord, and we are receiving even now.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Praise the Lord!"</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Does praying the Word in this way seem like foolishness to you?</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>I tell you, it is the way to eat, drink, and breathe Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>This is how we can live Christ, rather than living morality or ethics.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Read and pray the Word!</S>
