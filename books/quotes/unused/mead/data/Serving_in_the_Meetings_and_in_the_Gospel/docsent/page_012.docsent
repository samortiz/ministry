   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>Contacting Unbelievers</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>to Have a One-fold Increase Yearly</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>We need to take care of the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Lord comes back, He will ask us about the unbelievers.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>We cannot tell the Lord, I did not have guidance from You.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>The Lord has given us the guidance already.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>At least we have our relatives, neighbors, friends, classmates, and many persons on the street.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is one hundred percent right that every Christian has to have some part in gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>This is our duty.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Why do we not do it?</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>There are many reasons why, but one of the most important reasons is that we are not rightly related to the other brothers and sisters.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we are rightly related to our fellow members, we will have some work of gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>To have the outreach is one hundred percent right, but we should not make it a regulation.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Still, it is right to encourage the brothers and sisters to bring at least one person to the Lord yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It sounds like a small thing to bring one person to the Lord in three hundred and sixty-five days.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>However, if we now have one hundred people meeting together, and each one brings one yearly, the next year we will have two hundred people, one-fold increase.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Then the third year we will have four hundred, the fourth year eight hundred, the fifth year sixteen hundred, the sixth year thirty-two hundred, the seventh year sixty-four hundred, and the eighth year twelve thousand eight hundred.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>This is marvelous.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>I do not say this to push you; I simply say that this is our duty.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Having Effectual Contact with People</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>by Our Relatedness</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Why would we not fulfill this duty?</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>It is because we are not rightly related.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If the saints are willing to be built up, our number will increase more than one-fold yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In 1949 in Taipei, the capital of Taiwan, we had close to a thirty-fold increase in only a year, from about thirty to fifty people to over one thousand.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>This was possible because of our relatedness.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>With relatedness we are very prevailing to bring people to the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>We may have a relative who is not saved, and it may be hard for us to help him to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>However, if we are related to the brothers or sisters, we can ask all those to whom we are related to help us.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>For one or two nights we can invite our relative and all these dear brothers to our home.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Perhaps twelve persons can be there, giving testimony after testimony with much convincing speaking.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>In this way others can help us to convince our relative, and then we with the others will help to convince his neighbor.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This is the way the brothers in Taipei did their preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>They did not trust in preaching in public places.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Of course, they had much preaching in public, but they did not trust only in that.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>To preach in the way of inviting someone to come to our home for dinner is more practical than public preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>When they come, there will be twelve persons waiting for them.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>How can they resist?</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>This is what it means to be related.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>We do not preach the gospel or deal with our relatives by ourselves.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We are the members related to the whole Body.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>Sometimes after the Lord s table, a brother in Taipei would stand to say that he had a neighbor who needed to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This person may have been a worshipper of Buddha, so the brother would ask the whole church to pray for him.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Because the whole church prayed, it was easy to deal with the Buddhist.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>There is no need to go into detail about how to do this.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>I have just given some hints that we must put into practice.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>If we are first related to others and then go to serve, work, and preach, we will see the results.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Real, Practical, and Prevailing Way</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>to Preach the Gospel</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>We should first put the names of all the persons we know our relatives, neighbors, classmates, and friends on a list and check one by one whether each one has been saved.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Then we should consider each name and seek the Lord s guidance.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>The Lord will be with us and will burden us with at least two or three persons for the present time.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then we must pray for them and seek the Lord s guidance as to how to contact them.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>The Lord may lead us to send them some books or tracts or to have some kind of contact with them.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>In this way we will have the wisdom and power to move and work.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In addition, we should refer these matters to the brothers and sisters to whom we are related.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>This will be a real, practical, and prevailing preaching of the gospel, and it will be very fruitful.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>After a certain time, of course, the church may have a gospel preaching meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>Then we should bring our friends or the persons for whom we are concerned.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It will be easy for them to be saved.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>We have to encourage one another to bring at least one unbeliever to the Lord yearly.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>As a local church we have to produce something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>We should not be on one extreme nor on the other extreme.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>We need to be in the middle to be balanced.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>We know how to fellowship with the Lord, and we know how to fellowship with the saints and to be built up in the Body.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Then we function to produce something for the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>I am one hundred percent sure that we will see that this is truly effective and prevailing.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>We will see people saved through us, and not only once a year.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>The Holy Spirit will honor this, and this will stir up our spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>The more we love others, the more we love sinners for the Lord s sake, the more we will be strong in the spirit.</S>
