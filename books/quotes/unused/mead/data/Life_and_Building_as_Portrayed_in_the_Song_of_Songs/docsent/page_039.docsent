   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>LIFE TAKES TIME</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>We should not expect this to happen overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Some Christians today are urging people to fast and pray all night.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>Years ago, I did much of this.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>It was our custom during the last night of every year to stay up all night praying.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>We ate nothing that evening and spent all our time dealing with the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We confessed all our shortcomings, failures, mistakes, and offenses during the past twelve months, hoping that the next day would find us absolutely renewed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But it only lasted about three days.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>We were still the same.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>I do not mean that fasting and praying are not good.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Sometimes we need to fast and pray.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The point is that we cannot be changed overnight.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>I do not encourage nor discourage you to fast.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We must go to the mountain of death and the hill of resurrection and stay there.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Life takes time.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Many times we are desperate with the Lord, but the Lord says, "I am resting."</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We tell the Lord that we are going to fast and pray for three days, but the Lord says, "Take something to eat and go to sleep."</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Many of us have experienced this.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>We should not trust in our fasting and praying all night.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We must learn to stay at the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We must remain in the Lord's death and resurrection for a length of time.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>In the New Testament, especially in the Epistles, we cannot find many verses which support the teaching concerning fasting which we hear in today's Christianity.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>On the other hand, the Apostle Paul tells us many times how we must experience the Lord's death.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He repeatedly mentions this principle, as in Philippians 3:10: "That I may know him, and the power of his resurrection, and the fellowship of his sufferings, being made conformable unto his death."</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Paul does not speak of experiencing a portion of the Lord's death, but of staying there until we will be "made conformable unto his death."</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We will be continually tested and proved by our families, our surroundings, and our circumstances.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>All these things will test us to see if we are remaining in the Lord's death and resurrection.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>A SPONTANEOUS TURN</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>If we learn to stay in the Lord's death and resurrection, we will be transferred into His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense always transfer us to the mountaintop of Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If we take this turn, the next turn will occur spontaneously.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The Lord's death and resurrection will always carry us to His ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>We expect to stay at the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense, but we find ourselves on the mountaintop of Lebanon.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Here we are content and satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>We never want to leave.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>This is the Lord's ascension!</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>We would stay here for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>We were a crown, but we have now soared to the highest attainment, to be in the Lord's ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>But the Lord Jesus is still not satisfied.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>This is still only something for us; it is not so much for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>We have attained to the highest, but God's purpose has still not been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>This is why the Lord calls the seeking one to leave the mountain of ascension and to behold the situation on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Many are still hungry and thirsty, and the enemy is still causing much trouble.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even the Lord Himself is hungry and thirsty.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>He has nothing to enjoy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>So she must become a garden to grow all of the things which she has enjoyed of the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>All the items which she has enjoyed of the Lord must now grow out of her for the enjoyment of the Lord and for so many of the Lord's believers.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Our destination is not to stay on the mountaintop of ascension, but to come down to the valley to be a garden to grow all the things to fulfill God's eternal purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>It is through the garden that a city can be built up.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Many turning points occur in this book.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>From the crown there is a turn to the mountain of myrrh and the hill of frankincense.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>Then, spontaneously, the death and resurrection of the Lord send us to the mountaintop of ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>But then the Lord calls us to have another turn to come down and be a garden.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>To understand this book is to understand all the turning points.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>My burden is simply to point out all the turning points so that we may know the way to go.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>When we are driving in unfamiliar territory, we need a map.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>If we have a proper map, then we know where to turn in order to go on.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>All the turning points in this book show us how we can progress in our spiritual life.</S>
