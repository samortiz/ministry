   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER FIVE THE MYSTERY OF THE ANOINTING 2 Scripture Reading: Exo 30:25-31; Psa 133; 1 Pet 2:5; 1 John 2:18-20, 22-24, 27 A MUTUAL ABODE</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>The revelation in the Bible is one.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>No book ever written is more consistent, even though it is composed of sixty-six books which superficially are quite different from each other.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The central thought of the Bible is that God desires to mingle Himself with humanity, in order that man may become His dwelling place and that He may become a dwelling place to man.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>God will be the abode of man, and man will be the abode of God.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>When Moses said in Psalm 90:1, "Lord, thou hast been our dwelling place in all generations," he was declaring that the highest experience we as human beings can have is to experience God as our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Many of us do not have the thought that we can dwell in God.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>God is our Redeemer, Savior, and life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>But He also wants to be our dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Our home is where we are most comfortable.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>It is arranged the way we like it, and we have what we need there.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Over the years I have had to stay in many different places.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>My hosts have generally been most kind and thoughtful, yet even in the places where I received the most gracious hospitality, I usually felt the lack of something that was readily available at home.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>In our dwelling place we have our food, our clothing, our loved ones, and many little things that are special to us; in short, we have everything.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>To experience God as our dwelling place means to have everything in Him, or to have Him as everything to us.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Have we ever praised God for being our dwelling place?</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>We also must be a dwelling place to Him.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"Abide in Me and I in you" John 15:4 covers both of these aspects.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>"O Lord Jesus!</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>We praise You that You are our abode.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We can and we do abide in You.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Even the more, we praise You that we are Your abode.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>You can and You must abide in us!</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>If You don't abide in us, where else can You abide?</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Heaven is only Your throne and the earth Your footstool.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Without us, You have no place to dwell."</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Most Christians think of the heavens as the place where God dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>But Isaiah 66:1 tells us, "Thus saith the Lord, The heaven is my throne, and the earth is my footstool: where is the house that ye build unto me? and where is the place of my rest?"</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Heaven is God's throne, not His dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Without us, the redeemed human beings, God has no rest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>What a wonder that we can be God's resting place!</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>THE TEMPLE</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>The temple in the Old Testament is called the house of God.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>If you read the Old Testament carefully, however, you will see that the psalmists and priests of old also considered the house of God their dwelling place.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>David said, "One thing have I desired of the Lord, that will I seek after; that I may dwell in the house of the Lord all the days of my life, to behold the beauty of the Lord, and to inquire in his temple" Psa 27:4 .</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>David's only desire was to dwell in the Lord's house and behold His beauty.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>He brought out the same thought in Psalm 23.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>At the beginning of the psalm he was enjoying the green pastures.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>We may appreciate the riches of the pasture, but to be there is like being in elementary school.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>If we go on to graduate school, we shall say, "I will dwell in the house of the Lord for ever" Psa 23:6 !</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>The nourishment in the house is richer than that found in the pasture.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>"They shall be abundantly satisfied with the fatness of thy house; and thou shalt make them drink of the river of thy pleasures" Psa 36:8 .</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>In God's house we enjoy the fatness.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The temple, then, was a dwelling place not only to God but also to all those who loved and served Him.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>Once again I would call to your attention that the central thought of the divine revelation in the Bible is not that we be good or even that we be holy.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>Rather, it is that we abide in God and let Him abide in us.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>What a wonder it is that man can be thus mingled with God!</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Here we are, occupying a very little space, yet God would take us as His dwelling place and would say to us, "Man, come into Me and live in Me!</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Take Me as your abiding place!"</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This will be for eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>We shall enjoy Him, and He will enjoy us.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He will also express Himself through us.</S>
