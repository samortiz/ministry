<h1 class="title">THE TYPE OF THE BUILDING OF THE CHURCH<br />
AS SEEN IN THE TABERNACLE</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Exo. 38:1-20; Num. 16:35-38; 21:4-9; Exo. 27:1-8; 30:17-21; 40:29-33</h1>
<h2 class="head1">INTRODUCTION</h2>
<p>After the children of Israel had come out of Egypt and were at the foot of Mount Sinai, God told them to make a tabernacle for Him, a sanctuary, so that He might dwell in their midst (Exo. 25:8). This sanctuary was God&rsquo;s dwelling place in the midst of His people. The tabernacle, including the temple that was built later, signifies the children of Israel becoming God&rsquo;s dwelling place. God did not build the tabernacle or the temple to be His ultimate dwelling place; rather, He built up the children of Israel to be His spiritual dwelling place. It seemed as though the tabernacle and the temple were His dwelling place, but in reality the children of Israel were His dwelling place. Therefore, when God charged the children of Israel to build the tabernacle, His desire to obtain a dwelling place among His people was revealed.</p>
<p>Bible scholars know that the important matters explicitly revealed by God in the New Testament are either typified or portrayed with pictures in the Old Testament. These pictures are often more detailed and comprehensive than what is explicitly stated in the New Testament. This principle also applies to God&rsquo;s building. The building of the tabernacle, including the temple, in the Old Testament age is a complete picture of the building up of the church in the New Testament age. Hence, we will carefully consider the building of the tabernacle in order to know how God intends to build His church through us today.</p>
<p>From God&rsquo;s perspective, the building of the tabernacle was from the Holy of Holies to the outer court, but from man&rsquo;s perspective, it was from the outer court to the Holy of Holies. The Holy Place was between the outer court and the Holy of Holies. There were three noteworthy items in the outer court: the hangings of the court, the altar, and the laver. We will now explain each item.</p>
<h2 class="head1">THE HANGINGS OF THE COURT</h2>
<p>The hangings of the court refer to the fine linen that surrounded the tabernacle. When the tabernacle was pitched, it looked like a house enclosed by a court. The wall of the court was not made of wood or stone but consisted of fine linen hanging from silver hooks on bronze pillars. The bronze pillars stood in bronze sockets and were connected by silver rods (Exo. 38:9-17). The hangings of the court were the outer boundary of the tabernacle. Spiritually speaking, the items of the hangings of the court indicate how God sets the boundary of His building and how the building begins.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Bronze Sockets</h2>
<p>The most noticeable feature in the outer court was bronze. Apart from the hooks, the connecting rods, and the capitals of the pillars, which were all silver, almost everything else in the outer court was bronze (v. 17). The pillars and their sockets in the outer court were bronze (v. 10). The first major item of the outer court, the altar, was overlaid with bronze, all the utensils of the altar were made of bronze, and the laver was also made of bronze (vv. 1-8). Why were most of the items in the outer court of the tabernacle made of bronze? Bible students acknowledge that bronze signifies judgment. To be more precise, it refers to having been judged. For example, when God judged the two hundred and fifty men of Korah&rsquo;s company, they were consumed by fire from God, and their bronze censers were also burned (Num. 16:35-38). To be burned is to be judged by God. In verse 38 God said, &ldquo;The censers of those who have sinned against their own lives, let them be made into beaten plates for a covering of the altar.&rdquo; The bronze censers became a sign that all rebels and opposers of God will pass through His judgment. Hence, when people saw the bronze altar, they recalled God&rsquo;s judgment. Bronze is a sign of being judged by God.</p>
<p>Another type in the Old Testament also shows that bronze signifies judgment. When the children of Israel spoke against God and against Moses in Numbers 21:4-9, they were bitten by poisonous serpents. Therefore, Moses made a bronze serpent and set it on a pole to save the children of Israel from God&rsquo;s judgment. In the New Testament the Lord Jesus said, &ldquo;As Moses lifted up the serpent in the wilderness, so must the Son of Man be lifted up&rdquo; (John 3:14). Here the Lord indicated that He was typified by the bronze serpent. The children of Israel being bitten by poisonous serpents typifies the descendants of Adam being bitten and poisoned by Satan. In the eyes of God we are the same as serpents because we have Satan&rsquo;s poisonous nature within us. The Lord Jesus as the Word became flesh (1:14), and this flesh is related to the serpent. This means that the Lord Jesus had the form of a serpent, but He did not have the poisonous nature of the serpent. Hence, Romans 8:3 says, &ldquo;God, sending His own Son in the likeness of the flesh of sin and concerning sin.&rdquo; The Lord Jesus had the likeness and form of the flesh of sin, which in the eyes of God was the same as the poisonous serpent, Satan. However, the Lord Jesus had only the outward form of the flesh of sin; He did not have the inward sin, just as the bronze serpent that Moses made had only the form of a serpent but not the serpentine poison. The bronze serpent that Moses set on a pole typifies the Lord Jesus being judged on the cross by God so that those whom He redeemed might be delivered from God&rsquo;s judgment. These two examples in the Old Testament show that bronze refers to judgment or having been judged by God.</p>
<p>The first boundary of the tabernacle sat on bronze sockets. Within this boundary were the altar and the laver, both of which were bronze. This gives the clear impression that the building up of God&rsquo;s dwelling place must begin with His judgment, that is, with being judged by God. In other words, in order for a new believer to become material for the building up of God&rsquo;s dwelling place, he must first let the Holy Spirit work to convict, condemn, and rebuke him (John 16:8). This is to be judged. This also applies to a believer when he is revived. If we receive mercy to see this vision and are willing to let God build in us, we must pass through His judgment. We should never think that we are qualified to touch items of gold as soon as we enter into God&rsquo;s building. We must first pass through bronze in order to have silver. When we have a foundation of silver, we can slowly enter into the Holy Place, where there are items of gold. Later, we can go from the Holy Place into the Holy of Holies, where the furniture is either gold overlaying wood or pure gold (Heb. 9:2-5). This indicates that God&rsquo;s building in the church begins with His judgment. In order for us to be built by God, we must first be judged in the light of God.</p>
<p>We need to see this picture in the Old Testament. Everything that was outside the boundary of the hangings of the outer court was corrupt, dark, sinful, worldly, fleshly, and satanic and, hence, could not be part of God&rsquo;s building. Judgment, the first step of God&rsquo;s building, keeps such things outside the boundary of the building. If we desire to take part in God&rsquo;s building, we must first pass through His judgment, which deals thoroughly with everything belonging to Satan, the world, sin, and the flesh. Then we will begin to have experiences of being built.</p>
<p>I often hear some saints pray, &ldquo;Lord, we praise You because You want to gain a dwelling place, and You want to be mingled with us as one. You are being mingled with us, and we are being mingled with You to be a mutual dwelling place.&rdquo; Or they may pray, &ldquo;Lord, You are the gold, and we are the wood. You are overlaying us, and we are being mingled with You as one.&rdquo; Such prayers are not wrong, but they can be likened to jumping to the top of a building instead of climbing the stairs. At the entrance of the tabernacle there was not yet a picture of God being mingled with man. We do not see gold overlaying wood in the outer court, because this picture is not present until we enter into the Holy Place (Exo. 37:10-11, 25-26). We must be willing to be judged by God because so many things within us still need to be judged.</p>
<p>Suppose a brother quarrels with his wife and does not talk to her for a few weeks, but he comes to the prayer meeting and prays, &ldquo;Lord, build us up so that the condition of gold overlaying wood, the mingling of God and man as a mutual dwelling place, may be manifested among us.&rdquo; Can such a prayer be answered? Suppose three responsible brothers in a district are not in one accord and do not submit to one another, but at the bread-breaking meeting one of the brothers prays, &ldquo;Lord, we have seen that You want to gain a mutual dwelling place of God mingled with man. You are the gold overlaying us, the wood.&rdquo; Does such a prayer match his condition? These prayers are abnormal.</p>
<p>If God opens our eyes to see that He wants to gain a dwelling place on the earth, to build us with other saints into His dwelling place, our prayers will not be about gold overlaying wood; rather, we will condemn ourselves. We will see how many dark, base, and worldly things are in us. God will then cause us to pass through His judgment of bronze in our prayer.</p>
<p>A saint who has truly been shined upon by God to see that God wants to build him with other saints into a dwelling place will sense his corruption, desolation, offenses, and transgressions. He will see that elements of the world, the flesh, corruption, and filth are still in him. Hence, his prayer will not be concerning gold overlaying wood, God mingling with man, but rather his prayer will be similar to that of Isaiah when he met the glory of God: &ldquo;Woe is me, for I am finished!&rdquo; (Isa. 6:5). This is God&rsquo;s judgment signified by the bronze.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_030.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_032.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>The Vision, Type, and Practice of the Building Up of the Church &nbsp; pg 31</div><br></body></html>
