   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>CHAPTER TWO CHRIST LIVING IN ME Scripture Reading: Gal 1:13-16; 2:20; 3:27, 28; 4:19; Col 1:25-27; 3:3, 4, 8-10; 2 Cor 13:5; Phil 1:21; Eph 3:17</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>As we said in the previous message, there are three crucial points to Paul s ministry.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The first of these, which we shall consider in this message, is Christ living within us.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The other two we shall cover in subsequent messages.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>PLANNED IN ETERNITY</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>That Christ should live in us was purposed and planned by God in eternity.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>According to Ephesians 3, in eternity past God planned to work Himself into His chosen people.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>His eternal purpose is to have a people with Him as life.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>God will be within them and they will be one with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>This people will be the Body of Christ to express God Himself in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>First they are the church and eventually the New Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>The Bible tells us that in eternity past there was only God.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>Then He purposed to have a Body for Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>For this He created the universe and then man, the center of the universe.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>Man, Genesis 1:26 tells us, was made in a specific way.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>He was made in God s image and according to His likeness.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Why was it that God made man in His own form?</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It was because God intended that one day He would enter man to make man His container, with Himself as the content.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>From the very beginning, then, from the time of man s creation, the preparation was made for man to contain God.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>A VESSEL</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Romans 9:20-21 says that man is a vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The purpose of a vessel is to contain something.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Man is not called an instrument.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>He was not made to do something, the way a hammer can be used to hit a nail.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>When the Lord talked to Ananias about Paul, He said, He is a chosen vessel unto me Acts 9:15 .</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Paul was not chosen to be an instrument to finish a work.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>He was chosen to be a vessel to contain God in Christ, even to the distant parts of the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Later, Paul himself used this same word.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We have this treasure in earthen vessels 2 Cor 4:7 .</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>We are only an earthen vessel, but within us is the treasure.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>The treasure is the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>It is Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>It is the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Paul was the leading vessel, the pattern vessel.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>When Christians study the Bible, they may be impressed with how much work Paul accomplished.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>In a sense Paul did accomplish a tremendous work.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>His work, however, was to contain the Lord and then bring the Lord to others; it was not to do a work as such.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Wherever he went, he ministered the Lord to people, not in the way of working but rather by containing Him and then sharing Him.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>He was a vessel containing the Lord and bringing the Lord to others.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>CHRIST REVEALED IN US</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It pleased God, Paul tells of the time of his conversion, to reveal His Son in me Gal 1:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>God was pleased to do this one thing: to reveal His Son in Paul.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Before God called him, Saul was already a chosen vessel, but he was empty.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>Even so, he was occupied by the religion of his fathers.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>His being was full of the law and the traditions.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>He thought highly of himself.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Peter he may have considered an ignorant fisherman from Galilee.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>But he himself was filled with the law of Moses and the traditions of his people.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Much of the day he was no doubt thinking about God and considering how to serve Him.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>Yet he was void of God, empty, even while being so occupied by the law.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>He was being misused, usurped, by what was not God s purpose.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>God does not want a people who are religious or even sinless.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Saul considered himself blameless, yet he was void of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>He was zealous for God, yet God was not in him.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>God s eternal purpose is not to gain a people who will keep the law.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He is after a people who are full of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>While Saul was empty, yet so occupied, this dear Lord came, not only to save him, but especially to fill him.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>On the way to Damascus the Lord called him by name.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>When Saul replied, Who art thou, Lord? the Lord entered into him.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>It was enough for him to say Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>If you want to take a picture with a camera, you simply activate the shutter.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>With a touch the light gets in and the picture is taken.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>The moment Saul called Lord, the shutter opened, even without his realizing it, and the Lord Jesus came in.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>You may wonder if Paul was referring to the time of his conversion when he says, It pleased God...to reveal His Son in me.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>This is clear from the context: When it pleased God, who set me apart from my mother s womb and called me through His grace, to reveal His Son in me, that I might preach Him among the nations, immediately I did not confer with flesh and blood Gal 1:15-16 .</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Was there any other juncture in Paul s life when God revealed His Son in Paul?</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To me it is clear that this was the time God revealed His Son to him.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>This camera had been shut for years.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>He would not open up, though God as the heavenly light was watching and waiting.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Then the Lord came and asked Saul why he was persecuting Him.</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>As soon as the word Lord came out in Saul s reply, the shutter was activated and the Son of God was revealed in him.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>Of course, it was not till later that he realized what had happened.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>This is our own story too.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>When we repented and believed, we may have prayed, Lord, I am sinful.</S>
   <S PAR='75' RSNT='1' SNO='75'>Have mercy on me and save me.</S>
   <S PAR='76' RSNT='1' SNO='76'>We had no intention of receiving the Lord into us.</S>
   <S PAR='77' RSNT='1' SNO='77'>Our prayer was for the Lord to forgive us and save us, to take care of our troubles.</S>
   <S PAR='78' RSNT='1' SNO='78'>We did not realize when we called Lord that we activated the shutter.</S>
   <S PAR='79' RSNT='1' SNO='79'>It took a few days perhaps before we discovered that Somebody was inside us.</S>
   <S PAR='80' RSNT='1' SNO='80'>Before calling on His name, we were alone.</S>
   <S PAR='81' RSNT='1' SNO='81'>Now, however, we find there is Someone in us, not only with us, but in us!</S>
   <S PAR='82' RSNT='1' SNO='82'>Is this not our experience?</S>
   <S PAR='83' RSNT='1' SNO='83'>Especially do we find this is so if we feel like doing something that pertains to the old life.</S>
   <S PAR='84' RSNT='1' SNO='84'>Suppose, for example, we feel like going to a movie.</S>
   <S PAR='85' RSNT='1' SNO='85'>Another One within us says, I don t feel good about this.</S>
   <S PAR='86' RSNT='1' SNO='86'>While we are saying, It would be fun to go to a movie, Someone else within is saying, Better not go!</S>
   <S PAR='87' RSNT='1' SNO='87'>Who is this One?</S>
   <S PAR='88' RSNT='1' SNO='88'>It is the Son of God revealed in us.</S>
   <S PAR='89' RSNT='1' SNO='89'>He was revealed in us while we were unaware.</S>
   <S PAR='90' RSNT='1' SNO='90'>Aware or not, He came in!</S>
   <S PAR='91' RSNT='1' SNO='91'>Now we cannot get rid of Him.</S>
   <S PAR='92' RSNT='1' SNO='92'>The more we call on Him, whether positively or negatively, the more we become involved with Him.</S>
   <S PAR='93' RSNT='1' SNO='93'>We may say, Lord, I have had enough of You.</S>
   <S PAR='94' RSNT='1' SNO='94'>Leave me alone.</S>
   <S PAR='95' RSNT='1' SNO='95'>At least give me this weekend for myself.</S>
   <S PAR='96' RSNT='1' SNO='96'>I have something to do.</S>
   <S PAR='97' RSNT='1' SNO='97'>The more we talk to Him this way, the more He bothers us.</S>
   <S PAR='98' RSNT='1' SNO='98'>It is better not to call!</S>
   <S PAR='99' RSNT='1' SNO='99'>If we want to avoid trouble, we had better not talk to Him!</S>
   <S PAR='100' RSNT='1' SNO='100'>This may help, but I doubt it!</S>
   <S PAR='101' RSNT='1' SNO='101'>Jesus is no longer just a man.</S>
   <S PAR='102' RSNT='1' SNO='102'>He is the ascended Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='103' RSNT='1' SNO='103'>He is the ascended Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='104' RSNT='1' SNO='104'>He is also the all-inclusive Spirit.</S>
   <S PAR='105' RSNT='1' SNO='105'>When we call His name, we get the Person.</S>
   <S PAR='106' RSNT='1' SNO='106'>To call Jesus is to activate the shutter.</S>
   <S PAR='107' RSNT='1' SNO='107'>The heavenly light comes in.</S>
   <S PAR='108' RSNT='1' SNO='108'>Suppose, to use an example, I need one of you.</S>
   <S PAR='109' RSNT='1' SNO='109'>As soon as I call your name, you come.</S>
   <S PAR='110' RSNT='1' SNO='110'>But suppose I do not want you to come.</S>
   <S PAR='111' RSNT='1' SNO='111'>I do not want to have you around.</S>
   <S PAR='112' RSNT='1' SNO='112'>Then it is better simply not to mention your name.</S>
   <S PAR='113' RSNT='1' SNO='113'>If I keep saying, So-and-so, So-and-so, I do not want you here.</S>
   <S PAR='114' RSNT='1' SNO='114'>Go away, So-and-so, and leave me alone! it is likely you will stay around.</S>
   <S PAR='115' RSNT='1' SNO='115'>The Lord is real and living.</S>
   <S PAR='116' RSNT='1' SNO='116'>He is present and near.</S>
   <S PAR='117' RSNT='1' SNO='117'>When we call, Lord!</S>
   <S PAR='118' RSNT='1' SNO='118'>He comes at once.</S>
   <S PAR='119' RSNT='1' SNO='119'>I have learned to apply this lesson in preaching the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='120' RSNT='1' SNO='120'>People may argue and resist what we say, but if we want to win them, the best way is to induce them to call Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='121' RSNT='1' SNO='121'>At the beginning of this message I have listed the verses in Paul s writings that mention Christ living in us.</S>
   <S PAR='122' RSNT='1' SNO='122'>Paul tells us that while he was deep in zeal for religion and the law, the Lord Himself came.</S>
   <S PAR='123' RSNT='1' SNO='123'>From the moment the Lord called him, Saul, Saul..., he could not get away.</S>
   <S PAR='124' RSNT='1' SNO='124'>It was then that Christ was revealed into him Gal 1:13-16 .</S>
