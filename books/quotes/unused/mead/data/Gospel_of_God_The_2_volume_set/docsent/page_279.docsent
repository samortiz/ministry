   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>BATHING AND FOOT-WASHING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>Although we Christians are bathed once only, the Bible shows us that foot-washing happens many times.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>There is only one bathing, but there are many foot-washings.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>It is like the cleansing: There is only one cleansing by the blood, but there are many cleansings by the water of the ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The accomplished redemption of Christ occurred once only.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>But there are many applications by the Holy Spirit of this accomplished work to us.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>We are bathed only once, and all our sins are washed.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>But it takes many foot-washings to wash away all the dirt that we pick up on the wilderness journey.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There needs to be only one bathing.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>But foot-washing is a daily work before the Lord.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>Foot-washing is a washing that comes about by the Word of God, through the work of the Holy Spirit, and based upon the work of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we have been cleansed once by His blood, we must continue to be washed daily by His blood as well.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord Jesus does not have to come and do another work.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>We are cleansed again and again based on that one work.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>It is not the ashes that are cleansing us but the water of the ashes.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The ashes of the red heifer are the mark of our judgment.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>God did not substitute our judgment with the judgment of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Rather, He judged us in Christ Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Today man thinks that the Lord Jesus died in place of man; but actually, we died in and with the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>In other words, we are judged in Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>This alone will cleanse us.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>My daily cleansing is based on the death of the Lord Jesus.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>We know that we have taken a bath, that is, our sins have been cleansed.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Once we are saved, we are eternally saved.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>All the problems are solved.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>What then should we do when we touch the dirt while living on earth and coming into contact with the world every day?</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>We all cannot be like the thief on the cross, who went straight to Paradise without his feet ever touching the earth after he was cleansed by the blood.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Most people are not saved while on their deathbeds.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Most still have to take the wilderness journey.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Every one of us knows that while we take the wilderness journey, we should not sin.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>But sinning is a fact with all of us.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>As a result, our feet get dirty.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Many times we are rash and speak words that we should not speak.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>Many times we have improper thoughts.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>Thus, we admit that we are defiled.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>But God has prepared the foot-washing of the Lord Jesus for us.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>This is not just a sign of His love for us, but a sign of His love to the uttermost.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>He loved us; hence, He was crucified for us.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>Now He loves us to the uttermost; hence, He washes our feet.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>Figuratively speaking, foot-washing is not the love before marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>Foot-washing is the love after marriage.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>He causes us to be continually clean before Him.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>This is why the Lord said that he who has been bathed will be wholly clean once his feet are washed.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>We thank the Lord that His Son has given us a bath already.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>The Lord allowed Peter's foolishness to be manifested as a lesson for us.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>When He came to Peter, Peter said, "Are You going to wash my feet?"</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Peter thought that this was a matter of politeness and courtesy.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>The Lord said that Peter would not understand what He did then but would understand later.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>There is much spiritual truth here.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When the Holy Spirit comes, we will see.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Now we are bewildered.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>All we see is a basin of water and the Lord's washing.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>We do not see what they mean.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>In the future, however, we will understand.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>But Peter always had his opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>He exclaimed that the Lord would never wash his feet.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>The Lord told him that the foot-washing was very important.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>If the Lord did not wash Peter's feet that night, Peter would have no part with Him.</S>
