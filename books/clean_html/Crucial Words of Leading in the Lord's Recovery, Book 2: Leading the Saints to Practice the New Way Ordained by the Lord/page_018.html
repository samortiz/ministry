<h1 class="title">THE ELDERS NEEDING TO LEAD THE SAINTS TO PRACTICE THE WAY ORDAINED BY THE LORD</h1>
<h1 class="title">(1)</h1>
<h1 class="scripture">Scripture Reading: Rom. 12:1; Acts 2:46; 4:31; 5:42; Matt. 28:18-19</h1>
<p>Prayer: Lord, our heart does not hope that we would be great or successful in this age; rather, our wish is to humbly serve You today so that we may gain Your praise in that day. Lord, give us such a heart and such a spirit. This prayer comes from our heart. This is our desire and supplication, and it is the way we desire to take. Lord, may You have a way to continually flow out from within us. Lord, visit us. Be with us. Speak to us. Remind us, and show us what we need to see. Amen.</p>
<h2 class="head1">PRACTICING THE WAY ORDAINED BY THE LORD</h2>
<p>We now come to a practical point; that is, the elders need to lead the saints to practice the way ordained by the Lord. After several years of investigating, we have found that in order to practice the way ordained by the Lord, we need to pay attention to four main points: first, to visit people and preach the gospel to gain new ones; second, to lead the new ones to establish home meetings; third, to lead the new ones to join the small group meetings; and fourth, to participate in the district meetings. We must spend time and effort to fellowship and study these four points thoroughly so that we can carry out the new way practically. The elders in every locality should gather the saints together to fellowship and pray specifically regarding every item and every point. According to our observation, the main points in the practice of the new way have not yet become our habit. If they become our habit, it will be easy for us to go on in the new way. To build up this habit, we need to continue promoting this way.</p>
<p>The elders should take the lead not only to knock on doors and preach the gospel but also to gather the saints together to provide them with some fellowship and explanation, encouraging them to visit people and preach the gospel. To carry out the new way, at least one-fourth to one-third of the brothers and sisters need to exercise to visit people and lead them into the home meetings. In regard to home meetings, the percentage of those who participate in the new way needs to be higher. This means that at least forty percent of the saints in a locality should participate in some aspect of the new way. In other words, if one hundred saints are meeting as the church, at least forty, preferably fifty, would be involved in the new way. Perhaps twenty-five to thirty would knock on doors, while ten or more would take care of the home meetings. Of course, our greatest hope is that more than half the saints would be involved in visiting people in their homes. They would not only deliver the gospel to people and lead them to salvation but would also bring the meeting to them in order to help them grow and be perfected so that they might be brought into the practical church life. For this reason, we need to gather all the saints together in order to fellowship and to pray much regarding taking this way. Going out to visit people in order to preach the gospel and lead home meetings for the perfecting of the saints requires us to pay a price.</p>
<p>According to our study, in the past we have been truly lacking in our gospel preaching. In other words, after we baptized people, we did not have a proper way to keep them. For instance, a great number of people were baptized every year in the church in Taipei, yet very few have remained. The situation in other churches is probably the same. It is not easy for us to invite people to listen to the gospel, and it can be said that we have exerted a great deal of effort to help people to believe and be baptized; however, after several months only a few remain. Hence, all the churches must study how to improve and keep people in the church life.</p>
<p>Concerning the district meetings, we have changed the big meetings from the way that they were in the past. Now the brothers and sisters are learning the way of all speaking and all listening. However, as far as the practical situation is concerned, it will be a great loss if the church meetings continue to lack in the ministry of the word. If we do not try to make up for this lack, soon it will be difficult to maintain the meetings. This requires us to spend time to seek the Lord. In any case, the future of the church is promising; however, the question is whether we are all willing to be in one accord.</p>
<p>Few professionals in Taiwan work only according to office hours. The system of nine-to-five office hours is no longer adequate to meet the need. Often the important personnel in prominent, large-scale firms and factories need to work beyond the scheduled time. They cannot leave the office until they finish the urgent matters at hand. If the bosses and employees worked for only eight hours, their companies would surely lose money. This is the situation both in Southeast Asia and in the United States. Take the Japanese as an example. A world-renowned Japanese automobile factory has a branch in Los Angeles. Most employees in the company are Americans, who work according to office hours. When it is time to be off, they leave. However, behind the office, some are still working in a small room; they are Japanese, and they work until midnight. This is the spirit of the Japanese people.</p>
<p>The Jews are another example. If you go to New York, people will tell you that the Jews work constantly. No one knows what time they go to work in the morning and what time they go home at night. Besides working diligently, they are also very frugal. They value every cent they earn; this is why they are so successful. The elders should be like this in regard to administrating the church; they should not consider it merely as going to work and keeping regular office hours. If we keep regular hours in our service, the church under our care is finished. We must serve twenty-four hours a day.</p>
