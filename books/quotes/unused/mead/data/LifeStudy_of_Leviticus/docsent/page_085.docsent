   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>"The priest shall arrange the burnt offering on it; and he shall offer up in smoke the fat portions of the peace offerings on it" 6:12b .</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>This indicates that to burn the burnt offering is to lay the foundation for the sweetness of the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The burnt offering is therefore for the enjoyment of the peace offering.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>In its spiritual significance, the peace offering implies fellowship with the Triune God and includes the enjoyment of the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>The burnt offering was burned, but it was burned for the peace offering.</S>

   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The burning of the fat portions of the peace offerings in 6:12 signifies that we should have the burning of our burnt offering laid as a foundation for our sweet fellowship with God.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Regardless of how much we feel that we are enjoying Christ, if we do not have the real offering of the burnt offering, our enjoyment is in self-deceit.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The real enjoyment of the Lord is based on our offering ourselves to God as a burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>If we mean business with God and offer ourselves to Him and live a life that is absolute for Him, then our enjoyment of Christ will be real and not imaginary.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>We should not deceive ourselves but consider whether we have the necessary foundation for us to enjoy the Triune God.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>This is not a matter of how we feel; it is a matter of actually having a proper foundation for the enjoyment of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>We lay this foundation by offering ourselves to the Lord as a burnt offering, and therefore we are willing to be absolute for the Lord, and we actually are absolute for Him.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>If we have such a foundation, then, whether we feel like we are enjoying the Lord or not, we are enjoying Him in reality.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>However, if we live a loose life day by day, yet feel that we are enjoying the Lord, we deceive ourselves, because our enjoyment has no foundation.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our need to have a foundation for the enjoyment of Christ is clearly pictured here in the type.</S>

   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Leviticus 6:12b also signifies that on the foundation of the burnt offering our peace offering should be burned for a fragrance to God.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>Not only the foundation should be burned, but even the very peace, the very fellowship, we enjoy should also be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The burnt offering should be burned, and our peace offering also should be burned.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>This means that both our absoluteness for God and our enjoyment of the Triune God should be a matter of burning.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Thus, there is burning upon burning.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>In this message we have seen the regulations concerning the burnt offering.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>If we desire to offer Christ as our burnt offering, taking Him as our burnt offering and enjoying Him as our absoluteness toward God, we need to follow all these regulations.</S>
