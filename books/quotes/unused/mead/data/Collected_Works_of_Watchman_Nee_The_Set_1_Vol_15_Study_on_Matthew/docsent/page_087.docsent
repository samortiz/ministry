   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>In the original text there is another word worth noting concerning the Lord's coming again.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>It is erchomai, which means "to come"; it is an active verb.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Parousia means "presence"; since it is a matter of presence, there must be two persons, and hence the rapture is implied.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>When the Lord's erchomai is mentioned, it does not include the rapture of the saints.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Erchomai is used seven times in Matthew 24 and is used eight times in Matthew 25 Matt 24:5, 30, 39, 42-44, 46; 25:6, 10-11, 13, 19, 31, 36, 39 .</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>There is another word, proserchomai, which means "to come to the presence."</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is also used here Matt 24:1; 25:20, 22, 24 .</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>There is another word, deute, which means "come here" Matt 25:34 .</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>There is another word, heko, which means "has come already" Matt 24:14, 50 .</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>From this we can see the accuracy of the Bible in using words.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The third question of the disciples was, "And what will be the sign...of the consummation of the age?"</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>For the word age there are two Greek words: 1 kosmos, which means the material aspect of the organized world and is different from aion; and 2 aion, which refers to time.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>In the Bible there is the term of the world; it means to be caught by the organized things in the world.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>According to Genesis 1:1 this world is already the second one.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>In the Bible there is also the term of the age, that is, to be caught by the customs, the current, of the age, or to be fashionable.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>The disciples asked concerning the consummation of this age.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>The word "age" here is aion.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>"End" is a specific term.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>It can be translated "the end time"; it can also refer to the great tribulation which will last for three and a half years and not seven years .</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>The consummation of this age is the end of the age of grace, the age of the church.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>"The consummation" spans a period; it begins with the rapture to the throne and ends with the appearing of the Lord with His saints from the air.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Hence, this is comparable in time to the parousia.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>But the locations are different, because the parousia refers to the things that are happening above, while "the consummation" refers to the things that are happening on the earth.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Now let us see when the first major section will be fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Generally, there are two explanations: 1 It was fulfilled at the time Titus destroyed Jerusalem in A.D. 70, because verse 2 has been fulfilled completely.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>2 It has not yet been fulfilled, because the subject of Matthew 24 is the great tribulation.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>But we do not agree with either of these explanations.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>Those who agree with the first explanation include Scofield, and those who agree with the second explanation include Darby.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>We know that there are two destructions of Jerusalem.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>In A.D. 70 the destruction by Titus was only the first.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>There are seven big reasons to argue against the first explanation: 1 At that time there were self-proclaimed Christs, but they did not perform miracles v. 24 . 2 The abomination of desolation has not been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The abomination of desolation is the idols.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>This means that idols are put into the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>The first school says that this has already been fulfilled because there was the flying of the flag in the temple.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>However, at the time of the flying of the flag in the temple, the Jews were no longer able to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Yet verse 16 says, "Then let those in Judea flee to the mountains."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>3 The Lord commanded the Jews to flee.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>This kind of fleeing is a most urgent kind of fleeing, but at that time there was not such a necessity.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>4 After such a destruction the whole world should be influenced, but at the time of Titus there was not a worldwide influence.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>5 At the time of Titus the celestial phenomena did not change.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>6 The result of the destruction should be the Lord's appearing, but at that time the Lord did not appear.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>7 This section is parallel with Revelation 6.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>Revelation was written in A.D. 96.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The destruction by Titus occurred in A.D. 70.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>If it had already been fulfilled, why would Revelation speak about things that had happened twenty-six years before?</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>The temple will be destroyed at least twice.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Daniel 9:26 says, "And the people of the prince who will come will destroy the city and the sanctuary."</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Verse 18 uses the word "desolations."</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Daniel 9:27 says that "he...will replace the sacrifice and the oblation with abominations of the desolator."</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>This is the second destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>These two destructions are completely different in time.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>One took place after the sixty-two weeks, whereas the other will occur within the one week.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Verse 26 mentions the people of the prince, and not the king.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Titus was a prince and was not a king.</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>Then verse 27 refers to the king himself, who will be the Roman king.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>In the original text, "the end" and "to the end" in verse 26 both refer to the end of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>Hence, we know that the first destruction is before the end of the age.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>We will compare a few verses.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>By these verses we will become more clear that there must be a second destruction of the holy city.</S>
   <S PAR='60' RSNT='1' SNO='60'>Revelation 11:2 says that the Gentiles will trample the holy city for forty-two months.</S>
   <S PAR='61' RSNT='1' SNO='61'>See also 13:5 and 2 Thessalonians 2:7, which do not refer to the destruction by Titus, because after the destruction by Titus the gospel began to spread.</S>
   <S PAR='62' RSNT='1' SNO='62'>Matthew 21:41 states that after the first vinedressers were killed, new vinedressers were hired.</S>
   <S PAR='63' RSNT='1' SNO='63'>So in the first major section, verses 4-6 have already been fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='64' RSNT='1' SNO='64'>Verses 7-14 are not yet completely fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='65' RSNT='1' SNO='65'>They are still being fulfilled.</S>
   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>Verses 15-31 are not fulfilled yet.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>In comparing the other three Gospels, we see that both Mark 13 and Luke 21 record these things, but there are differences.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>Matthew, Mark, and Luke, all three Gospels, record the first question.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>Mark and Luke contain more detail than Matthew.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>Whatever was said by Matthew was said by Mark and Luke also except for the preaching of the gospel of the kingdom to the earth .</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>Concerning the second question, there are more differences, and concerning the third question, there are even contradictions.</S>
