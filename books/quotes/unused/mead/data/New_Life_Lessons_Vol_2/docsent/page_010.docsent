   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>KNOWING THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>After we are saved and have come to know the Lord Jesus Christ, we still need to go on to know the church.</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>I. WHAT IS THE CHURCH?</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The first time you heard the word church, what did you think the church was?</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>The church is not a cathedral,</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>a chapel, or a meeting hall.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>It is not a house or a building.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>It is not a human organization.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>It is not a religious group.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>THE CHURCH IS THE CONGREGATION OF THE CALLED ONES</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>In the original language the word church is ekklesia.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>It is composed of two words.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>The first word is ek, which means out, and the second is derived from kaleo, which means to call.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>When these two words are put together, they mean a congregation of called out ones, or a gathering of the called ones.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Hence, from the meaning of the word itself, the church is a group of people called out of the world by God to gather together.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>THE CHURCH IS THE BODY OF CHRIST</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>The church, which is His Body, the fullness of the One who fills all in all.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Ephesians 1:22b-23</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>1 The Fullness of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>The fullness of Christ is the Body of Christ as His expression.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The church as the fullness of Christ is the overflow of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>2 That Which Comes out of Christ</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>As Eve came out of Adam Gen 2:21-24 , so also the church is out of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>From this we know that:</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>The church is a living organism,</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>not a dead organization.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>The church takes Christ as her Head.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>The church shares the same</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>life and nature as Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>The church is the fullness of Christ,</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>the expression of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>3.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>THE CHURCH IS THE HOUSE OF THE LIVING GOD</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>That you may know how one ought to conduct himself in the house of God, which is the church of the living God, the pillar and base of the truth.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>1 Timothy 3:15</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>The church is the house of God,</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>the place of His rest.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The church is the place where God</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>manifests Himself on earth.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>II.</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>THE FUNCTION OF THE CHURCH</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>IN RELATION TO GOD</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>1.</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>TO EXPRESS GOD</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>Having predestinated us unto sonship through Jesus Christ to Himself, according to the good pleasure of His God s will.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Ephesians 1:5</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>The meaning of sonship through Jesus Christ is that through Him we are redeemed and regenerated to become the children of God, possessing the life and position of God s children.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>God predestinated us the church to receive sonship, so that He Himself may be expressed through us.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>TO DEAL WITH THE ENEMY</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>In order that now to the rulers and the authorities in the heavenlies might be made known through the church the multifarious wisdom of God.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>Ephesians 3:10</S>
   <S PAR='55' RSNT='1' SNO='55'>The rulers and authorities in the heavenlies here refer especially to the evil angels.</S>
   <S PAR='56' RSNT='1' SNO='56'>Before we were saved, we were dead in trespasses and sins.</S>
   <S PAR='57' RSNT='1' SNO='57'>But now we are redeemed and regenerated and have received the sonship to become the Body of Christ.</S>
   <S PAR='58' RSNT='1' SNO='58'>This surely manifests the multifarious wisdom of God and is a great shame to His enemy, the devil.</S>
   <S PAR='59' RSNT='1' SNO='59'>III.</S>

   <S PAR='66' RSNT='1' SNO='66'>The church is the house of God and also our home.</S>
   <S PAR='67' RSNT='1' SNO='67'>To be regenerated is to be born into the family of God.</S>
   <S PAR='68' RSNT='1' SNO='68'>For this reason we should put off our old manner of life and come into the church life.</S>
   <S PAR='69' RSNT='1' SNO='69'>2.</S>
   <S PAR='70' RSNT='1' SNO='70'>THE CHURCH IS OUR PROTECTION</S>
   <S PAR='71' RSNT='1' SNO='71'>When the Bible speaks of the church life, it often uses the phrase one another.</S>
   <S PAR='72' RSNT='1' SNO='72'>This life of mutual care is our protection.</S>
   <S PAR='73' RSNT='1' SNO='73'>We should not be individualistic Christians.</S>
   <S PAR='74' RSNT='1' SNO='74'>We should give ourselves to the church.</S>
