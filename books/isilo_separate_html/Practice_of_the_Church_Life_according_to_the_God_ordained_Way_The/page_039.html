Of Reconciliation with God<br>through Justification<br>6. Of the Spirit's Regeneration</H2><P>We must not only be able to tell people the doctrine of regeneration but also be able to share our experience of regeneration.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>7. Of God's Full Salvation in Christ</H2><P>To prophesy we must have the experience of God's full salvation in Christ. God's salvation is not a partial salvation, but a full salvation.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>8. Of the Assurance of Salvation<br>and the Clearance of the Past</H2><P>Many believers do not know that they are saved. They do not have the experience of the assurance of salvation. Based upon the assurance of salvation, we have the experience of the clearance of the past. After we are saved, having the full assurance of this, we have to clear up our past.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>9. Of Positional Sanctification and<br>Dispositional Sanctification by the Spirit</H2><P>We also must have the experience of positional sanctification and dispositional sanctification by the Spirit. Positional sanctification is objective. Dispositional sanctification is subjective, in our disposition. We must experience these things; then our prophesying will be rich.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>10. Of the Spirit's Renewing,<br>Transforming, and Conforming</H2><P>We must experience the Spirit's renewing, transforming, and conforming. The Spirit conforms us to the image of the glorious Christ (Rom. 8:29).</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>11. Of the Dealings with Sin, with the World,<br>with the Flesh, with the Self, with the Natural Life,<br>and with the Natural Strength</H2><P>The book The Experience of Life covers all of these different dealings. This book comprises messages given in a training in Taipei in 1953 and 1954. I would encourage all of us to read it.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD3>12. Of the Killing of the Subjective Death<br>of Christ and the Life-imparting<br>of the Resurrection of Christ</H2><P>We must experience the death of Christ, and we must also experience the life-imparting of the resurrection of Christ. The death of Christ is for killing, and the resurrection of Christ is for life-imparting.</P><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_038.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_040.html">Next</a> </body></html>
