<p>Verse 11 says, &ldquo;And I saw another beast coming up out of the earth, and he had two horns like a lamb, and he spoke like a dragon.&rdquo; This beast is not Antichrist, but the false prophet who comes up out of the earth. That he is a lamb in form but a beast in actuality indicates that he is false. Whereas Christ as the Lamb of God with seven horns has the seven Spirits of God (5:6), this false lamb with two horns sends out unclean spirits (16:13).</p>
<p>Verse 12 of chapter thirteen continues, &ldquo;And he exercises all the authority of the first beast in his sight, and he causes the earth and those who dwell in it to worship the first beast, whose death stroke was healed.&rdquo; As a prophet he speaks so that people follow him to worship the first beast, the Antichrist. Because Antichrist will be killed and miraculously resuscitated, people will worship him. This will be the message of the false prophet. Just as the prophets of God today preach the resurrection of Christ, at that time the false prophet will preach the resuscitation of the Antichrist. Verse 13 says, &ldquo;And he does great signs, so that he even makes fire come down out of heaven to the earth before men.&rdquo; This will be to counter what Elijah will do as one of the two witnesses (11:5). This false prophet will show people that what Elijah can do, he himself can do also.</p>
<p>Verses 14-15 say, &ldquo;And he deceives those who dwell on the earth on account of the signs which he was given power to do before the beast, commanding those who dwell on the earth to make an image to the beast, who had the stroke of the sword and revived. And power was given to him to give breath to the image of the beast that the image of the beast might even speak and cause whoever would not worship the image of the beast to be killed.&rdquo; <em>Breath</em> in verse 15 may be translated <em>spirit.</em> Since the beginning of the history of man there has never been an idol which could speak, but at the end of this age there will be an idol with a spirit in it which will speak; that will be a real miracle. However, those who keep the commandments of God and have the testimony of Jesus&mdash;the real Jews and the faithful believers&mdash;will not worship the beast and his image, so many of them will be killed.</p>
<p>The coming Antichrist will be a very extraordinary person. Both the Antichrist and the false prophet will be persons returned from the dead. The first beast, Antichrist, comes out of the abyss (9:11; 11:7; 17:8), and the second beast, the false prophet, comes out of the earth. This false prophet may be Judas Iscariot. In Acts 1:20, Peter refers to Judas by quoting Psalm 109:8, which says, &ldquo;May his days be few; / May another take his office.&rdquo; Verse 6 of this Psalm says, &ldquo;Appoint a wicked man over him, / And let an adversary stand at his right hand.&rdquo; This indicates that Satan stood with Judas, the one who betrayed the Lord Jesus. In addition, Acts 1:25 says that after Judas died, he went &ldquo;to his own place,&rdquo; not to his people as Abraham, Isaac, and Jacob did (Gen. 25:8; 35:29; 49:33). In John 17:12 the Lord Jesus also said that Judas is the son of perdition, while 2 Thessalonians 2:3 tells us that the Antichrist is the son of perdition. Only these two persons are called the sons of perdition. Lastly, in John 6:70-71 the Lord Jesus called Judas a devil. By joining all these points together, we can believe that this false prophet will be Judas, who will come back from the dead. Who among men is as qualified to be the false prophet? Judas is the one most qualified.</p>
<h2 class="head2">The Number of the Beast</h2>
<p>Revelation 13:16-18 say, &ldquo;And he causes all, the small and the great, and the rich and the poor, and the freemen and the slaves, to be given a mark on their right hand or on their forehead, and that no one may be able to buy or sell except him who has the mark, that is, the name of the beast or the number of his name. Here is wisdom. Let him who has understanding calculate the number of the beast, for it is the number of a man; and his number is six hundred sixty-six.&rdquo; Because the book of Revelation was written during the time of the Roman Empire, John could not write it in plain words. Since it was written in such a mysterious way, wisdom is needed to understand.</p>
<p>Six hundred sixty-six is the number of the beast, the number of a man, and the number of the name of that beast. Some people have spent much time to find the meaning of this number, and I have learned from their studies. This man is Caesar Nero. In Hebrew and Greek, letters represent numbers. The number represented by the Hebrew letters of the name <em>Nero</em> is 306, and the number represented by <em>Caesar</em> is 360; the total comes to 666. Therefore, Caesar Nero is the name of this man and the name of the beast.</p>
<p>Of all the numbers from one to ten, the most negative number is six. In the Scriptures the number seven is formed either by six and one, signifying the creation plus the Creator, or four and three, signifying the creature plus the Triune God. The number six, however, is one short of seven, signifying humanity created on the sixth day but short of God and corrupted by Satan. The number of the beast, Antichrist, the man of lawlessness in 2 Thessalonians 2, is 666, nothing but humanity short of God, damaged and corrupted by the devil. In contrast, the Greek name for <em>Jesus,</em> according to the numeric value of the Greek letters, adds to 888, eight being the number of resurrection. He is the resurrection (John 11:25), and everything about Him is in resurrection. In addition, in reference to the Antichrist the word <em>beast</em> is used thirty-six times in Revelation, which is six times six, while <em>Lamb,</em> referring to Christ, is used twenty-eight times, which is four times seven. The Antichrist is nothing but corrupted humanity without God, while Jesus is humanity mingled with God in resurrection.</p><br><a href="./page_001.html"> Home </a> | <a href="./page_022.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_024.html">Next</a> </body></html>
