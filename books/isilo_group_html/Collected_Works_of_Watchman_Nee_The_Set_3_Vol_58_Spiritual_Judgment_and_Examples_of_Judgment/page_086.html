N.</h2><p>I was born into a Christian family. At the age of sixteen I heard Paget Wilkes in a conference and came to realize that I was a sinner and needed the Savior. From that time onward I believed in the Lord Jesus as my Savior. Once I went with my brother to cast out a demon. The demon knew that we were Christians and was scared. It left the man, and our faith was strengthened. When I was in school, I knelt down to pray three times a day. Once when I was praying, I seemed to hear a voice, saying, "Just as I have saved you, you should save others." I asked the Lord whether I should be a preacher and told Him that I was willing to be one. Since that day I have not heard any voice.</p><p>In February of 1931 our school invited Brother Nee to come to preach the gospel. He preached on the subject "There Is God." After I heard it, I felt that it was different from other preachings. After this, I often went to Wen-teh Lane in Hardoon Road, Shanghai, to meet with the brothers. In fact, I did not go to any other place. At that time Brother Nee asked me to take shorthand notes of the meetings. I have been doing that since then. Once I was deceived by Satan. Brother Nee told me that everything Satan says to us is false and should be rejected. I was bothered by Satan so much that I became confused in my mind and sick for a few months. I could not focus my thoughts. I was full of confusion and fear even while I was sleeping. I called on the name of the Lord, saying, "Lord, I am afraid." Soon the fear left me, and my sickness gradually went away.</p><p>Once the Lord's word came to me: "Seek Jehovah while He may be found;/Call upon Him while He is near" (Isa. 55:6). I went to the meetings of the church in Shanghai. I was willing to seek Him and to call upon Him. There I saw many people handing over their all. I was touched to do the same thing. After that, I came to Kuling. Brother Nee wanted me to take shorthand notes again. I said I could not do it because my head hurt. Brother Nee said that I should not worry and that the headache was not my business. I said, "My head belongs to me. How can you say that it is not my business?" He told me just to work anyway. As I was taking the notes of Brother Nee's message on "The Holy Spirit, the Church, and Resurrection," I began to believe his words. The Lord's resurrection power uplifted me and sustained me to continue in my note taking.</p><p>The messages on the mountain show me how subjective, proud, and self-loving I have been. I also have discovered a strange phenomenon: My head hurts under certain circumstances and does not hurt under other circumstances. Whenever I set my mind on unrelated subjects, my head hurts. But whenever I reject these distracting things, my head stops hurting. Within my being I discovered that my mind is mixed up with God's will, my feelings, and Satan's accusations. When my mind is under control, my condition improves. Since 1935 Brother Nee has been telling me that my mind needs to come under control. Yet even today, I have not learned this lesson well. I feel that Satan, the father of liars, is always tempting me to think wild things. I can only ask my dear Lord who loves me to control my thoughts.</p><h2 class="head1">BROTHER NEE'S COMMENT</h2><h2 class="head2">Being Simple in Thoughts</h2><p>Our brother is very strong in his mind. Before the Lord our mind should be as simple as possible. Your thoughts are wild, active, and complicated. Even while you are being dealt with, you cannot stop thinking, and your thoughts run out of your control. This makes it difficult for you to get through before God. It also prevents you from having a straight pathway.</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_085.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_087.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 3) Vol. 58: Spiritual Judgment and Examples of Judgment &nbsp; pg 86</div><br></body></html>
