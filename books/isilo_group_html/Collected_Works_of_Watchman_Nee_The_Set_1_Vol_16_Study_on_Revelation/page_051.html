Revelation 14:11</H2><P>"And the smoke of their tormenting goes up forever and ever; and they have no rest day and night, those who worship the beast and his image, and whoever receives the mark of his name." </P><P>This shows us that once a person goes to hell, there will no longer be any chance for repentance. Moreover, one does not perish immediately when he goes into hell. The saints will not need to sleep in the new heaven and the new earth, while those in hell will not be able to sleep forever.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>C. Revelation 14:12</H2><P>"Here is the endurance of the saints, those who keep the commandments of God and the faith of Jesus." </P><P>This verse corresponds with 13:10. "The commandments of God" refer particularly to the first and the second commandments: "Thou shalt have no other gods before me," and "Thou shalt not make unto thee any graven image." This is the time for the believers to exercise their endurance.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>V. BLESSED ARE THE DEAD WHO DIE IN THE LORD<br>(REVELATION 14:13)</H2><P>"And I heard a voice out of heaven, saying, Write, Blessed are the dead who die in the Lord from now on. Yes, says the Spirit, that they may rest from their labors; for their works follow with them." </P><P>"From now on" refers to the time after the worship of the beast begins. This shows that one can escape the persecution of the beast by death. Those "who die in the Lord" must be the Christians. Here it does not say the seven Spirits of God, but the Spirit. The Spirit is directly related to the church, while the seven Spirits are directly related to His judgment. Our works cannot go before us to God. However, Christ's work goes before us to God and secures for us God's acceptance. Our works follow us to God and bring to us God's reward.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD1>VI. THE REAPING OF THE HARVEST<br>(REVELATION 14:14-16)</H2><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>A. Revelation 14:14</H2><P>"And I saw, and behold, there was a white cloud, and on the cloud One like the Son of Man sitting, having a golden crown on His head and a sharp sickle in His hand." </P><P>"A white cloud" here agrees with 1 Thessalonians 4:16-17. "One like the Son of Man" is a word related to the church (Rev. 1:13). "Having a golden crown" signifies having obtained glory. The sickle has to be sharp so that the reaping can be done quickly. In Matthew 13:37, the Lord is the Sower; at His second coming, He will be the Reaper.</P><H2 CLASS=HEAD2>B. Revelation 14:15-16</H2><P>"And another angel came out of the temple, crying with a loud voice to Him who sat on the cloud, Send forth Your sickle and reap, for the hour to reap has come because the harvest of the earth is ripe. And He who sat on the cloud thrust His sickle upon the earth, and the earth was reaped."</P><P>In verse 15 we have the angel sent from God speaking to the Lord. Here the Lord takes the position of a servant. In Matthew 9:38 the Lord says that God is the Lord of the harvest. Here the Lord is a sent One.</P><P>"Harvest." Mr. Darby does not recognize that Christians can pass through these judgments. Hence, he thinks that the harvest here refers to something negative. However, nowhere in the entire Bible is harvest referred to in a negative way. The wheat is not like the fig, which can remain on earth for a long time. Once it has ripened, it must be harvested. The first time that the harvest is mentioned in the Bible is in Genesis 8:22. There it clearly indicates that the harvest is a blessing from God. In John 4:35 the Lord refers to the harvest in a positive way. Matthew 3:12 says that the wheat should be gathered into the barn. In Exodus the firstfruits of the harvest should be gathered into the house of God (23:19; 34:26). To be gathered into the house of God typifies the initially-raptured Christians being taken to the throne of God, while to be gathered into the barn typifies the majority of the believers being raptured to the air. The barn is between the field and the house. The field refers to the world (Matt. 13:38), while the house refers to the heavens. Hence, the Christians who are gathered into the barn are those who are raptured to the air, which is between the heavens and the world.</P><P>The harvest in Matthew 13:37-43 is a reaping of what the Lord has sown. What the Lord has sown is something good; hence, what is reaped must also be good. In Mark 4:26-29, God is reaping because the time of harvest has come. Romans 11:16 says that if the firstfruits are a certain way, the whole lump is also. Since the firstfruits in Revelation 14:1-5 are good, the harvest in verses 14 through 16 must be good also. Since verses 1 through 5 do not refer to the judgment of the sinners, verses 14 through 16 should not refer to something negative; they cannot refer to God's judgment.</P><P>The word "ripe" can be translated "dried up." The immature grain will not be harvested. Likewise, the immature Christians will not be raptured. The firstfruits are composed of those who ripen first, those who forsake the world first. It is only after the worldly Christians have been dried up of the world that they will no longer love the world.</P><P>Matthew 13:39 says that the angels are sent to reap the harvest. The sickle in Revelation 14:14 is in the Son of Man's hand; it is a mysterious sickle. When the Lord comes to receive us, we will be raptured. Then, we will "stand before the Son of Man" (Luke 21:36).</P><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_050.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_052.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 1) Vol. 16: Study on Revelation &nbsp; pg 51</div><br></body></html>
