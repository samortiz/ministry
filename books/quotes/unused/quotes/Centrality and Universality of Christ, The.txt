In this short book, we want to fellowship about the centrality and universality of Christ Christ as the center and Christ as everything
We will spend one chapter for the objective aspect of this subject and three chapters for the subjective aspect
In the old creation He is the first; He is the beginning; He takes the preeminence, the first place, in God's creation
All things were created in Him, in the power of His person, through Him as the active instrument, and unto Him for His possession
All things are united and compacted together in Christ because Christ is the center and Christ is the circumference
He is the Head and the Firstborn from the dead that He might have the preeminence, the first place, in all things
The economy that God according to His desire planned and purposed in Himself is to head up all things in Christ at the fullness of the times
We should not pay our attention to anything other than to holding Christ as the reality, the center, the circumference, and everything
Paul preached Christ crucified to the Jews, and this became a stumbling block to them because they were seeking something other than Christ
The Father is the source, the Spirit is the communion, the fellowship, the transmission, and the Son, Christ, is the center
If we have the Son, we have the Father also, because the Father is in the Son and the Son is the very embodiment of the Father
Whatever God has planned, whatever God has done, and whatever God is doing is to make Christ the Head, the center, and everything
Now we come to the last item concerning Christ as everything in God's intention Christ in the Christian life or Christ in the Christians
You can teach grace and even fight for the doctrine of grace, yet you do not have grace if you do not have the living person of Christ
You may not have the word grace in your vocabulary or dictionary, but if you have the reality of Christ, you have the reality of grace
Christ nearly has no place, no ground, even in the formal church, the doctrinal church, the fundamental church
What you need is not forms, doctrines, gifts, healings, and speaking in tongues, but Christ the living One, the Son of the living God
They paid attention to something other than Christ, something which was used by God to bring people, to conduct people, to Christ
The Galatians were trying to do good, to improve themselves, and to adjust themselves in order to have good behavior
We have to come back to God's Word, where we do not see any stress on doctrines, forms, gifts, healings, or speaking in tongues
In Colossians 2:8 Paul said, 'Beware that no one carries you off as spoil through his philosophy and empty deceit'
It is not something in black and dark clothing, but something in a white and bright garment that can carry us away from Christ
If we focus on something other than Christ, regardless of how good it is, we have been sidetracked; we are no longer on the right track
All these things are substituting for Christ, replacing Christ, usurping the ground of Christ in the believers
The enemy is fighting to frustrate, to damage, to mix up, to confuse, and to complicate the pure building up of the church
Galatians 3:23-24 says, 'But before faith came we were guarded under law, being shut up unto the faith which was to be revealed
Of being a means, an instrument, to bring people to Christ, the law has become a hindrance and a separator, separating people from Christ
The subtlety of the enemy is that he utilized this matter to hinder these people from going on to know Christ in a deeper way
They could not sit quietly with a sober mind and an open spirit to listen to someone speaking to them about Christ as the inner life
Corinthians was written simply because the Corinthian believers were held by the gifts and would not go on to know Christ in a deeper way
It is in the opening of this book to the Corinthians that the apostle declared, 'I did not determine to know anything
If we receive Christ and experience Him by the cross, the Holy Spirit who indwells us will restrict us from exercising so much in the gifts
Many people there are the believers, the followers, of Christ, and they more or less confess the name of Christ
On the one hand, the New Testament tells us many times that Christ has ascended to the heavens and is now at the right hand of God
No matter how great the quantity is of good oranges in Southern California, they will not do you any good unless they get into your stomach
There is too much of the objective Christ in Christianity today, but there is very little of the subjective Christ in you
The Gospel of John, the Gospel of Christ being life to us, does not say that the very Christ who is life in us has gone to the heavens
If He is not subjective, if He is merely a Savior in the heavens and He is not in us, how can He be life to us?
Let us also read Romans 8:9-10: 'But you are not in the flesh, but in the spirit, if indeed the Spirit of God dwells in you
In every part of our being in our mind, in our emotion, in our will, in our conscience, and in our spirit Christ is mingled with us
In addition to the verses mentioned above, we have Ephesians 3:17: 'That Christ may make His home in your hearts
To dwell, to remain, in a certain place is one thing, and to make home, to settle down, in that place is another thing
Christ not only is in us, lives in us, dwells in us, and is being formed in us, but also wants to make His home in us, to settle down in us
No matter how much He is, how good He is, and how all-inclusive He is, if He is not subjective, He is nothing to us
In the preceding chapters we have seen clearly not only what Christ is in Himself but also what Christ is to us
If we desire to have a genuine church life, we must realize that all the life matters depend on our real experience of the subjective Christ
We have such a Christ who is central, universal, all-inclusive, and subjective, but what is the proper way for us to contact such a Christ?
Of all, we have to know that if we are going to contact Christ, the living Christ, the subjective Christ, we have to realize what He is
Let us read 1 Corinthians 1545 So also it is written The first man Adam became a living soul the last Adam became a lifegiving Spirit
They know the Scriptures and the doctrines concerning the Trinity, predestination, justification by faith, sanctification by faith, etc
If you have only the knowledge of Christ as the living bread, yet no way to experience it, what good is it to you?
You may know that Christ is the life, but do you have the proper, real, practical, and living way to experience Him as life?
If we are not in the spirit but just in our mind, then the Word in black and white is separated from the living One Christ
When you are contacting the written Word, you must have the sense in your spirit that you are contacting the living Word
Brothers and sisters, we have to learn to realize, to experience, Christ in our spirit in such a real, substantial way
Sometimes when you are depressed, suppressed, or even oppressed, you shut up your mouth and cannot pray for a prolonged period of time
If you go to the Lord with your mind in the same way that you go to the laboratory, the more you pray, the drier you will become
The best way, and in fact the only proper way, for us to contact such a Christ is to exercise our spirit to pray
We are bothered by the problems, troubles, difficulties, tests, trials, sorrows, pains, and others' unfair dealings with us
If we are occupied with many things, that will only help us to exercise our mind and hinder us from exercising our spirit
When you pray in this way, eventually you will realize that it is not only you praying by yourself but also Him praying within you
When you are so much mingled with Him and one with Him, it will be difficult for people to tell whether you are praying or Christ is praying
When we are in Christ, we enjoy Him as everything as life, as power, as the light shining within us to guide us all the time
If we are one with Christ and blended together with Christ, it is easy for us to receive healing when we need it
We have to realize that He is such a One living within us so that we may experience Him in such a living and experiential way
On the one hand, we stress the all-inclusiveness of Christ He is the center, the circumference, and everything
On the other hand, we want to see that this very central, universal, all-inclusive Christ is so subjective to us
If He is not subjective to us, He has nothing to do with us, and we cannot experience Him as life and everything to us
We all may realize that with a subject as big as the centrality and universality of Christ, there are many things to see
On the one hand, the Scripture reveals to us that Christ has ascended to the heavens and is now at the right hand of God
It is wonderful that these two spirits, the divine Spirit and the human spirit, can be joined and mingled as one
We have to realize that this oneness is possible only in the spirit, not in the body nor in the mind nor in the soulish life
The divine Spirit is life to the human spirit, and the human spirit is the container, the vessel, to contain and express the divine Spirit
The central point in the divine thought is that this wonderful divine Spirit wants to come into this little human spirit
Christ, as the substance of the Divine Trinity, as the Spirit, comes into our spirit to dwell in it and to be one with us
Now let us read 2 Corinthians 47 We have this treasure in earthen vessels that the excellency of the power may be of God and not out of us
Now we come to 2 Corinthians 3:17: 'And the Lord is the Spirit; and where the Spirit of the Lord is, there is freedom'
Christ as the wonderful Spirit the lifegiving Spirit the freeing Spirit and the transforming Spirit is the treasure in the earthen vessels
Within a human being there is also a human spirit which serves as the very receiving organ for us to receive Christ as the treasure into us
Verse 11 says, 'Let us therefore be diligent to enter into that rest lest anyone fall after the same example of disobedience'
The first thing is the tabernacle or temple with three parts: the Holy of Holies, the Holy Place, and the outer court
A small number of priests entered into the Holy Place, where the showbread table, the lampstand, and the incense altar were
In that outer court, the children of Israel enjoyed Christ as the sin offering and the Passover Lamb by offering Him on the altar
When they were in the wilderness, this means that they were in the Holy Place, not in the outer court nor in the Holy of Holies
Egypt corresponds to the outer court; the wilderness, to the Holy Place; and the good land of Canaan, to the Holy of Holies
While this book encourages us to enter into the Holy of Holies, it also tells us that we have to enter into the rest of the good land
Finally, Hebrews 4:12 indicates that we are tripartite beings, beings of three parts: the body, the soul, and the spirit
They love the Lord, seek the Lord, and enjoy the Lord as the manna from heaven, yet they are in their soul and do not have the rest
Since the divine Spirit is in the human spirit, when you touch the human spirit, you touch the divine Spirit, who is Christ Himself
On the one hand, we know we are hateful in God's eyes, but on the other hand, in our eyes we are really lovable
There are a lot of teachings and writings about the cross, but there is very little application of the cross to one's self
If we do this, the good land will be ours, and the riches, the produce of the good land, will be a bountiful surplus
The Catholic Church has brought Christianity back to Judaism by mixing a lot of Old Testament forms with the things of the New Testament
He does not pay attention so much to the outward manifestation, but He pays His full attention to the inward working
Paul had to learn to experience the Lord Himself as the inward grace, not the Lord's performing of an outward miracle
The subtle enemy, Satan, is trying his best to bring the New Testament believers back to the Old Testament time
Let us come into the rest in the Holy of Holies into the good land into the spirit and learn to know the Christ who is with us in our spirit
We have to realize that grace is not something outward in miracles, in signs, and in physical or material things
