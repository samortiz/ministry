I also found out to my comfort that the brothers and sisters in all the localities had been protected by the Lord! There are a few matters that I want to report to you; I hope you will take time to read them:</p><p>(1) Because The Christian is free, many who do not desire spiritual food and light send in a postcard asking for five or six copies per person (some ask for more than ten copies). They put them away and do not distribute them to anyone. I have seen this with my own eyes in the northern and eastern parts of Fukien. It would be better for each reader to personally subscribe. If many live in one place, the publications can still be sent to one place. They will not be wasted this way.</p><p>(2) Please send two copies of The Open Door to each of these places: (1) Ong Jeh-dun, Hung Shan Bridge, Foochow, Fukien; (2) Dr. Lee You-fu, Tung-Ren Hospital, Lien Shui, Fukien; (3) Christian Gospel House, Tung Tai, Lien Chiang, Fukien; (4) Gospel House in Hsiao-Yao-Hsia Store, Lien-Shui, Fukien; (5) Mrs. Chuang Shih-chi, Dong-Men Ji-Min Hospital, Shao-Wu, Fukien. The places mentioned above all have meetings or will soon have meetings.</p><p>(3) I have recently been led by the Lord to work in eastern and northern Fukien. The Lord has opened the door of the gospel wide for me. I preach on salvation and victory. May the Lord bless and give grace. May you be filled with the Lord's grace!</p><p>Your weak brother,<br />Ong Je-dun<br />January 28<br />[Address omitted]</p><h2 class="head3">Two</h2><p>Beloved brothers in the Lord:</p><p>Juang-Shan-Jen belongs to An-Hsi. It is located upstream from Pei-Shi at an important point. A few years ago Brother Chen Ju-yen worked here for a long time. Later, we could not take care of it because there were security problems. A few months ago Brother Ju-yen and Brother Wang You-yi passed through and worked for awhile. Brother Wang Teng-ming and I had seven days of meetings. We thank the Lord for this assembly. There are about fifty or sixty people in the meetings. There are still fields for our labor in the neighboring regions (in remote areas) which are waiting to be opened up. Please pray for them. Please send me The Open Door regularly. Peace in the Lord.</p><p>Your little brother in the Lord,<br />Chang Tung-yuan</p><h2 class="head3">Three</h2><p>To my respected and beloved sister in the Lord:</p><p>May God bless you and all the sisters more richly in all things through Christ. The sisters here (Pu-Tien) had meetings every afternoon from January 3-8. Sister Wang Yu-Ju and Sister Weigh Kwang-shing translated for me into the local dialect. Thank the Father for giving grace and blessing and for leading us through. On the seventeenth, the Lord willing, we will begin a week of meetings in Han-Jiang. It will be an edification conference for the sisters. Please pray for this, if possible. Brother Ke-san has already gone ahead to Feng-Ting to work. I have heard that some will be baptized there. Three sisters here want to quit their jobs to give themselves full-time to prayer and the ministry of the Word. May the Lord bless and use them much, and may He open a door before them. They are Sister Weigh, whom I mentioned earlier, Sister Fang Ching-ying, and Sister Chen Tien-leh. They have been saved for quite a long time. May God call out more servants who are able to match His heart's desire and answer His call (Matt. 24:45)! Praise and thank the God who is my all! He is light. He is salvation. He is strength. He is my shield. He is my hymn. He is my joy. He is my everything! Sister, may we meet together in His glory soon! 3 John 2.</p><p>Your sister,<br />Bao Hsu-min<br />January 11<br />[Address omitted]</p><br><a href="../index.html"> Home </a> | <a href="page_001.html"> First </a> | <a href="page_053.html">Prev</a> | <a href="page_055.html">Next</a> <div style='text-align:center'>Collected Works of Watchman Nee, The (Set 2) Vol. 31: The Open Door (1) &nbsp; pg 54</div><br></body></html>
