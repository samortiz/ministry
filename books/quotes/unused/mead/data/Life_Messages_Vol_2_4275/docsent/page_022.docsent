   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>A TEACHING AND PREACHING MEETING</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>"And daily in the temple, and in every house, they ceased not to teach and preach Jesus Christ" Acts 5:42 .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>The early saints were a teaching and preaching people.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>In homes and in the temple they taught and preached.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Today's situation is quite similar to what prevailed in Jerusalem in the time of the Acts.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Then there was a strong background in Judaism.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>Now here in the United States there is a strong background in Christianity, including Catholicism.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>To meet this situation there needs to be a place and time set, known to all the people in the city, where the Word of God is taught in an atmosphere of preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>In Anaheim we have already begun to do this on Lord's Day mornings at 10:45.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>There is Bible teaching, but it is not in dead letters; it is delivered as gospel preaching.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>We teach the living Word and preach the high, all-inclusive gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Many of you young saints lack the proper knowledge of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>What, for instance, is the difference between redemption, salvation, justification, and reconciliation?</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>What is the difference between being saved by the death of Jesus and being saved by the life of Christ?</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>There is more to the gospel than telling people they are lost and bound for hell, but that God loves them and Jesus died to save them; if they believe in Him, they will be saved and go to heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Consider the Gospel of John.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>This whole book is the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>It tells us of the Word being God and becoming flesh; of the vine, the husbandman, and the branches; and of the Lord's deep, rich prayer in chapter seventeen.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Even that mysterious prayer is part of the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Have you ever realized that the gospel is so comprehensive?</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>It is not only others who lack knowledge; even we ourselves are short.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>A Shining Lampstand</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>Because of insufficient knowledge, both secular society and the so-called Christian churches are in darkness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>In every place where the church is, that church must be a shining lampstand, shining forth the light of the truth of God's Word.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>The churches can be such by having a preaching, teaching meeting regularly.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>We can then advertise the meeting by word of mouth, telling our relatives, neighbors, classmates, colleagues, friends, and acquaintances.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>Such a meeting, with an hour-long, attractively given message, will bring in a good increase, not from among the drifters but from those we know.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>The word will spread that there is such a place with the shining of the truth, and seekers will be attracted.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>In this way the whole church becomes a lampstand, with all of us as lights shining together.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Laboring to Get a Message</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>If you are to have such a meeting, all of you must get into the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>This is not the work of only two or three.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Then the leading ones must be desperate to get a proper message for each Lord's Day.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>It must be convincing and logical to the listeners.</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>At first there may not be many new ones, but if you continue this way for a period of time, they will come.</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>You can not preach the same thing every time, like "Jesus can satisfy your hunger."</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>People will be turned away by such repetition.</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>Every meeting must be full of truth, logical, and convincing.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>It must be able to subdue all the differing opinions.</S>
   <S PAR='40' RSNT='1' SNO='40'>The burden for the meeting must be on the whole church, not just a few.</S>
   <S PAR='41' RSNT='1' SNO='41'>It is not easy to take the lead.</S>
   <S PAR='42' RSNT='1' SNO='42'>First Timothy 3:2 tells us that one of the qualifications of an elder is that he be skillful in teaching, "apt to teach."</S>
   <S PAR='43' RSNT='1' SNO='43'>He must enjoy teaching and teach well.</S>
   <S PAR='44' RSNT='1' SNO='44'>The elders are not the teachers in Ephesians 4:11, but they nonetheless must be skillful in teaching.</S>
   <S PAR='45' RSNT='1' SNO='45'>First Timothy 5:17 says further regarding the elders, "Let the elders that rule well be counted worthy of double honor, especially they who labor in the word and doctrine."</S>
   <S PAR='46' RSNT='1' SNO='46'>This verse says that the elders should be supported with the material supply, especially those who labor in the Word.</S>
   <S PAR='47' RSNT='1' SNO='47'>When their time is fully occupied in taking care of the church, they will have no way to make a living.</S>
   <S PAR='48' RSNT='1' SNO='48'>Thus I encourage all the elders to go to the Lord desperately each week to get a message for the teaching, preaching meeting.</S>
   <S PAR='49' RSNT='1' SNO='49'>Do not take this matter lightly.</S>
   <S PAR='50' RSNT='1' SNO='50'>When Brother Nee was a young man, he picked up a burden to preach the gospel.</S>
   <S PAR='51' RSNT='1' SNO='51'>Every Saturday he would fast for the whole day, while he prepared.</S>
   <S PAR='52' RSNT='1' SNO='52'>He would kneel, reading the Bible, praying about his burden, and preparing a convincing message.</S>
   <S PAR='53' RSNT='1' SNO='53'>Then the next morning he would deliver a logical, well-reasoned message.</S>
   <S PAR='54' RSNT='1' SNO='54'>This is an example of how the elders must labor in the Word.</S>
