   <S PAR='1' RSNT='1' SNO='1'>There are many peaks of victory, and the ground of ascension is broad; there is room for movement and growth.</S>
   <S PAR='2' RSNT='1' SNO='2'>However, Ephesians shows us that the heavenly places chapters one and two are the very places where the enemy dwells chapter six .</S>
   <S PAR='3' RSNT='1' SNO='3'>Walking on the mountaintop and looking down from there inevitably bring us into an encounter with the lions' dens and the leopards' mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='4' RSNT='1' SNO='4'>The earth is the place where the lions roam, and the world is where the leopards devour.</S>
   <S PAR='5' RSNT='1' SNO='5'>Yet the lions' dens are in the heavenly places, and the leopards' mountains are also in the heavenly places.</S>
   <S PAR='6' RSNT='1' SNO='6'>Before we know ascension in an experiential way, all that we encounter on earth is the enemy's work.</S>
   <S PAR='7' RSNT='1' SNO='7'>After we know ascension, we will dwell in the very places where the enemy dwells.</S>
   <S PAR='8' RSNT='1' SNO='8'>We must not only be aware of the enemy's work, but we must engage the enemy face to face.</S>
   <S PAR='9' RSNT='1' SNO='9'>The emphasis regarding lions in the Bible is on their roaring.</S>
   <S PAR='10' RSNT='1' SNO='10'>Hence, their work is primarily that of posing threats.</S>
   <S PAR='11' RSNT='1' SNO='11'>The emphasis regarding leopards in the Bible is on their fierceness.</S>
   <S PAR='12' RSNT='1' SNO='12'>Hence, their work is primarily that of devouring.</S>
   <S PAR='13' RSNT='1' SNO='13'>The Lord has called the maiden to the ground of ascension.</S>
   <S PAR='14' RSNT='1' SNO='14'>Yet He has never said that everything will be rosy.</S>
   <S PAR='15' RSNT='1' SNO='15'>He shows her that even in a life on the peak, lions and leopards are closer to her than ever before.</S>
   <S PAR='16' RSNT='1' SNO='16'>Those who do not understand Ephesians 1 and 2 do not understand the spiritual warfare in chapter six, but those who know ascension realize the reality and nearness of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='17' RSNT='1' SNO='17'>Nevertheless, the Lord is still beckoning us to look down from this place.</S>
   <S PAR='18' RSNT='1' SNO='18'>Our mountaintop is still the truth, our mountaintop is still the armor, and our mountaintop is still victory and destruction.</S>
   <S PAR='19' RSNT='1' SNO='19'>Heavenly things can be clearly discerned only in heavenly places, while earthly things can be discerned clearly only with a heavenly view.</S>
   <S PAR='20' RSNT='1' SNO='20'>Heaven is the only place to oversee everything.</S>
   <S PAR='21' RSNT='1' SNO='21'>We often do not look from heaven.</S>
   <S PAR='22' RSNT='1' SNO='22'>Rather, we explain many things with an earthly view.</S>
   <S PAR='23' RSNT='1' SNO='23'>The result is nothing but foolishness.</S>
   <S PAR='24' RSNT='1' SNO='24'>Even the smallest thing on earth must be seen from the heavenly position.</S>
   <S PAR='25' RSNT='1' SNO='25'>Otherwise, we will not be clear even about the smallest thing.</S>
   <S PAR='26' RSNT='1' SNO='26'>Yet looking from heaven is looking from the place of the lions' dens and the leopards' mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='27' RSNT='1' SNO='27'>In exercising our observation, we cannot forget the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='28' RSNT='1' SNO='28'>If we look from heaven, we will not fail to see the relationship between everything and the lions' dens and the leopards' mountains.</S>
   <S PAR='29' RSNT='1' SNO='29'>Those who have a mountaintop view are able to capture the enemy's view concerning everything.</S>
   <S PAR='30' RSNT='1' SNO='30'>Hence, those who observe from the "promised ground" of God's peak will also see things from the view of the enemy's interest.</S>
   <S PAR='31' RSNT='1' SNO='31'>Spiritual warfare is first a matter of position, and second a matter of view.</S>
   <S PAR='32' RSNT='1' SNO='32'>Without position, we cannot identify the enemy himself, and without the heavenly view, we cannot identify the deceptions of the enemy.</S>
   <S PAR='33' RSNT='1' SNO='33'>Without these two things, there can be no warfare, and we cannot fight.</S>
   <S PAR='34' RSNT='1' SNO='34'>This is an unprecedented call!</S>
   <S PAR='35' RSNT='1' SNO='35'>It is a great and fearful call!</S>
   <S PAR='36' RSNT='1' SNO='36'>Naturally speaking, it is extremely difficult for a weak maiden to climb up the mountain and go to the high ground.</S>
   <S PAR='37' RSNT='1' SNO='37'>How much more forboding it is to be beside the lions' dens and the leopards' mountains!</S>
   <S PAR='38' RSNT='1' SNO='38'>But the maiden has heard the call.</S>
   <S PAR='39' RSNT='1' SNO='39'>How should she answer?</S>
