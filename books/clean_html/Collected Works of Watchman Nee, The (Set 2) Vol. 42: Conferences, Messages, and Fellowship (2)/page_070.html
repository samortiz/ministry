<h1 class="msg">CHAPTER FIFTY-FOUR</h1><h1 class="title">THE LIFE-RELEASING DEATH OF CHRIST</h1><h1 class="scripture">Date: December 17, 1936, evening<br />Place: Foochow<br />Scripture Reading: Luke 12:49-50; John 12:24; 14:16-20; 2 Cor. 5:16</h1><h2 class="head1">THREE ASPECTS OF THE DEATH OF CHRIST</h2><p>There are three aspects of the death of Christ. There is the aspect of His substitution for us, the aspect of His identification with us, and the aspect of His releasing His life for us. All three aspects of His death are needed in order to make God's way of redemption complete. If we only had one of these three aspects, we might feel insecure and might think that God's salvation was not trustworthy or complete. We might feel that God's salvation is like the light in this room tonight, flickering and dimming intermittently. All three aspects of the Lord's death are important. First, there is the Lord's blood. His blood speaks of His death as a substitution for us; He shed His precious blood on our behalf. Second, the Lord's death on the cross speaks of His identifying death. We do not have any part in the shedding of His blood, but we can have a part in His cross, because when the Lord went to the cross, He brought us along with Him. We have to know what the Bible says, and we also have to know what the Bible does not say. The Bible says that we have been crucified with Christ, but it does not say that we have participated in the shedding of His blood. We cannot say that we have a part in the shedding of Christ's blood, but we can definitely say that we have been crucified with Him on the cross.</p><p>Third, the Lord's flesh refers to the aspect of His death that released His life. This aspect of the Lord's death has nothing to do with God or man. It refers to His flesh being given for the world. The Lord released His own life. The flesh signifies the Lord's life, the life released through the Lord Jesus' death. This is why it speaks of His flesh, not His corpse. The Lord Jesus was God. Yet He came to the earth, putting on a body of flesh and having the life of man. In order for Him to release His life, He first had to put off His human physical life. In Luke 12:49-50 He said, "I have come to cast fire on the earth, and how I wish that it were already kindled! But I have a baptism to be baptized with, and how I am pressed until it is accomplished!" The word "pressed" means "constricted" in the original language. "Fire" does not refer to a physical fire that is lit by a match or any other kind of fire. The expression "cast fire on the earth" proves that this fire is not from the earth, but from heaven. The book of Hebrews says that our God is a consuming fire (12:29). Here fire signifies God's life, which is the life of Christ.</p><p>The Lord wanted to see all men filled with His fire, that is, His life. But when the Lord spoke these words, they had not received His life yet. Therefore, He said, "I have come to cast fire on the earth, and how I wish that it were already kindled!" Following this He said, "I have a baptism to be baptized with." This is a strange word. Was not the Lord already baptized? He was baptized in Luke 3; it had been done already. He had been baptized at least three years earlier. Why did He say that He had a baptism to be baptized with? We have to realize that baptism in this verse refers to His death on the cross. The meaning of baptism is death and burial. It was right to say that the Lord still had "a baptism to be baptized with." This meant that the matter had not been consummated. At that time, the Lord had not passed through death, signified by baptism.</p><h2 class="head1">CHRIST'S LIFE-RELEASING DEATH</h2><p>God's life originally filled the whole universe. But after Christ was incarnated, it was limited by His flesh and was bound. God had no way to dispense His life to men. First, His life entered the flesh of the Lord Jesus. The Lord's aspiration was to put off His body through the consummation of His baptism so that He could dispense His life to men. Luke 12:49 and 50 are the two most precious verses in the New Testament. At that time the Lord's baptism had not yet been consummated, and although the twelve disciples were very close to Him, they could not obtain any life from Him. This is why we say that the third aspect of the Lord's death has nothing to do with God or man; it was His own aspiration for the release and liberation of His life. We can see this even more clearly from John 12:24, which says, "Unless the grain of wheat falls into the ground and dies, it abides alone; but if it dies, it bears much fruit." The death of the grain of wheat has nothing to do with sin. Neither does it have anything to do with identification. The death of the grain of wheat is a life-releasing death. Life is in the grain of wheat, but this life is surrounded by the shell. If you put a grain of wheat on the table, nothing will ever happen; it will forever remain as one grain. It has to be planted in the ground, allowing the shell to break, fall off, and decay through the action of water. Only then will life sprout forth, take root downward, and branch and grow upward. After two or three months, a hundred grains will be produced. Each of the grains will be impregnated with life, and the life within each grain will be derived from the one grain.</p><p>In the same way, when the only begotten Son of God died, millions of God's sons were produced. Before the Lord's incarnation, God's life was abstract and untouchable. After the Lord was born, God's life was locked in the flesh. However, the Lord went to Golgotha and was crucified on the cross. This released God's life. God's original intention was for His only begotten Son to become the firstborn Son so that He could have many sons. Through the death of the only begotten Son, His life was released, and this life produced many sons. The one grain has become a hundred grains. There are now one plus one hundred grains. Originally, the one grain was unique. Now it has become the first of many grains. Before the Lord's resurrection, God had only one Son. After the Lord's resurrection, God had many sons. Before His resurrection, Christ was God's only begotten Son. After His resurrection, Christ was God's firstborn Son. The Lord told Mary on the day of His resurrection of "My Father and your Father" (John 20:17). Originally, the Father was only the Father to Christ. We were not able to call God our Father. Hallelujah! After Christ was crucified on Golgotha and after His resurrection, He was no longer just the only begotten Son of God; He became the firstborn Son of God. Hebrews 2:11 says, "For both He who sanctifies and those who are being sanctified are all of One, for which cause He is not ashamed to call them brothers." Just as the Lord Jesus received His life from God, we have received our life from God. Our life is the same as His.</p>
